It was more like going through the motions, ticking off boxes without any real emotional investment\n\nSure, the battle mechanics are decent, and if that's your thing, then hooray. But let's not kid ourselves, everything outside of the battlefield was about as captivating as a conversation with a brick wall. No surprises, no depth, just a flat turn-based experience to pass the time\n\nBut here's the kicker, folks: This game comes at a price that won't break the bank. So, if you're in the market for an on-the-go turn-based game where you can tune out the world and not strain your brain with innovative strategies, then by all means, give it a shot", "timestamp_created": 1684779194, "timestamp_updated": 1684779194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138350422": {"recommendationid": "138350422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198977079", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1684176090}, "language": "spanish", "review": "xD", "timestamp_created": 1684176984, "timestamp_updated": 1684176984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138215137": {"recommendationid": "138215137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413956433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1683945266}, "language": "english", "review": "I only played for 30 min as a warm-up, but when I tried to restart it turned out to be impossible, even after both deleting and uninstalling everything.

It works fine, there are no issues with it.\n\nIn terms of story, gameplay and visuals its very simplistic.\nThe story is baseline and moves you along with some light dialog, gameplay has enough depth to make you think a little, but nothing too challenging and visuals are perfectly fine as well, nothing bad, but nothing stands out.\nThere is a campaign, which you can complete in around 2-3 hours and a survival mode, but that one feels too random for my taste.\nI played this while doing something else, so it served its purpose well. I got all the achievements from the second playthrough, so nothing tedious.\nEverything seems fine, it did its job to help lower my need for distractions. Theres nothing wrong with a generic game, they have their place in the market. In fact, I feel we dont really have enough decent ones.\n\nBut would I recommend it for the current asking price of 6,59 Euros? Im afraid not... 3-4 would seem reasonable for a recommendation, but at this price I would be a bit more critical. \n\nI got this in a cheap bundle with the other games of the series, so Im pretty satisfied with my purchase. Its a pretty nice side game.

The graphics are nice as well as the sound effects and music.\n\nThe map of the game as well as the battlefields will remind people of some time management series of the past. You will be able to choose from seven different units for your army as you unlock them by acquiring xp. You also acquire coins to spend on units, unit special abilities as well as four things for your hero to wear/weapon. You will also have a special ability to use during battle, as if your hero calls when to use it.  There will be 5 abilities total as you advance on the map and unlock them.\n\nThe game breaks down to being able to buy enough units and knowing which ones to use and not waste coins spending them on units you will not be using later and how you move your units on the battlefield. Battles are turn-based with very few options to use for your units. You can move, delay your move, attack or put up a defense each turn for your units. Nearly all units have a special ability that you can choose to use, however once used you will have to wait a few turns before you can use it again.\n\nGame is recommended as a first RPG game to get the feel of it, if the player is playing for the first time. If you want a challenge, avoid. Best to get on sale as well, as there isn't a lot of playtime involved, I have 23.4 hours in the game but left it running a few times while doing chores.

Whatever, lemme review this dumpster fire and move on.\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] ART. To be specific, the random sketches done by artists, probably concept art, used as cinematics mostly. In-game visuals are garbage ones you see in every other kiddy mobile game. Not sure this is much of a \u201cpros\u201d, but I had to enter something.\n\n[/list]\n\n\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] EVERYTHING ELSE: From garbage turn-based \u201cgameplay\u201d that will put you to sleep, to attempt at having a story (they don\u2019t) that goes nowhere fast (I started a new game after finishing just to be sure what it was about), this has to be a perfect example of a mobile game that should NEVER exist on PC. \n\nBut we are living in a reality where all trash from mobiles is dumped on PC and ends up getting glorious reviews from people who just discovered PC gaming.\n\nOh and do you see \u201cBOOK-1\u201d somewhere on the store page? Do a Ctrl+F and see if you can find \u201cBOOK\u201d at all.\n\nYou can\u2019t find it?\n\nWell then you\u2019ll love the fact that the game ends with information about \u201cTHIS IS BOOK 1, PLAY OTHER BOOKS\u201d (something like that).\n\nSo yeah, this garbage dump of a mobile game has \u201cbooks\u201d like it matters. I wouldn\u2019t have reviewed this game at all if not for this game having the balls to tell me to buy more \u201cbooks\u201d, like it\u2019s Lord of the Rings waiting to be explored, a journey as old as time.\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]TLDR;[/h1] \nInstead of wasting money on such games, buy indie games that deserve your money. There are a lot of developers who put actual time and effort into making something new or improving upon other games that came before them.\n\nIf you go to the developer\u2019s site for Braveland, you can see that these people churn out generic trash on mobile and quickly export it to PC as well (doesn\u2019t take much to do it, trust me).\n\nNow, instead of pressing \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d for this game, go and subscribe to my awesome curator thingy below.\n\n\n[h1]=============================[/h1]\n\n\n[h1][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37751144/]SCRAPPY JUNKYARD - Curator Group[/url][/h1]\n\n\n[h1]=============================[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1647314985, "timestamp_updated": 1647315011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410129725933074951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111226565": {"recommendationid": "111226565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117773743", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 469, "last_played": 1621791606}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is easy to play and mos of my time spent in it is just to get last achevments with difficulty because I didn't saw it at the beginning.\nBut owerall not bad game for flash game.", "timestamp_created": 1646041109, "timestamp_updated": 1646041109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110634038": {"recommendationid": "110634038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000814319", "num_games_owned": 624, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1644659384}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a mildly entertaining game going from point A to point B with some dialog and combat encounters.\nThe game is suuuper simple with very little going on in terms of strategy or thought needed to play.

It is a Turn Based Strategy, with hexagonal movements. It has three difficulty levels for more challenge and more hours of gameplay.\n\nThis game doesn't provide any dialogue options, nor can the story be affected, altered, defined, nor shaped through any player actions. What it provides is a choice of mercenaries that can be recruited for combat, and the items that the player want to equip.\n\nIt works like this: some fancy hero wants to save the day from an evil king, as it usually goes, and on his way he recruits units to help him out. Some join as a reward for freeing them, some for assisting them, while others be recruited for coin. The dumbest part here is that the hero itself doesn't participate in the fights. The protagonist is just a manager, while the antagonist does participate in the fighting. In my opinion he should have been featured as a hero fighter.\n\nThe following are available unit types: peasants, pathfinders (dual-wield rangers/rouges), archers, healers, footmen (sword and shield), arbalesters (crossbowmen) and knights (two-handed). Unit types have unit stacks, which are represented with numbers and a health bar. The higher the number the more soldiers the unit has. As the helth points drop, units get killed, and the numbers decrease. Each unit is visually represented by a single soldier. Each unit has a star value, which is there to provide some insight in the power of the unit, and to impose the limit of 15 stars a warband can have. This way the developers have established the balancing of the game, and the unit limits. The maximum number of units is 5 at any given time, but it can be smaller if the player wants to recruit more of the unit types with the higher star ranking. it supposed to be like the higher the star rating of the unit, the better and stronger the unit. But, I will explain what is the problem here in the continuation of the review.\n\nThe player navigates on the linear, semi-open world map, and picks the fights, recruits units and buys the equipment. After every battle the player receives the experience points and gold coins. Gold reward will be diminished for every unit lost during the fights. The higher the casualties the less of the reward player receives. During the fights, gold can be dropped by the enemies, and some battles have gold chests on the map. Interacting with the chest during the battle counts as an action, and the unit which has opened the chest can not attack. The equipment items are few in numbers and are expensive. They provide the bonuses for spirit, attack, physical defense and magical defense, as well as specialised damage bonuses for certain unit types. That way the player can role-play the warband. Those are a hat/helmet, cape/chest armour, belt and a weapon.\n\nBattles are turn-based. Units have limited moves on the hexagons. Their movement speed depends on the unit type per se. Pathfinders can traverse the largest distance, while footmen are some of the slowest in the game, thus traverse shorter distances. Except for the peasants, every other unit has one special attack, which, once used, will take couple of turns to recharge. Also, there are special magical powers that player can use, for the cost of the rage points. Each hit received fills the rage bar. Special powers can be used to buff the defenses of the unit, attack the enemy units, and so on. Units, besides their special attacks have their pros and cons, which the player must learn how to use to his/her advantage. For example, archers are ranged units, but if they shoot from the longer range their attacks are weaker. The ideal option is to place them two hexagons away from the target. But, in that case they become too exposed, and considering they are the archers, they are squishier than other units, so they can suffer lots of casualties by the melee opponents. If the enemy unit gets placed one hexagon in front of them, they can not do their ranged attacks, but have to either switch to weak melee attack or to step away and then shoot. Arbalesters, which are crossbowmen, can shoot from the furthest corner of the map, and harm the targets better than the archers. The further away from the target they are, the harder they hit. Those are examples of how the player must develop strategy starting from the arranging the layout, or should I say the formation of the units, before the battle starts and then, covering the ranged units with the melee units, flaking the enemy units, locking the enemy ranged units, and so on. Peasants are the only unit without special abilities, but if the player has chosen the equipment which boosts the damage of all units, they can critically hit hard certain unit types, which makes up for their lack of the special ability. Also, they are the cheapest and the most numerous unit in the game.\n\nAs for the cons, the fact that the hero is not participating in the fights, but is only visually representing the warband on the world map, does not leave a convincing impression that he is in to get the evil king. The fact that he is just a mere unit manager, and not a hero who would lead the charge in the battles, takes away from the story itself, especially at the end of the game, where he stands triumphant over the evil king, as depicted in the cutscenes. The balancing is the main issue of the game that matters. For example, healers are utterly useless. Their attack damage is the lowest of all units in the game, including the enemies, yet in order to heal, they have to use their special ability. The healing spell is so weak, that the health regained is not relevant, compared to the enemy's damage output, which can smite couple of units in one hit. Yet healers heal 18 life at most, which is not enough to heal one allied unit for the full health bar. Once a player uses the healing spell, the healer can not attack, nor make any other action. And the worst yet is that a healer can only cast healing spell twice per battle, and the cooldown takes around three turns. Having them in the warband is a waste of turns, and they can only serve as a meat canon, but not for long either, as they are the squishiest unit in the game. There is one more mage unit type in the game, elementalists, the strong mage type worth being in the warband, but that unit is not available in the story mode by the stupid choice the developers have made. They are only available in the second mode of the game called survival mode, where players compete for the highscore. Another problem are the knights, which come last to join the hero. If they join the last, they are the strongest melee unit one would think. Especially since they have the 5 star rating, the highest star rating in the game, accompanied only by the arbalesters. The problem with them is that their damage output is inferior to peasants and pathfinders, units available right at the beginning of the game. Their special ability is an area of effect ground slam, which deals unimpressive damage.\n\nAll in all, it is a fun little game, and deserves the rating of 4/5. It is not special, but it can provide hours of fun even after one beats the game on all three difficulties.", "timestamp_created": 1637883986, "timestamp_updated": 1697143874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103504289": {"recommendationid": "103504289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863991757", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1639056957}, "language": "english", "review": "OK", "timestamp_created": 1637785867, "timestamp_updated": 1700683004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103425812": {"recommendationid": "103425812", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995399180", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1578406607}, "language": "english", "review": "It was nice.", "timestamp_created": 1637779090, "timestamp_updated": 1637779090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103109807": {"recommendationid": "103109807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390980360", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1637386164}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but fun, relaxing, tactical turn based game; I enjoyed it.

There's a general lack of units, skills, items, etc. Lacks mechanics like cover and doing well in battles largely comes down to buying more men with gold. The one real choice you will make is to decide which units to bring as you're limited in which units to use. Not very difficult overall and if you have issues, when you flee from a fight or even lose it, you get bonus gold which you can use to buy more upgrades.\n\nThere is a 'Survival' mode, where you spend gold on a random choice of upgrades and units and allies that die don't respawn. You fight an escalating series of 10 battles until you (most likely) die. Tried it once after finishing the main story but don't combat isn't interesting enough to make it fun.\n\nOn the other hand, if you pick the game up on sale it's only like $2.

Lead an army across a horizontally scrolling map of the world.  Move them from location to location.  Fight battles. Defeat enemies.  Receive XP to level your general and gold to purchase items for your general.  Obtain warriors for your army.  As your army defeats enemies and liberates locations you can; recruit replacements and better units, gain rewards to increase your general's stats and special combat abilities, purchase unit powers and, obtain weapons and items to boost the general's stats.  \n\nBefore combat organise your army from the small number of unit types available and acquired.  Units include: militia, thieves, archers, crossbowmen, healers, armoured warriors and knights.  Move units into melee combat.  Have ranged units fire from distance.  Use unit and your general's abilities for tactical benefit.  Purchase replacements for fallen warriors.  Purchase and equipment items to your general's inventory.  Rinse and repeat.  Until the final battle.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415857286\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n+ Conceptually well designed and implemented.\n+ Well balanced scrolling overland map.\n+ Clean well-drawn cartoony graphics.\n+ Preview detail showing potential encounter difficulty.\n\n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n- Overall too linear.\n- Not enough dynamic elements. I.e. Battle numbers, enemy composition etc.\n- Playthroughs on separate difficulties are not unique enough.\n- Not enough unit types.  \n\n[h1]AND THE REST:[/h1]\n* Fun if cliche fantasy theme, story and setting.\n* Short and fairly simplistic battles.\n* Simple but balanced gameplay mechanics.\n* Robust but simple enemy AI.\n* Dozens of user determined encounters.  Most are linear.\n* A basic but apt soundtrack.\n* Small inventory with stat boosting items, for the army general.\n* Some dynamic changes to battle maps layouts.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2415859923\n[h1]ANALYSIS:[/h1]\nBraveland proved to be a fairly enjoyable if run-of-the-mill experience.  Aesthetically the graphics and soundtrack are exactly what to expect from a low-budget indie title but together it does the job.  The overall design and implementation is about perfect for the game in hand.  \n\nPlaying the game was positive if rather shallow.  The UGO-WEGO combat mechanism works well but fighting battles is too short.  Every encounter feels over-refined in that there are just enough enemies to cause problems but never really defeat the player.  This is compounded by an enemy AI that lacks any sophistication.  Really unless the player makes a mistake with the order some encounters are fought in, there is little to worry about.  \n\nManagement is also a very basic affair with all to limited inventory and army configuration options.  As was the journey taken across the overland map to reach the final battle to defeat the game.  Even though there were a few choices as to which encounter to undertake, only one path was really possible to minimise casualties. While playing through this game it became clear that alot of polish went into making what is a very smooth and balanced game.  The lack of content maybe a minor problem to some but I found it to be maybe just shy of what I hoped for.\n\n[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]\nOverall I consider Braveland to be repetitive and fairly shallow.  Maybe thats due to its casual and mobile port origins.  Even if thats the case, its a decent fantasy themed turn-based tactical 'war' game with limited management elements.  Its complete and polished production could take it from a Maybe to a Recommendation if you can overlook the numerous limitations.  There are larger, more detailed games of this genre out there but if you fancy something a little lighter then this is a good place to start.  Its fairly cheap and there are already three sequels released from this IP.  So if you find yourself enjoying this game you could look into getting those as well, even at the same time.  Some of them are cheap and/or bundled up.\n\n[quote=]Thank you for reading. | Find my reviews [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/]here[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1596311264, "timestamp_updated": 1620989489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712933957576751709", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73430322": {"recommendationid": "73430322", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075837521", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1595973065}, "language": "english", "review": "a nice distraction and for the money well worth getting even if you only play for ma few hours which i doubt you would after the storyline grabs hold of you...well worth the money....buy it, you know it makes sense!!!", "timestamp_created": 1595964455, "timestamp_updated": 1595964455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72811359": {"recommendationid": "72811359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977450814", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 416, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1594939218}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Your army will be too strong\"\n\nIt is funny that for a commander that needs an army to fight his enemies you are not allowed to bring too many units to battle.

The game is straight forward, easy, turn-based strategy game. But it is very dull. The characters and campaign-story lack any depth. Combat is repetitive. And I always think about Battle for Wesnoth, a no-cost alternative, and I wonder what the steam game has to offer above that one.\n\nWhat makes me ultimately makes this a recommendation is how it makes the mechanics of Might and Magic accessible, and there is an opportunity to replay random battles with the survivor-mode. It is kind of a fun game to play while listening to something else, too. This would have made a killer game to play with friends, and it is a shame they left it singleplayer only. Anyway, this is an old game that most people have already, although only 24% of steam owners have bothered playing to get the first achievement for recruiting the peasants. This review is not going to change anyone's mind about buying it, to be sure. I played this on an ubuntu desktop, where there seemed to be no option for full-screen mode. The game uses the Unity game engine, and it takes up 325MBs of diskspace.", "timestamp_created": 1589488436, "timestamp_updated": 1589488436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682150840759277344", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69010360": {"recommendationid": "69010360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448636283", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 332, "last_played": 1589282390}, "language": "english", "review": "mehhh...", "timestamp_created": 1589290226, "timestamp_updated": 1589290226, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68950673": {"recommendationid": "68950673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205018304", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1659395199}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me gusto, es un juego para pensar y pasar en poco tiempo, en general bien.", "timestamp_created": 1589195616, "timestamp_updated": 1589195616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68597956": {"recommendationid": "68597956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211681908", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1588662420}, "language": "english", "review": "chill quarantine game... completed hard mode", "timestamp_created": 1588662456, "timestamp_updated": 1588662456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68509752": {"recommendationid": "68509752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056291302", "num_games_owned": 1285, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1588635269}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting turn-based game with many battles.", "timestamp_created": 1588531606, "timestamp_updated": 1588531606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68453419": {"recommendationid": "68453419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075403106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1588456186}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is not interesting at all.

The only thing this has going for it is it's cute artstyle. The game is very short and the gameplay consists of buying new and more units/gear followed by repetitive battles with no risk involved. Losing is meaningless as your troops are revived completely after every battle. The AI battles in the same style for every single battle, forcing you to play in the same way every time aswell. The combat is just plain uninteresting, with the no-risk element making it feel extremely tedious. I ended up turning down the difficulty to easy near the end so I could finish it quicker. The few moments I was engaged in the game was when a new troop was introduced (ally/enemy). I read through all the dialogue at the beginning, not really expecting it to be good whatsoever, which it certainly was not. The story is simply non-existent and is only there so that the combat makes sense. I understand this is a mobile game, but if it is on Steam, I think it should be judged as a PC game. The game is not terrible and is a decent time-waster if that is what you are looking for. The animations are well done and there is some variety to how you can play.

I put quotes around \"strategy\" because there isn't much depth to it.I have finished the game twice in 12 hours with one restart because I messed up a simple choice in trying to get my last achievement for playing through on Hard. There are 3 save game spots, but only one per game. So, if you make a mistake with a choice, always around buying something, there is no going back. But since the play through is pretty quick, not much time is lost.\n\nWarning: If you are playing through on Hard to get that achievement, you have to be very careful if you lose a battle. The game immediately asks if you want to lower the difficulty setting and it is easy to select the check mark (for yes) by mistake. That automatically lowers the difficulty to Normal and you can't get the Hard achievement in that play through.\n\nThere really isn't a story here, no real plot, and I have no idea about music since I usually play with my sound very low. The game map is very small with point and click to the next spot sort of thing. The enemy numbers, types, locations, etc., don't change. There are very few items to equip and about 7 units to choose from that become available at the same spots, limited only to your limited money at any given time. You essentially buy units, a few items to boost your 4 stats, and a few special attacks.\n\nThe game has no real replay value once you beat it and have all the achievements, if that is your thing. There is a Survival mini-game that unlocks, but it is just a beat 10 battle grids sort of thing without being defeated and you have at least one unit that isn't available in the regular game. However, in the Survival game, if you lose units, they are gone.\n\nThere is no grinding with the exception of if you lose a battle. Then you essentially restart in the spot just before the battle without really losing anything. You even make a little money. At the end of each battle, you get a monetary reward, minus the cost of replacing your units. So even if an entire unit is killed, you don't lose them or have to go back and buy them over again.\n\nYour Hero doesn't appear on the battlefield, doesn't participate, and there isn't any character customization. The units are tiered in value and the most you can ever have is 15 total score in units. The units are valued from 1-5. Once you get the hang of combat, know the enemy strengths and weaknesses, and those of the units, the game isn't really that hard, even on Hard.\n\nIf you are new to \"strategy\" type games, I suggest playing through on Easy or Normal to get your feet wet. I played through on Normal the first time and got all but 4 achievements. It would be possible to play through once, on Hard, and get all the achievements, but most people would probably miss at least one, unless you read something about the achievements first.\n\nThis isn't a game that you are going to spend dozens of hours with, but it can be a refreshing break from those games that require a lot of strategy, planning, mental attention, and take days and weeks to finish.\n\nI experienced no crashes and no identifiable bugs.\n\nI wouldn't recommend paying full price for the series. But if you get it significantly discounted, the amount of play time and interest level is worth a few dollars. I have paid a lot more for movies that were shorter and a lot less entertaining.\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1580643730, "timestamp_updated": 1580643834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62678295": {"recommendationid": "62678295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132674697", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1676609242}, "language": "english", "review": "very short", "timestamp_created": 1580391163, "timestamp_updated": 1580391163, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62368826": {"recommendationid": "62368826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351747300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1579506529}, "language": "english", "review": "fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1579940858, "timestamp_updated": 1579940858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62136504": {"recommendationid": "62136504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140251355", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 303, "last_played": 1579528382}, "language": "english", "review": "Not Recommended.\n\nSimple Strategy-esque turn-based.

Battles are small but resolved quickly and are not overly challenging or frustrating. There is some tactical thinking involved although the lack of units limits the range of tactics you can use.  You are only allowed a handful of units so it's difficult to set-up a good defensive formation and the most important tactical decision you have to make is what targets to prioritize.  Battles give experience win or lose which I was very glad to see and failure is not punished. Lose a fight? Your units come back fully healed, you get XP for any enemy units you managed to eliminate, and your troops take up a small collection for you giving you some gold after a defeat(although to be fair, not much, in fact a pittance compared to what you get for winning (as it should be.)) so that you can still progress and build yourself up after the loss, avoiding the danger of getting stalled and being trapped in a downward spiral where your only alternative is to start over from the beginning. Some battles are more challenging than others but there's usually some alternative battles you may have better luck at allowing you to build up your army before attempting the challenging battle again. I also liked that a \"Retreat\" button was provided so that if it becomes obvious you're not quite ready for that battle yet, you can end the misery and get out of it to come up with a new approach.\nThere are some RPG elements as you are cast as a commander of the army, an abstract character who is NOT represented on the battlefield, but who DOES level-up and grow stats and who can acquire gear that will improve those same stats, and those stats improve the abilities of your army.  Leveling up also improves a \"Leadership\" stat which increases the number of \"soldiers\" your units can contain which essentially equates to the \"Hit Points\" of your units, thus improving their survivability.\nThere are some drawbacks to the game, the low number of units was disappointing and, as I stated, limits tactical flexibility.  Also the lack of \"Zones of Control\" was frustrating as i would try to use my melee units to protect my ranged units only to have the enemy unit race past my melee unit to attack the ranged one. Yet another example of how the low number of units hurt the game. There is \"terrain\" on the battlefield that creates \"choke points\" but the low movement of friendly units vs faster movement of enemy units usually meant they would be through the choke point before you could completely block it.\nThere's also no \"cover\" mechanic, terrain blocks movement but has no effect on ranged fire so there's no tactical advantage to using the terrain except for attempting to block enemy movement, a task as I mentioned above, is difficult in itself due to lack of units and zones of control around them.\nYet despite these weaknesses I found the game enjoyable. With so many \"rogue-like\" games on the market with their OP units/bosses, it was nice to play a game you have a reasonable chance of beating, and still many of the battles were challenging without being frustrating.  There were still some battles lost, especially in the learning phase, but the reasonable handling of defeat kept it from being discouraging and maintained the \"fun factor\" keeping me engrossed in the game.  So don't buy this if you're looking for large, deep tactical battles with dozens of units and infinite options for deploying them, but if you want an entertaining diversion that will keep you engrossed for a few hours and is fun and challenging you could do worse than to pick up a copy of Braveland.", "timestamp_created": 1574495088, "timestamp_updated": 1574495088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57329948": {"recommendationid": "57329948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198796428620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 167, "last_played": 1573955537}, "language": "english", "review": "Braveland is a turn-based game in a fantasy based setting. The story follows a man whose village was raided by bandits, and he seeks revenge. You start out with a few basic units and go on a journey with them. Each victory in battle gives you gold which can be used for various purchases. The map is pretty basic. It's got points that you click on to move to, and some paths branch to areas containing useful items that can improve your army. You can increase the amount of units you have by buying them at designated points. These points are hidden until you pass certain areas, and, generally, these are blocked off by an enemy group.\nThere's a gamemode outside of the story if the story isn't your type. You are given a starting amount of gold and purchase some units. After each match you are given some gold and can purchase units or other improvements seen in the story.\n\nBravelands was rather underwhelming. The story is poorly written: not only is it generic (with the main character being the typical \"I want revenge\" protagonist) everything seems repetitive or makes little sense. Every single enemy detour had the lines of \"This business/group bad, we block people from going\". There was no variation between, and I would have preferred it more if the game had simply forwent it. The main character isn't even playable; he just does... nothing? I wasn't too sure what he was there for since he wasn't in-game as a unit, nor did he seem to do anything except respond to enemy dialogue on the overworld map. This usually followed the lines of the enemy saying \"I'm bad ohohoho\" and then the protagonist responds \"Evil must die\" or some other stereotypical hero phrase.\nThe story seems as though it would simply end when the protagonist finds the bandits who raided his village. After all, he's a simple villager. Yet somehow he decides to take on an entire kingdom. Oh and for some reason the \"villager\" unit follows. Though that's not too bad, since removing an entire unit would be a poor decision, but there's no interaction or reasoning as to why the villagers, who had the reasoning for joining as \"those bandits raided us\", continue on the \"hero's quest\".\nThe gameplay was okay as well. The turn-based hexagonal-map was interesting at first, but there's hardly any strategy. It's a simple either you're stronger, or the enemy is. There's not much else to say about it. There weren't any notable gimmicks, except maybe a reviving enemy, which didn't revive half the time. There's a healer unit but that's one unit and has a limited amount of heals to use which hardly do much health in the first place.\nMoving through the overworld map is tedious as well. The character has to walk to each section, and it follows the drawn path on said map. Which should be simple and somewhat expected, but the map is extremely long horizontally, and when there are some areas that still have units you can purchase, but those units are locked behind... story sections(?) it gets annoying to check every now and then. It takes over a minute to do so, and the characters don't even speed up to move there. It's a set traversing speed, and the least that could be done with this is either increasing the speed, allowing the player to skip this animation, or just pulling up the menu for purchasing from the set area.\nThe game is unclear on how to play as well. There's the starting tutorial, and the occasional pop-up saying \"This is how you use item X\" but that's it. The game doesn't explain what each stat does. For example, there's a Fury and a Initiative stat, which wasn't explicitly stated what they did. Survival mode doesn't explain that units have perma-death compared to the story mode.\nThe sound was average. The sound effects and grunting didn't sound like they were being recorded from a phone call made in a basement, but they were rather repetitive. They didn't have variation and got annoying quickly.\nThe animation for the game was fine too. Animations were simplistic, which is fine. Nothing too artsy about this game in the first place, nor would I expect such from a $5 game. \n\nOverall, Braveland is rather lackluster. Nothing sticks out, nothing seems interesting, and I ended up playing it just for the steam cards.

Each turn the player must choose where they need to move their characters based on enemy locations and which are a more important target to take care of first. Now that is out of the way the big question is whether or not this game is a good game, simple is nice but doesnt always mean it is good. I will be reviewing the game in a pro/con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n      Each character is unique. Not only each character has different stats but some have pretty useful special abilities that when used properly can be a game changer. The game gets easier based on having more of the same characters since it adds an attack multiplier to the damage output but allows the characters to take more damage till all the backup of a specific character class is used up.\n\n       The story is ok. It is about a town that gets ransacked by bandits and it is the job of a village to take up arms, build an army, and confront the leader of the bandits. Through the game you will run into some interesting dialogue by both bad guys and your teammates. Maybe some references to pop culture game stuff here and there.\nCon:\n      There is no grinding. So when you complete a location hub it is completed forever. That means you can not revisit it in hopes of killing more enemies to get more exp or money. It is a big deal when you think about it since money is used for getting more characters like more archers, thieves, ect or get gear. Money is a limited resource to get in the game and sucks that you will never have enough to get everything. It is not important to get everything but you can seriously make part of the game a bit more challenging than it should because you used your money to buy gear when you should have got more characters or unlock a skill for a character.\n\n       Less amount of a character you have the weaker they are. For starter lets look at the healer. If you have just 2 which is the starting amount you do an awful amount of healing and damage output. It does not help that if cost 130 per healer making that entire class for the most part useless. Now if you look at any other class. When in combat and your amount of backup for a character drops to the last one. You might as well pull them away from combat since they will barely do any damage. It is annoying feature which it rewards having alot at the start but punishes the player when loosing more of that character by lowering the amount of damage output and maybe resistance. \n\nConclusion:\n      The game is functional, it is simple and could certainly use more polish but this is an early game for the dev team so expect this type of clunky quality for new games. It is not a bad game by no stretch of the imagination because it has a pretty good story and dialogue between characters. Though short it did lead to some funny moments. It does have problems with the combat with the stacking of characters improving stats but loosing the stack leads to poor stats within a fight. I would recommend the game because it was alright, probably pick it up on a sale and give it a try.

It's quite unrekarmable in that regard.\n\nThe core game combat meanwhile is alright, it's simple but there's quite some tactics and decisionmaking involved, at least on higher difficulties, and everything is pretty streamlined, although it can get rather dull where you have beaten most heavy duty enemies in melee and only defenseless spellcasters or rangers remain and you gotta beat them down, would be neat if sufficiently beaten the enemies would retreat.\n\nThere is some semblance of story here, but it's just generic half-witty banter and cliches. You're some peasant guy whose village gets robbed so he decides to avenge the robbers, going all the way up in villains chain of command killing them until the biggest baddest guy is defeated.\n\nOverall, worst thing about this game is length, took me 3 hours to beat it.

There is an excellent tutorial mode that leads the player through each element of game-play as it arises. The player's allies are always revived after every battle and even the defeated villains sometimes appear to survive.\n\nHard Difficulty, however, forces the player to make hard choices when deciding which allies to recruit. This is due to much smaller rewards for victory in battle and encourages some cynical gamesmanship. After a defeat the player is rewarded by not being compelled to pay to revive his fallen friends and receives a bonus for losing the battle! The longer the battle continues and thus the higher the casualties, the bigger the bonus. In Normal Difficulty, where resources are plentiful this is not an issue, but in Hard Difficulty where resources are scarce, it can be an expedient means to fully flesh out your army.\n\nSurvival Mode: \n\nIn Survival Mode the player must successfully complete a series of ten battles in sequence. The player begins with a sum of gold to purchase an army from a random selection of up to three types of allies. Unlike Story Mode, lost allies are not automatically revived at the conclusion of battle.  Instead the player earns additional funds with each victory to purchase from three randomly selected allies, items and/or spells before each subsequent battle. What allies or items become available is not under the player's control. This can lead to losses being impossible to replace.\n\nThere is no tutorial in Survival Mode and there is no manual to refer to if the player forgets some aspect of game mechanics or potential abilities.\n\nMinor Quibbles:\n\nThe target space and the currently active unit in battle are both surrounded by a hexagon of different shades of yellow. There is no undo feature if a unit is moved in error before an attack takes place.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI would recommend this game for players interested in the short, charming, light fun of Normal Difficulty Story Mode.", "timestamp_created": 1559352592, "timestamp_updated": 1559402844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50951391": {"recommendationid": "50951391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026999552", "num_games_owned": 540, "num_reviews": 135, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1603177339}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a casual, flash game-tier sort of videogame.

What you do get left with is rather shallow for a strategy game, and I guess for the asking price it's not too bad, but I really dislike having to leave out some units for others, especially since some of them are, in my opinion, not worth the squad points the game asks you go pay to field them in battle. I realize it's a difficult balancing decision to do in strategy games to not make things too easy, but it's a direction that I personally dislike. \n\nI also really dislike not being able to determine your units' positions at the start of each battle.

The game features the old-school, hexagon grid system and with plenty of battles and a survival mode as a bonus. For the price its put I think its a fair deal, but anyone sane would get it on sale, like with other games on steam.\n\nStarting with the Gameplay, the battle system and the stat system is really simple compared to other Turn-based Strategy games like Pit People from the Behemoth or the free-to-play Battle for Wesnoth. Featuring two squads fighting each other until one side eliminates all the troops on one side. Speaking of the troops they are handle by a number, showing how many troops are in that unit. For Example, a Archer unit might have 6 troops attached to it. if the number reaches zero, the unit dies. This health system can be somewhat annoying since the less troops you have the less damage the unit does which is a big problem for the tougher battles. On top of the reasonably short story mode, there is a endless survival mode if you want more of this simple battle system.\n\nNow, visually the cartoonish style is very nice, It kinda reminds me of Dan Palaian from Behemoth's Art Style of cartoony characters. The music isn't anything too special, kinda generic medieval themes. Most of the game comes in the gameplay which is simple.\n\nOverall, Braveland isn't the best Turn-Based Strategy, but for around 4.99 USD I'd say thats a OK price. Luckily they gave away free copies so the price isn't a big factor on my part. Another thing about this game is that it has two sequels Braveland Wizard and Braveland Pirate, which seem to be much bigger than the original. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550669673, "timestamp_updated": 1550669673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49116120": {"recommendationid": "49116120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221587880", "num_games_owned": 1538, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 1287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1676289917}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun to play with an interesting story line.\n\nEasy to play.\n\nI will give it an 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1550653341, "timestamp_updated": 1550653341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528432726860046387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49022326": {"recommendationid": "49022326", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970938346", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 546, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1550297821}, "language": "english", "review": "This is worth about $1\n\nStandard overworld with fights which take place on a hex grid.  Your game pieces are various classes (archer, peasant, etc) that are in groups vs enemy groups.\n\nIt works without apparent bugs but so much basic mechanics information is missing and that is really irritating.\n\nMissing is how damage is calculated so you don't really know if an attack will just wound or actually kill an enemy group.  Does having more in a group do more damage - they don't tell you?  Nowhere does it show how much your attack power is, or what the defensive rating of the foes are, so you're just playing a guessing game. How many are in each group of foes disappears when it's not your turn, etc. I'm really frustrated with the lack of information.\n\nThen there is a lot of polish missing too.  In the tutorial where they teach how FURY works (the spell-casting) I killed the foes and ended the tutorial before I could even generate enough Fury from received enemy attacks. Its not rocket science how it works, but this is the kind of B grade polish you can expect. If you let the AI path-find on it's way to attack a foe, it doesn't show you where it plans to move... so it could end up on the wrong side and leave you without a blocking piece.  When you end a battle, to restock your army you have to walk all the way across the overworld to the barracks, etc... why is this way when restocking and buying equipment on the overworld is required after each battle? HP bars are nowhere to be seen, so when it's your Healers' turn, you have no idea which group will most benefit... these deficiencies are EVERYWHERE\n\nI can't play a game like this.

illusion of gameplay.\nKing's Bounty which was released in 1990 had more strategy and challenge in its combat sections than this.\n\nOh, probably because Braveland is actually a mobile game port of a boring game where gameplay is an illusion and all you actually do is just tap, tap, tap your finger. Heck, you don't even click \"new game\" and you get instantly shoved \"BUY OUR OTHER GAMES ALSO LIKE US ON FACEBOOK\" down your throat.\n\nBraveland has nothing to do with turn based strategy like  Heroes of Might and Magic.\nIt may look similiar on screenshot but its actually just bad and dull puzzle game for brainless people.\n\nThe only redeeming part about this so-called \"game\" is that its not filled with microtransactions like other mobile games.\nBut don't worry.

You and your fellow peasants, archers and whatnot join you on a quest to bring down an evil king. While the game is short and can be completed in under 4 hours even on the hardest difficulty, it is very well paced. You continuously unlock new units, new spells and new abilities as well as new enemy types. \n\nBattling isn't the most complicated thing in the world either; units (you can have up to 5) move on a hex grid in a turn-based fashion. You have some spells, and every unit (save for one) has their own ability that has a small cooldown. It's all very easy to understand. If you want any challenge, play on the hardest difficulty; the game still won't be extremely difficult, but it will at least provide the occasional challenge. You earn gold which you can spend to increase the squad size of your units or on equipment.\n\nIf you are looking for a very light, bite-sized tactical RPG, I'd say this fits the bill. The only negative I have seen is that gold can be a bit sparse sometimes, so you have to spend it wisely; if you're out and still can't win a battle, the only way to get more gold is to repeatedly fail a fight (you will get some \"failure gold\") until you have enough to buy new stuff. Certainly not the best system, though I personally didn't have to use it. Otherwise, it's a very well-paced short tactical squad RPG with two surprisingly good music tracks.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1548244420, "timestamp_updated": 1548244507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53896099328994751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48500453": {"recommendationid": "48500453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353228474", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1548217669}, "language": "english", "review": "Looks like a smartphone game, but it's still fun.

You can unlock a special cooldown-based ability for each unit, some of which are slightly interesting and some of which are not.  Each turn comes down to using an ability if it's off cooldown, moving a few hexes, and attacking whichever enemy will counterattack you for less damage.  It's uninteresting, and every fight works out about the same way once you pick up the basic strategies.\n\n[strike]Now maybe the gameplay would be tolerable if it was quick, but it's really, really not.  The interface is certainly easy to understand, but it's [i]slow[/i].  Animations can't be disabled or skipped, and you can't select another unit if one is moving or attacking.[/strike]  There are some hotkeys (which are not explained in game) that will save a few clicks, but they don't do enough to really make a difference.\n\nEDIT: my bad Ragnar, I somehow missed the fast animation key in my 7 hours of play.

I completed the campaign (on normal difficulty) within 3 hours.\n\nBattles take place on a hexagon grid. You can only move, attack (melee or ranged based on the unit), defend, or wait. Most units have one 'special' attack that has a cooldown. Your units start on the left side of the screen (and the enemy on the right) and you just move towards them (or let them move to you) and attack. Later on you get access to the Fury meter which builds as you take damage. You spend the meter to cast spells (like deal damage or buff defense).\n\nThe campaign is a pretty simple story: chase after bandits who raided your village. The map is just traveling between circles (which represent an dialogue/store/battle). As you travel, you gain new units to use, find/buy upgrades and defeat harder and harder enemies until you reach the boss.\n\nIn normal difficulty, it had a pretty simple difficulty curve if you do every level to get every upgrade. I was able to beat almost all levels on the first try. There was one side path (of two battles) that was more difficult than the rest but it just meant revisiting the levels after progressing much further.\n\nYour stats (that are determined by upgrades and equipment) are something like HoMM: you have generic buffs to units (Damage/Phys Resist/Mag Resist/Fury). I'm not really sure how much each buff helps or what is better to get because the game is pretty light on details of its mechanics.\n\nSurvival mode is a 10-round battle system where you start with 1500 gold and have selection of 3 types of units to hire. Any unit you lose is gone forever (so doing poorly will snowball). In between every round you get a random selection of 3 things (units/special attacks/Fury spells) to buy with the gold you've earned/saved up. While skill is a factor, it feels pretty dependent on luck because you may not get the chance to buy what you need to win. I tried a couple of times and on my best run I lost in round 8 with over 2000 gold in the bank because only the cheap units were available to buy (and I couldn't spend the rest of my gold).\n\nWorth a look if you want a casual tactics RPG.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[*] Apparently, the story is 'book one' of a series.\n[*] There are no keyboard shortcuts (as far as I know).\n[*] There are often some obstacles that create chokepoints which may be good to stop all melee enemies from getting an attack in.\n[*] Units only one counterattack per turn. You may want tankier or more disposable units to take the hit. On defense, chokepoints serve as a way to ensure \n[*] Physical (non-magical) ranged units are stuck with weaker melee attacks if they have to attack someone next to them (so you can take less damage if you corner their archers). Enemies will sometimes rush your back line so make sure your own archers have a buffer.\n[*] Survival mode lets you use the Elementalist unit which is an enemy-only mage unit in the campaign.", "timestamp_created": 1536431966, "timestamp_updated": 1537716080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44636166": {"recommendationid": "44636166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145689780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 377, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1598774151}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little game takes about 6 hours to complete on hard mode. \nChoose your upgrades wisely to get the best gear in the end.\nThe music is fitting for the setting but not the most ineresting.\nI would give this 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1536426031, "timestamp_updated": 1536426031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44630149": {"recommendationid": "44630149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168868214", "num_games_owned": 1892, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 254, "last_played": 1536404046}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]!

Pero le di una oportunidad y la verdad me sorprendi\u00f3 bastante, ya que a pesar de ser un juego corto (ya que no dura m\u00e1s de 3 o 4 horas y si quieres los logros 6 a 7 horas) me entretuve bastante durante este tiempo.\nEs un juego que a mi parecer es f\u00e1cil inclusive en su mayor dificultad, pero hay ciertas batallas que tuve que ir a otros puntos del mapa que estaban m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles a conseguir dinero para poder seguir progresando ya que no pod\u00eda hacer frente a ellas.\nSobre el mapa, al principio te da la impresi\u00f3n que es muy peque\u00f1o pero a medida que vas jugando se va expandiendo y con ello la cantidad de tropas disponibles, los \"hechizos\" si se les podr\u00eda llamar as\u00ed, las armaduras, las armas, los enemigos nuevos y varias zonas m\u00e1s que no se ven en el inicio.\nSu historia no es que sea la mejor del mundo pero eso no es lo importante, lo que realmente importa es su jugabilidad, la verdad es algo b\u00e1sica pero es disfrutable y bastante f\u00e1cil de entender.\nEso si hay ciertas cosas que el juego no te explica y debes darte cuenta tu solo/a quiz\u00e1s es algo negativo ya que al principio no me di cuenta que las tropas no se perd\u00edan y estaba s\u00faper preocupado ya que en mi mente dec\u00eda si perd\u00eda una tropa buena, el juego se me har\u00eda cuesta arriba, pero bueno... son cosas peque\u00f1as que no afectan en casi nada.\nAlgo que quiz\u00e1s me pueda quejar es que no hay muchas clases de tropas, de hecho solo hay tres a mi parecer, los guerreros, los arqueros y la sanadora. (Solo hay un tipo de sanador :l)\nEl estilo art\u00edstico me recuerda a castle crashers por lo \"simple\" y liso que es, es bastante agradable a la vista y da la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando en un dibujo (bien hecho por cierto).\n\nEn resumen, el juego me gusto, eso s\u00ed con algunos peros. Sin embargo sigo insistiendo que es muy corto y no da tiempo a pensar estrategias.

You buy units (to upgrade) as you gain gold from battles, but, again, there are no choices. There aren't different builds for you to try. The planning exists to the extent that each unit type costs different amounts of gold, and so you can prioritize some over others. But, again, it makes very little difference.\n\n\n\nThe game works, but I can't imagine anyone getting a valuable experience out of this.

The game is controller compatible, so perhaps people will have better luck using it.\n\nStill a fun game in spite of these minor issues.  I would probably pick up the remaining two games if there wasn't some weird sale where the entire trilogy costs less than the remaining two games.

Haven't played it after that so not sure if it's common behavior or if it affects survival mode ending screen (no, I don't want to test it more because that means I'll have to play this boring game for another 10-20 more minutes. no). Campaign worked good, no issues here.\n\nAbout game itself. It's simple mobile game with cute graphics (tho it's not completely unique for units, you'll see alot of mirrored and recolored units) and very basic gameplay. Music is OK but lacks variety. Story is laughable or better to say no story just lame attempts to joke or whatever it was. No choices or if you have any choice it does not matter in game. Units have similar stats and their spells/powers are weak (I won't spoil but there's at least 2 types of units that is completely useless by their attack rate and powers, others suck but suck adequately). Repetitive time waster with cute graphics. Couple of strange achievements like \"visit facebook ot twitter\" and \"complete game on hard\". why I consider it strange? this game is so boring that I see no way how you would embrace this boredom for 2 times in a row just to get 1 achievement. Visiting social media sites to get an achievement is not valid request unless someone is giving away bunch of shovelware for that. But that's OK, FB link in game failed to work so I've got that achievement for nothing.\n\nTo summarize my experience I'd say this game is not something I'll keep in my library or would replay, it is 3 hours one sitting boring experience. It's boring not because it is simple, it is boring because it lacks balance, story, variety of units and armor/weapon, it lacks in every area possble. \nI wish we could have neutral review", "timestamp_created": 1536039774, "timestamp_updated": 1536039774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528289079666137695", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44560115": {"recommendationid": "44560115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126312752", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1536019135}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es como un juego para android. \nLa historia pff ni la lei es completamente innecesaria.

I played the 2nd game 1st. So far the biggest difference I see is that you could use your \"hero\" in the beginning of the 2nd game, and so far, I haven't been able to use him in the 1st. Not sure if it will unlock at some point or not. Still is fun, and with a great tutorial. Very thorough; teaches you every time something new shows up. It's a relatively easy turn-based game, where the more units per squad you have, the more damage you do and less you take. For example if you have 10 archers in a squad, they will do far more damage than if you had 3. When the squad takes damage, it doesn't just immediately die. The amount of units in the squad decreases, so 10, 9, 8 etc in this example. Healers can increase the squad count back up.

Yes, it is a watered-down version of 'Heroes of Might and Magic,\". . . but I really like Heroes of Might and Magic.  Certainly the mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played HoMM or Kings Bounty: you fight turn-based battles while continuously leveling up your General and moving your troops around.  It is faithful to HoMM-1 in that you have 4 stats on your General and those 4 stats also beef up your troops.  It is more like the original Kings Bounty (the one from around 1990, not the current series) in that you just move around one single General, stopping at taverns to replenish your troops.  You don't have to worry about conquering gold mines or garrisoning castles.  Think of this as a single scenario map, and decide for yourself it you want to try it.

Your land is in turmoil. Bandits rampaged your town and currently going on a raiding frenzy. You, a rag tag farmer decided to rise up to do away those bandits. So, your quest begins by searching the lands (in linear fashion), recruit your army and fight your adversaries in hexagonal combat battlefields all displayed in hand drawn yet beautiful art. So, what are you waiting for? Oh, this sounds familiar, way too familiar to your liking? You guessed right. Braveland, even though it looks gorgeous, doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the turned based hexagonal combat system. Heck, even the plot is ho-hum to the max as the entire game is simply fighting one mob to the next until the game ends.\n\nIt may sound I\u2019m a little too harsh with this and yes, I am. There\u2019s nothing really going for in this game other than the artwork. The game is a mobile phone port and that, in itself, is not too bad considering I have played ported mobile games that actually fared well (e.g. Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD). What made it sub-standard is there\u2019s very little that caught my attention wanting to see what\u2019s next in store. It\u2019s all a matter of fighting one battle to the next until the game ends. At least add an interesting plotline however that was not the case too. So, all you have left is the visuals and sounds. The visuals I have to admit are pretty to look at \u2013 all sugary with a cherry on top that doesn\u2019t overstay its usefulness and the musical scores are brilliantly composed and well suited for this style of game.\n\nHow the game plays out, you have a world map to explore aiming to recruit your armies to finish off those malicious bandits that destroyed your town. You cannot get lost in the world as the available path is drawn out for you so it\u2019s a matter of following the leader (so to speak). During your adventures, you\u2019ll get the opportunity to hire men-at-arms and even \u2018stray\u2019 off the beaten track to gain further enhancements for your army. But of course, everything will result in combat, not matter what. The only exception is when you locate a store to buy equipment and / or more cannon fodder. But to get to those places is guarded by mobs so you can say every damn movement equals to combat.\n\nHow the combat plays out is displayed in a battlefield of sorts. Drawn in hexagonal shapes so your movement is governed by six directions. Your army stands on the left and right, the enemies. Both armies can be a mixture of critters, archers, warriors, golems and so on. However, the important factor is the number of solders stacked in that group. Basically, the higher the number, the deadlier they become. In a nutshell, it plays upon strength in numbers.\nAlso, each combatant is governed by statistics to measure their qualities so this is where the minimal RPG elements comes in. The statistics ranges from armour to damage output to speed and so on. Granted the game does extremely well with its tooltips as you can view their stats anytime without too many clicks - simple yet effective. Also, each troop have a special ability to spice things up yet they require a cool down once activated. I actually smiled at one of the enemy\u2019s special ability where the archer\u2019s special ability is they occasionally miss. I wish there\u2019s more silliness like this however it wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nAnother skill that\u2019s capable to turn the tides of battle is the rage meter. What this does that every time your character gets hit, builds up rage. And once you accumulate a certain number of rage points can launch a rage spell like fire arrow or boost armour (to name a few). Take note that rage skills can only be found and not earned however they are worthwhile investments as it does not take up a movement point and heck, it\u2019s a bonus as it\u2019s governed by the number of hits your group takes.\n\nAs far as tactics is concerned, the battlefield does have some \u2018roadblocks\u2019 that can assist you \u2018bottlenecking\u2019 the enemy (and vice versa). However, that tactic for me had marginal success as there\u2019s normally a mob group that moves around this roadblock and attack your weak armoured soldiers, namely the archers / healers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that and I applaud this tactic. However, because I played the game on hard difficulty, I cannot say whether these happens at the lower difficulty levels.\n\nSo, what I normally do before combat starts is to see if I can create a roadblock. After that, I analyse which enemy\u2019s secondary skill will cause me grief and then once spotted, gang bang this group with all my troops. Next to see which group has a high soldier count as the game does plays upon strength in numbers. Dwindle their numbers down by using your archers / healers. Then mop up the rest. This thought pattern has won me a lot of battles and granted, there are some battles that comes down to just two, my warriors vs enemy archers, for instance. That was pretty cool as it went down to the wire.\n\nThere were times that the landscape displayed groups of tough enemies as my next encounter that I need to defeat them however just couldn\u2019t. Caused me a little concern as it could spell game over just because I couldn\u2019t defeat any of them. Yeah, I can knock down the difficulty level however in doing so ruin a certain achievement. However, luck played its role and looking in hindsight, was also pretty cool. So, the troop balancing is pretty spot on in most parts \u2013 well I guess for my playing style at least. My style mainly consists of having heavily armoured soldiers and a good set of archers in the back as I found that the healers are a joke. Weak armoured, weak attacking spells and only have two healing spells per battle is a waste of troop space for me.\n\nTo complete the game can take approximately five hours or so. For me on hard, it took me about six hours to complete. Also, because there\u2019s no grinding to level up and earning extra gold, every combat counts. Because of this makes you think twice spending gold as there\u2019s no way you will be swimming in it. That\u2019s another bonus to this game however take note I\u2019m basing this on hard so it could be different playing on the lower difficulty level.\n\nTo those achievement hunters, there are twenty-one to accumulate and I managed to snag sixteen during my first run. Looking back on them now, you can snag all of them in a single playthrough as well. Also, because the game is linear, there\u2019s no real reason to play it again. That\u2019s fine in my eyes if the main campaign had a decent length and interesting (and not just having one hundred go fetch quests). I guess gameplay length is the bane of most mobile gaming in general so it would be nicer if the PC port has extra missions. But that requires more effort on the developer\u2019s behalf and we all don\u2019t want that to happen aye. In additional to this, there are five steam cards to collect and even though the cards are pictures from the game, they all quite nice to use as background wallpapers. Heck I using one right now.\n\nSo, with all this negativity and a handful of positives as explained above, it would be hard pressed to recommend this game to anyone other than those who likes a quick bash waiting for the train to arrive (so to speak) or even want a taste for this style of \u2018war gaming\u2019 experience. Even the price tag of approximately USD $5 may be tempting (subject to exchange rates if you are not in the US) however I still believe there are better games out there even if your goal is to kill a bit of time.\n\n5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1494494044, "timestamp_updated": 1494495350, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75955885648727417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1517938054, "developer_response": "Hi.

As you progress through the map you will come across friendlies who will join up with you. You'll get help from knights, archers, and healers for example.\n\nWhen building a team for battles they give you a point system. Each unit stack costs a certain amount and your max points to use is 15. So for example farmers costs 2 points per stack and archers are 3. Then after leveling up your main character you will be allowed to recruit more people per unit stack. This way when you go into battle you would have like 15 farmers per stack, 10 archers per stack, and so on. Enemies may only take some damage or may wipe out a few people from the stack. After each battle you are given exp points and gold.

I'm going to start off by saying that I played through the entire story campaign on Hard Mode; I recommend doing this because it feels like the best way to get a decent challenge out of this game.\n\nCombat in the game takes place as turn-based tactical skirmishes on small hexagonal battlefields, with a particular emphasis on troops. That is to say, each character on the battlefield is actually made up of multiple people of the same class, with their stats stacking on top of each other. As these troops take damage and lose bodies, so too do their stats dwindle, similar to Advance Wars, and probably a lot of other games I haven't played because I am a huge scrub. This creates an interesting dynamic where it's not always the correct option to focus damage on one enemy troop at a time, but rather spread damage out enough to make enemy attacks feeble rather than fatal. Additionally, there's a long-term concern in the form of gold: You have to pay a penalty out of your gold reward at the end of combat to recover lost allies, and there's no way to grind for extra gold, so keeping losses to a minimum is paramount.\n\nProgression is semi-linear. You go across a three-region map from skirmish to skirmish, picking up new allies and abilities along the way. There are short side paths to turn onto which end with treasure, stat upgrades, and shops to purchase additional units for troops as well as equipment to put on your main character \u2014 who inexplicably, despite being a warrior's son and built like such, doesn't have any actual presence in battle, instead preferring to radiate his stats onto his troops from the sidelines I guess. The early game can be pretty brutal due to the lack of troops and gold to enhance them with, though this gradually becomes less of an issue as income outpaces expenses. It isn't exactly clear how the stats on your main character affect your troops either, so to be honest I just didn't bother with equips until the best were available for purchase. Upgrading troops directly seems to be the best use of money anyhow \u2014 a massive clump of one-star Peasants can be surprisingly effective!\n\nGraphically, the game is colorful and the environments are nice enough to look at, though the character models are a bit too reminiscent of a high school Flash animation for my taste. On the other hand, the music, while inoffensive, only consists of two tracks: The one used for travel and the one used for combat. Not even the final boss gets a different song, which I found quite disappointing.\n\nOverall, Braveland was an enjoyable experience for a rather unassuming casual title. The campaign lasted around 4-5 hours for me to clear it 100%, which is a decent length for the $2 it tends to go for on sale. There's also a Survival mode where you just play battles and spend gold on upgrades in-between, which to be frank I didn't bother with too much. \n\nUnfortunately, I've heard that the sequel, Braveland Wizard, adds the ability to grind for gold and apparently makes it feel necessary to do.

When this title is on sale, it is about the same price as the normal price for the mobile version. \n2) No PC optimizations: #1 would be ok if the developers actually put effort into the port, but as it stands there are little to no improvements. There are very basic features that the game lacks due to lack of will/laziness. One example is that you cannot find out the movement zone of enemy units - in typical strategy games you mouseover a unit to see how far it can move so you can stay outside the range, in this game, you need to look up its movement, and manually count squares. You cannot 'mouseover' on a phone, so why implement it on a PC? Right?\n3) Lack of strategy: This game, despite being a strategy game, has almost no strategy. The two small figments of strategy is that most enemies have only one counter, so double teaming them saves one counter hit; also, you can block enemies with your troops to prevent them attacking your back line. Staples such as combo attacks are non-existent. So most battles are just a slapfest where your troops and enemy troops will stand toe to toe slugging it out until one stack dies. \n\nBottom line: Maybe acceptable for a kid, but for anyone who likes the strategic aspect, Braveland is a pass.", "timestamp_created": 1445268612, "timestamp_updated": 1445268612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520689666271209717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18561191": {"recommendationid": "18561191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037520882", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444110868}, "language": "english", "review": "This is blast to play.

The only thing what i dislike is the attack direction, You had this in the might and magic series however. Like - if there is an enemy in the front, and u want to attack from behind, you have to to that tile first and then click again to attack, instead of having a small sword icon that will it do for you.\n\nThere is a story.\nIt is Semi post apocalypse but totally worth reading because it contains some funny texts at times.\nYou can the change the difficulty at all times.\nLevel up system.\nThe game is very calm and music is relaxing, graphics are not even hurting your eyes.

I just skip those lol. (2/10)\n\nGameplay: Unlike the aspect of the story, the gameplay itself is enjoyable for a turn-based strategy game.  (8/10)\n\n1- Character Elements -\n@You can view each character's information which include: health, damage, defence , range of movement and number of turns. There is also a description of character abilities and what it's capable of (stunning/magic damage/healing etc)\n@Level System: You level up by getting exp (obviously) by defeating and winning enemies. \n@Main Character: You buy more units or upgrades with the coins you get, you can't upgrade your units and however, you cannot fight with your main character (you only fight with your 'squad' aka your units)\n\n2- Combat- \nThe combat is fun and easy. You get tips in the start of the game to understand the basics, and then you will just get used to the combat and know what to do.\nThere are some points however, where you will have to move forward and fight weaker enemies instead of trying to beat an overwhelming enemy squad because your squad is not strong enough (which makes the game challenging.)\n\nGameplay Styles: (5/10)\n3 Difficulties (Set to Easy/Normal/Hard)\nEasy is too easy , Normal is challenging enough and Hard oh well, it's for those of you who want to hit your head in the computer in order to win each match even if you have for example 5 units and your enemies have 500.\n\nEnjoyment: the game is fun for a regular and basic turn based game, I recommend it (it's not have so many\nhours of gameplay either so it's just for fun for your free time) - (4/5)\n\nRepeatable: Didn't finish the game yet, but it's one of those turn-based games which the difficulty is the only thing that will change your gameplay. (1.5/5)\n\nFrustration: Except for extremely unexpected challenging enemies (bosses with 300 health and 2 units of it) the game is fluent and you will feel like a god playing with your super talented squad. - (2/5)\n\nBoredom: You will play this game for few hours without breaks.

It's hard to know what to say about it. It is not a bad game. I'm tempted to call it good. But I'm not going to do that, and I wouldn't recommend it to people.\n\nAt $4.99, Braveland seems reasonably priced. On sale, it might even sound like a steal. But you're going to get a few hours out of it, and there's nothing remarkable about those few hours.\n\nThere's nothing really awful about Braveland. The graphics are slightly unnervingly Fisher Price, but they're effective and the backgrounds look nice. There are only a few songs, and they sound competent and appropriate. The interface is fine. The mechanics are... well, balanced and kind of standard for this kind of game.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nThere's not much depth to the battles, and there's not much to it besides battles. You pick up a modest variety of classes, and can bring up to five with you: archers, healers, knights, scouts, etc. Their roles are fairly obvious and they do them well enough. But you can really use whatever combination you want, and the gameplay won't change much at all.\n\nThe story is... well, the dialog is spelled and formatted correctly and does tell a pretty straightforward story about soldiers, bandits, villagers and the like. No one really says anything very interesting, but the conversations are short and inoffensive. The most personality you get out of the game is that bandits are dime-a-dozen jerks, and your peasant friend is a bit of a coward. There's a hero, who doesn't actually fight, and annoys me a little to look at him strutting around the world map as though he's helping. Technically he provides stat bonuses to the rest of the team by leveling up, but he mostly just speaks for the team and collects power-ups.\n\nThere's no real replay value to the campaign, but there's a Survival mode where you can play battle to battle, losing characters and buying new ones, and see how far you get. I played around with it a little, and it might add a bit of life to the game if you wind up loving it. So, there's a bit of hope for getting more play out of the game at least.\n\nI have played a lot of Flash games in my days, on sites like Newgrounds - RPGs, tower defense, strategy games, action, etc.. Braveland feels very much like one of those games. The look, the feel, the length, the design choices and the options the player is given. Indeed, I feel like I've played Bravelands many times already. Except usually, when I play this kind of game, it's free. Often, it's also got something more novel or fun about it.\n\nNormally, it's probably not good to get lost in the weeds talking about free vs. paid gaming in a review like this. I guess all I'm saying is, Bravelands is a dime a dozen kind of game that you see all over the internet, and even if it's got a bit of polish and isn't awful, it's hard for me to justify anyone spending their money on it. For a few dollars more, there are lots of really unique, memorable games on Steam.\n\nIf you just want to blow through some clean and simple RPG battles for a few hours, you probably won't hate this game. If it looks like it might be really awesome, it's not. It's just not. Look at the other reviews. A lot of the positive reviews say that it's short, it's easy, there's not a lot to it, it would be good for kids, etc.. Hardly ringing endorsements. If this game were getting 1 to 10 ratings instead of Yes or No, I don't imagine they'd be all that high. Nobody really loves this game. Everyone just agrees it's okay.

You have a (very) small set of units to play with, you only get one of each type, and you can't bring them all into the same battle.  The melee units are all on the same spectrum, with fast, weak units on one end and slow, strong units on the other.  The ranged units are similar, and it seems like the designers went out of their way to make the game completely balanced so that there are no wrong choices.\n\nWhich means there are no right choices either; nothing you do deployment-wise or unit management-wise has any real effect on the battles.  I suppose you could decide to intentionally damage your chances (ie: not buying/equipping new items, not upgrading when you have the option), but there's no advantage to be had by making that choice.  So, for each choice you're presented with in the game, either all answers are equivalent (and therefore it doesn't matter what you decide) or one answer is clearly better than the others (at which point, why even ask the player?).\n\nCombat itself, the heart of the game, is similarly weak. There's no real tactical or strategic interest in the battle system. Melee characters bash things in the next hex, ranged characters are weak against melee, but can hit any hex on the map. There's no cover or line of sight, so there's nowhere to hide from the ranged units.  There's no zone of control, so there's no preventing the melee units from running straight up to the ranged units and pounding on them. None of the hexes has any intrinsic value (other than the occasional chest, of which I think there were two in the entire game?), so you almost never need to be anywhere in particular on the map.\n\nSo really, it's just a brawl in an empty parking lot.  Over and over.\n\nThere are some special abilities (one per unit), but there's no tradeoff for using them.  The crossbowman, for instance, gets a super shot.  He has to sacrifice a turn to use it, but does triple damage the next round. There is no reason not to use this power every time it comes available; the enemies aren't variable enough to make it worth banking (especially since there are no reinforcements), and it means that in two turns you do three turns worth of damage.  It's simply more effective than just using the regular attack.\n\nThere's a global set of spells you can cast any time, but you accrue spell points by your units taking hits, so you can't really contrive to earn them more quickly.  They come in at the rate they come in, and you can spend them on (by the end) one of five spells.  Two of which are \"hit enemy\" and \"hit random enemies\", one of which makes a unit faster, and two of which I can't remember because I never needed them and they weren't interesting enough to try.  So, much like the unit powers, the spells wind up being an attack you get to throw for free once in a while. There's never a good reason not to do so when you have the chance.\n\nA total absence of interesting choices (tactically, strategically, plot-wise...) is the defining experience of the game.  With some minor changes to combat (ZOC!  How did they manage to make a hexmap game without zone of control?  What were they thinking?  And where are the tradeoffs for the specials?  Why isn't your hero on the field somewhere?) it could be really good, but as it stands it's weak and unsatisfying.\n", "timestamp_created": 1426637931, "timestamp_updated": 1426637931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14914324": {"recommendationid": "14914324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026221093", "num_games_owned": 5237, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1426474492}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun relaxing game that I totally lost track of time in, then it was over and put me in a good mood afterwards.

If you're experienced with these type of games the tutorial is painfully slow anyhow as the mechanics of this game is not different enough from most other games like it to make it necessary to explain the combat and workings of the game in detail to anyone but the less experienced players. Also the combat doesn't really change much hence it's not very replayable and to be honest i didn't find even the hardest difficulty noticably more challenging than normal (didn't try easy). \nStill. If it's on sale it is a good time once you get past the tutorial and start playing the game.\n\nPro:\n- Charming graphics\n- Easily learned battle mechanics that, although somewhat easy, still can throw you if you don't get rid of the right enemy first (as an example: leaving the poison dealing archers till last while dealing with a slow moving, heavy hitting boss may make you lose the battle). These should however be things that come naturally to more experienced players.\n- Good balance of difficulty throughout the game as the middle part is not the most difficult part of the game as in so many other games.\n- Choices matter - chances are you will not earn enough gold to focus both on having a full army, all skills unlocked AND all the best equipment, you may have to choose unless you're insanely good at not taking damage and healing your own units (the gold won from each battle depends on how many of your units died).\n- Some resemblence of a storyline throughout the game despite the fact that it's a small one that took me only a few hours to play through. The current time on my profile is two playthroughs, and the second was much shorter than the first. Although it's generic and has the almost clich\u00e9d throwback that most RPGs have where you - upon beating your sworn arch enemy - realize that who you that who was portrayed at the main villain was just someone's pawn afterall aaaand you have to defeat them to. And their armies. And their pets. And their wife. Possibly. Also sully the honour of their daughter in in the nude.. waitwhat. No. Nevermind.\n\nCons:\n- Music got really annoying to me (granted, i find myself unable to listen to game music most of the time).\n- The different difficulty settings were really not that different to me.\n- You're forced to play through the tutorial as it's integrated in the story of the game (First three moves or so on the map).\n- Not really challenging at all, even on the hardest difficulty.\n(- For the achievement junkies like myself: you have to check out their twitter online in order to obtain all achievements.

Or perhaps King's Bounty or Age of Wonders? Stripped of all city management, you basically just have the turn-based combat. Braveland takes this and adds a big, friendly smile on every creature.\n\nIt presents you a cute, classic storyline: a happy farmer boy loses his family and farm to bandits and sets out on a bold journey for revenge, but it turns out there is something more sinister going on and the happy guy wants to deal with it. He travels around and beats up the bad guys who take the hits with permanent crooked smiles on their faces. At first the dialogue attemps some meme-based humour (arrow in the knee anyone?), but they are quickly discarded for cheerful, repetitive greetings and taunts.\n\nTravelling happens on a board with enemies, stores and events in each tile. It's linear, though you can (and should) check every branching road for bonus items, gold and experience points. Gold gets you more troops and items, experience gives small bonuses to creature stats and increases the cap on troops.\n\nWhile I only played the hard mode, combats are easy for a player familiar with turn-based strategy games. Combat AI does not offer surprises in neither good nor bad ways, so it's okay. There are only 7 different types of troops to buy and around the same number of different enemies with upgraded versions of the usual ones coming later into the game. Basically all of them also smile all the time.\n\nWhy, I even lost one battle! Being vastly out-numbered, my troops collected their pocket money and gave it to me to hire more troops for another try. Happyland would have been a more appropriate name for the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Braveland would probably be a nice introduction to turn-based strategy games for children or people not acquainted with the genre.

You play the role of the Commander of a small and motley crew of fighters seeking vengeance against an evil army that sacked your village.  \n\nThe player starts with a pitchfork-weilding peasant and an archer, and eventuall unlocks 3 more melee fighters, one more archer, and a healer.  The healer is also able to cast magic bolts at enemies at any range.  The player's character doesn't appear in the battle directly but is able to cast attack and status effect spells during battle.  The tactics are generally pretty simple.  The largest force a player may bring into combat is 5 members but because there is cap on the sum of ranks of player units, the later, there is a choice as to whether to bring a lot of fast/low armor units or a smaller number of slow/heavily armored units.  Despite its apparent simplicity, there is just enough depth to keep the game interesting through its campaign.  The campaign isn't terribly long, with a full playthrough on Normal difficulty taking about 4 hours.  Muc longer than this, and there would need to be more depth to keep the game interesting.  \n\nThe graphics are pleasant, with a hand-drawn motif thant is a bit more sophisticated than the retro-throwback style so many games employ these days.  The colors are bright, animations are smooth, and it is generally fairly clear what to expect from new units -- both friend and foe -- when you first enounter them.  The music is well produced and fits the game's art style to a T, with a somewhat medieval/fantasy feel and a nice mellow overworld theme and battle music that conveys tension but keeps with the smooth and relaxing feel of the rest of the game.  \n\nBottom Line:  That \"smooth and relaxing\" feel is this game's draw.  It is not a super deep prove-your-mettle-as-a-general battle/war sim.  It's deep enough to be a little engaging but not so involved as to be distressing.  It is a diversion for a few minutes or hours getting away from the hectic and stressful beat of real life or a soothing distraction to pass the time on a bus or in a waiting room where your undivided focus for several hours simply isn't available.", "timestamp_created": 1416113347, "timestamp_updated": 1416113347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525339066982269287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12918423": {"recommendationid": "12918423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018466482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1415841140}, "language": "english", "review": "Like a simplified version of the King's Bounty series, boasting a HoMM-like combat and relatively quick combats that can make for quick sessions (but end up just becoming \"one more round and that's it!\").

Enjoyable battles and progression. Traditional units with a little bit of a unique approach. Some good improvements to previous titles.\n\nBad:\nPretty much straightforward gameplay: battles cannot be replayed, grinding is not present, not enough choices. Tactical combat is not deep enough.\n\nOverall, I recommend Braveland to anyone who wants to play a strategy game which can be played in small bursts. There is not much complexity in this game, but it definitely has a few enjoyable moments.\n\n[u]MY OPINION: 7.0/10 (FAIR)[/u]\nGraphics: 8/10\nWorld Design: 7/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplay Value: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1415390700, "timestamp_updated": 1475089833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569325387477874756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12831775": {"recommendationid": "12831775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053049955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1415318219}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like King's Bounty, then you'll like this game because it has most of the same elements.

Hard mode wasn't much different than normal, but did offer a little more boosted enemy AI.  Failure still pays out.  Survivor mode was actually a fair challenge.  Unit death is real, and you have to buy units between battles.  This gets tricky, as they only offer specific units for sale between each battle.  This makes healers imperative, but also puts a huge target on their head.  The longer you last, the bigger bonus they will give you next time around.

Despite this, it manages to throw heavy (yet short-term) consequences for playing badly on hard mode. The game has a small element of resource management wherein the more efficient you play, the more money you get to keep. If for example you play terribly on hard mode, you'll end up earning less gold (you'll have to pay more to replenish your party). The battles are finite so you can see how this can affect you. Luckily there's a way to earn gold in case you mess up. Be warned though that the other method is pretty boring.\n\nI went in expecting a casual experience and that's exactly what I got.

For the price, length, and style, it really is a fun little game.  I'm playing on a Mac, so there are a few glitches I encountered (don't know if this is true for other OSes), none of which were deal-breakers and a few other minor irritations:  \n\n1) For some reason, out of the blue usually, you can't do anything-- move, click on anything, close the game. . .  Like the forums say, an easy fix is switching the game to beta.  Worked like a charm after that.\n2) Despite doing some things in-game (like the rain of fire, 100 troops), the achievements didn't unlock.  \n3) The game ends rather abrubtly.  I suppose if I'd paid attention, I would have realized I was at the end.  I think part of that is because there really isn't a huge emphasis on the game's story or story development.\n4) I'm not sure if it was just me, but the battle for the sword in the stone seemed far more difficult than any other battle in the game.\n\nBut, like I mentioned before, these really are just minor issues.

The main hero can not be taken into battle, but you can outfit him with armor and weapons to boost your teams stats. The soundtrack is superb and art direction reminds me of some of 5th cells games.
