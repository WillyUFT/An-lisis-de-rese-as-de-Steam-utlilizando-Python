Overall I would say I liked it, but there are some flaws that will definitely stop me from ever playing it again.\n\nFirst of all, the good. Graphics, music, atmosphere, world design and animations are astonishingly fantastic and feel just right throughout the whole game. Most major and some minor characters are so likeable and/or well-written that this alone drove me towards continuing to play for most of the 20 hours. I daresay that if the game had only been a bonding roadtrip of an unlikely father-child relationship it would have been a much stronger game emotionally and pacing-wise. Sam is endlessly adorable and John is a suitable main player character despite never saying a word. As I said, side characters are strong throughout and I had an emotional connection to many of them, especially considering their respective fates.\n\nThe Zelda-like gameplay loop, both light puzzle-solving and fighting, was overall solid. The world and story is more linear than one would initially think, with few side quests and even fewer reasons to deviate from the main objective most of the time, as you visit nearly every location in the game anyway and if you go there too early you mostly cannot progress anyway and have to fight enemies twice. Enemy variety is not that exciting that you should go out of your way to find fights.\n\nStory-wise, I am conflicted. I certainly liked the road trip aspect of travelling East and learning new parts of the world and finding new friendships. However, I did not really enjoy the motivation for travelling East or the very gloomy, very tragic consequences that accompanied each and every location. Despite the game desperately trying to portray a \"happy ending\", it is anything but. Without going too much into spoiler territory, nearly all of the main characters suffer a tragic fate and have to live ([spoiler]or not[/spoiler]) in the post-game world in some fucked up emotional states.\n\nAside from the story, the game has some pacing issues. On quite a number of occasions the quest progression requires you to walk back and forth between NPCs or locations, looping back to the main path or fighting enemy hordes in gated arenas. The \"rule of three\" was strong with the designers as many of the more annoying diversions come on groups of three before the story picks up the pace again. There were also a few late-game sections involving stealth, timed traversal puzzles or shifting/changing walls while being chased, all of which were particularly fun to play and more annoying when I had to repeat them due to somewhat arbitrary conditions that did not exist outside of those sections. I prefer games that do not betray their own universe's rules, especially not when it feels like it was made to pad out the game time, as those sections did not add anything to the story. The final dungeon also felt overly long, to be honest, and I actually started to speed past minor enemies whom I had fought until that point all the way.\n\nAs I wrote above, I believe the game would have been stronger and more emotionally fulfilling as a pure roadtrip story. The characters were strong enough on their own to carry even a somewhat fluffy story about growing up or bonding between two people (one adult, one child) and the relationships they build along the way. The principal end-of-the-world sci-fi story is more a hindrance and a distraction, and ultimately a betrayal of the bonding story, as the game does [spoiler]not end on a high note for any of the characters[/spoiler], as I already noted. This (and the padding) are the main reason why I won't replay the game.\n\nThat being said, I do consider it overall a worthwhile time investment. Even if it was 25% longer than it needed to be, many of those hours were fun to play and experience thanks to John, Sam, Alva, Isabel, William, Daniel and many, many, many other characters. I could have done without the darker and horrific undertones and fates, but maybe that's just me.", "timestamp_created": 1700694692, "timestamp_updated": 1700694783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151107196": {"recommendationid": "151107196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099849112", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 281, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1700718008}, "language": "english", "review": "me personally enjoy this game very much, the puzzle so entertaining. the sound design perfect for every stage and unique each character. the graphic over the top, pixel yet very beautiful, the scenery even the waving grass so perfect. just dont like old TV filter, glad the setting let me turn it off.", "timestamp_created": 1700676276, "timestamp_updated": 1700676276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150836729": {"recommendationid": "150836729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336944231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1700626765}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game", "timestamp_created": 1700626904, "timestamp_updated": 1700626904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150810478": {"recommendationid": "150810478", "author": {"steamid": "76561199162281996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1688189792}, "language": "english", "review": "Story rich, amazing art style, good gamelpay.

Looking forward to playing Octopia (the upcoming DLC), I feel like I'll love it even more than the base game.\n\n\n      [table]\n      [tr]\n      [th]Category[/th]\n      [th]Score[/th]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83c\udfc6 Overall Rating[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83d\udcd6 Story[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83c\udfae Gameplay[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83c\udfa8 Graphics[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83c\udfb5 Sound Design[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\u21a9 Replay Value[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83d\ude27 Difficulty[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83d\udc1b Bug free?[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f PC Requirements[/td]\n      [td]\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606[/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [tr]\n      [td]\ud83d\udcc8 Game Length[/td]\n      [td]\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\u25b1\n      [/td]\n      [/tr]\n      [/table]\n\n\n      [hr][/hr]", "timestamp_created": 1699369384, "timestamp_updated": 1699370943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149442636": {"recommendationid": "149442636", "author": {"steamid": "76561199486823866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1464, "last_played": 1699020941}, "language": "english", "review": "WASTE OF TIME", "timestamp_created": 1699020999, "timestamp_updated": 1699020999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422728270292282104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149414818": {"recommendationid": "149414818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835932921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3616, "last_played": 1698807150}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely adore this game, so much that I'm currently doing a second playthrough six months after I originally completed it.

The tone was all over the place; from major tragedy to funny fetch quest to major tragedy to funny sidequest, and the \"funny\" parts were always way too drawn out. It can't decide what kind of game it wants to be; weird or dark. And that ending was just not satisfying... It just feels like they left too much to speculation.\n\nThe gameplay was okay, though attacking was weirdly inconsistent and it has the Breath of the Wild \"cooking makes health a joke\" problem. Once you have the the ability to easily refill ammo combat is rarely difficult except for figuring out boss patterns, which is fine; I feel like if it was actually hard it'd be really frustrating. Puzzles were rarely hard (except when I was being dumb) but could get a bit repetitive.\n\nOverall, I can't in good conscience recommend the game.

The controls are occasionally clunky, and attacks would sometimes lag on my system, but the difficulty is forgiving enough to keep that from being terribly frustrating.

Several threads are left unresolved in those chapters, in a way that's less thought-provoking and more just plain confusing. Eastward is at its absolute best when it's about towns of regular people living out their regular lives, and just not great when it's failing to clearly set up the motivations of its villains.

But would I recommend it to someone: no, I wouldn't.\n\nI love retro 2D action adventures even though there are only a few worth playing on the PC. Judging from the screenshots, I assumed Eastward could be the game I was waiting for, but after finishing it in ~28h I'm pretty much disappointed. Actually, I was from the very beginning.\nLetting aside the odd and mostly annoying music or the few blurry animations in a totally different graphics style, mainly the story and overall game design are a total mess. But also smaller design choices made (at least) half of the time I put in it more of a hassle than fun.\n\nIt starts with the dialogs which are badly written, can't be really skipped and seem to take forever. I feel that during the 28h, I tried several hours to skip dialogs while pressing mouse buttons and keys for a million times. Even when you save a game at a fridge (for whatever reason), there is a stupid dialog each and every time. Why make a every little thing such a pain?\n\nWhile the level graphics are generally good or even great, the character design is very weird and doesn't really fit the tone of the game. Together with generally unfitting music (happy Caribbean music when walking through a cold and dark city), the game feels off most of the time.\nBesides, it's very linear game and there is no large world to explore. It's separated into 8 chapters where you can never go back and most of these chapters leave no or little room to explore. There are two chapters with somewhat larger areas, but even there, there is not much to be found except for a chest here and there. Besides, one of the design issues is that you never know if you can get back to a place. I.e. you can't say if you can't open a door or solve a puzzle right now of if you overlooked something and will never be able to come back. This is worsened by the fact that some events and progressions are triggered by just walking somewhere and that there is only one manual save slot per game.\n\nThen there is the fight system and I can't say I liked it. Generally, you need to switch between the two main characters all the time to stun and hit enemies. This permanent switching is just not really fun and when you mastered it, the game punishes you by separating the two characters. Repeatedly. Also, switching bombs and forces doesn't seem to be possible other than by entering the menu. There generally doesn't seem to be a keyboard configuration and the menu navigation is somewhat strange. Again, everything in this game is a bit of a pain.\n\nFor whatever reason, there is an embedded super-simplified, unpolished and pretty difficult Gameboy-Style role playing game called \"Earth Born\" which can be played at some arcade machines (?) in the game or from the \"Extras\" menu after finishing it. In a nutshell, it seems to be a fully playable mini-RPG where you can use items bought in the main game but due to lack of saving and poor design it's not really worth wasting your time. There's also an embedded slot machine game each time you cook something which influences the status effects of this meal. Again, this is a very weird and really stupid idea.\n\nThe game itself is not very hard and all the cooking and buffs wouldn't be really necessary but there are quite a few annoying time based puzzles (especially the time rewind things towards the end) and sequences where you need to flee from \"Miasma\" etc. under time pressure. Generally, the game doesn't explain most of its mechanisms, i.e. that you must use charged or double/triple charged shots at some points. Which can be super-annoying in boss fights under time pressure. Generally, the game doesn't give you a lot of direction what to do. Sometimes you need to visit certain places to go on with the story but the game doesn't really tell you so.\n\nIt's hard to explain, but all in all, with all the cut scenes, lengthy dialogs, places where you couldn't use your weapons, stupid mini games, very small rooms etc., Eastward never really felt like a real \"whole\" game to me but more like an accumulation of pieces that didn't sum up to a believable and enjoyable game world. This is worsened by the writing which combines annoying pointless dialogs with a convoluted story that seems to be pieced together from different ideas and doesn't really make any sense in the end. The \"museum\" and \"cyberspace\" (?) parts towards the end and actually the whole ending show that even the developers didn't really know how to conclude this mess.\n\nIn a nutshell, I didn't really enjoy a lot of the 28h I put in this game. I never really wanted to come back to it, actually I put it aside for some months until I decided I must somehow finish it before starting another game. But that alone tells a lot about my enthusiasm to play Eastward.", "timestamp_created": 1696586616, "timestamp_updated": 1696586616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147718758": {"recommendationid": "147718758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087060889", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2193, "last_played": 1683342557}, "language": "english", "review": "Every part of this game is beautifully crafted.

Everyday I get off work and i immediately open this game. I\u2019m so fully invested in the world this game designed.

The combat and boss fight is more maze/puzzle based and I also love it so much (totally not because I suck at combat) it\u2019s hard enough for me where I feel challenged but still can manage to beat it but to people who are more mastered at combat it might be too easy for them I think???

It somehow helps that player keeps on tabs with npcs per certain events and see their reactions.\n\nSound 9/10: Even though the game have no voice acting, the overall plot was able to deliver emotions even thru just text boxes and character emotions. The bgms exactly goes with the theme and surroundings.\n\nGameplay 9/10: A simple action battle gameplay with enough roster of variety of weapons and skills to go with every maps. I think it suits the overall catch of the game along with some puzzles to tinker your mind a bit before proceeding. Somehow a bit of strategy is needed but if you are keeping up with weapons and how to use them, a player can breeze thru any enemies with enough foods. Overall good. A big plus as there's even a mini rpg \"Earthborn\" entirely separate to the game plot but integrated to the characters hobbies and likeness. This brings another challenge and trophy hunters.\n\nControls 9/10: Everything is snappy and active. The only thing seems to be I am having problem with is the targeting using analog controller especially the baseball mini game or Sam's bubble magic sometimes on some puzzles. It would help maybe to put scrub control button on controller to have a minimal precise targeting. But I still got thru without it so no biggie. An addition would certainly help other players. \n \nGraphics 10/10: The art direction is enough to put the whole game deliver what it needs to show to players. Characters are expressive, environment is beautifully rendered, and the animations are smooth as intended. It helps that the world is colorful and even backgrounds have something moving that make the world looks alive and natural.

There's a reason that I took a year-long break and only moseyed my way on back after committing to clearing my backlog.\n\nThere's so many wonderful things about it: the designs, the color palette, the score, the feel of the world, and the puzzles. I cannot rave enough about the designs and how beautiful and charming they are.\nBut for the main driving force of the story, nothing really lasts long enough to feel satisfying.\nIf you're a fan of character interactions there's only so much dialogue you get through but being sent along on the next fetch quest. Fan of fetch quests and exploration? Have fun with the segments the game allots to you before you're hurried to next story segment and blocked from the area until next time. \n\nAll this could've been easy to forgive with strong main characters. Sure, a silent and gruff protagonist juxtaposed against an excitable and cheerful young child? Excellent combo, No notes.\nBut I found myself yearning for moments of our main characters interacting or reacting with each other. Even with a silent protagonist, you can have moments of interiority with them. Especially with a team that makes sprite-work this expressive.\n\nThere's a moment in New Dam City where a character presents Sam with a pair of new boots, seeing as she never even had shoes. You have this small moment of John looking abashed, even a little guilty, for not providing this seemingly basic necessity. I was starved for moments like that. But as it is, it mostly feels like John is less a character and more just a big skillet you can use to beat the salt out of enemies.\n\nI keep coming back to its stellar opening cutscene. And I find myself nostalgic for a game that doesn't exist. A game where there are giant sprawling worlds teeming with life, where the where the main duo display open affection for each other in this game that is arguably centered around their bond. I want to play THAT game.\n\nAll of this being said, this is a stunning debut for a studio. The sheer scope and love that went into all aspects of the game is plain to see. Though I may have not been the biggest fan of the execution, you would never see me call this game lazy.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1693769970, "timestamp_updated": 1693770270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145541101": {"recommendationid": "145541101", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099615623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1696631039}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, and the pixel art is amazing,", "timestamp_created": 1693679164, "timestamp_updated": 1693679164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145460081": {"recommendationid": "145460081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973410550", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1685817536}, "language": "english", "review": "epic fun and adventure, its so good i dont want to finish it\nhas that old school SNES gameplay :)", "timestamp_created": 1693585842, "timestamp_updated": 1693585842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145455809": {"recommendationid": "145455809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183057659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1626, "last_played": 1693022471}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the story for this a lot. in parts it can feel a bit filler-y but not in a bad way, at least for me. the combat was fun but it could be a little bit annoying sometimes, especially towards the end. i liked the puzzles", "timestamp_created": 1693581685, "timestamp_updated": 1693581685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145450588": {"recommendationid": "145450588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388300666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1504, "last_played": 1695840816}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1693576803, "timestamp_updated": 1693576803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145436118": {"recommendationid": "145436118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137272202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1361, "last_played": 1693559403}, "language": "english", "review": "A game with a delightful world.

Having said that, what it does present is still worthy of the time investment. This is especially so if the considering player is unfamiliar with the genre or is on the younger side.\n\nThe areas in which Eastward excels and has shortcomings tend to promote this. The visual and audio presentation is praiseworthy, featuring adorable sprite-work and a charming style that references certain classical Asian landscapes or culture. In some ways it's representative of the insidious Western influence upon it, most clearly noticeable from the recipe variety.\nIts overindulgence in these matters is demonstrative of the title's shortcomings, however. Eastward is ultimately the story of Sam, and as such is the primary focus, having many endearing sprites to outwardly and with childlike innocence represent her many different emotions. Her counterpart and silent protector, the guardian that is John conversely has relatively few sprites - appearing rather sparse in comparison.\nLikewise, it is charming at first to demonstrate this relationship visually, but in conjunction with the approach to storytelling can become a little tedious. In the small world of the prologue where the stakes are low it matters little should someone with custody of a young and spirited child allow them to make decisions and determine directions in order to learn consequences, but John's lack of intervention during legitimately dangerous scenarios and resolve to be utterly silent, following and being at the whims of a child in times of peril, ultimately go against his character and what he ostensibly stands for. What Eastward does best in my opinion; that representation of youthful innocence, curiosity, and sense of justice that is exemplified by the relationship between the two protagonists can terminate by becoming a flaw of presentation. Eastward makes frequent use of dramatic irony, which is suitable for a pantomime where the only recourse for the audience is to shout in hopes of altering the script, or to realise and gaze through their fingers - unable to look away from the mounting inevitability. But for the protagonists of a video game to do this, characters which the player controls to act out the story, can become tedious and a little annoying when used repeatedly. In an attempt to lower raised tension to provide the player with appropriate respite, the story can often be advanced by very convenient means that the player seemingly has little control over. To bring the aforementioned together, there is one instance where the simple intervention of John, made clear by dramatic irony - a scenario where an innocent child would happily part with something dear and important to aid another, but would not fool a sentient adult, would prevent the aimless setback of the player - all in the name of advancing the plot.\n\nThe game-play itself, how the player can and is able to interact with the world is fun, simple, but nothing to write home about. The combat and the puzzles match the same description but exemplify the simple to the point of being a little easy and repetitive, hence why it would be a suitable and enjoyable introduction.\n\nEastward wears its reference material on its sleeves, which is nostalgic and pleasant as a sign of appreciation for what game before, but can give merit to the argument that Eastward is a little too referential and derivative rather than original. When a work is too much so, it can become a lesser sum of its parts, attempting to replicate and copy from too many sources without excelling in one of its own. It is so in this case, as I may consider greater past titles that excel in Eastwards components. For instance, one may point to Mother 3 and Chrono Trigger for the world, storytelling, and graphical influence, Cross Code for puzzle and game-play elements, and so on.\n\nWhat makes Eastward captivating would almost be better suited to something akin to a slice of life - where it matters not if characters don't grow as a consequence of their actions, an almost static world where the current representation of characters and their interactions with others and the everyday comings and goings is able to shine more readily.", "timestamp_created": 1693515086, "timestamp_updated": 1693515086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145071705": {"recommendationid": "145071705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972756602", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1975, "last_played": 1693067461}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing artwork, nice characters and a beautiful story.

There's a lot of minor characters with their own little stories to meet, a few minigames, and it is all very fun to go through.\n\u2714\ufe0f Nice enough game feel overall.\n\u2714\ufe0f Enjoyable alternation of paces between exploration, narration, combat, and puzzles.\n\u2714\ufe0f The cooking minigame is surprisingly entertaining.\n\n\ud83d\udcad The game is pretty linear. Make sure to complete areas before venturing forth too, because it won't let you go back.\n\n\u274c While a lot of things about the worldbulding are very enticing, I can't help but feel that the story itself lacks something. In the end it didn't make me feel much despite its clear intention to be pretty emotional. It's probably due to the general tone of the game being very gimmicky and lighthearted, which kinda prevented me from getting very attached to characters. Also got a somewhat \"why did I do all this again?\" feeling in the end.\n\u274c While there's an enjoyable variety of gameplay, and the gameflow feels nice overall, the gameplay itself is pretty basic. You kinda just bash stuff with a pan, with not much more to it. I'm caricaturing a bit, but still, I would have enjoyed some more interesting enemy patterns that force you to think your actions through a bit more. There are a few, but they tend to be pretty limited. Part of the issue is that they put an ammo system for all the ranged weapons, which means they couldn't require you to use them in fights, because you could just get stuck if they did.\n\u274c Aiming is somewhat difficult, especially in combat, and especially when you have to charge an attack. Not a big issue, but can be annoying on the long run.\n\nOverall I do recommend it as a fun little (not so little actually, took me 37 hours to finish) game, with quite a bit of worldbuilding depth, and light but entertaining gameplay. Just don't expect a particularly touching story and you won't be disappointed (and maybe you'll have a good surprise if it works better on you than it did on me).", "timestamp_created": 1692924972, "timestamp_updated": 1693235704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640309154987335205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144885813": {"recommendationid": "144885813", "author": {"steamid": "76561199539260974", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1450, "last_played": 1693359887}, "language": "english", "review": "AmaZing\n", "timestamp_created": 1692830856, "timestamp_updated": 1692830856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144852953": {"recommendationid": "144852953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193993449", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1690074612}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game", "timestamp_created": 1692792981, "timestamp_updated": 1692792981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144817714": {"recommendationid": "144817714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153964293", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1692740767}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, very male oriented.

Wow did this game hit the nail on the head for me. From mechanics, resource economy, art style, right down to the amazingly heartwarming story (promise no spoilers ;)). \nThe mechanics, while pretty simple, are very unique for the genre, having two main characters with very different abilities to switch between, which allows for much more dynamic game-play, especially since the combat isn't bogged down by turn-based mechanics, which outside of nostalgic favorites, I'm way too impatient for. The puzzles and time limit areas were simple enough as to not present a severe obstacle to story progression, while also making you think just enough to be interesting most of the time. The game also felt very intuitive, i wasn't slogging through tutorials for every new weapon or bomb type, with there only being small text-banner hints for the new stuff, which let the story/dialogue have a lot of room to breathe and grow. \nThe only real criticism I have for the mechanics of the game has to do with the resource economy. The game includes a limited crafting system in the form of cooking, which allows you to make different food items that buff your stats, while also restoring health or providing an overshield to your healthbar. While this isn't all that different from other RPGs, the way to acquire ingredients felt a little lack luster, as outside of the selection of items you could buy at the food shops, the only way to get ingredients was to defeat enemies, and hope that the RNG gods would bless you with a good drop. The Ammo also felt somewhat similar towards the beginning, but by mid game you would probably have collected enough in-game currency to not have to worry about buying refills, and they introduce a time-based refill feature. \nYou can probably tell by the previews in the store page, but the art style of the game is gorgeous, while lacking the depth of field of similarly illustrated games like octopath traveler, the highly stylized pixel art design is incredibly endearing, and character design is very unique. There are little to no recycled elements (oustide possibly the dungeon areas, I'd have to go back and really scrutinize) and each character and dungeon just screams with personality. \nMy biggest compliment would definitely be to the story, outside of a few points mid-game (which did, by game's end, give more meaning to the ending) everything felt important, and the story didn't feel all over the place. From reading other people's reviews, the most common criticism I see is that the story's pacing is a bit sluggish. I can absolutely see where they're coming from, as I feel the marketing strategy was more focused on the combat and action sequences (which there are plenty of anyway IMO). However, personally, I was very much appreciative of the time I got to spend getting to know the supporting cast of characters, rather than the time spent in menus or trying to read item lore after the fact. The story telling really gave weight exactly where it needed to be in the events leading up to the ending, and really built up the player's emotional connection with the characters. What I will say regarding this, though, is that If you come into the game expecting a quick pixel-art dungeon crawler, then this title will certainly not meet your expectations, it is surprisingly long, and I enjoyed every minute. \n100% would recommend this game, and I'll definitely be coming back to 100% complete in the future. \n", "timestamp_created": 1692398275, "timestamp_updated":

I have been playing for awhile now and I love how detailed and graphics of this game is. There is so much to explore and to find hidden chests and secrets within the maps. I don't usually care for story but this game is great at it! I love the mix of characters and the story I get to experience along with them. Going back to the graphics of this game, the colors used is almost like a grungy, rusty feel to it which I really like because it is so unique. Exploring New Dam City was so incredible, the details put into the buildings and the music really puts it all together. In this city, there are little tales told by a ghost which is a nice eery touch! As for the combat of this game, I love it as well. You get lots of weapon choices with the two characters. I usually use the pan and gun then use Sam to stun which is very useful. The bosses are very cool too since each are very different so you do not get tired of fighting them. You have to figure out how to first defeat each bosses and experiment. It is so satisfying figuring out how to damage the boss!! My favorite part is the puzzle-y parts where you and Sam split off and help each other get through the room!  There is SO MANY unique concepts about this game that I adore so much. I really recommend this game to other players especially if you appreciate nice pixel art and good combat!

If you look at it like a Young Adult Novel with Gameplay and go in expecting that and the number of times you'll have to sit through plot, it's a really good time.\n-----------------\n\nI haven't finished Eastward, but I can tell I'm going to. I absolutely love the game to bits. Despite this, this is a game I wish I could give a \"hmmm\" to, as far as recommendations go. Loving a game and recommending it to others are two very different things. Yet, I had to get my thoughts out now because it's both a blessing and a head-scratcher to be playing something like this.\n\nI didn't get the game when it first came out because it had a \"mostly positive\" review rating. I waited until it was on sale and when it have \"very positive\" for it's reviews of all time. I think the people that don't like the game have their right to not like it, but I also think it's harsh to not recommend it the way they do, like the design is flummoxed or lacks intention. This game is made with a lot of intention, love and care... for mostly better, sometimes worse.\n\nI'm reminded of the frustration people have been having with the latest Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom. A common complaint I see is the story is vapid, utterly nothing, that it sometimes doesn't even feel like a sequel to the last game because of how so much of the last game's events are just ignored entirely. Meanwhile, you're given no time to actually interact with characters. This is intentional, to give the player as much freedom as possible. A butchered quote I see applied to Miyamoto, master of Nintendo and a man known to stick his fingers in all the games, is he hates games that try to tell him what to feel and instead wants to leave the feeling to the player. To that end, it can sometimes seem the Zelda games don't feel much of anything if you aren't prepared to do a fair bit of legwork to get emotionally invested.\n\nPlaying Eastward is like playing a bizzarro reality where the word \"Freedom\" was forgotten almost entirely when a legend of Zelda game was made, and making you feel a certain was was always the goal. Just as the freedom at the cost of plot isn't a bad thing, neither is plot at the cost freedom. The only issue, I think, is not being told one way or another that this is what you're getting into. It's a mistake a lot of games make, in their attempts to maintain the mystique of being a new world, reality or experience. \n\nIn this game, you take on the role of John, at first, and I do believe you'll be playing him through most of the game. Later, you also play as his adoptive daughter as the two try to survive in this crazy world while Sam has magic powers she doesn't understand and there's people that believe the world above ground is a wasteland. It isn't... until you arrive and perhaps cause the second apocalypse.\n\nAlthough the writing is simple and quirky on the surface, it uses the minimum amount of words and visuals possible to express it's dense story. More than that, it works hard to make you feel like our two main characters. This is impressive, considering John is a silent protagonist who doesn't look anything like a legendary chosen here. In another game. his sprite could be any NPC's. Here, though, his silent demeanor is a real character trait; he's a man of few words and doesn't like small talk. But something you'll find out quick, if you pay attention, is he's a kind man who cares deeply for same. In this way, the game has its cake and eats it too with how its main character feels; you can project onto John a bit, but ohn will always be John.\n\nSam is, on the other end, vibrant and loud. She's a kid, a real one. The writing here is spectacular, but if you're the kind of person who doesn't like to be told how you feel, Sam might be annoying. The game attempts to endear you to her through John, as John clearly loves her and wants to do what's best for her. Doesn't matter what you want, though, cause John's gonna take care of her. But hey, at least she takes care of John, too. In a way, it's another Dad simulator, but I'd call it a family simulator.\n\nThe writing in the game is superb, and I don't just mean the spoken words. If you're attentive, there's a lot of details you can notice, such as how John's house at the start of the game only has one bed, and how he sleeps sitting up. Sam's a new addition to his life, and John had no question in what was best for her. Likewise, several seeds and questions are expertly planted that are answered later, when you might have forgotten you'd even asked. \n\nThe artstyle is also phenomenal. It's as if Legend of Zelda and Earthbound had a baby, then uncle Fallout came to visit, said the baby was cute, and offered old clothes. The game is charming and quirky, with pixel art made with oodles of love and care. The fact John, who wield's a frying pan like a sword, isn't an ambidextrous sprite and turns like a person and doesn't just flip between two sprites says a lot too that. They want John and Sam to feel like real people down to how they move, and I'd say they succeeded. The pixel work is like the days of the SNES, but we never stopped advancing it. In a word, gorgeous. In another word, schizophrenic, but never unintentionally so. Some bits of the UI and character design feels odd (like how the character portraits for John and Sam are anime as heck, with John having an epic smile and a seemingly out of character determination in his eyes), but it feels intentional. It doesn't clash, but sticks out, like it wants to tell you something. \n\nThe second biggest flaw with the game is the pacing can sometimes be a bit... absurd. I was struck by a feeling of whiplash as John and Sam made it to the second town and after only being there a day, the town's prettiest lady falls for John. At the same time, we've gone from the slight octane of a boss fight and getting to a beautiful new world via what we first thought was a death hole to hazing a grand, slow, peaceful time at this new village. The romance plot feels like a way to get us more attached to this place so leaving will be all the more bitter. It can feel a bit like they were throwing out as many hooks to make sure you bit and became caught up in loving this place. Some things were slow, others fast, all at the same time. Give the game patience, take it with a bag of 50 salt (it'll make sense when you play) and it'll pass, but I can see this as a deal breaker for some and I wouldn't blame them.\n\nPerhaps the biggest flaw with this game was to even be a game in the first place. Maybe it would be better received as a book or a comic. But this wanted to be a game and it had good reasons to be, but not everyone is going to agree with that or buy into it. Control is regularly taken from the player for long cutscenes and characters talking to each other for minutes at a time. It's good dialogue, and if you come in expecting it, it's like playing a visual novel with Legend of Zelda (classic) gameplay. But the dialogue is programmed in a way where skipping it isn't fast. It expects you to be here. If you're here to \"play\", you may be here for the wrong reasons.\n\nI you come to Eastward, come to feel it and experience it. Don't come to play it like a free roaming game, come to play it like a story that has something to tell you. If you don't want that, play something else. Eastward isn't for everyone, and it's beautiful for being willing to do that.", "timestamp_created": 1690522228, "timestamp_updated": 1690525732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142786440": {"recommendationid": "142786440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101886413", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1770, "last_played": 1690310950}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game, great story, nice pixel art and an amazing soundtrack to boot.

Is it a great game? No. If there was a better rating system in place then I'll give this game a 6 out of 10. What makes it worthwhile play is the aesthetics; the graphics is phenomenal the little details and the movement is all beautifully presented and on top of that is a great soundtrack. Everything hits those 16 bit era feel just right with a modern twist to everything. \n\nThe story starts of intriguing if a bit slow to start but it builds character sadly that story loses focus midway where it shoe horns some weak story beats that dont quite belong. Then we get to the pay off and its a tad underwhelming and somethings are left un answered for but its also slightly heart warming.\n\nSo the gameplay is very A link to the Past - lite, you have your dungeons and basic functions of a melee weapon. Along the way you are provided with more weapons but they are never really utilised to any satisfying results. Also the attack can be iffy at times, I dislike how you are stationary when executing an attack and on occasions i was unable to hit the target resulting getting injured. The attacks are very basic to a fault and rather slow in comparison the enemy who tend to be a tad faster. Thankfully the game is very forgiving, if you die you are not sent too far back plus encounters are not too difficult.\n\nThe puzzles are on the easy side, very similar to Zelda games and even the chest opening music cues and posing is borrowed from zelda games. I enjoyed the puzzles but nothing too taxing.\n\nNow the games biggest problem is how slow everything moves and that includes the text boxes, which has no way to speed up the dialogues and if you accidentily hit interact with an NPC again u have to sit through the whole ordeal again. And by god there is way too much dialogue, though they are well written it goes on for way longer than nessecary. Even saving the game there is a pointless dialogue box to siv through. At 20 hrs it did feel it did over stay its welcome way before the endgame.\n\nNow why i say i recommend it is because there is huge potential on display here. The game is very similar to Zelda and the story can at times be intriguing and there is heart. I think the graphics and the music alone can draw your attention through to the end but definitely its not a game for everyone.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690130663, "timestamp_updated": 1690130663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142589754": {"recommendationid": "142589754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010355407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1423, "last_played": 1690034158}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite some nice audiovisual aesthetics, this game really outstays its welcome and has terrible pacing. \n\nI went in with an open mind, and found the YA-style writing to be quite pleasant at first.

Give it a shot if you have some spare cash, if you like story, you cant go wrong with this.\n\nFirst, the negatives - The pacing is way off. The start is super slow, and it suddenly ramps up to what it should be. The initial bump is after the first area outside the start, though you will quickly become accustomed to it. \nMost animations, dialogues, and cutscences are not skippable.\nIt can go from feeling very slow to very rushed in terms of story, particularly towards the very end, though I didnt mind this and felt that it added to your momentum and feeling of urgency.\nThe story is a little flat at times, though I will touch on this more in the positives. \n\n\nAnd now the good - \nThe art direction is GORGEOUS, communicating everything from grungy, cramped tunnels to a wide sprawling forest to more... unconventional spaces. Environment design and character art is stunning, just do not expect the most polished product.\nThe story is a little bit of a toss up, though I think its more good than bad. It can be a bit hard to get invested if you want action and plot right off the bad. But the initial section, getting into a day in John and Sams lives, helps greatly with immersion. You can get an idea of what they, particularly John, feels about their situation. Sure, it may fall off a little between the middle and the late game, but the resolution feels immensely moving. Generally, the story is usually engaging if not weirdly paced at times. \n\nOverall - I highly recommend the game. For those who like puzzles, theres plenty, even if they can be tedious.

No block, no dodge, no abilities or strategy, just mash X. What's worse is that all the enemies feel the same, and are way tankier than they need to be. There's not enough depth to the combat mechanics for the enemies to feel different from each other, and the enemies in New Dam City for example take 20 hits each to kill. There isn't any skill or anything to it, you just stand there and swing your weapon 20 times, for every individual enemy. \nWhen you're not fighting repetitive enemies, you're watching weirdly slow cinematics ([b]literally[/b] 3 minutes of the title slowly appearing as you stare at the sky with no way to skip), doing a seemingly endless stream of fetch quests, or reading surprisingly shallow dialogue about nothing particularly interesting or engaging. There was one segment about an NPC [spoiler]falling in love[/spoiler] with the main character, but the main character doesn't talk or even react to anything happening, and this NPC had no character development or backstory. There was no depth to this segment of the story or to either of these characters personalities, so it all just felt awkward. It's like the writer just doesn't quite understand how a bond is formed.\nThe overall story is also lacking, we aren't actively working towards a big end goal, it's like everything we do is just random and unimportant. I know there's something going on with Sam, and there's obviously some story behind the Miasma, which is [spoiler]this black void thing that seems to be consuming the world[/spoiler], but nobody talks about that. Why am i herding pigs, or cooking meals to impress a casino boss while everybody just acts like there isn't anything more important going on right now that we need to deal with? The game is almost all filler without ever getting to the point or tackling anything important.\nVisually, this game is great. The locations are all pretty typical and uninspired, but it's got pretty, well animated pixel art. And Sam is a great character. She is interesting, unique, lovable, and has a story to tell.

However, there\u2019s a few shortcomings in the gameplay department that hold this back from being that slice of timeless indie-game-heaven-pie that we\u2019ve gotten recently with Deaths Door and Unsighted.  \n\nOverall, Eastward is not too dissimilar to the likes of Secret of Mana, Terraenigma or Illusion of Gaia (what I wouldn\u2019t give for a pixel remaster of those last two); a top-down action JRGP with a simple gameplay loop \u2013 you hit a town to talk to some NPCs and solve the odd puzzle to keep the story moving, and then inevitably end up in a Zelda style dungeon with a mix of puzzles (lots of bomb puzzles\u2026) combat and secrets.  \n\nThe best thing about the game is undoubtedly is presentation.  The pixel graphics are absolutely phenomenal, both in design and animation, and the vibrant colours made me feel like I was playing an interactive Studio Ghibli film.  The music, also, is absolutely top-notch, with a soundtrack that combines chiptune and analogue synths that really gets my nostalgia muscles pumping.  I also really enjoyed the games cast of familiar yet lovable characters.  In like manner, the game\u2019s plot, while hitting on A LOT of JRGP tropes, was well-written and worth experiencing, notwithstanding a few pacing issues in the middle.  The boss battles were also a real standout for me \u2013 although none of them were that challenging, they were well-designed and and the best were almost like puzzle battles in Iconoclasts.\n\nThe parts that I felt held Eastward back all come in the gameplay, though.  While the game is clearly doing its best to channel the 16-bit legends of yore, it sometimes feels like it\u2019s a bit too stuck in the past.  While the puzzles are generally very good, the simplistic combat really lets the side down. First, this game really needed a dodge or a block function, and certain enemies will just barrel towards you and there\u2019s little you can do to avoid damage.  And while there\u2019s character switching and multiple weapons, none of it feels like it makes a big enough impact or really changes things up.  This may be due to the lack of much enemy variety and the fact that they never force you to use even half the tools at your disposal.  Its not a deal breaker or anything, but it is noticeable that the combat feels a bit half-baked, especially against the outstanding graphics and sounds. \n\nIn conclusion, I really enjoyed my time with Eastward and found it a journey well worth taking, although you might want to approach with caution if you don\u2019t have an affinity for 16bit RPGS as this is pretty much riding the nostalgia train to the end of the line.  I am interested to see where this dev team go next \u2013 if they can bring the gameplay of their next title up to the same lofty standards and the presentation, we might have a classic on our hands.    \n\nEDIT - i became aware that this game was mainly made by 3 devs, which makes this all the more amazing", "timestamp_created": 1688998568, "timestamp_updated": 1690028579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141701437": {"recommendationid": "141701437", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147028014", "num_games_owned": 2201, "num_reviews": 372, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 646, "last_played": 1688916737}, "language": "english", "review": "Eastward takes you on a whimsical adventure in a post-apocalyptic world. Playing as John and his adopted daughter Sam, you'll explore charming pixel-art landscapes and encounter a cast of lovable characters. The game combines action-adventure gameplay with elements of Zelda and JRPGs.\n\nThe world of Eastward is beautifully designed, with vibrant pixel art and attention to detail. The characters have unique personalities and the animations add a ton of charm. The gameplay involves navigating through dungeons, battling enemies, and solving simple puzzles. John does most of the fighting, while Sam's psychic powers come in handy for both combat and puzzles.\n\nThe main quest takes around 30 hours to complete, but there are additional secrets and side quests to explore. The game also features a roguelike JRPG game-within-the-game called Earth Born, which is optional but enjoyable.\n\nThe standout aspect of Eastward is its world and art style. The pixel art landscapes are creative and filled with life, from bustling cities to serene countryside. The soundtrack, while not standout, complements the visuals well.\n\nThe writing is the game's weakest point, with some clich\u00e9d lines and drawn-out dialogues. However, the overall story is engaging and there are surprises along the way.\n\nThe combat is simple but satisfying, with John's frying pan and Sam's powers adding variety. The puzzles, while not complex, offer some enjoyable challenges. Boss fights are the highlight, requiring strategy and the use of both characters' abilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Eastward is a delightful journey with charming characters, beautiful landscapes, and a well-paced story. The gameplay offers a good mix of combat, puzzles, and mini-games. While it has some minor flaws, the game's strengths make it a worthwhile experience.\n\nFollow My Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44271151/", "timestamp_created": 1688926866, "timestamp_updated": 1689096156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518046557903289795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141683765": {"recommendationid": "141683765", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034962817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1245, "last_played": 1688912128}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una historia muy completa y un pixel art precioso, lo unico que al final del juego se sentia que se alargaba, pero tiene sentido ya que se centra en cerrar todas las lineas de la historia.

The game is heavily inspired by '90s Japanese animation, and it shows through its visually captivating pixel art and atmospheric soundtrack.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game's graphical style is striking. Pixpil has done an incredible job of bringing a dystopian world to life with vibrant pixel art that breathes personality into every corner of the map. The characters, too, are well designed and expressive, each with their unique quirks and characteristics that make them stand out.\n\nGameplay-wise, Eastward offers a variety of puzzles and combat scenarios that require strategic thinking and efficient use of your character's abilities. The alternating control between the two protagonists, John and Sam, provides a nice variation in gameplay, as they each have their distinct skillsets.\n\nThe game's storytelling and world-building are also a standout, offering a rich narrative that draws players into its lore. The dialogue is well-written and sprinkled with humor, helping to foster an emotional connection between the player and the characters.\n\nHowever, Eastward does have some minor drawbacks. The pacing can sometimes feel a bit slow, especially in certain sections where the storyline seems to meander. Combat, although engaging, can also feel slightly repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite these minor issues, Eastward stands out as an engaging, atmospheric, and overall delightful game that offers a nostalgic nod to pixel RPGs of the past while offering something new and unique in its presentation and storytelling. Whether you're a fan of classic RPGs or just appreciate good storytelling and beautiful pixel art, Eastward is a journey worth embarking on.", "timestamp_created": 1688173112, "timestamp_updated": 1688173112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140982223": {"recommendationid": "140982223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084712480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 751, "last_played": 1688141164}, "language": "english", "review": "RRTRFFY", "timestamp_created": 1688140211, "timestamp_updated": 1688140211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140950157": {"recommendationid": "140950157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282989191", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1337, "last_played": 1688100738}, "language": "spanish", "review": "S\u00ed", "timestamp_created": 1688100850, "timestamp_updated": 1688100850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140913651": {"recommendationid": "140913651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198890731844", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 537, "last_played": 1689404821}, "language": "english", "review": "tomato is a fruit, not a vegetable. 3/10 unplayable", "timestamp_created": 1688056557, "timestamp_updated": 1688056640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365047872066497803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140881084": {"recommendationid": "140881084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391471216", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1686390352}, "language": "english", "review": "Eastward is cute and charming as it is mysterious.

When I finished the game I had to ask myself. Did that resolve the feelings that were created in the first hour or so of game play? When in my head I didn't even know the answer, I had to return to basics. I went through the next few areas of the game (no spoilers here) and for every 10 questions generated by a minor plot point, cool world design, or important character moment, MAYBE 3/10 would be answered in any sort of meaningful way. My disappointment in one minor character actually caused me to stop playing for about a week. \nYou might then say, man this guy hates the game. No, no on the contrary, I really really loved it. It has some impressive themes, and makes me FEEL something when I think about it and some of the main characters. While combat isn't difficult per se, it was quite well executed, and I appreciated all the crafted areas in the world. I guess it's BECAUSE I love the characters and the world building so much that I am disappointed in some of the lacking areas of the story. Whether it's entirely dropped plot points, characters with super unsatisfying endings, or the definite paradoxes created by the mere existence of some things in the plot, it makes me ask, why did they make those decisions when crafting the story? However, the world building is so incredible, the music is so gut wrenching and effective, and the characters themselves so powerful, that I can't do anything but recommend this game. In all honesty, I want you to feel the same way I do, I want you to love all that there is to love, and hate all that there is to hate. There aren't that many games like this, regardless of what people might say about game play being similar to other things out there. You'll have to try it out, and love the game, be pissed at it, and listen to the music online. Just like me. \n\nThis game could have used four more chapters MINIMUM, but I'm just happy we got this much. Some people say Eastward 2. I'm not against that, but perhaps I've grown to appreciate the game as is, even with the glaring faults that I genuinely believe exist. There are plot points to finish and things to do in the future's of the characters, but thinking up the epilogue in my head isn't bad either.

But it's not a perfect game, as of June, 17, 2023, only 16.2% player have finished the game. It has flaws but cannot obscure the splendor of the jade.\n\nThe pixel art is utterly beautiful and elegant. Fascinating, I'll put it in this way. From all those places- future city, countryside, cropland field, underground places to grocery stores, pubs, apartment buildings, labs to single rooms, each look different and has its own glamour. The graphic is definitely a highlight, pixel art at its peak, looking fabulous in different times of the day and under various weathers, the light and shadow are executed extremely well.\n\nPlaying this game is like watching a road film. Travel to places, sightseeing, new equipment, get to meet new people and know \u00a0places, chase your goal while helping them, develop friendship and eventually bid goodbyes. You know you won't stay at one place for too long because you don't belong. Many characters are loveable, the lines are short but straight to the point, be it humorous, sarcasm, and give facts - facts so right at some point it hits me, if I've played this game earlier I'll handle some sad moments better. You'll see ups and downs in this game like real life, witness the greatness of love and faith, then accept that even the best of the best can fail.\nThis is life.\n\nPuzzle-solving and battle takes 50% of the game, they get a bit annoying in the last 2 chapters when you have to reach a certain point before time runs out, without a checkpoint. But the rest are pretty okay for me, as puzzles are easy and battles can be avoided except for the bosses, you can cook foods with various ingredients like in Zelda games. The rest 50% is walking sim and dialogues, the dungeons are fun to explore as well as the cities, usually containing multiple smaller maps with some treasures, collect them to get more hearts and part for upgrades.\n\nThe story is not hard to follow, if you pay attention to dialogues you don't need to pay extra to understand. It's good the game does not keep throwing more questions, it gives many hints and explanations along the way, and tells everything at the end, the story unfolds with good path and speed. At the end even I could foresee the end I still cried, for the sadness and a new hope.\n\nWriting here, a quote pops \"If you don't fear life, you should not fear death, as it is just one of them\". \nBut how to face one you love so much yet you still can't save them?\n\n[u] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WelcomeWhyNotGames] My curator page[/url][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1687015629, "timestamp_updated": 1687015629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780769050121307373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140220053": {"recommendationid": "140220053", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079945588", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1698478699}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good game", "timestamp_created": 1687012855, "timestamp_updated": 1687012855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140195348": {"recommendationid": "140195348", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076173172", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1657517962}, "language": "english", "review": "THE GENUINE PAIN I FELT REACHING THE END OF THIS GAME IS AMAZING 10/10 BUT ALSO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADGHHGHGD HJNHCDNJSX god i love this games characters and world building its just amazing", "timestamp_created": 1686976059, "timestamp_updated": 1686976059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491694360971450806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140192101": {"recommendationid": "140192101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181856595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1208, "last_played": 1686969893}, "language": "english", "review": "John is very cool.", "timestamp_created": 1686970213, "timestamp_updated": 1686970213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140158060": {"recommendationid": "140158060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817464690", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1282, "last_played": 1686922585}, "language": "english", "review": "Eastward has gorgeous pixel art, quirky characters, and an engaging premise.

Early on the cameos are kinda neat but by the last few chapters its been beaten to death and I just wanted it to end. Really bad writing, like over all its really bad... it was pretty hard to keep going forward at many many points. The flow doesn't make sense and the ideas are pretty disjointed. \nCombat mechanics are as basic as can be, mob targets player and moves toward them, sometimes with a deley w/e. The AI is crap, you just walk in a circle kinda kiting and shoot it. I used the flamethrower pretty much exclusively which wave clears and kills everything pretty much instantly and or stuns it until its dead. Only mobs at the very end of the game need any other care taken and not much. The combat is few and far between which would only make a difference if it wasn't terribly basic. \n\"Dungeon Puzzles\" assuming you can bring yourself to call them dungeons or puzzles you will find yourself railroaded down a single track just like every other aspect of this game, walking down endless isles of wack a trigger and watch a door open.

It was actually a fairly lengthy game with a really cool pixel art style and an interesting take on a post apocalyptic setting. You play as two characters, *John*, a mute warrior and *Sam*, a girl he found and has been raising. The story follows their travels as they are first exiled from their town and then fight to stay ahead of and possibly defeat the *Miasma*, a death fog that kills everything it touches. Basically.\n\nThe artwork is particularly noteworthy in this game. There is a very real emphasis on hand crafted assets. The level of detail and attention to the use of color and shading makes for a fairly stunning visual experience. Considering how many unique set pieces there are in the game, this is highly impressive.\n\nI enjoyed this game, but it definitely has some misses depending on your preferences as a gamer. \n\nThe combat is fairly representative of top down action RPGs, which works well. The RPG mechanics are centered around upgrading your pack and weapons which can be purchased from vendors with the requisite items/money in your possession; and collecting food and recipes to for buff items, which can be found, cooked, and purchased. Quest progression is mostly linear, and there were only a few quests that were search or map dependent. Fortunately, the map is pretty informative and the levels are pretty straightforward overall. I never got lost.\n\nThe story is very, very dialogue heavy, and this is probably where people will make a determination as to whether they enjoy the game or not. The intro and first chapter also move pretty slowly. However, the pacing increases as you progress. The character development, both protagonists and NPCs, is quite well done. Similarly, the story is well thought out. It takes some queues from anime, which I guess is also the source material, but it never becomes too surreal and the ending makes sense.\n\nThe final chapters rely heavily on a time loop mechanic, which was fine and contextually sound for the story, but also probably the weakest part of the game, and the time loop puzzles were definitely bordering on annoying.\n\nMy total playtime was just under 26 hours. It's a game that is easy to recommend, but with caveats as mentioned above. Solid chance you'll enjoy it, but I could also understand if a person didn't find it to be their thing. It is perfectly Steam Deck compatible, which is always nice to see.\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

The world is incredibly detailed, with multiple areas in each of the five main locations that all seem very thought-through and cohesive. These locations are also filled with an almost overwhelming amount of npcs, all of which can be talked to. Most of the npcs have dialog that changes according to the events of the game which gives the sense that they all have little stories you can piece together. Some of them also have side quests that can be accomplished. I really enjoyed all of the npc interactions, but if you're not someone who wants to poke around and learn every detail of a world they can be very irritating. The dialog often is very long and unskippable. There were many times that I accidentally talked to someone I'd already spoken with and had to sit through a minute worth of dialog I'd already read. The pacing of the game is also an issue. The game is very very slow, with many of the main questlines requiring you to sit through a lot of unnecessary cutscenes that don't add anything at all to the story and are sometimes just plain boring. One of the main chapters of the game feels more like a movie where you back and forth between scenes than a game. The combat is also amazing in some ways and awful in others. The core mechanic, which is having two characters and switching between them, works very well both in the combat and the puzzle areas. There are new mechanics introduced through the game that kept this part of the game feeling interesting and novel. However, I played with the keyboard controls and I had a lot of issues. It's impossible to disable the mouse and just use the keyboard, so the only way to aim is to use the mouse. I ended up trying to position the mouse in a specific corner of my screen and then running around trying to keep the enemies to that side of the characters, but I almost stopped playing at the first dungeon because of this. Finally, the story and lore are in my opinion the place where this game excels, and also the greatest flaw. (Very very mild spoilers ahead) The game is constantly providing small details that slowly build up the lore so that it feels like you are personally uncovering an incredible mystery. The whole game seems to be building up to a really really interesting finale where you will finally understand how all of these puzzle pieces fit together. Characters are introduced, and then introduced again, and then cryptic details about their past come to light, and it feels interesting and exciting. The game is intentionally giving you questions about the world and about the characters, and for me, the drive to learn the answers to these questions was the whole reason I continued playing the game. But then at the end of the story, literally nothing is explained. More questions are introduced right up until the end of the game (why a train? why monkeys? why is this character appearing again? Where did that character come from? what happened to that other area? what is the relationship between these two characters? why do these people know your name? how did you get to point a from point b?) but the answers to these questions just don't exist at all. I found the end of this story to be a complete disappointment because of this. I think someone who likes interesting puzzle mechanics will really enjoy parts of this game, but not others. I think someone who really enjoys story-based games will like parts of this game, but not others. I'm not sure if people who like combat will get much out of this game, although I enjoyed the combat since it seems pretty much the same throughout the game. Basically, I'm really not sure who this game is for.", "timestamp_created": 1685996607, "timestamp_updated": 1685996607, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693604767322540283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139569253": {"recommendationid": "139569253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071392844", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1608, "last_played": 1667976755}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2611 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ?

Honestly i finished the game a couple of hours ago and i didn't know how to to express about this game\n\nIMO the soundtrack is one of the best things about this game. I got chills from the beginning to the end of this game. Every zone has its own soundtrack and atmosphere and the the devs did a great job putting everything together\n\nThe graphics is gorgeous and gameplay is great. John has three weapons and a godly pan with spam or charge attacks until you have to parry , do not confuse him with Yohn, Johnny or John (the dog). Sam is more of a supporting character with stuns, shield and hearts recovery.\nMostly this game consists of dungeons and puzzles. I liked a lot exploring for secret chests, even tho i tried to look for them i ended up with 83 out of 102 which is a bit disappointed cuz i wanted the achievement. The story was very good with a few quirks,i don't wanna to spoil anything but [spoiler] but Once Upon a Time in Monkollywood it was just fing bad, like out of nowhere u got in a train with a buch of monkeys making movies and they arent related to the main story,  the only reason they are there is because u need that rocket so u can reach Ester City [/spoiler] \noh and there's a second game Earth born, i haven't played to much since caught up in the main story\n\ni'm planning to play it again so i can complete all achievements \nafter i finished the main story with no rushing enjoying the game, atmosphere, soundtrack, characters exploring as much as possible, this game become one of my favourite games.

Over the course of five hours I'd say there were a total of 6 sections where the game actually allows you to do more than loot random crates and talk to people.Each of these are roughly 15 minutes of awful puzzles designed for room temp IQ morons, and enemies that you'd have to try to die to. \n\nThe game could use more lootable crates to distract me from the lack of things to do, since I searched and found a total of 14 or so boxes to loot over the course of five hours. Switching between characters is fun, but it is almost entirely unnecessary apart from solving puzzles. Cooking is nice, but the game is far too easy for you to need to eat all that often and basically boils down to: Choose ingredients, play the slot machine, and enjoy the cooking music. Didn't play that much of the RPG within the game but from what I did, it was okay. Intentionally awful writing and easy gameplay. There are far too many puzzles with not enough mechanical depth to really challenge players, but they are a nice break from the dialogue.\n\nCombat:\nI genuinely liked the first ten minutes of combat. The simple enemies, lack of threat or complexity, and general clunkiness were tolerable. However, it quickly dawned on me that there was nothing to the combat beyond spamming the light attack to stunlock enemies. The heavy attack is a botched idea, since it requires you to first throw a light attack and then hold down the button to perform. There were a total of three \"bosses\", which to be honest I liked quite a bit. The first two are pretty fun, but the third one is just kinda there and gone. They ranged from pitifully easy to mechanically frustating, but it was at least something to do other than listen to people tell me what random minigame I'd be doing that day.\n\nStory:\nThe plot of this game is unironically brilliant, 10/10. Things just seem to happen with little rhyme or reason, characters come and go, and it is simultaneously rushed and far too slow. Most of the time you're just running around doing random things for people until the plot decides to actually happen for little to no reason.\n\nYou're constantly being interrupted so that you can listen to entirely unrelated people talk about things that have no bearing on the actual plot. Chapter 2 is the worst example I've encountered thus far with a whole scene of character growth for a character we just met, someone who will die two scenes later off-screen. \n\nThe game tries to make me care about the second town so it can set up a tragic backstory, but it seems like John and I are in agreement in not giving a flying fuck about it. On that note, John being a silent protagonist that literally ignores the obviously marked for death love interest was pretty kino, and I found that to be pretty funny. Though I doubt that was intentional in the slightest. Most characters are soulless beyond being \"Oh So Quirky\", and completely one note.\n\nSam is awful, just awful. She is the designated mouthpiece for John since he refuses to engage with the bullshit of others. As a result, most of the abhorrent dialogue comes from her or is instigated by her, and I just can't forgive that. Other than that she's generically childlike in all the worst ways.\n\nTLDR;\nShallow gameplay, awful story, and barely even a game at all.", "timestamp_created": 1685755663, "timestamp_updated": 1685949100, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416710495948791504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139397217": {"recommendationid": "139397217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329652723", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1631866665}, "language": "english", "review": "UPDATE VIETNAMESE PLZ??????????????????????", "timestamp_created": 1685662647, "timestamp_updated": 1685662647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454357713460922241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139382232": {"recommendationid": "139382232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338475194", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1697141922}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful art , music and story so far. nice combat style and puzzles, not too difficult. good game.", "timestamp_created": 1685641303, "timestamp_updated": 1685641303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139381964": {"recommendationid": "139381964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025209314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1685736319}, "language": "english", "review": "stardew valley + lone wolf and cub + earthbound +  dystopia = its pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1685640958, "timestamp_updated": 1685640958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139371101": {"recommendationid": "139371101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017789280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1700537355}, "language": "english", "review": "Super charming Zelda clone", "timestamp_created": 1685627146, "timestamp_updated": 1685627160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139352571": {"recommendationid": "139352571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354438516", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1685676773}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing world and characters very very fun", "timestamp_created": 1685590795, "timestamp_updated": 1685590795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139333154": {"recommendationid": "139333154", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966362365", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1794, "last_played": 1685558590}, "language": "english", "review": "A long and beautiful pixel art game.

Needless to say this doesn't happen often, but Eastward was the exception.\n\nNow of course what one person can love another can hate so I'll give a bit more detail on what this game is about and what it isn't about so you can guess if you'll enjoy it.\n\nSome people might see a couple of action shots in the trailer and think this is a combat-focused action RPG and they are gonna be disappointed. The game is primarily narrative-based. The storytelling is it's strongest part. Beautiful scenery, lovable characters, hart-warming story, etc. If you played games like Final Fantasy 9 or Chrono Trigger you know what you can expect in terms of world building and storytelling. The game took me a lot of time because I kept coming back to talk to everyone after every quest to see if they had some new dialogue options. If you are the kind of person who goes \"skip, skip, skip\" then I'd recommend you \"skip\" the whole game and play something else.\n\nNow what about the gameplay? It consists mostly of dungeons or designated combat-enabled areas where you fight monsters, solve puzzles, encounter bosses plus a couple mini-games from time to time. While the combat becomes harder and the puzzles more complex in the last hour or so of gameplay, don't expect a Dark Souls. You'll probably be able to beat most bosses the first time which is perfect for this game. Since having to try 20 times to defeat the same boss would completely destroy the narrative pacing. You can avoid cooking food if you want to increase the difficulty a bit. \nNow that doesn't mean the combat/puzzle sections feel like a chore. I've found them to be just long enough to be really enjoyable and they contribute to pushing the story forward.\n\nI really cool detail though is that you can play a game within the game. You can find consoles where you can play a traditional turn-based RPG, together with Amiibo-like gacha. It is a pretty cool short game you can play between quests and it's not just some random game, it's actually [ SPOILERS ]\n\nSo that's basically it. If you had the patience to read all the way through here without going \"tl;dr\" after the first paragraph then you probably will love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1685045297, "timestamp_updated": 1685045297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 152, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925873935222625732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138946182": {"recommendationid": "138946182", "author": {"steamid": "76561199156227495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1012, "last_played": 1676786165}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really cute and I love it :3", "timestamp_created": 1684989872, "timestamp_updated": 1684989872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473684221506118774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138901291": {"recommendationid": "138901291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387003136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1465, "last_played": 1681791421}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing 2d game.

XD \n\nThere are nice amounts of collectables in the game, although some will only be money, others will be important upgrade pieces or more health, honestly it's nice to see a game dev make treasure actually useful rather than the typical here's another useless item you can maybe sell for money you already have too much of kind of thing dood.\n\nThere is a mini game you can play along with the main game, it's an old school RPG style game, I didn't bother with it because I was too enamoured with the main game but I did play it and it seems like it's decently in depth, outside you have a gachapon that gives you figures, these give you in mini-game items that will help you progress, the game plays like a typical RPG game, turn based, skills, items used, you can recruit certain members, certain enemies and bosses are icons on the map, saving sucks because it doesn't tell you how to, I think it's the night and day cycle which would have been nice to know before I quit and lost my boss progress which put me off doing more, the gacha's are different in each gachapon machine too, it's decently in depth from what I can tell but just not what I was wanting to play around with personally dood.\n\nThere's also a cooking mechanic in the game, you get a variety of items you can use to make various meals that come with some nice effects, my favourite of which being overhealth but you can also get more damage, defence and two other effects, there are quite a lot of recipes at that too, some most certainly better than others, it's a great excuse to actually use money along with buying upgrades and such dood.\n\nAnything to improve? That's a difficult one, for what the game is in itself it does it all right, outside of adding more stuff in general I can't think of any-no wait there is one thing, an area with all the gachapon machines would have been nice, not for me granted but for other players who want to play the mini-game it would have been a mighty boon for a myriad of reasons, otherwise yeah I'm coming up blank on any actual in game problems, they did a great job with the game dood.\n\nOverall? I can't see any reason not to like this game a whole darn lot if not love it, it's got a charm to it, a fun set of characters, an interesting story, it's just right out fun to play and creative, it's decently long too considering I have 24 hours on record and I didn't really touch that mini-game all that much, you really get invested especially in the later chapters, I'd love to see more games with this much heart and soul put into it as these days games feel quite shallow so to speak both in terms of gameplay and story, who needs AAA when you got games like these though I say! I wish the devs well and thank them for a great game and I thank you for reading this all, I hope it helps you decide on whether to buy Eastward or not and that you enjoy it if you do dood. ^-^", "timestamp_created": 1684403229, "timestamp_updated": 1684403229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679910421371459961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138356512": {"recommendationid": "138356512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198987002899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2726, "last_played": 1690930208}, "language": "english", "review": "NICE!", "timestamp_created": 1684187078, "timestamp_updated": 1684187078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138317194": {"recommendationid": "138317194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063624248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1389, "last_played": 1684538921}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story.

It's definitely a slow burner and for a person like me who doesn't usually get too much into RPG's and interacting with characters, it's deepness was daunting and a bit boring at times. But I feel like that's due to my own preferences and not the game's fault, since dialogue is wonderfully written and the characters are all unique, both in writing and design.\n\nI am a really big fan of the graphics. Anything pixel related and you got me looking. But with the added lighting effects and the motion of the environment and characters, this was a 10/10 in that department. Don't even get me started on variety. Absolutely wonderful, each environment had its own personality and felt lived-in. All effects including water, fog and others were also expertly done. It blended the style of pixel graphics with a refined shader and lighting system that just felt very nice to explore.\n\nGameplay is accessible, meaning I did not find it challenging in the slightest, but almost all boss fights were extremely engaging. It is a forgiving game, so I would recommend it even if you have 0 experience playing games. I would have liked a bit more challenge and Chapter 8 was definitely a highlight. The regular gameplay loop of exploration and beat-em-up style combat was also very interesting, but a bit repetitive at times. The combat doesn't have a lot of depth to it and you can cheese it very easily, but it was nonetheless fun and enemy types were varied.\n\nThe story was very engaging and had a nice rhythm to it. It honestly depends on how you play the game and how much exploring you want to do. At first, mostly due to the achievement popping up, I tried talking with everyone all the time. Although well written, it didn't fit my pacing preference, so I went for a half and half approach. I explored up until the point where I felt I had enough and the game did not disappoint. The writing was also subtle and not too much on the nose. I can compare it to a Pixar or Disney movie, where the basic narrative is there, but you can also read between the lines to get some extra details along the way.\n\nAll and all, it's a solid 4/5 and if you are a fan of 2D Pixel Graphic Action Adventure RPG's with an engaging story, you have to try it!", "timestamp_created": 1681993621, "timestamp_updated": 1681993621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136999467": {"recommendationid": "136999467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312293849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2069, "last_played": 1687769615}, "language": "spanish", "review": "definitivamente es un viaje", "timestamp_created": 1681990827, "timestamp_updated": 1681990827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136988668": {"recommendationid": "136988668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860079584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1520, "last_played": 1681884683}, "language": "english", "review": "Personally I loved this game up until the ending.

En cada cap\u00edtulo, sobretodo m\u00e1s adelante en el juego, puede observarse que cada rinconcito de civilizaci\u00f3n del juego tiene vida propia, los npcs tienen sus rutinas varias del d\u00eda a d\u00eda, discuten, se divierten o simplemente est\u00e1n pasando el rato en su lugar preferido. Esto es algo que puede pasar desapercibido para aquellos que solo le importe la historia principal pero he de decir que ver el juego en su totalidad y hablar con todos los personajes que me he ido encontrando ha hecho que tanto el ambiente como la historia de Eastward sean mucho m\u00e1s enriquecedores. [spoiler] \u00bfQui\u00e9n m\u00e1s hizo que la chica de Ester City decidiese casarse con su profesor solo por estar nosotros cotilleando? [/spoiler]\n\n2. Nunca pens\u00e9 que dir\u00eda esto pero el minijuego de \"Earth Born\" me ha hecho olvidar a veces incluso que el juego que estaba jugando realmente era Eastward y no un rpg retro, entender m\u00e1s de este minijuego te lleva a comprender mucho del humor de Eastward y sobretodo toma un papel muy importante al final del juego.\n\n3. Hablando del humor en el juego este es algo que te alegra por lo tonto que es o te saca una sonrisa con las chiquilladas de Sam pero Eastward no se olvida de la historia que est\u00e1 contado en nig\u00fan momento y el juego est\u00e1 plagado de historias que despertar\u00e1n diversas emociones tanto buenas como malas pero sobretodo algunas bastante complejas que dan que pensar. Esto hace que conectes m\u00e1s con la historia, con como se sienten los personajes e intentes entender las decisiones que toman algunos de ellos. [spoiler] El personaje de Isabel me dej\u00f3 pensando sobre si lo que hab\u00eda hecho era un acto de locura por la p\u00e9rdida o m\u00e1s bien de amor por Alva, en cualquier caso nunca pens\u00e9 que desarrollar\u00edan tanto al personaje y me llev\u00e9 una grata sorpresa. [/spoiler]\n\n[b] Lo \"malo\" : [/b] \n1. Es un juego que empieza de manera lenta, la trama va desenvolvi\u00e9ndose a lo largo de los 8 cap\u00edtulos que tiene y muchas veces te sientes algo perdido ya que no hay realmente un villano como tal en el juego y seguir atento en la trama puede hacerse cuesta arriba. [spoiler] ( algunos dir\u00e1n que Solomon es el villano o incluso que la verdadera villana es Mother pero para m\u00ed ambos fallan en este papel, haciendo que estos personajes me parezcan m\u00e1s complejos de lo que podr\u00eda verse a primera vista, generando una especie de empat\u00eda por lo que luchan que me impide verles como villanos de la historia) [/spoiler]\n\n2. El sistema de combate es relativamente sencillo con varias armas con las que crear tu propia mec\u00e1nica de combate aunque al principio del juego puede parecer excesivamente simple y aburrido para aquellos que quieran pararse a conseguir algo de sal ( la moneda del juego ) con la que comprar mejoras de la mochila y armas. \n\nEsto es todo lo que puedo decir sobre Eastward y la verdad es que me alegro de haberme propuesto terminar el juego como es debido ya que sino me hubiese perdido una verdadera joya <3", "timestamp_created": 1681679303, "timestamp_updated": 1681679303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611032545566558838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136785538": {"recommendationid": "136785538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035794187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1264, "last_played": 1681624436}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I thought that I found a diamond in the rough. The opening cinematic was incredible, the art style looked painstakingly hand crafted, and the characters were all visually distinct from one another. But as I poured hour after hour in this game, my cheery optimism gave way to confusion which gave way to pure hatred. I will try to keep this spoiler free.\n\nStarting with what many seem to think is the biggest flaw of the game: the characters will not stop talking. While I don't think this is what outright killed the game for me, it does contribute to the issue that did. If you are planning to play this, the first thing you should absolutely do is turn dialog speed to high. Even the most mundane events will have entire Greek novels of text to wade through before you are able to play again. There is no skip cut scene button so get ready to click X for 30 minutes while the NPC you decided to talk to runs their mouth off about nothing of interest.\n\nThe game play itself is also nothing to write home about. Combat boils down to swinging your frying pan at the foe until it dies or, if it has quite a bit of health, stun it and then hit it to death. Better equipment and abilities don't change up play style at all either. They just have better range or do more damage. Puzzles are also bland and uninspired that just consist of splitting up John and Sam or hitting a bomb across a gap. I never felt challenged by many of the bosses either because whatever damage they did to me I just ate a meal and was back to full health. Some of the later bosses do get a bit harder, but it feels too little too late.\n\nMany little gripes pile up as well. When you try to dodge an attack, Sam who is trailing behind you always takes damage. The Earth Born mini-game that is constantly mentioned to be one of the best video games in the world of Eastward is some of the worst turn based combat I've ever played. You get a bunch of salt (Eastward's currency) whenever you kill enemies but never have a reason to spend it on anything other than more inventory so it just piles up once you have maxed it. The music is alright, but the same songs get played over and over (this one song that plays at heartfelt moments was played something around 30 times in total).\n\nAll of these are bad, but what killed the game for me was the story. I wouldn't mind if characters talked nonstop if the entire story between the beginning and end wasn't filler. Entire plot lines and chapters are focused on people who do nothing once they are off screen. It feels like the story is a continual stream of consciousness on what a story should be. This happens and THEN this happens and THEN this happens without building on any characters. What the story should be is this happens THEREFORE this happens THEREFORE this happens.

I was a big fan of Undertale at the time and loved it's art style so Eastward seemed PERFECT! Although after looking through the reviews a lot of people said the frames on switch were pretty awful, so I decided not to buy the game. Move on to 2023 and I now have a Steam Deck, and while on the store found Eastward again. I was unsure at first if I should get it, some reviews said they got bored halfway through or the game was generally not fun, but one thing was for sure, the art style was incredible and that was the reason why I'm now sitting on 7.5 hours playtime after having got the game yesterday... And that's how and why I got Eastward.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nOk, this game is simply the best pixel art game I have ever played and may ever play. The story, the characters, the puzzles, the fights, the monsters, the graphics, all simply blew me away. This game had me obsessed within the first 10 minutes and that does not often happen. I just want to say do not listen to the reviews that say that this game is boring or too easy or maybe even not fun at all, I guarantee that If you like pixel art, adventure games, and/or Undertale... you will LOVE Eastward.\n\nSo what are you waiting for...\n\nGET IT!!", "timestamp_created": 1681163869, "timestamp_updated": 1681163869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136485095": {"recommendationid": "136485095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240163422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1776, "last_played": 1664027227}, "language": "english", "review": "Very captivating game!

The game's pixel art is incredibly detailed and vibrant, and the animations are smooth and fluid. The soundtrack is equally impressive, featuring a mix of atmospheric and upbeat tunes that perfectly complement the game's visual style.\n\nGameplay in Eastward is a mix of puzzle-solving, exploration, and combat. Players control both Sam and John as they travel through a variety of environments, each with its own unique challenges and obstacles. The puzzles are clever and challenging, and the combat is fast-paced and satisfying.\n\nOne of the standout features of Eastward is its storytelling. The game's world is richly detailed, and the characters are all well-developed and memorable. The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the story is both heartwarming and melancholic, with plenty of surprises and emotional moments.\n\nOverall, Eastward is an incredible game that is well worth playing.

The story is the main winner here, it\u2019s a (very strict) linear game, and that can be a good and a bad thing. It\u2019s a great thing if you are looking to enjoy a story and find a secret or two along the way. It\u2019s a bad thing when you want to complete the game 100% as it is extremely easy to miss stuff and get locked from areas because you forgot to check every corner after every stage of every single quest just in case you can now go there and have all the necessary tools. If you don\u2019t, you will probably miss out on a lot of stuff \u2013 including abilities for the main character ?! \n\nI enjoyed the story; it was a great ride, and the ending \u2013 spoiled only by the unresponsive controls and sluggish character movement \u2013 was phenomenal. Yes, the combat is a weird thing in this game; it\u2019s very easy in all but the final stage of the game, where the sluggishness and unresponsiveness become sadly apparent as you must act quickly and precisely. Overall, I say I enjoyed the game and were I not locked out from areas I knew I missed but just could not get to because some guard told me to\u2026.

I do not agree.\n\nThe wide array of 'everyday' monsters seen on maps (which change based on which area of the world/map you're in) have different attack styles: ranged, charge and jump away, not getting knocked back when you hit them, exploding on death, shooting bombs, spawning smaller monsters, attacking only when you turn away, mimicking objects, etc. And all their designs are unique, which makes it enjoyable just to observe them from a distance while you figure out how they're gonna come at you. If you get more than one type of monster coming at you, it compounds the difficultly. I do concede that once you learn monster's attack styles it's easier to take them down, but I still couldn't consistently avoid taking damage if I engaged with them, even while traversing maps I'd been in before.\n\nAll the characters are engaging, not just main ones. Like the guy [spoiler] with antlers in Potcrock Isle [/spoiler] who serves no purpose other than making comments that show he definitely has a crush on John. Some supporting characters could be predictable in terms of the building blocks of their personalities, but I found it necessary to the course of the story as opposed to unoriginal or annoying. Also, essentially every time a plot event happens all the NPCs have something new to say.\n\nThe basis of the major boss battles is 'attack until they falter, strike, rinse, repeat,' but since the nature of how to weaken each boss (whether to use Sam or John, which weapon of theirs to utilize) changes, I didn't find it boring.\n\nUsing cooking to make meals instead of having to buy basic, boring, pre-made food/potions was really fun for me, too. I enjoyed collecting all the ingredients and deciding which meal's buffs I liked best. Also, every food (and item) in the game has an amusing/fun/interesting description that makes the experience more unique.\n\nI think when getting this game it's important to know the plot, characters, and world are the bigger part of the game (i.e. more than 50% of the game is focused on those as opposed to battling). If you're someone who enjoys storytelling through experiencing the world, I think you'd like this! Go around and talk to everyone, seriously! And yes, I did get emotional over the ending. Definitely recommend.\n\nSidenote: only the main story goals show up in your quest log.

The Repetitive Level Designs reminiscent of platformers\n2. The Linear Storyline\n3. The Overall Difficulty\n\n1. In every section of the game, there will be places where you're in a town, able to talk to residents, and all that, and there was a fair bit of worldbuilding and excitement for the idea of being in an underground village in an abandoned subway. But when you get to the levels inbetween these places, the story is replaced with fast placed hack and slashing, as well as the occasional puzzle and platorming obstacle course. This aspect of the game was a real chore, and detracted from my enjoyment of the game, and upon viewing how much harder the game gets as you pass the level I was on, it just gets even harder, and I was playing on the supposed casual mode, so I was very frustrated. And The Save bot was always preaching to me, and that got very tedious too, like shut up, I'm trying to save here, I don't need to be hear it. All in All, there could've been better deigned transitional levels, it felt less like an open world exploration of a big new world, to being a survival game, mixed with a platformer in 2d, which I wasn't a big fan of.\n\n2. The Linear Storyline locked your path in place, you followed one path, no room to move around and explore. When watching ads and seeing the early artwork on the web places, It looked absolutely excellent, I wanted to see more of the world, and not just slash more enemies, but the path of the game, guided me in only one direction, when I wanted to go in ten. The Developers really missed the boat on this aspect of the game, and they ought to make up for it, buliding an open world rpg in 2d, because with these graphics and mechanics, it would totally work, and I would enjoy playing such a game, in a casual easy mode throughout the game. Multiple Endings, depending on your choices, the story felt more like a generic rpg with sci-fi elements, which could've worked, but all of the game's focus was on the girl, which was very disappointing, because it felt like the whole game was about her, not the cool rugged dude with the beard going on a quest, leaving the safety of the abandoned subways. The game probably would've been way more fun to play if this was about the guy, who's character was far more intriguing and developed, as opposed to the rude little girl that the game insists you're supposed to love and feel bad for, and that's sad to me.

According to the devs its 30 hours long (it took me 24 hours with like 3 being on a mini game that is more fun than the game itself) which you would mostly spend talking with NPCs, putting bombs to solve easy puzzles and talking to more NPCs for the first 10 hours of the game.\n\nThen after it you would unlock the other mechanic of the game which would add another button to your current putting bomb button. Repeat this for another 10 hours.\n\nWhile doing this you also get to read the story which, on a basic level, it has a lot of potential with an interesting setting and lore behind but that it crashes by the awful pacing and obvious lack of direction cause at the end of the day, the devs didnt know what to do with their characters.\n\nThere are, in my opinion, 6 prominent characters in this game, that you get to know during it just so at the end most of them end up doing nothing. It's a great disrepect for probably one of the 3 interesting aspects of the game.\n\nSpeaking of characters, this game could theorically have a rock or a box as the main character and i dont think it would change anything. So much shit happening in this world and in front of his eyes and he doesn't react or act to almost anything. It also doesn't help that his sprite makes him look like the most boring and uninterested person ever.\n\nThen, after 20 hours of slog, you reach the final 2 chapters, which are filled with interesting concepts not only story wise but gameplay wise and you are wondering why wasn't the game cut 10 hours so you could just play this sections earlier.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, thats the real curprit i mentioned earlier: this game is too big. Too big of a story that wasn't developed well enough. Too big of a game that was basically empty from mechanics up to the last 2 hours.\n\nAnd too big of a disappointment, cause when you really think about the good parts, you can only think what this game could have been if it wasn't trying to be what it isnt.", "timestamp_created": 1675319123, "timestamp_updated": 1675878164, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695068478584289551", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132036666": {"recommendationid": "132036666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386305919", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1925, "last_played": 1675302714}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is much longer than I thought it would be.

It's kinda simple, the zelda-esque dungeon sequences are pretty fun but very easy, the combat is very button-mashy. The game is VERY heavy on cutscenes and dialogue(at least for me, I read it's Earthbound-inspired so if you like that game then the cutscenes won't bother you). \n\nBut in spite of all these things, which could potentially be described as flaws, this game has a real heart to it. There's just a weird flow of energy through it which is really engaging. Even the characters are rather typical, but they carry the story really well. \n\nAnd the real prize goes to the artists. The sprite work is probably some of the best I've seen, the feel of environments is great, the way they use light and colour combined to create real vibes and feelings of dark caves, bright cities, narrow alleyways. Warm lit torches against cool cave colours. It's really, really effective, it really draws your eye without being distracting. It's the perfect garnish. Really, really beautiful stuff. \n\nSo if that sounds like something you'd like then have at it! The game was really enjoyable. I played it on the Steam Deck and it worked really well, save for some weird phantom button presses in menus - it was like it had switched to default ON rather than default OFF.

I've always liked pixel graphics in games.

I was literally mesmerized by the scenery of the game and oh God how good they are.\nThe story is also important in the game. The plot is very original and immediately introduces you to the course of events with the help of the trailer. The way the story moves, the chapters passed did not leave me indifferent. The game tells and reveals its cards slowly during the game and because of this it begins to seem that plot is developing for a long time. \n\nMusic always adds charm and style to your playing. It is the music that shows us the most intense and calm situations in the game. There are problems with the music. And it's not even about quality, the soundtracks in the game are really good and many of them will be remembered by you. I even added a couple to my spotify. It's more of a lack of them. Many tracks are constantly repeated in the game, especially there were moments when this or certain music did not particularly fit the situation in the game, which created a slight dissonance.\n I was very pleased with the great variety of things during the game. In addition to battles and constant walking around the city, there are cool mini-games. The game tries to keep a balance between battles and quiet moments so as not to get tired of one or the other. Uncomplicated pumping, everything is simple and clear, I would add. And of course how without stuffy levels. Some locations were passed for me with great pleasure, while others just wanted to quickly finish and dump. Well, that's my subjective opinion.\n\nMy verdict: Despite some objective disadvantages in the game, I still want to forgive them, because the game is actually very good.

After beating the game in January of 2023, I\u2019m proud of what it offered me each time I played it. The art style inside and outside the game is fun and comforting, adding flair and detail to character and setting designs. John and Sam are a delight to play, and I never questioned why John was mute because it never became a clear-cut issue. Every character John and Sam meet has neat quirks because you spend entire chapters alongside them. That\u2019s without mentioning the dark and foreboding MIASMA enveloping everything the game\u2019s setting contains. The empty black space adds tension to each chapter after exploring the game\u2019s world and NPCs. The game\u2019s antagonist, Mother, drives many of the game\u2019s bosses to try and stop you, culminating with Mother fighting John as the final boss.\n\nAs for Eastward\u2019s combat and puzzles, some feel too difficult, whereas others feel too easy. The inconsistency varies depending on the player\u2019s abilities, both with a controller or keyboard and Sam and John\u2019s abilities and weapons. The combat mechanics uses John\u2019s arsenal of a frying pan, a gun, a flamethrower, a cog shooter, and three types of bombs to deal damage and Sam\u2019s small but vital arsenal of telepathy to stop enemies and activate other puzzle elements. However, the puzzles and bosses add a challenge regardless of skill level. It\u2019s especially the case towards the end of the game, bar the final boss if you stock up on food beforehand. There are also a few mini-games to add to the game\u2019s experience. Firstly, it has Earth Born, an entire JRPG inside the game. Secondly, there\u2019s cooking, done via a combination of ingredients, which changes the recipe, and slots, which boosts the health given by the food. It gets a bit tedious after 20+ hours of making more food, but it\u2019s a quaint negative to the experience.\n\nHowever, Eastward could have been so much bolder than it is. Its focus on the MIASMA and Mother could be more present than it was, especially in the first couple chapters. The dynamic between Isabel and Alva could have the same treatment, as their relationship hints at being more romantic, but the game never goes further. The game has more potential than it offers, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a waste. I hope the developers have a second crack at something similar to their first outing because streamlining aspects of the story will heighten the experience and create a beautiful adventure. Not everyone will love this game as I do, but that\u2019s a pitfall I\u2019m willing to live with for a story filled with companionship and the determination to deny the end of the world.", "timestamp_created": 1673050191, "timestamp_updated": 1673050191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130293772": {"recommendationid": "130293772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081576799", "num_games_owned": 1181, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1645574308}, "language": "english", "review": "pixel art is gorgeous but theres barely any gameplay and the story is unbearably boring", "timestamp_created": 1673035145, "timestamp_updated": 1673035145, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130243384": {"recommendationid": "130243384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968519797", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1468, "last_played": 1672975555}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of what I'm going to say has already been said by other reviewers.

If you haven't gotten at least half-way through the game, don't read the spoiler-hidden sections.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, and the character design is generally impressive. I do have problems with some characters/plot points being coded as romantic interests through certain... design choices, but that is a personal preference and by no means a universal complaint (though, I will say, it makes the game less child-friendly than might be guessed at a first glance). There is a strong argument to be made for including discussions of sexuality in games - and I do not want to sound prudish - but at some points it seemed gratuitous. [spoiler] I'm looking at you, Alva steam bath scene, Alva naked spirit visiting Izzy scene, \"Morning Glory\" vending machine, and sex robots at Coin Palace (which a kid is interested in???) [/spoiler] Again, that is likely just a personal, rather than an objective, complaint.\n\nIn terms of the story, I didn't feel like it [b] brought [/b] me anywhere. The stakes seemed highest in the earlier parts of the game, and the consequences of the protagonists' inability to act are felt very early on. However, past that point, the trauma is rarely referenced apart from dream sequences and the occasional sentence or two. [spoiler] For instance, Sam's amnesia after the Miasma attacked Greenberg seemed largely unnecessary beyond giving some justification for Sam remaining chippy after a truly world-shattering event. Jasper is the only character who really communicated the depths of trauma associated with losing loved ones to the Miasma, but he is quickly put back into his comedic role without any more references to any struggles he might be having with readjustment. [/spoiler] There are cute moments, but these become mired down in unnecessary fetch [spoiler] or deliver [/spoiler] quests for a plot which meanders itself gradually towards its conclusion. That is to say, I'm not sure the game effectively balanced the equal realities of life's everyday beauty and the emotional weight of living in a post-apocalyptic [spoiler] and pre-apocalyptic, too, I guess? [/spoiler] world, always on the run.\n\nThe music is [b] beautiful [/b] , and I did find myself humming along with it quite happily... for the first few chapters. However, the motifs become predictable and grating after ten hours of game play. Rather than allowing the player to come to their own nuanced evaluations of just how \"happy\" or \"sad\" or \"tense\" a scripted moment is, the game took four-ish dominant themes and superimposed them on dialogue to code the dominant emotion. [spoiler] I am also disappointed that, for the most part, the \"Arrogant\" song i.e. what plays for the Mayor of Potcrock, for the New Dam City goons, and for other characters, usually corresponds with fatter characters. It works with the Mayor - but then it seems as though most every fat character that is in any way intimidating or antagonistic gets associated with that theme. I would have liked to see some variety. [/spoiler] I would be remiss, however, if I didn't mention that there are some absolute gems of musical composition in this game which do make the game feel alive and really drew me in. [spoiler] Like the theme in Charon, for instance. That song is a banger. [/spoiler]\n\nThe game controls well, and has a wide breadth of puzzle content. I actually appreciate the simple combat, and the puzzles were generally engaging enough to keep me interested. There is one section which really frustrated me, [spoiler] the stealth section in Monkollywood ... come to think of it, most of Monkollywood in general, to be honest [/spoiler] but it was short, and so I can't really complain about it too much. With so much variety in terms of puzzle mechanics, tools at the player's disposal, and all of the possible permutations between scenarios, environments, and the weapons, not every single puzzle or section will be everyone's cup of tea; but there is enough to go around for most everyone.\n\nThe inclusion of a game-within-a-game originally upset me. However, once I realized it was completely untied to progress in the main game, completely optional, and provides a depth of experience to cute and charming moments scattered throughout the game, I came to appreciate it more. I even ended up beating the base quest, but didn't bother trying to beat the New Game+ which became available after that. If you're a completionist, you're in for a ride, but otherwise its nice, optional and light-hearted fun.\n\nTL;DR Most everything has already been said by other reviewers, both good and bad. In spite of the tone that my review has taken, [b] I would recommend this game for people to play [/b], though I would recommend that you wait for it to go on sale. This is definitely a fun experience, especially for fans of the RPG genre.

The monster design... not my cup of tea, but the pixel art is beautifully done even if I don't necessarily like their designs. Music and sound design are both great. That's about it.\n\nEverything else:\nGame is so close to being decent, but so far from being good. I picked the game up after hearing from absolutely everyone how amazing it is, and I couldn't disagree more. I couldn't even stomach finishing the game by myself, and had to team up with my S/O to tag team through the last chapter or two just to see if the ending made it any better. It didn't. \n\nThe story is the most disappointing stand-out, as there are so dang many loose ends and unsatisfying conclusions. The devs didn't have much of a story to tell in general, which is fine. There are plenty of great games with very basic stories. The problem is that they just keep tacking things on and not fully explaining or expanding upon them. Many characters are just outright unlikable and confusing, and other characters which I wanted so badly to like just don't quite make it there... and are still confusing as far as where they came from, what their involvement is, etc.\nAfter the final scenes of the game, it just didn't sit right with me that the worst character who is least deserving of a happy ending is the only character who got any closure or positive outcome. \nThen there are the rest of the characters with absolutely no closure, or the most depressing endings imaginable for almost no reason. \nThere are plenty of theories online that explain things in a more satisfying way, but these are ultimately just theories, and I can't give the devs credit for fan interpretations of the character's stories. \n\nAlthough the game seems to be pretty lighthearted and family-friendly with all the jokey and cringe dialogue, it surprised me by having weirdly adult content throughout. In New Dam City, there's just some like 8-year-old kid who is obsessed with a literal prostitute robot. I don't care if there are going to be adult jokes, but it is surprising/jarring when it comes up in a game that represents as family friendly and goofy in every other way. And... why do they have to specifically drag the child characters into it? Who knows.\n\nGameplay... it exists. You spend most of the game reading through dialogue and wandering around cities, so the combat and puzzle elements aren't something you'd be playing this game to experience, but they're there. \nThe puzzles are okay. Some of them are even pretty fun. Some of them are ruined by how annoying the enemy monsters and hitboxes are. There's also this weird issue with puzzle difficulty scaling. Some of the \"hardest\"(they're still fairly easy) are at the end of the game as expected, but mixed in with those are some of the easiest and most insulting excuses for puzzles that basically just amount to time wasters. I'm talking the kind of puzzle you would expect to get in a tutorial that just shows you how the mechanics work... yeah THAT kind of puzzle is at the END of the game in the final dungeon.\n\nCombat, though, I have nothing positive to say about it. \nHit boxes for many enemies are awful. \nMechanics for many enemies are awful or unreasonably annoying. \nEnemies you wouldn't expect to be tanky (a bird?) are unreasonably healthy. \nEnemies you would expect to be more difficult are pushovers. \nEnemies can go inside walls and float around off cliffs, at times artificially extending combat as they are just farting around outside of your range. \nThe character you're not controlling can be hit by things and take damage for you even if you dodged something. That character will also be sought out and attacked by things, so even if you leave them off somewhere they'll be out of the way you can still lose health for whatever is happening over there. \nIt is cute to have the other character following you around, but as far as combat it's just another thing to be frustrated about.\n\nOverall, the game is beautiful visually, but the story telling is frustrating at best and the gameplay elements can actively feel like a punishment.", "timestamp_created": 1672898147, "timestamp_updated": 1672898147, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546369493007659912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130151674": {"recommendationid": "130151674", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999604891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3366, "last_played": 1671689644}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot of charm.

I can explain some of the reasons why; however, there's also a magical element to this game's world that I can't explain that pulled me in hard. The developers have created something truly beautiful here.\n\nA quick note: I initially played this game on another platform, hence my low playtime at the time of writing this review. I have in fact beaten the entire game, though I haven't yet 100%ed it. I am looking forward to doing so here on Steam.\n\nTo break it down, this game is a little bit \"Earthbound,\" a little bit \"Zelda,\" a little bit \"Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga,\" a lotta bit unique, and a gorgeous homage to '90s anime. It plays as a story-heavy, top-down action RPG with puzzles, exploration, \n hidden treasures/loot, boss battles, and a series of minigames that make up an entire playable \"Final Fantasy\" style JRPG that tie cleverly into the narrative of the actual game. So, yes, this is kind of two games in one. The gameplay loop is very effective and very satisfying, and there are a ton of cool secrets to sniff out, if that is your thing.\n\nAs mentioned, this game leans hard into the narrative. While there is plenty of action and exploration you can engage in, this is a linear game and is a fair amount of dialogue/cutscenes. That may seem like a drag to some players, but the dialogue is well-written and the pacing of the story is spread out just enough to keep you engaged while not giving too much away up front. In this adventure, you play as a rugged, non-verbal miner named John and a young girl named Sam that he discovered in cryogenic sleep while mining. John takes Sam in and cares for her, standing in as a father figure. Much of the game revolves around their relationship with each other and the many colorful characters they meet along their journey, with whom they develop a sort of found family. As the journey progresses, you learn more about Sam's origins and the fate that lies ahead of her, while John fights to protect her from strange, paranormal forces and a society on the brink of collapse. I won't say any more about the story, as it's definitely best to go in with very little expectation--the story is at its best during its most surprising moments. I will say, though, that there is a lot of humor, pain, mystery, and many sincerely touching character moments that make you fall in love with these people and their wild, crumbling world. When the game ended, I was just thinking about it for days after, making new connections and analyzing it. There is a lot to unpack once it's all through.\n\nAesthetically, the game is stunning. It's presented in detailed, layered pixel art with beautiful modern lighting and weather effects, all supported by a brilliant soundtrack. The sound effects and visual effects are all very satisfying, as well. While the character animation is relatively simple, it does wonders for immersion and for making the characters feel especially alive. Sam, in particular, is almost cartoonishly effervescent to great effect. Each cast member feels unique in the way they are drawn, animated, and written, and the developers take every advantage with putting characters together in many interesting, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking ways throughout the story.\n\nThe anime influence is very much worth mentioning, as well. There's an overarching Ghibli vibe that is obvious from the screenshots and trailers, but there is inspiration taken from many great animes of the '90s and even earlier. Some are subtle, some are not. If you're not familiar with that material, you will not feel lost--there's so much standalone charm here that anyone can appreciate. For those that are familiar, the developers have mentioned taking inspiration from \"Memories,\" \"Tekkon Kinkreet,\" \"On Your Mark,\" \"Porco Rosso,\" \"Astro Boy,\" \"Angel's Egg,\" \"Cowboy Bebop,\" \"Akira,\" \"Paprika,\" \"Cat Soup,\" \"Metropolis,\" and more. I'm pretty sure \"Gurren Lagann,\" was a source of inspiration, as well--but that's just a guess. Most of this is just present in tone, style, or story beats; but, eagle-eyed players will notice a few more overt references hidden in the world.\n\nHonestly, this is a very easy recommend. If it looks even remotely interesting to you, I would strongly advise giving it a try. This game means a lot to me, and I hope I can get at least one other person to play it and love it as much as I do.

Before anyone jumps my gun at the Earthbound comparison, I am not the first to make this. Literally, every piece of media coverage and YouTuber that\u2019s picked the game up has called it an \u201cEarthbound-inspired\u201d game. There\u2019s literally an optional half-Earthbound parody called Earthborn you can play. The influences Earthbound has had on Eastward aren\u2019t the slightest bit subtle and I think it comes at the game\u2019s detriment. Something that is going to be extremely prevalent in my writing on this game is that I don\u2019t think Eastward has its own identity. Every part of Eastward plays things so extraordinarily safe and it still falls flat.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910488535\nLet\u2019s lead with the gameplay because it\u2019s the only thing it tries to do to distance itself from its obvious influence, except it takes too much from its other source of inspiration. It plays exactly as if Link\u2019s Awakening had the screen limitation cut out. This wouldn\u2019t normally be a bad thing since not many games play like LA, but Eastward doesn\u2019t experiment that much with this. Aside from a greater focus on ranged weapons. The frying pan is just a reskinned sword. Weapon variety is very limited with access to more weapons being restricted by chapter unlocks. Weapon upgrades are so rare and insignificant to the point that I stopped seeking them out, which didn\u2019t exactly fix the situation either. Enemy variety is fairly small and I think the number of bosses surpasses them. They were all laughably easy considering the frying pan stun locks some of them and the rest you can just spam bullets into. The greatest step with experimentation stems from the Mario & Luigi style partner swapping with silent protagonist John and the actual character on the cover art, Sam. This mechanic is used for some rather slow and simple, but inoffensive puzzle design. There were probably upwards of a hundred puzzles but not one stuck with me. Whack a bomb across the ledge. Pull this switch so John can pass and then pull this one so Sam can follow in pursuit. Spam your energy balls with Sam. I never had to really stop and think about a puzzle. And while it\u2019s much worse for a puzzle to force you to look up a solution, I think it\u2019s a huge problem when both your combat and puzzles are so tediously simple.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910487705\nBut oh my god, the writing is easily the most irritating part of Eastward. Most RPGs have fun and interesting scenarios to put you in. Eastward just tries to think of the most entertaining time-waster to keep you occupied until they have to actually continue with the plot. The first chapter of the game starts out fairly interesting. You\u2019re plopped into a town built into an underground subway system with a corrupt mayor that banishes anyone he doesn\u2019t like to the surface. Lots of questions get put into place like: Why is everyone living in a subway system? Why is the surface so scary? The story continues into the second chapter immediately after you\u2019re banished to the terrifying surface. You find a town and then Sam does the dumbest possible action ever and faces zero consequences for it because she conveniently doesn\u2019t remember it. Mild spoilers, but lots of people die! Where do you think the story goes after this point? If you guessed we spend half the game making several meals for a mob boss because of a random bet with no actual established risks, you would be right. Chapter 3 is the definition of filler and it doesn\u2019t get much better with pacing until the final few areas of the game. The main two villains don\u2019t offer much in threat factor or even entertainment. Solomon is the one you\u2019ll primarily be encountering and he\u2019s played off as a joke half the time before becoming an actual problem out of nowhere. The only comedic moment that got me feels unintentional as it involves a one-sided romance story with a silent protagonist that shows zero reciprocation. Several story points and character motivations are very confusing as well. It got to the point where I thought it was just a me issue, but the wiki pages for this game are so barren and discussion on the plot is so divided that I realized it was just how the game was written. I cannot stress this enough, Eastward\u2019s plot is boring at best and frustrating at worst. It doesn\u2019t help that a lot of the tropes I personally despise are very common.\n\nThe soundtrack is another one of Eastward\u2019s weakpoints. It\u2019s generally rare that I can\u2019t find a single highlight in the OST for a game, let alone for an RPG. I think my problem with Eastward\u2019s music is how generic it sounds combined with how small it feels when compared to the actual size of the game. Describing what makes something generic is rather difficult, but every musical piece sounds like something I\u2019ve heard before. The battle music sounds like it could be pasted into any other game. The suspenseful encounter music is the exact same. It\u2019s the exact same for every other song. Especially when something joyous happens and the happy song plays. That song gets spammed to oblivion throughout the dialogue dumps. I personally feel that Eastward lacks an identity in its soundtrack and I will never be listening to it again.\n\nThe art is something I feel conflicted on as well. It\u2019s mainly the character sprites, the actual background environments look gorgeous. Eastward has a bunch of unique locations that are beautifully put together. I mentioned earlier there\u2019s a town built into an old subway station, but there\u2019s also one built entirely into a singular train! While not nearly as absurd, a city being built entirely on and around a dam with there being class segregation for how high up you live was another neat place. And the human factories were probably the most off-putting locations I\u2019ve seen. The story really wasted the unsettling nature of seeing hundreds of test-tube people tended to by the emotionless breeder bots in those segments. The pixel art for the backgrounds is absolutely stellar and I really like how they incorporate semi-realistic lighting into it. I cannot say the same about how people look in this game. I feel as though too much detail was put into their design. Several characters show off every pore, blemish, wrinkle, foundation, etc. shown off in their sprite. Luckily John and Sam themselves look fine, but there was one moment when Sam opened her mouth really wide that looked really off-putting to me. Characters are also overtly bouncy with their idle animations which isn\u2019t too much of an issue by itself. It\u2019s when that bounciness translates to a lot of the female characters having somewhat exaggerated breast jiggling that it feels distasteful. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2910488084\nPerformance is something that I can praise Eastward for at least. The game never crashed and there wasn\u2019t a single game-breaking bug. The worst offender I encountered for bugs was some NPCs ignoring the collision of objects during cutscenes, as it appears that their pathing doesn\u2019t always factor in the environment. There were no other technical or visual errors that occurred outside of this. I feel as though this is important to stress as more and more releases are forgetting about the importance of stability. Despite my many blatant problems with Eastward, it is still a polished and complete game.\n\n[b]Overall, I\u2019m placing Eastward as a 4/10. I think lots of Eastward can be expanded upon in either a sequel or the development team\u2019s next work.[/b] I\u2019ve played worse games, but I\u2019ve also played much better games. I cannot recommend Eastward because it doesn\u2019t stand out to me.

Nearly every NPC looks unique and detailed, even ones that serve zero purpose other than just dialogue. It is seriously impressive - unique idle and walking animations that all play up to their designs. I loved it. The environments are also a treat, with so much life and care and personality put into every new area you visit. If there was any recycling of assets, they were hidden well enough to where I never noticed.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is extremely simple... a lot of the time, it just boils down to spamming the X button while enemies are against a wall. Bosses, while visually stunning, don't get too interesting either (with a few exceptions, of course, but most of them have that standard \"hit him when vulnerable to get to the next phase out of three\" thing going on.) I think it was around Chapter 5 where I stopped going out of my way to find weapon upgrade parts in the world - why bother when the game is this simple and easy?\n\nThe story, along with the game's visuals, kept me playing until the end. The characters especially are memorable and fun. The game takes the MOTHER 3 approach (one of the many, many things Eastward borrows from it) whereupon after major story beats, character dialogue changes all across the map - I found myself revisiting areas I was only required to visit once just so I could talk to the NPCs and find new dialogue. I love it when games do this, and there is even a fast travel option to facilitate it. \n\nThe story does meander quite a lot, though, with tons of dialogue and cutscenes that... really don't matter? Most egregious in Chapter 3, but Chapter 6 also left a sour taste in my mouth. I think whether or not this kills the game for people depends on if you end up caring for the characters - I loved them all, but even I had to question the pointlessness of the many errands the protags were constantly going on when there were way bigger fish for them to fry, so to speak...\n\nThe music is also pretty great, catchy, though not particularly memorable. Standout tracks for me probably include the New Dam City theme, and the boss fight music. At the very least, it stays consistent throughout, and never feels out of place.\n\nI'm glad I gave Eastward a chance, despite the negative things I've read about it from people who gave up on it.

As somebody who grew up on games like those in the Zelda series and Earthbound, I would say the gameplay has an interesting blend of the two with a bit of hotline Miami sprinkled in when it comes to combat. Having just finished my first playthrough I can safely say that Eastward is a great game. However, it does manage to be a bit rough around the edges in certain ways so I'll talk about the bad first and then the good. The story, while I found it beautifully written, i have noticed that it can be a bit confusing at times as others have pointed out. While the game was fun and really enjoyable, the pacing did have some hiccups at certain points where things seemed to drag a bit or play out in an odd way. And finally, the finality of every action you take can be a bit frustrating at times. Walking into a new zone can be a gamble as you could be going into a side room with treasure you can go in and out of orrr you end up stuck having to progress as your entrance just caved in. Also just a side gripe, no potatoes in late game made me one recipe short of getting the five star chef achievement, its kinda similar with a lot of food items though so if you're a completionist be aware of that. NOW FOR THE GOOD STUFF. First the setting/world is phenomenal and the usage of weather and lighting with an overgrown world is wonderfully done. There is also a really amazing blend of styles with American, Japanese, and even Soviet motifs sprinkled throughout the world with an apocalyptic twist. The characters and their dynamics with one another are also really heartwarming and there really is a gorgeous emotional connection with the characters, especially the main protagonists. The fighting is really fun and despite it having a somewhat old fashioned top-down zelda/hotline Miami style, it can prove to be a really fun and refreshing challenge, and with some really well made dungeon puzzles you're surely in for a good time. Overall even though there are some rough spots in the game, I feel like most of them will be fixed possibly through updates and even with them I would still say my time with this game was well spent and really enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1671085982, "timestamp_updated": 1671085982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128497484": {"recommendationid": "128497484", "author": {"steamid": "76561199053125326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1838, "last_played": 1693925994}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1670953333, "timestamp_updated": 1670953333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128477628": {"recommendationid": "128477628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092681929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1526, "last_played": 1670967777}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun, i love the story, i love how it looks. i really enjoyed playing this", "timestamp_created": 1670928053, "timestamp_updated": 1670928053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128462846": {"recommendationid": "128462846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145047760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1981, "last_played": 1670901272}, "language": "english", "review": "gave me an odd sense of nostalgia that i didnt want to end. some of these types of games tend to drag on too long but i feel this was the perfect length. amazing job to everyone involved in making this game", "timestamp_created": 1670901532, "timestamp_updated": 1670901532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128373603": {"recommendationid": "128373603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991361921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2101, "last_played": 1699107075}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es complicadillo de pasar pero merece mucho la pena.

Everything from the art to the music to the writing just oozes creativity and love, you could really tell when the creators were just having fun with what they were making in this.  The fact this game isn't talked about as much as it should be honestly is a bit of a crime, because it's genuinely a work of art, art in a very weird sense I'll admit but art nonetheless. \n\nThat being said there are a few issues I did find with the game, albeit small.  The most glaring of issues is the odd pacing of the story, the story of this game is very dramatic and a lot of its most heart breaking moments don't get enough time to shine before the next goofy, upbeat moment comes to ruin it.  In other words, this game has an odd sense of timing when it comes to playing with the emotions of the player, because one moment you'll be hit with tension immediately to be broken by very very very inappropriately timed music.  There also lies an issue with the controls during combat, the combat in this game is admittedly rather  clunky, depth perception is often an issue and switching weapons is not nearly as smooth as it should be during fast combat.  I used a lot more healing items than was really necessary most of the time because I kept getting stuck between weapons when switching.  It's such an odd issue with the game that after a while is something I just slowly got used to but even so it's a bit frustrating.\n\nbeyond that, it's in short a good game worth it's price tag", "timestamp_created": 1670012530, "timestamp_updated": 1670012530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127766181": {"recommendationid": "127766181", "author": {"steamid": "76561199179511356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1689713348}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics are sooooo good I love it, and the colors are so vibrant!", "timestamp_created": 1669992046, "timestamp_updated": 1669992181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127617033": {"recommendationid": "127617033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171369813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2691, "last_played": 1669796923}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Good 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1669797051, "timestamp_updated": 1669797051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014469861984253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127601636": {"recommendationid": "127601636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167759203", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 406, "last_played": 1695953226}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game, so far the story has been really interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1669772791, "timestamp_updated": 1669772791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127591953": {"recommendationid": "127591953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158854290", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1669175597}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no es malo pero no me pareci\u00f3 divertido, le di horas para que me enganche y no lo consiguio, es disfrutable pero para nada perfecto, esteticamente muy lindo eso hay que decirlo", "timestamp_created": 1669759080, "timestamp_updated": 1669759080, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127501432": {"recommendationid": "127501432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973163863", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1446, "last_played": 1670182441}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like this game and while the art is 12/10 and the action parts are fun the story and writing SUCK. lll more than likely finish it and its probably less than 40 total hours, but I'm at the point where I'm just trying to ignore the text and spamming buttons till its over and I can get back into the action parts and exploration.

Being thrown into a dystopian world that seems to be at the hands of human-made environmental disaster and a cast of idiosyncratic survivors is a great lure for audiences and players who enjoy atmospheric driven stories. One will try their luck adapting to the needs of the scenario, piecing together the histories and relationships of the characters. An embedding and killer soundtrack, which includes one of my favourite cooking mini-game mechanics that I've had the pleasure of coming across. \nPlay captures the child-like desire to act immediately with confidence and following a moral compass (which may just be impulse) as Sam, along side the projected stoic, consequence-knowing and quick reactive resourcefulness of John, made for complimentary engaging solutions to the puzzles and dungeons. Akin to audiences that enjoyed the feeling of first watching Adventure Time, these protagonists are often steering toward the wrong path in their quest to investigate new places and help the people they care about in a lush and weird setting. I also feel that there is similitude to Celeste such as increased difficulty at a good pace, harbouring fluid controls, cute art-style, and emotional merit. \nThe game does pull the player into making inferences to fill in the gaps of the lore, some may find this confusing or tiresome, but for those in the corner who see the drive and attraction coming from not knowing, it will not disappoint. Something to note is that the music tracks during a dialogue sequence can be repetitive and distract from reading, as well as the type and number of attacks required in boss fights.

The visual aesthetic and the music alone bump this review to a positive rating. What had initially got me interested in this game was the beautiful visual style that was presented in the trailers, and in this regard Eastward does not disappoint. \n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the puzzles and combat mechanics aren't mind blowing, but they are pretty good and will keep the player engaged throughout play. There's a lot of standard \"dungeon\" formula, with areas containing a significant amount of puzzles and combat encounters with a boss fight at the end. This is by no means bad design, but it definitely began to feel cookie-cutter the more I played.\n\nThis game does come with a catch, however. The sheer amount of fetch quests and dull conversations with NPCs brings the experience down a few notches for me. The amount of times I had to aimlessly run around trying to find the next NPC to talk to that would advance the story became annoying relatively quickly, and resulted in a substantial amount of dull sections overall. This ultimately resulted in me having to practically force myself to finish the game after dropping it for multiple months prior.\n\nTaking these points into account, I still ultimately recommend the game, but only to a specific audience of people that is fine with many dull moments that are solely dedicated to world building or advancing the story in small increments, with combat and puzzles mixed in every now and then.", "timestamp_created": 1669255988, "timestamp_updated": 1669255988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126481826": {"recommendationid": "126481826", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208364216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1669245438}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sam!!! \u2661", "timestamp_created": 1669244995, "timestamp_updated": 1669244995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126384916": {"recommendationid": "126384916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448107377", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1669220180}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game\n", "timestamp_created": 1669220188, "timestamp_updated": 1669220188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "126189238": {"recommendationid": "126189238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014946394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1691383309}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely STUNNING artwork and style but everything else, especially the combat, just feels bland to me.

The game makes constant reference to Nintendo's Earthbound (Mother 2) as an inspiration, but it's closer to Illusion of Gaia in execution - long stretches of stilted combat adventuring and light puzzle solving punctuated by towns filled with painfully dull dialogue. The charming artwork and animation pulled me most of the way through the game, but the lack of story payoff and an increase in combat clunkiness over meaningful progression just made the slog unbearable. \"Monkollywood\" was the nail in the coffin of my interest.

The combat and puzzles also tend to lead to this problem, where instead of serving as fun, engaging sections to break up bits of the story, they instead can turn into drawn out, lengthy dungeons with combat mechanics I wish were better tuned. The art team really outdid themselves with this game though, with a somewhat short but really sweet soundtrack filled with a lot of great tracks and some of the best art direction I've seen not just from an indie game, but any game period.

Nothing connects logically, and the game builds up interesting new developments only to suddenly hop over to WACKYVILLE with zero rationale for any of it. Worse yet, it doesn't really feel like there's like... a point, to this game. I'm not trying to get anything, or go anywhere; neither of the main characters has any real motivations, or core. Sam is a vaguely magical child who probably caused the apocalypse some vague amount of time ago, John is the Doomslayer if he just liked beans in the afternoon.\n\nAn excellent example of this is the cooking wager. At one point John and Sam show up at a new city, for the incredibly personal reason that it was the next automated station the train would take them to, and they get a job as general assistants so that they'll have a room to sleep in. Sam then just... sneaks out, meets some local kids, and at their request goes to the local casino because one of said kids is there. She gets him to go back and then just stays and begins gambling with a magic coin. The mob boss catches her, and like... Decides to have a bet with her, that John and she can't cook a dish he'll like. There's no real reason to go along with it, no real prize or punishment connected to the bet. She accepts, and this becomes basically the main quest.\n\nThey get three tries; on the first they go through a dungeon to get a fruit, and then gift that fruit to someone else who sells them a sob story. Not really that annoying, this fits the characters as shown. Second try, they get some high-quality crab, make a crab steamer pot, and then they get pressganged by the local clowns to help them train for the circus' grand opening, for no payment or reason, which causes the crab to overcook and instantly go bad. Thirdly, they go through ANOTHER long dungeon, find some kinda magic fish, feed it to the mob boss, he concedes defeat because it's good fish, and then Sam insists that she wants, as a reward for the wager, that he come have dinner with them every night because she feels they're friends now. No! I've met this man like thrice and every time he's been vaguely menacing at both best and worst! I don't care! WHY am I here! WHY is my search for Alva being interrupted by goddamn Ape Escape! WHY is my search for a rocket interrupted by crappy Jeopardy! WHY is my arrival at Ester City interrupted by suddenly John and Sam teleported into being pirates for no reason!

I couldn't stop staring at each scenes. [b]The soundtrack is so atmospheric and evocative[/b]--it perfectly captures the mood of the game and was able to make me elicit every emotion there is. It truly brought the game to life. The story of the game is well-written. You can tell through the dialogues and overall narration of the game that the writer really took their time with the process; the conversations felt natural and seamless, and the narration during montages were so poetic, [b]it made me clutch my heart[/b]. The story can get dark, but there surely is a lot of comical and heartfelt moments throughout the game. The flow is slow-burn and some people may get bored in certain areas. But not me. I am into story-driven games and I genuinely enjoy reading dialogues and getting deep within the lore, so my experience with it is just pure fun. Also, the aesthetic aspect of the game just captivated me and it really helped with getting me to hyper fixate on the game that I did not get bored with my playthrough.\n\nIn terms of its gameplay, it is very casual like you would expect. But I would be lying if I'd say I didn't get a hard time with specific fights, because I did. In multiple instances, in fact. Nothing too elden ring type of difficulty though. If you've played a bunch of super mario and related games, this is a piece of cake for you. I did not expect that the game would be this long. Not that I'm complaining. But I wish the chapters were equally divided because leaving the game mid-chapter when you have to go about your day or head to bed kind of ruins the momentum\u2014some chapters were too long and felt dragging. I had to chop it off and continue the next day. [i]I'm looking at you, chapter 7.[/i]\n\nOne tip that I can give is that, upgrade your backpack and always fill it up with foods because enemies will catch you off guard sometimes. Every time you stumble upon a stove, cook. So you have food along the way, like the true adventurer that you are.\n\n[b]Overall, the game is so beautiful and memorable.

Games like Space Quest, KingsQuest, Quest For Glory. \nThe Game play isn't a story that drags, where you just want to finish so you get your money's worth. EastWards storytelling, is realistic, and for me, does what today's games no longer do! They cause real feelings of love, ager, and hate! Not to post spoilers, but I'm not even far in this game yet, and want karma to bury that evil Mayer!! \nPuzzles are like the old Sierra games, and get more difficult as the game progresses.\nFor those who like to cheat in games like this, a huge warning. Do not add items you have not gotten in game yet! Adding more tokens, chips, gold, and salt, and locking ones HP is the only safe type of cheating you can do!\nIncreasing bag size, and adding better weapons and items before you get to the parts of the game where you get them will forever softlock you from ever completing the game. It's not an anti cheat, it's triggering game flags that look at the items you have, and remove the code for the events that would have opened up new reagons for you, and instead forever keep them out of your reach.\nEarthBorn game, the only safe cheat is increasing gold and adding exp. Don't raise the levels, because doing so will result in game flags being passed up that give you needed items and reagon unlocks. Adding exp so levels go up nature, by realistic numbers, is only safest cheat to level up. For example, if you have 88 exp and 400 is level up, then add 312 and fight something. Don't go adding 200,000 exp all at once, or your game will softlock!\nI'll fix this review to format it better on my PC. Doing this on my phone.\nGame play and controlls is simple enough, but a game controller for battels Is highly recommended.\nDon't like the controller options, try a utility called Xpadder. It's a utility I myself use, to program the gamepad keys the way In comfortable with. This is great, if you play several games with a configuration your used to, and want this game to use the same configuration. I don't recommend Xpadder for valve games like TF2, as it's been known to accidentally trigger false VACs due to changes it makes in memory.\n\nEastward reminds me also of the old Ultima and Final Fantasy games, using multiple player characters to complete puzzles, only they can do.\n\nThe animations and especially the intro was done with great thought, and not thrown together, just to fit similar game formats.\n\nBack your adata save folder up often! This way if you make a mistake, or auto save, loses a good game, you won't have to start over. \n\nThe only thing I severely dislike about this game, is having multiple intro screens, forced down ones throat , with no way to bypass. It's important to give credit where credit is due, but after the first time, if I'm paying for a game, I don't want to be forced to watch all the games creators, every single time I load the game up. Even running off an NVME, it's damned annoying!\n\nThe game starts off, in an underground city. It looks as if an apocalypse has struck, where science of our time, has long been lost. The city is run by a corrupt mayer, who has convinced his citizens that the world above, is a dead and baren wasteland. Question the Mayer, and you and your family vanish. Sent off to what all believe are their deaths, never to return. \nSam is found in a stasis, and through has no memory of her past, somehow knows the truth of what exists above, mostly by a spirit of herself, that tends to appear in times of danger. \nThere are a lot of hidden rooms and treasures that your treasure Meter won't announce, so keep your eyes open for them. \nThis is a single player game, but one the entire family can play together.\nDefinitely worth the price!\n", "timestamp_created": 1668300698, "timestamp_updated": 1668300698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648800253868103027", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125371519": {"recommendationid": "125371519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073516852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1135, "last_played": 1667864909}, "language": "english", "review": "Great music, design, characters.

It's destination? -That's for you to find out, within environments that are and intricately crafted, characters that are teeming with uniqueness, and scenarios that you can immerse yourself in.\n\nFrom the very start of the game what stands out the most is its atmosphere. -Dark, rustic, and desolate. -Yet, the characters which lived in it bestowed it with the warmth, and the color it needed to feel inviting. The environments, and the setting perfectly captures story set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is on its last legs. -And as the journey progresses, you come across various other locations which adds stark contrast to where you start the game originally, all the while maintaining the overall atmosphere of it. In addition to that, the attention to detail that you find in each of these environments is simply gorgeous. From the depths of the earth where scant light filters in, to the fields that are bathed in soft afternoon sunlight, \u201cEastward\u201d has its world crafted masterfully.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters, the game goes vivid. You find a set of characters that stands out under their own spotlights. Unique, vibrant, and exciting. -From cowards that uses others as an excuse to save themselves, to lovers who wish their love becomes true, to comedians that wants nothing but the best in life, to heroes that put others before themselves, \u201cEastward\u2019s\u201d characters go above and beyond to add that \u201clight\u201d and \u201clife\u201d that its world lacks. Every character who comes into contact with John and Sam on their journey adds their own flavor to it. Be it an NPC of the main quest, a simple bystander that shares tidbits of their life, the conversations are crafted in a way that makes you \u2013 the player \u2013 feel a part of their world.\n\nThe story of \u201cEastward\u201d stands out as one of the best in its own right. The journey of John and Sam is rich with emotion as they come across various situations, and characters of the world. The game is brimming with moments that are simple happiness, moments of solemnity and calmness, and of course moments of sorrow and anguish. -And they come together in perfect balance as John and Sam makes their way through the world of \u201cEastward\u201d making it stand out on its own. Without giving any spoilers, in each part of the world of \u201cEastward\u201d that John and Sam travels to, brings to them their own set of \u201ctroubles\u201d (To which Sam dives headfirst with her bright and cheerful nature, and John simply follows her.). With a mystery element that simply gets you craving to find out what happens next, \u201cEastward\u201d draws you in to its world filled with adventure, and paired with it, danger.\n\nThe gameplay of \u201cEastward\u201d is very smooth with little to no rough edges. Clearly this game is meant to be enjoyed on a controller, but keyboard and mouse works just fine as well. The weapons in game were simply brilliant, using skill to use them in combat and in puzzles -The puzzle system of the game is crafted to perfection, with just the right amount of critical thinking factor put in to keep you on edge. -Finally, the boss fights were often exciting, providing greater sense of accomplishment, and euphoria upon triumph.\n\nOverall \u201cEastward\u201d was a game that I will remember a long time. -Not simply as a \u201cgame\u201d that I played, but as a \u201cjourney\u201d I took together with John and Sam to find out the wonders of its world. -And on that journey I found so much  more than I ever hoped for.\n", "timestamp_created": 1668088670, "timestamp_updated": 1668088670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591503262519836426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125225505": {"recommendationid": "125225505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392394442", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1557, "last_played": 1668040382}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La historia es simplemente maravillosa, el problema m\u00e1s significativo que podr\u00eda encontrar es la importante cantidad de di\u00e1logos (no skippeables), a\u00fan as\u00ed esta obra es digna de un gran juego.", "timestamp_created": 1668040554, "timestamp_updated": 1668040554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125209898": {"recommendationid": "125209898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866639687", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 2607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 671, "last_played": 1669951064}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta muy bueno si te gusta los juegos clasicos tipo zelda y el pixel art. 8,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1668014200, "timestamp_updated": 1668014200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125184555": {"recommendationid": "125184555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865090693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 949, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1700691669}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun so far", "timestamp_created": 1667965872, "timestamp_updated": 1667965872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493403702974319458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125181139": {"recommendationid": "125181139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114473848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1311, "last_played": 1667955353}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of my childhood playstation games :D, I admit it has a lot of talks but the story and graphics is so cute, I can feel how happy John is when he saw Sam in the ending, I'm about to cry T_T", "timestamp_created": 1667959524, "timestamp_updated": 1667959524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45861855149269104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125178104": {"recommendationid": "125178104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050708882", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1669583713}, "language": "english", "review": "delightful story based game that has a beautiful pixel art style that is reminiscent of Gameboy games, a touching and remarkably well written story that starts at found a girl in some old ruins, like literally that's the prologue and it only gets weirder!

Do not recommend.\n\nAfter hearing so much praise for this game I was intrigued. I bought it, installed it, and jumped in with high hopes. Almost immediately I was having fun; the art is engaging and detailed, the world is vibrant and beautiful, and the setup seems interesting. And then this charm wears thin. VERY quickly.\n\nPros:\nThe art is gorgeous. Environments are beautiful and detailed. The pixel art aesthetic is awesome to look at and beautiful to explore.\nThe music is nice. Not amazing, but nice.\n\nCons:\nEverything else.\nThe characters are pretty much all grotesquely ugly and appear malformed. This is reflected in their attitudes; I think there's maybe four people so far that I haven't felt utterly sick of within minutes of talking to them. The dialogue takes forever, and you can't skip cutscenes or lines at all. The objectives in each area feel absolutely pointless. An example follows:\nYou are sent to get a berry. You go and get the berry, which involves convincing an old man to let you have it, which is purely arbitrary. There is no story impact whatsoever to this old man or convincing him you can't take the berry. It's just dialogue to mash through until you get the berry and go back to your house. But, before you can actually USE the berry, a scam artist--who is very obviously a scam artist--shows up and scams the berry away from the protagonists, who don't even question it. And that's it. Nothing else comes of this, except you fail in your objective to get the berry and the game continues on.\nThis isn't helped by the main characters. John is an absolute nothing pie. No characterization, no emoting, no dialogue, nothing. You get the sense that he MIGHT care about Sam, but it's hard to honestly say he does because he's such a blank, scruffy, ugly slate. It was a surprise to me since the game only ever shows off Sam on its cover art, and she's cute! Until she isn't. She does all of the talking for both characters, and at a point it starts to seem whiny. \n\nThe plot of the game is also propelled by truly despicable characters. The mayor and Yohn are two of the most slimy jerks I've ever seen in a game, and not only do they manage to win against your characters, they get no sort of comeuppance. As the player you simply have to accept that the scummy, evil people won and move on. The exception is the second area you end up in--everyone there is pretty nice! But then it all ends up completely devoid of meaning anyway and you have to move on. \n\nTen hours in and I'm struggling to understand the praise. Maybe people just have low standards. Maybe it gets better. But as-is?

If a dollar an hour of gameplay is worth it to you then this is a plus, if that seems lacking then you may find this disappointing, but I feel it is worth it on my end, and I tend to shop cheap.\n[] While there is a lot of experience to be had, that time does blaze by. This is good in the sense that it is gripping, but bad in that it really felt like it went by quickly. The number of locations feels small (even though those locations, themselves, feel enormous, at times.) I feel like you also could do well to explore some of the things that are showcased in more depth at times. There's several places that look like you should be able to enter and explore, but they are just set dressing. This is not a full negative, rather neutral, to me, because, really, if it took me (exploring a lot) almost 40 hours to complete, there clearly _is_ substance. \n\n- The minigames are a mixed bag. The side-minigames really don't feel worth delving too much into, though I did enjoy the gatcha since it doesn't really intrude on the gameplay, and doesn't affect the main story, I will also give the gatcha mechanic, conceptually a pass. (If the gatcha were in some way required to beat the game, this would be a second minus.)\n- The story has a couple pitfalls that kind of disappoint me, personally, but not every note is going to hit everyone just right.\n- There can be a BIT of busywork to the gameplay.\n- The way this game gets dark when it does has some level of sour taste in its actions that don't fully feel like they always push the plot forward, or they push it forward in ways that feel a bit mean-spirited to the player in a narrative sense.\n- Some of the things that happen also make it feel like it wouldn't be fun to replay if you get connected heavily to characters (not in the Undertale sense of that experience, in a different sense.)

It's negative now.\n\nThe game is not too bad, but it's utterly and overly stupid. It's juvenile, it's not even childish, it's puerile!\n\nThe story doesn't have any pathos, you are supposed to save people you don't give a damn about simply because the game doesn't make these people feel real, alive. They're just sprites, some pretty and some ugly, with an annoying dancing animation that makes me wanna scream \"stop it now!\"\n\nFor instance, the circus quest. You can't enter an area for no reason at all, the game simply says you can't go on until everything is ready, but no other explanation is offered. Later, you can enter the area and there's nothing there, just a bunch of clowns chilling. Why was not I allowed to enter bedore if nothing was happening? Even later, when I acually had osmething important to do: the stupid brat that clings along with her white hair made a bet with a mafia boss that I could cook him something amazing, and when i had the ingredients, she gave them away to an obvious liar who simply wanted my ingredients; she didn't ask, she just took my stuff and gave it away. next day, I had everything for an even better dish, but she asked me to go train the damn clowns so they could make a good show and not be kicked out. But, why? I'm a digger, I am not a clown, I can't teach clowns how to do their damn jobs! But I had not choice, the stupid brat promised I would, and my dish overcooked and only one day's left to make a good dish and not be killed or something.\n\nIt's been three sessions since I had any fun. Fun, in this game, comes from combat. But combat is shallow and repetitive. Still fun, specially ehen everything else is so bad (except the graphics; the graphics are so good... not the NPCs constantly dancing for no reason). But it's been a few hours since I had some combat, and now I've been through story, but the story in this game is drivel. All that circus thing? That's not story, that's just drivel.\n\nIn a walking simulator, when you go to another house and open a door, the story moves, goes on, there's progress, that's the game, the story is the game. Eastward wants to be story and gameplay, and it thinks gameplay is having an NPC asking you to go to some house, find three items, and bring them back. Yeah, simple fetch quest like any RPG. Except, the house is a few screens away, but 20 seconds tops, and inside there are three rooms, open, along a single hallway, each containing one item. You enter, grab the item, and leave. 20 seconds later, you go back and give the items... it's so asburds, it's so pointless, there's no challenge. Literally no challenge, not a single enemy, nothing, just walking, pontless walking, the story doesn't move, this quest is not story, and almost every single quest in this game, is drivel.\n\nI don't mind whether a game's writing is Shakespeare or Coelho (i.e. great or sh*t) as long as the game is fun to play. I don't care if a game's gameplay is simple and not too fun, as long as the story is worth to read and see through. This game has sub-par gameplay and bad writing. The graphis are excellent but the graphics can't save a game if the other factors are this flawed. Music... forgetable; not bad, only not interesting, just average.\n\nThe first few hours were good, the story seemed to make sense, the NPCs had some charm, but after you leave the first location, every NPCs is shallow and empty and more than silly. I can't recommend this game, I feel cheated.\n\n***\n\nOriginal review, after three hours:\n\nSuper good game.\n\nOnly a couple minor flaws: Controlling the characters with the stick is imprecise, and the main character doesn't talk, aren't you tired of silent protagonists? And a nitpick: school bullying is so clich\u00e9d, we've been reading and watching stories about school bullying for four decades now.\n\nOther than that, the game is wonderful, at least the prologue and the first episode, and I can't wait to play the next episodes this next weekend!

I'd play for maybe an hour or two and get so drained that I wouldn't touch it for months. But recently I got the urge to just finish it. There are just a lot of quality of life issues: there's no way to make the text auto or skip it, sometime's you can't fast travel, or the quest is too vague for you to figure out what to do next. I literally cleaned out my 7000+ camera roll during the cut scenes because it just wasn't really engaging. \n\nI spent a lot of time using walkthroughs and to be honest, I don't think a game should be so complex that you have to spend majority of it on a walkthrough page. There were so many moments where you can easily miss something really vital if you aren't glued to the walkthrough page. \n\nI'm not sure what i expected from this game but it didn't really fulfill my expectations.

Combat feels sluggish and repetitive, and there is no room at all for putting your own style into it. Every fight feels almost like a chore, a nuisance, or just a roadblock for progression. After a while, it just delays you from the already slow story. \n\nSecond is the plot. Although it was probably very well thought out, the plot is not deep at all. What I find gets me attached to games like these is a great story, one that I can remember for years, or one that makes me think about it whenever I'm not playing. I really wish I cared for Eastward, but I simply don't. I don't know how it ends, or what will come next, and that doesn't bother me.

I thought that the visuals and music combined well with the narrative to create incredible places to explore.\nThe detail in the character design, animations, cooking ;), earthbound, the UI, backgrounds are unparalleled. Some of my favorite moments without spoilers and in no particular order were the train/animations and design, the zoom after leaving the first train station near the start of the game, the last two boss fights, and the design of the final large city. \n\nThis game is incredibly atmospheric.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who like narrative driven adventures with accessible gameplay, anyone who wants a highly produced and stylistic story with heartfelt characters. The game was a nice and wholly chill escape into a trash punk future. \n\nNotes: \nPacing: \nThe beginning of the game has long stretches of text only interactions, truly the game has many moments where the dialogue drags a bit from my perspective. There are moments where the dialogue shines through, notably: at the casino, in the fog city, in the mayors house, many of the glitch moments, there are others. Rather, the game is quite linear and the beginning takes quite a while to complete while providing not a huge amount of narrative and engaging gameplay. This game was very ambitious in many ways, and it accomplishes many of them well, but I think that it edges into the realm of quantity over quality.\n\nGameplay: \n  For those looking for interesting gameplay, you may find many of the puzzles and fights a bit simplistic, although many of the boss battles were incredibly engaging.", "timestamp_created": 1664739724, "timestamp_updated": 1664739802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123166557": {"recommendationid": "123166557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815837845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1407, "last_played": 1644711525}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful art style (especially the environments) and intriguing story.

You obtain a number of different weapons throughout the game but none of them ever felt fun to use to me. The game is extremely stingy with health drops and loves to spawn enemies right on top of you. If you stock up on food items you can grind through the missions without much trouble but doing so feels like a chore rather than an accomplishment.\n\nThe story, as many others have pointed out, is plentiful but not very deep.

There's something so magical about the art, soundtrack, and storytelling method.

While there's definitely a lot more they could have built on, and it had it's fair share of plot holes, I found myself coming back for more and more.

The art is stunning but the gameplay and storyline kind of sucks.\n\nI've not written a review in a long time, but I just can't with this game. So I got this it while it's on sale and I'd say for the art work, its wroth every single penny and maybe even more. Kudos to the artists! If it's not for them there is almost no reason for me to recommend this game at all. The gameplay and storyline are really just not the best, and I would not recommend paying anything more than 30% off. Disclaimer, at the time of this review, I am at chapter 3 only. It may get better later on so I'd try to comment on the general things rather than chapter specific things. No spoilers whatsoever.\n\nTo be fair, I kind of went in blind without knowing what the game is about nor what kind of experience I would get out of it. I bought it merely because of the art style and because it seemed to be a cute RPG game. Right off the bat when the game is launched, there's a short *skip-able* \"introduction\" or a mini background story on how the two main characters Sam and John met. And that is basically all the information you'd ever get about them. If you pressed ESC and skipped it, you would be left in the dark as to who the protagonists Sam and John are. I'm at the third chapter right now (which is about 8 hours in) and I have not gained much new knowledge on the game's backstory, such as why we're going on the missions, or why the world is the way it is. From time to time there'd be a sentence or two hinting Sam's backstory, but it is very vague and it's all guessing work. \n\nThere's no voice over, which is alright. But omg, there are a lot of cutscenes, and most of the dialogs are long and unnecessary. Most of them can be easily summarised in a sentence or two and be done with. Some conversations are almost at the brink of being pointless because it does not add any depth to any of the characters as none of them had a solid backstory/ storyline significance for players to really get to know them. They all existed because the towns needed some NPCs. Even with \"side characters\" (if you can even call them that) that had quests or more conversations with, will come and go as the so-called storyline wanted them to. They existed simply to provide quests and nothing more. \n\nSpeaking of the quests. they all felt like tutorial sessions disguised as quests. It just felt like the entire game is about constant boss fight, and some random \"quests\" to teach you how to perform certain actions that would get you through the path to get to the boss. Most of the quests, if not all, provided no actual value to the plot. Often times I feel like I'm playing super pretty platformer with some half baked dialogs in attempt to explain why the background landscape changed from A to B as I proceed through the levels. To make matter worse, Sam's dialogs just makes her bratty and annoying; and John having zero dialog makes me feel like he too, like other NPCs, is just a hollow character. \n\nLet's talk about the gameplay. The game recommends you to play with a controller, and since I don't have one, I went with keyboard and mouse. You walk with WASD and fight with right click. This setup shouldn't be chunky but then they decided to do a 360' aiming radar (with the mouse) instead of a simple keyboard North, South (NE/ NW), East (SE/ SW), West and that is where it gets super annoying. Although the range of the aim is large enough to hit multiple targets at the same time, having to constantly twitch the mouse to aim the attacks, all while trying to move the character around is just bad combat system design. \n\nOn top of that, health drains like crazy. Say you start off with 5 HP right? Touching an enemy (if you walk pass them) automatically loses 1 HP. Then of course, if you can't dodge their attacks and got hurt, you'd lose another. There are occasionally HP droplets and weapon replenishments dropped as loot from defeated enemies but you will run out of supplies and die a lot. Based on the art style I was expecting some chill gameplay but no. Because of the auto-safe function I had to restart a timed puzzle so many times with basically 1HP left, and it honestly brought me so much frustration it's crazy. It's okay to die a lot, but instead of having to save the game only at designated spots, maybe allow the player to save whenever they want so it makes the restarts less painful?\n\nThere's also an in-game mini game that is very similar to OG 8-bit Pokemon gameboy game. It is as usual, not save-able whenever you desire. And it also doesn't show the enemy's full health. You switch between pokemons (characters in this case) trying to fight monsters without even knowing what level or HP they are at. And that is just absolutely dumb. What if you're level 1 and they are level 10, wouldn't you want to know whether you should fight or flight? And once again, I am not sure why they even added this mini game into the game in the first place. It all goes back to a weak plot. I guess I'm just so confused as to what this game is about. \n\nI will most likely give it few more chances because I still do want to get through the game to see how other stages look like. The world looks fantastic and although many objects are not interactive, it still is a joy to walk, stop, and admire the amazing details in the pixel art world they've created. Once again, hats off to the artists! If the gameplay/ storyline were better, it would have been so much more enjoyable.

Its always pretty clear what you need to do next and there is little else to do.  There is an unnecessarily complicated cooking minigame which you need to play to make food for healing yourself.

It's a labor of love, and you can tell that from every detail they put into it.\n\nHowever I do want to point out a few things that have bothered me from day 1 and they don't seem to be keen on addressing any of it:\n\n1) There is an awful lot of unnecessary dialogue that the game forces you to go through. It doesn't add much to the story and basically just feels like it wants to slow you down. While it's fun to read at first it quickly becomes a reason I don't want to start the game. Especially when you realize that all most of said dialogue could have been reduced to a single sentence. So please just add options to skip or speed this up. \n\n2) The interface of the game. Every time you start the game it has to go through many screens. No option to speed up or skip any of it? Why? I get that you want to tell everyone who was involved. But not every time surely?\n\n3) Dying. Thankfully I don't die a lot, but for the love of all that you can skip: Add an option to either disable or skip the dramatic death animation. You want to quickly go through that instead of having to wait for the screen to load, play the music and return you to the last save...\n\nSo yes three points that considerably reduce the fun that I do have in this game. Perhaps these are things that don't bother others, but to me these elements are very important and are usually present in many of the games I enjoy playing. \n\nBut I do love this game. The story and its characters are wonderful. John and Sam as a team really works. \nThe artwork is beautiful and reall well done. All the little details they put in are a treat to the eyes.

The music was also great overall and I really was into the basic plot elements of the story. On the other hand the story was also the weakest part of the entire game. It had some highs with chapters 3-5 but after that the quality just drops immensely. Chapter 6 was a slog to play through that shouldn't have existed and the overall level design for 7-8 felt very boring to play through with exposition dump at the end that ironically doesn't answer 90% of the questions given. Despite this the climax at the end did pull me back and it ended off with a heartfelt moment.

I also think this game is more an interactive story than a game, yes there are some puzzles and dungeons but ultimately it's about the story.  So let's look at the story.  It's good I've enjoyed the parts I have experience but I have a huge quirk and that's the dialog.  if I hit a or x it needs to appear instantly so I can then read it instead of painstakingly waiting for it come up and be read.   I'm sorry but this game is already very long and drawn out and at times a gauntlet of patience when it comes to getting through the dialog, especially when the current plot is so obvious you really don't need to read through it.  \n\nCriticism two:  sometimes the dialog gives you descriptions and they are counter intuitive to where you should actually go.  Example: someone asks you to meet them at the cemetery Downtown... The cemetery is in a place literally called Uptown and it's north on the map... \n\nCriticism 3:  Let me skip the long as intro, no not the cool animation which you can skip, the painfully slow fade in of the eastward title that then EVENTUALLY brings you to the menu...  Most infuriating thing about this game is the lack of being able to skip or move quickly through cut scenes and dialog when you want to.

Or them?\" - The Fridge, [i]Eastward[/i][/h1]\n\nAside from save fridges inducing an existential crisis and forcing into question the very foundations of philosophical anthropology, [i]Eastward[/i] has a lot to offer. In a refreshing yet polarizing game inspired by Earthbound and Zelda, you follow John and Sam on their post-apocalyptic journey, [i]er[/i], eastward.\n\nShanghai-based indie game studio Pixpil offers you an [i]experience[/i] flooded with beautiful pixelart, a uniquely wonderful and immersive story, and all the feels. It's a shame this game only appeals to... a very specific audience. [i]Eastward[/i] thrives in it's immersion, characters, art, and story; combat serves more to advance the narrative than being a central mechanic. Of course there's plenty of combat, but it's obviously supplemental. In [i]Eastward[/i], the sum is most certainly greater than the sum of its parts. \n\nMost critiques I've seen can be summarized by what John Koenig calls [i]the bends[/i]: \"frustration that you're not enjoying an experience as much as you should... which prompts you to plug in various thought combinations to try for anything more than static emotional blankness, as if your heart had been accidentally demagnetized by a surge of expectations.\" To many, the narrative pace, heavy dialogue, omission of narrative detail and clarity, and more simplistic combat (at least early on), are reasons to call the game [i]boring[/i]. My conclusion is that these very features are what makes the game charming and worth playing. The heavy dialogue helps with immersion and truly fleshing out the characters and atmosphere. The story, although a bit obscure, is not your standard structure and felt like few stories I've seen recently that tried something [i]different [/i](with great pay-off, I'd say). \n\nBut it's not a game for everyone: if you like narrative-driven, immersive, and explorative adventures, you'll probably love [i]Eastward[/i]. If you want something more action-heavy, straightforward, or casual fun, this might not be the game for you. \n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Artstyle and Animations are some of the best I've ever seen, especially for pixel art. The color choices and environment design is unparalleled. \n+ Characters are well-designed, fleshed out, and help immerse you in the story and environment.\n+ Atmosphere is probably the shining feature for me about this game. If atmosphere and being drawn in is important to you, Eastward is for you. \n+ Story is unique, emotional, makes you piece together and theorize, and is perfectly supported by every other element in the game. Won't say more for spoiler purposes. \n+ Combat is simplistic but has enough variety to stay fun for those sections. \n+ Cooking was a blast in this game -- and I usually [i]hate[/i] resource collecting and cooking in games. \n+ Collecting was at a perfect amount, and was a pleasure to complete.\n+ Difficulty never seems too hard, in combat or puzzles, but still enough to keep you involved. \n+ Earth Born -- it's a whole game within a game! I love when developers do this and how it's weaved within the environments and a bit of the story. It was certainly fun to try and master. \n\n[h1]Cons/Mixed[/h1]\n~ Guides or information about many parts of the game are incredibly difficult to come by and more so for achievement completionists (see below).\n~ Pacing may take a while to truly grab you; it's a slow burn that requires/rewards patience and curiosity. I say give it until the end of Chapter 3 to see how you truly feel about it (even though each chapter is truly different and it got more fun personally as I went on). Full disclosure: I put the game down after Chapter 2 and it took a year before I came back to it... then I couldn't stop. \n~ Story leaves... questions and a lot of it can be open to interpretation or is left unclear. This could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences. \n\n[h1]Completionists: The Good & Bad News[/h1]\nThe achievements are all fair and a blast to do. There are plenty of missable achievements, even just from the prologue (before many realize they'll want to complete it), but thankfully in one of the recent updates they created a chapter selection and added Earth Born to the main menu as well. This helped me go back and find some missing chests, get upgrades, ingredients, and so on. \n\nHowever, the bad news was it wasn't completely optimized. Despite going back into multiple saves it wouldn't completely work with recipes and eating all the food items as there are some missing even though there shouldn't be. (This problem is not standalone to me.) There also should be a way to see which food/chests you're missing, or at least which ones you have, for reasons like this. \n\nThe most frustrating though, is I beat Earth Born via the main menu, but it didn't unlock the 4 pixballs it should have when going back into the saves to the machines. So there's no reason to play it through the main menu and to get certain Earth Born achievements you need to beat it through the saves. I now need to complete it all over through the save to get the pixball achievements -- this is unnecessary and they should either add a machine to the main menu, make it universal across saves, or have it so beating it in the main menu unlocks it in the saves. \n\nBut overall this experience will forever stay with me and is worth the price. \n\n9.13/10", "timestamp_created": 1660679523, "timestamp_updated": 1660679523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466101676225662231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120723943": {"recommendationid": "120723943", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202527641", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5464, "last_played": 1693344447}, "language": "english", "review": "There's something utterly charming about this game.

the legend of zelda and earthbound.\n\n+ charming main characters with unique gameplay. sam and john are two of the most lovely main characters i've ever played with. at some point, you'll have to use both to solve puzzles or fend of your foes.\n\n+ great character writing and development. a lot of different persons with feelings, emotions and peculiarities. pretty charming and always a pleasure to talk to the people. overall the character cast was pretty well written with many memorable ones along the way.\n\n+ well executed story - it's a well rounded mix of wholesome slice of life sets and a mysterious, futuristic and apocalyptic plot. eastward is a magnificent roller coaster ride and you'll witness many different intense emotions like friendship, camaraderie, love, loss, despair, fear and many more. fantastic stuff right there!\n\n+ interesting world and decent world building. mysterious, dangerous, yet laid back and cozy.\n\n+ gameplay is \"bare bones\" at first glance compared to modern video games with a basic action combat system and simple puzzles, which isn't an issue at all imo, but there will be more gameplay and puzzle adjustments over the course of the game. many people complaining about it, but i can't confirm the critique since the gameplay is simple, yet works so well. the controls are responsive and there are no major flaws. a dodge button would be great tho. if you don't care about an overly unique and modern gameplay, you'll be totally fine with eastward.\n\n+ different weapons and special abilities for puzzles and combat.\n\n+ somewhat challenging and unique boss fights. the bosses are quite creative in it's design and accordingly there is a lot of variety as well. in my opinion the boss fights are going to get more complex and strictly better throughout the game. the last ones are an absolute blast to battle!\n\n+ the game is somewhat linear, but there will be freedom in exploring at times and it definitely pays off doing so. a little investment in backtracking is well worth your time, at least if you care about dialogues and for completionist reasons. do keep in mind, if you reach certain story milestones, you'll be locked out of past areas for the rest of the game.\n\n+ gorgeous pixel art and graphics with a lot of love for details. eastward is an artistic masterpiece whit a stunningly detailed artstyle and excellent art direction. \n\n+ well crafted animations which are even more impressive, considering the minimalistic graphics.\n\n+ well composed and sometimes hilarious soundtrack with calm and relaxing chip tunes and other retro themed osts, absolutely loving it.\n\n+ many secrets and chests to be found - i wasn't able to find everything on my own in the first playthrough.\n\n+ decent amount of upgrades, although upgrade materials take quite some time to obtain.\n\n+ comfortable fast travel to speed things up, but honestly i've almost never used it since the game is so beautiful. everything's a pleasure to the eye and a delight to walk through, so simply delve into the affectionate details of your surroundings. usually it won't take long to reach your area of interest anyway.\n\n\n[b]what felt debatable to me:[/b]\n\n~ slow pacing since the game is heavily narrative driven with an abundance of dialogues, which i personally enjoyed a lot. the game is chill, providing one of the most relaxing gaming experience i've ever had and so it shouldn't be rushed anyway. could bother some people tho so i put it into the \"debatable\" section.\n\n~ fantastic opening cutscene with a ghibli-esque art direction which let's you hope there are more of these, but sadly there won't. kinda missed potential.\n\n~ eastward got an okay'ish sense of humor and some npcs are \"tropes\". it's adorable most the time - so i can't complain much, but some are questionable at best.\n\n\n[b]what i disliked:[/b]\n\n- i've had a bug in the shop menu which made it barely controllable sometimes, because the cursor gets constantly dragged into one direction. to fix this issue i've had to quit the shop screen and reopen it. nothing too serious tho.\n\n- the stealth section wasn't that great and kinda infuriating at times. may be a personal issue.\n\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1660567222, "timestamp_updated": 1660567237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808416008949279785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120629418": {"recommendationid": "120629418", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181723453", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1056, "last_played": 1669716857}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.

I watched the original trailer several times and the moment the game released I bought it. To be completely fair, I am aware of the very difficult development process the team went through, I respect them for sticking through to the end. That being said, I just wish they would have delayed the game's release. Between the awful progression system that is downright irritating at times, and the story that hops all over the place without reason or explanation, this game was a quick finish and uninstall for me. The amount of times I have gone to get a chest or something with my brand new ability, only for the game to say \"No! You missed your chance and now you aren't allowed over there!\" when the item is 1 screen away is infuriating. The progression is incredibly linear and forced. Speaking of the story, this game's story bounces all over the place, leaving so many question unanswered. Chapters 1 and 2 set up a decent amount of mystery and questions, the first 2 chapters are easily the best ones. But everything past there is a mess. Spoilers ahead: It is never explained how Alva died, which is kind of a big deal considering how important of a character she is, it is not explained how Isabel knew of Ester City (it is also not explained how she even got to Ester city due to the time fog bs), it is not explained why we fight 3 different Solomons (are they clones? That still wouldn't make sense since the oldest is the last one encountered despite also being the furthest back in time due to the Ester city loop), Ester city being in a time loop to begin with is not explained at all, the fact that John and Sam were magically inserted into said time loop. In all honesty, the villains were extremely boring because nothing about them was ever explained. The villains were simply there. The ending was such a cop-out as well because it was just another \"Oh no! Child is dead! Boohoo so sad!\" only for her to be reborn or something, which is just another thing that never gets explained.

The more you explore, the more tricky the puzzle. At least for me who is not fan of puzzle games or game with a lot of puzzles btw. \n\nSome pixel based games rely too much on puzzle things, at least for some games that I've played. CrossCode is one of example that have a lot of difficult puzzles. Eastward is no exception. It also rely on puzzle that makes my broken controller give me tough time to solve it. I'm not saying the whole puzzle is difficult, its ez to solve but my broken controller makes it more difficult lol.\n\nIn some cases I just, \"please no more puzzle, I just want to enjoy the story, I have a lot of unfinished backlogs\" and that makes me not really enjoy the game.\n\nBut at the other side, I want to know how the story goes, so... yeah, love it or hate it I must finish it.\n\nThe story is sadly not explain a lot, it has strong story at first about 2-3 hours, then, meh and boring. It become little bit exciting when we arrived at some climax of its story. \n\nThere are a lot of unexplained things such as how this become that (no spoiler sorry). Surely in the end, it ends cute but, still, I want to know about what exactly happened in its world.\n\nTo put it simply, the story is all about daily life of John and Sam in mining town, but things become bad after they try to leave the town. Mayor seems has some explanation about why they cant leave the town and it seems he also have some 'contract', but it leaves us as mystery until the end.\n\nThey should've explain the ending about how mayor etc conditions and not leave us questioning about it. \n\nThe character writing is so strong, you will enticed to love or hate them. You will feel devs have gone a lot of hardships writing the characters, it has their own charms. \n\nSadly the plot is not. It has a lot of potential but the linear story not exploring things that should've been exciting to explore.\n\nFor example, what happened to the world by explaining this and that (again, no spoiler). Why they're become like this. What is Miasma, why it exist. Some are quite exciting if it explained properly, but no.\n\nThe music is very good, reminds me to my own childhood playing old Nintendo or arcade games, but it has not much variations. In some cases, they just using the same music again and again for some scenes. Need strong memorable music to represent city or battle or sad scene tbh.\n\nEastward's visual is beautifully crafted for a pixel game. I like how dev set the lighting and choose the color for the game. Some colors explain how the dark and gritty the world is. It may be the best pixel game ever made in terms of visual.\n\nThe world is so much detailed and crafted with love. I loved it. It gives me a nuance that 'it would be good to live there' kind of things in some cases.\n\nDevs should make DLC or expansion about this game's story to explain anything related to its world tbh.

huge Zelda and Earthbound fan, I was hyped for this game.\nNo gonna lie, the visuals are outstanding, the pixel art is absolute top without a doubt, the soundtrack is also charming here and there.\n\nHowever, the Story and the Gameplay were NOT enjoyable for me at all.\nThe story starts alright, the problem is the pacing itself, It's extremely slow, when you reach the fifth hour or so you will be starving to see something new, It seriously feels like the story progresses painfully slow, characters doesn't help much either since the main protagonist doesn't offer anything and a few side characters barely appears, so the only character that really pushes the narrative is the little girl, thing is most of the stuff you will read are either jokes or silly dialogues so I wouldn't expect much on that regard as well, I understand they want to mimic Earthbound on this aspect, making silly and weird moments like that franchise I mentioned, but even Earthbound has a good pacing and UNDERSTANDS the player wants to have a good time but also to progress the story itself\n\nGameplay wise, It's also an issue, I wouldn't complain too much if the gameplay was good at least, but it wasn't the case either, It's fun the first hours but later on, It feels completely bland, the reason why it's simple, the gameplay itself doesn't evolve enough, the dungeons are too simple, as well as the battle system, the difficulty is not that high, not like it matters, especially on a game that seems aiming for a casual audience, but It feels way too simple that I'm not sure a casual player would be able to enjoy propertly.\nPuzzles are extremely simple to the point it requires minimal effort, and so on...\n\nI RARELY drop games, I actually detest to do so, but I had to do it because I wasn't enjoying my time, sure, the visuals are stupidly amazing, but to me, the story and the gameplay are vital, and It wasn't enough this time.", "timestamp_created": 1659299771,

The story is always the focus, and it isn't one where you can make choices that impact the game.  I'm perfectly fine with that, but I think it's important to know this upfront before considering getting the game.  With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  The story was intriguing and engaging.  Not all of your questions will be directly answered, but it isn't hard to piece the puzzle together yourself.  There were a couple writing decisions I don't entirely agree with (specifically the Uva storyline), but nothing that left me bewildered or too upset.  I do wish they had spent a little more time on the final chapter as well, it comes across as a rushed attempt to tie things together.  The ideas are there, expand on them all the way!\n\nThe game play elements are fun, if a little simple.  The combat takes almost a dungeon crawler-type approach, which is right up my alley (for example, it is at times reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda).  You have multiple weapons and abilities to use, and the weapons can be upgraded.  The boss battles are generally straightforward, their difficulty climbing appropriately as you progress.  I never felt blindsided by newly introduced enemies or mechanics, everything was very intuitive.  The graphics are fantastic, some of the best I've seen in the \"modern pixel RPG\" genre.  The music is also wonderfully composed and used to great affect.  It never felt too repetitive or annoying - in fact, I ended up buying the soundtrack on vinyl because I love it so much.\n\nTruly above all, this is a game where you immerse yourself in the story, the characters, the world.  Every single person you encounter has a unique personality.  They have their own problems, worries, and wishes, often times communicated through just a few lines of text.  You absorb all of this when talking to them, and it encouraged me to talk to everyone I stumbled across, whether required or not.  The world building in this game is stupendous, and I enjoyed every second I got to spend exploring it.  You know when you finish a story (be it a book, TV show, or game) and it leaves you with a pit in your stomach, an empty feeling inside?  That's what happens when you've grown attached to that world and the characters, but their story is over and you don't know what to do next.  That's how I felt when I finished this game.  As I mentioned before, I think the story ending could be stronger, but everything else is well executed, so it earns my recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1658866555, "timestamp_updated": 1658866966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581068933010101318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119496116": {"recommendationid": "119496116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880990681", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1063, "last_played": 1679467569}, "language": "english", "review": "I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT JUST TO GET NEAR THE END 10/10 LOVE THIS LOVE SAM", "timestamp_created": 1658826051, "timestamp_updated": 1658826051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119490123": {"recommendationid": "119490123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393530554", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1660702244}, "language": "spanish", "review": "tanasheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "timestamp_created": 1658815725, "timestamp_updated": 1658815725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119475415": {"recommendationid": "119475415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198936785406", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1658722849}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovely adventure.

It's just exhausting. The game wants you to be confused and have everything fall into place for in the end but that doesn't work if your leaving the player confused about more than just the story.

i want to support a studio that went through a lot of turmoil to make this game, but there are some serious fundamental problems i think people should be aware of before they buy this game\n\nthe whole gameplay loop in general isnt particularly deep or engaging. the combat is uninteresting and clunky, the puzzles dont really require any brain power, and most of the quests youll be doing are fetch-quests with no real plot relevance.\n\nthe story is a mixed bag. it starts off very strong, the first two hours or so of this game are by far the best in terms of plot and gameplay, as there is a lot of mystery and intrigue built up around the end of the world and a town mayor who clearly knows more than he's letting on about what happened and a prison break, and a middle aged man seeing the outside world for the first time.\n\nmy main problem with this game is that all of that intrigue doesnt really go anywhere. the story after reaching the second location you arrive at after the tutorial zone becomes quite slow and meandering, and the whole end-of-the-world plot surrounding sam and her powers and connection to the MIASMA that is destroying the world is seemingly abandoned until pretty much the end of the game in favour of cute, but reasonably short adventures in one location that focus more on character writing than plot writing. thankfully character writing is one of the game's big strengths, but the pacing is ruined by this extended series of fetch quests.\n\ni think the main problem is the game wanted it both ways, it wanted some cute soft-apocalypse slice of life stories, and a big exciting plot about saving a broken world from a cosmic evil, but the two never really converge. nothing in the slice of life stuff is ever interesting or exciting enough to really get invested into (as well as often being pretty padded and contrived, like [spoiler] a cooking contest where sam just gives away the main ingredient to the two world liars ive ever seen, whilst john does nothing about this obvious ruse [/spoiler] or [spoiler] the whole section with a bunch of monkeys on a train that are making awful movies that ruins all the suspense built up by the previous drama of an attack on a city and the wounding of a main character for the sake of a 3 hour long joke about how bad these movies are and an unreasonably long stealth sequence [/spoiler]), and the big saving the world story is never really explained well enough to make any sense. its hard for me to even explain what happens in this side of the narrative because i find the overarching plot of the game to be that confusing.\n\n theres a number of sections i think are meant to have narrative purpose, like [spoiler] exploring the older sections of the city that have been overtaken by the MIASMA, and its residents turned into mutated monsters, supposed to show the scale of the threat the world faces [/spoiler], or [spoiler] the final plot twist where it turns out the whole apocalypse was because of eugenics, sam is the sole survivor or a superhuman species that want to wipe out humanity in order to grow stronger, and the MIASMA apocalypse has actually happened hundreds of times over now [/spoiler], but all of those events SOUND much more interesting and engaging than they actually are, because none of it is ever really explained. the plot becomes a lot better after playing because all the superfluous sections are forgotten, and all the story is only explained in as much detail as a faded memory anyway, so you think back on it more fondly thinking theres a bunch of other cool stuff youve just forgotten about.\n\nthis is a good game to buy and play if you like strong character writing, slice of life adventures, fetch quests, and extremely pretty visuals, those are the games core strengths, but its definitely a 'brain-off' experience. you cant think about it too much or the whole thing will just fall apart. i look forward to pixpil's next game because i do think theres a lot of potential in this studio if they are given the time and budget they simply didnt have with eastward, but i do also badly wish this was the game that was advertised by the opening

Salt is just rupees. You also have a bomb, and you also get variations of the bomb, and you get a lot of neat tools to help you explore.\u00a0\n\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nAs I mentioned, this game heavily reminds me of the Legend of Zelda games. For example, to progress, you need to acquire a tool in order to proceed to the next part. Then the next part will heavily utilize this new tool.\n\n[list]\n[*][i] Camera:[/i] Very little camera controls because its a 2D Pixel art game. A way to control the camera is to move around your character or to start charging/aiming your weapon/ability since the camera moves to allow you to see more of where you're aiming.\n[*] [i]Movement: [/i]There are no movement techniques like dashing or jumping, but there is a walk and run animation. You'll be running most of the time tho. Game scenes are small enough that it doesn't feel like a chore to move thru scenes, but to make traveling easier, the game provides a way to get to places real fast, like train rides and fast travel.\n[*] [i]Combat: [/i]Combat possibly gets its inspiration from games like Legend of Zelda and Binding of Isaac. You have a normal and charged attack with your primary weapon, and a bomb, which is a LoZ staple item. As you progress, you acquire more weapons. Like LoZ, there is almost zero random encounters, which means enemies are predictably placed all over the map.\u00a0Lastly, boss fights will always involve a trick, but they're intuitive, so just trust in your instincts and hope that you survive long enough to figure it out.\u00a0\n[*] [i]Economy: [/i]Salt is the currency. Currency can easily be collected by grinding them from mobs. Drops become better as you move to the later chapters. Finding treasure will possibly allow you to have enough money for everything that you need. But if you find yourself poor, you'll have to go out of your way to grind, or find more treasure. There's no passive income mechanic in this game. There is an ingredient inventory, separated from the combat inventory. Combat inventory can be upgraded to contain more items. It is also very easy to run out of items after fighting thru a \"dungeon\" or during a boss fight, so you'll constantly want to get your inventory filled.\n[*] [i]Physics Engine:[/i] There is a semblance of physics engine within the game because of the puzzles.\n[*] [i]Saves:[/i] There are 6 available saves slot. On your first playthrough, you only get to use one save slot. After finishing the game, you're allowed to consume other slots to get back to things you missed out on, via the Chapter Select.\n[*] [i]Minigames:[/i] Yes. There are MULTIPLE minigames embedded in the game. Earth Born is a major minigame within this game and it is referenced within the story itself, so make sure you play it a few times when you encounter it.\n[*] [i]Bugs:[/i] I never encountered any bugs so far.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Music:\u00a0[/b]\nMusic is made by Joel Corelitz, who also worked on Death Stranding and Halo Infinite.\nIron Carbine, Tatari, Heretic Frypan and Final Boss are my favorites, but To My Knight is also such a heartwrenching moment.\n[list]\n[*] [i]Number of Tracks: [/i]There are 72 tracks for this game.\u00a0\n[*] [i]OST in Spotify: [/i]Yes. You can also purchase the soundtrack on Steam to show support.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Story:\u00a0[/b]\nThere are interesting characters in the game that proceeded to be a major driver of the story. However, it seems that their story, motivations, and what happened to them, parallel to the protagonists' timeline, were only shown in glimpses and could be fleshed out in the form of a DLC or a separate story.\n\n[list]\n[*] [i]Voice Acting: [/i]SFX grunts and hyahs. No voice acting for dialogue.\n[*] [i]Multiple Endings:[/i] No. Only one ending. Linear progression.\n[*] [i]Narration:[/i] It is told in the eyes of the protagonist(s). Small, obvious, and targeted exposition, which means the environment only shows the story when it wants to do so. Minimal lore is told wordlessly through the environment. While the protagonist is usually silent, he does speak and is able to have conversations with other people. It's just that none of the conversations is apparent to us.\n[*] [i]Pacing:[/i] A huge portion of your gameplay is spent in the same place from Chapter 3 to Chapter 6. Then afterwards, you'll zoom past everything. This is possibly because I did not have much attachment to the worlds they provided and I just wanted to get them people over with.\n[*] [i]Worldbuilding:[/i] A lot of suspension of disbelief is needed. Salt does not seem like a reliable currency. How do they get dough underground? Why is there only one railway line? \n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Lifespan:\u00a0[/b]\nI would say that after your first playthrough, the magic is gone. Boss Fights will be easier since you understand how their tricks work.\n[list]\n[*] [i]Chapter Select/New Game+ : [/i]Yes, Chapter Select allows this. Food, ingredients, max health, and certain upgrades are kept intact.\u00a0\n[*] [i]DLCs[/i]: This game was released on Sep 2021. There seems to be no news of a DLC.\n[*] [i]Duration: [/i]How long to beat lists this as 26.5 hours for the completionist duration. I took around 39 hours to beat this. Will possibly take more if you include Earth Born.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nThe 2D artstyle is a welcome sight for those who wants to play these pixel art games. It's definitely gonna attract you with how beautiful it is. But there's a lack of it for the worldbuilding that you'll just have to imagine how it actually looks like. Also, the scene transitions between maps for cities might distort your idea of how big or small the place really is.\n[list]\n[*] [i]Graphic Settings:[/i] No Borderless Window support; Art is upscaled at 1080p, and an Oct 2021 update has introduced options for the upscaling method. Very minimal graphical settings due to 2D nature.\n[*] [i]Lighting: [/i]Dynamic Lighting exist, because some abilities produce light. Lighting is also used to provide different moods to locations, such as day/night cycles, imminent world-ending danger, and so on.\n[*] [i]2D/2.5D/3D[/i]: 2D.\u00a0\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Achievements:\u00a0[/b]\nThere are hard achievements for this game, particularly, the Minigame achievements. There's also the Treasure Hunter achievement that will consume a lot of time and effort.\n[list]\n[*] [i]Missable Achievements[/i]: Yes. I suggest consulting a guide for Treasure Hunter to make sure you don't miss out on treasures. A 2nd playthrough of the game will definitely happen if you miss out on treasures. And there's no in-game guide telling you how many you've missed in a certain chapter.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Accessibility:\u00a0[/b]\n[list]\n[*][i] Varying Difficulty:[/i] None.\u00a0\n[*][i] Controller Support[/i]: Yes, with DS4/DS5 Support.\n[*][i] Subtitles[/i]: Yes, and these subtitles are different from the text in the speech bubbles.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Multiplayer:[/b]\n[i] No multiplayer support.[/i]\n\n\nOverall, I really like this game because the worldbuilding is fantastic and it leaves a lot of open areas to make it a new IP. Hopefully, that happens one day. The music really got me into loving it. The BGM during fights just gets my blood pumping and vibing at the same time.\n\nStory, overall, is good. There are things I wanted them to expand on, so I feel a desire to explore more of the world. However, this is a linear game, so not a lot of things are shown.\u00a0\n\nThere is an emphasis on trains, for some reason, but you never get to bond with the train. It's really just a vessel that takes you from one place to another.\n\nThere is a negligent moment of putting \"explore the world again once you get new tools\" on the tooltips. But make sure you reexplore dungeons once you get new shiny tools. Either that or mark areas you've couldn't explore because there's a tool/ability that you don't have.\n\nSo I do recommend playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1657687866, "timestamp_updated": 1657692092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764887511730194092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118713033": {"recommendationid": "118713033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126906351", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2467, "last_played": 1673083417}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game!

It's a linear story and most of the time you run from npc to npc for some text.\n- The story is confusing and misses some clear plot points. Writing could be better.\n- Balance between story parts, fighting, exploring and some riddles could be better.\n- Several ours of playtime were a little bit boring for me\n- Button smashing in some combats\n- No free exploration. Just linear paths.\n- Several side npc are not very important. \n- Most of the time I can't abort the cooking mini game\n- Missed some at,osphere sounds such as wind or other details.\n\nWhishes for next Eastward:\n+ More structure. Think about A Link to the Past: After some story in the beginning you have to get 3 medallions. So you have somethink to do but you have to find out how to do it.\n+ Clear plot points and twists.\n+ Better progress vibes. In Zelda you can see a heart container after a boss and you have to pick it up.

You\u2019ve likely had the same experience as playing this convoluted ass DDLC-aper/Zelda-grubber masquerading as a good time. Eastward is the gaming equivalent of that time Buddy tops his Pop-tart, M&M, and marshmallow pasta with maple syrup in Elf. Legit, I\u2019ve listened to schizophrenic homeless men get their point across better than this, and that\u2019s shout outs to Earl. Even my geriatric grandmother has enough sense to not waste my time with this much fuckshit before handing me some red, cash-filled envelopes.\n\nHyperbole aside, Eastward is a game that plods along to the rhythm of an admittedly fantastic soundtrack, however encumbered it is by the weight of its influences, its mediocre gameplay, and most of all, its overwrought plot. I\u2019ve read beaucoup summaries on what the fuck is going on with the story in writing this little review, and after reading my fifth wildly divergent fan theory, I can scientifically conclude that no one actually knows. I know it\u2019s hard to cast aside the game\u2019s colorfully beatific art style, but if you care at all about the 20 odd hours you will never get back on this shit, I am begging you to throw cake on the Mona Lisa and run the other way.\n\nEastward unapologetically employs a maximalist writing style in execution of the tale it seeks to tell, building in a number of restrained, meditative moments to evoke what clearly expressed story beats would in any other. This is a method common to some of the greatest stories ever told in a multitude of mediums: show, don\u2019t tell. But when you put it in a video game like this, you run the risk of leaving little game left to be played if you don\u2019t also build in compelling gameplay. Eastward treats that risk like a 50-foot ramp to skate down in a grocery store cart without any of the fun that suggests. What's more, by centering the story around a child and her mute caretaker, the game takes a considered choice in taking an ignoramus' perspective on the complicated subjects it grapples with, putting players in an awkward place where there are many questions with no clear answers.\n\nThe lion's share of the game is spent caught between droll conversations with an all too expansive cast and mediocre Zelda-styled dungeons. You literally only need to get from point A to point B; there is little to no challenge to any of it, and the lack of creative ideas to bring to the table of a long existing tradition of play dulls the impact of whatever execution intended. Here, playstyle fails to complement story, both existing in vacuums to the detriment of the other. It wasn't until the final two chapters that the game started introducing fresh concepts that provided a genuine challenge, and by then, they had come so late that they came off more like afterthoughts than the complementary elements they should've been.\n\nI actually feel shitty coming down so hard on this one because it is very clearly a child of Earthbound and Mother 3, two games I hold dear to my heart as all time favorites.

It excels in presentation, provides content for more than 20 hours and, even though the core mechanics may be too simplistic or unpolished for some, they do not stain the overall experience too much, and lets the game be enjoyed as its own thing.\n\nThe art style is stunning. Aside from enemies and a few obstacles, I don't recall any sprite as being notoriously reused throughout the game. Also, as another commenter made me notice, every NPC has their own sprites. Moreover, some of the main tools, like the fridge and the stove, are so well-presented that made me wish I had a physical miniature of them.\n\nThe soundtrack is arguably one of my top-three favorites ever in gaming. Even though it's all retro-styled, the quality that modern tools provide shines in it, merging the nostalgic feel that the retro synths evoke with the melancholy tone of a post-apocalyptic setting. It's surprising how some quite frequent tunes, like Home, Weather Talk and Cooking are such masterpieces despite their brevity, raising the annoyance threshold of having to listen to them over and over again quite a bit. Other longer themes like Eastward, Rust and Strange Quest are top tier bangers.\n\nOverall, the presentation manages to create that sensation of longing that most memorable pieces of entertainment achieve, where you crave for a bit of that weird beauty and fantasy in your real life. The art crew did a really good job in making this pixelated world come to life and be remembered.\n\nThe story is a typical hero's journey, but the context where it takes place makes it quite enjoyable nevertheless. The world is interesting, the characters feel alive, and the underlying lore, although not entirely clear, combines a few ideas (time-travel, dystopian future, life and death) in a very interesting way. I presume that the writers had a very personal idea or something they wanted to say to the world and delivered it through this game. And despite the use of clear references, still came out as something original in the end, at least in my opinion.\n\nMy only complaints would be the excess of sexist humor and the randomness of one of the chapters, which, as several other commenters have pointed out, appears more as a filler than as a continuation of the story.\n\nI feel that the criticism has been a bit unfair for what the game is worth. I had seen some trailers before buying it and, in my experience, offered just what it promised me, no more, no less: a beautiful pixel-art adventure, with an ambitious world-building. The only thing that I didn't consider was that the soundtrack was ridiculously good, so that came as an extra to me.

The various towns, cities and settlements explored throughout the story have a variety of cultural and historical influences from their former selves which make a unique setting to explore. The devs even put a full scale 1980's RPG in the game (in the form of a arcade machine you occasionally find) for the player to explore and try which adds probably one of my favourite bit of side content that I've ever played in a game, it even has a New Game+ which adds a bunch more content to the already optional side-game.\n\nIt has a gorgeous art style that is fun to look at, fun and unique characters that make you want to explore and talk to every NPC in town and an interesting story that stretches over a well made and expansive world.\n\nMy biggest problem though with Eastwards is that despite having all that, it just decided not to do anything with it. There are no little lore dumps that explains the world that they developers have created (which it could certainly use). There are only a handful of side quests to do across 8 chapters and all of them are either hidden or not pointed out to the player making them difficult to find or complete and the combat remains to the very end of the story to be incredibly basic offering little challenge to the player despite the fact that the mechanics to do so are there.\n\nI have these criticisms as someone who went out of their way to get all the achievements in this game, which was by and large a very painful experience. Everything in this game is missable, and I mean everything. From chests to food recipes, shop sold consumables, to ingredients. There is no way to go back and find any of these things past a certain point and that point is frequently the end of the chapter. With the exception of the recipes/ingredients they won't even tell which of those you are missing, just that you are in fact missing them. They later added a chapter selection (after the 1.0 release) after you beat the game for the first time but they don't tell you that until you get there, for those who care that was a great thing to add\n\nDespite those things I think Eastwards is an incredible game, especially for the first game made from this studio as far as I can tell at least.

But it took me weeks to finish the game. Not because it was particularly hard...But because it frustrated me massively.\n\nIt starts extremely strong. Super super good story writing, it really chained me to my PC / SteamDeck. But roughly at half-time of the game, it loses much quality. To me it feels like that some extraordinary storywriter wrote the beginning of the game, had to leave and some intern picked up where he left. There is so much filler that is absolutely disconnected from everything and just feels displaced. Seems like a waste of time and is just plain boring and / or annoying.\n\nThe game builds much on top of it's combat system, but that combat system is clunky and frustrating at times. There are \"riddles\" that have to be completed on timers and those timers become tighter and tighter, but the whole combat / movement system doesn't allow for frustration-free movement.\n\nThen out of nowhere the story picks up again with it's major plot while you were in a silly filler-episode. And so many things weren't really explained well enough. Character development is basically non-existent.\n\nIt is a beautiful game, visually stunning and in theory i would recommend it within \u00b5-seconds. But i had to force myself to play this game to the end. I lost interest so many times, i got frustrated so many times, i was annoyed so many times. All that made me finish that game was the hope that i would return to it's brilliance of the beginning and that it would catch itself and fix everything...It didn't. But i payed for it, so i played it.\n\nSo....this is a beautiful game, that has a very very interesting plot and some charming characters. But i just fails to deliver anything deeper. It fails to build these characters up and develop them, it fails to make any meaningful transition from one plotchapter to the next, it fails to use it's systems to it's advantage because it forces you to do sometimes pixel perfect and extremely tight-timed actions on top of a clunky combat / movement system.\n\nI really wanted to like this game...", "timestamp_created": 1656446109, "timestamp_updated": 1662204002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117802187": {"recommendationid": "117802187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083995660", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1676, "last_played": 1650640789}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Eastward es precioso, bonito, espectacular.

There's very good worldbuilding and a good sense of mystery, right up to the end.\n\nIt helps that the visuals and music are some of the best I've seen in a while. I mean, just look at it!\n\nGameplay is pretty standard Zelda-style fair. It starts out kinda slow, and takes longer than it should to introduce new gameplay elements and tougher combat, but once it gets going it fleshes itself out pretty well. I kinda get the impression that the level and boss designers were learning as they went because there's a sharp uptick in gameplay quality by the last few chapters.\n\nOne hint: Be sure to grab everything on your first pass though because there's frequent points of no return.\n\nThere's also a cute game-within-a-game of a turn based RPG.

Are they good, or do they just LOOK good? Are the reviews good because people enjoyed the game, or they FELT that they need to give the game a positive review? Is the wondrous look a sign of supreme attention to detail, or a pile of wasted resources, diverted from not working on the other, more important parts?\n\nI thought, hey. Maybe this one will be different. Maybe this one actually delivers on the promise, and finally marries the ingenuity of indiedev with the unchained, freeflowing capabilities of modern visual artists.\n\nNope, it doesn't. Or maybe it does, but the flaws and the general flatness I saw in the first 90 minutes drove me away, and I'll never know.\n\nWhat's good about this game? The writing's not terrible, and the rest you can see on the trailer. It's a visual affair first and foremost, down to the UI. And that's all I have to say on that topic.\n\nNow let's get to the bad parts. The first thing that annoyed me is that even in those 90 minutes, it was never clear as to where, or why, I was supposed to go. I quickly caught on that I'm supposed to open the map screen and look at the quest marker - and you'd better do that, because for the most part you're left to your own devices. To be fair, not always, but even then you're given more of an idea rather than specific directions. And sometimes nothing at all.\n\nThen, there's the NPC dialogue. Every time you walk up to someone, your characters line up facing them and the screen shrinks in that letterbox effect. In classic JRPGs, such as Mother 3, this was a signifier or an important conversation; you're entering cutscene zone. Here (almost) every conversation is like this. It's not such a bad thing, if it wasn't for the fact that sometimes you're thinking that there's a follow up to this important part - so you talk to the NPC again, only for the whole letterbox thing to happen again; if your characters say something, this is also being repeated. \n\nThe combat? It's there. I've seen worse. Feels a little like classic Zelda. It's passable, but not very enjoyable.\n\nThe characters. Oh man. There's John and Sam. John never speaks - you can't even respond to conversations in a \"yes/no\" kind of way - and Sam is your typical magical overly excited little girl. I've seen this one too many times to treat this seriously. What's cool is that all other characters have clearly different sprites, with little animations to boot - but they still didn't feel particularly interesting. Easy to tell from each other, but still somewhat interchangeable. What a shame.\n\nAnd then there's ... a game within a game, which seems to be a big deal for Sam and her friends. It's a classic Dragon Quest-style JRPG. Not only it's not particularly fun, but also you know what I do when I want to play a different game? I play a different game. This made sense back in the early 90s, when we were all stuck without internet with just a few game cartridges. \n\nMaybe the game does get better, more interesting; or maybe it gets worse. I don't know. Would you like to find out? Be my guest. Me, I decided to follow a siren song of an animated trailer and I'm a little bitter about my own foolishness. If you decide to follow my footsteps, please at least know what you're getting into.

I had looked forward to Eastward for a long time; I think it had been on my wishlist for years. Finally I decided to try it out... the reviews were in... they were very good. I had seen the beautiful graphics, the great opening anime, and had heard the soundtrack. Everything seemed great. \n\nThen I played it. At first I was disappointed that the animation was JUST for the intro and not interspersed with the story... I thought there would be cutscenes that were animated... but that's a small thing. So what if they invested in a pretty cartoon to sell the game? \n\nThen I was disappointed with the main character... our silent protagonist who has no opinions no matter how good or bad a situation is. The guy who follows around a little girl who will seemingly do anything anyone suggests for no real reason. He has literally no character development, and with the small exception of people saying he liked to drink before he met Sam (maybe he still does?), we have no other background about it. Finding Sam, or perhaps a little before we find Sam, might make for a reasonable starting point... but instead the game picks up well after. You don't see how finding a little girl changes his life. You don't see why he'd want to take in a little girl when there is seemingly no reason he would. This is emblematic of the story as a whole: it just sort of meanders around without really making any kind of sense. \n\nThen I was disappointed with combat. It is terrible and ubiquitous. There is no way to dodge or block, there is no challenge yet somehow everything is mildly annoying (enemies that sit in a spot, impede your progress, and respawn if you  wait too long, for example), the puzzles (only found in combat areas) are also simple to understand and somehow annoying to execute, switching between characters and weapons is clunky, and I need to open a menu to use a healing item. The boss battles are neat, but they are few and far between and certainly not innovative. \n\nThen there was the pacing... all of this might be fine if it wasn't broken up into these huge, bland chunks. First you have a huge block of time running around a map (often changing screens so quickly you wonder why they bothered to make the area you were just in! I literally blinked when going upstairs and missed a map in between the place I came from and the place I was heading to... WHY BOTHER MAKING THAT MAP AT ALL?!) to talk to NPCs who had poor dialog that is often totally irrelevant... and conveniently for the story... John can't talk or think or express ideas to anyone. He just keeps going on quests because Sam thinks it's a good idea I guess. Then you get the quest and it is a huge block of going through screens, fighting the same enemies over and over (sometimes multiple times on the same map). \n\nI didn't even feel good when I got a reward: found a chest that will let me get a heart if I find three more chests (who cares?), more salt to buy ingredients to cook things for my very limted backpack (why bother?), I can finally afford an upgrade to my weapon (too bad the difference isn't noticeable), finally I have found more tokens to get trinkets for the game within the game (oh FFS!). Loot is the bread and butter of RPGs. You should find loot and feel rewarded, gain an upgrade and feel more capable... somehow the game even fails to deliver on that fundamental point! None of it means anything so why bother? \n\nIt's all so amazingly tedious. It literally put me to sleep while playing. I only made it to the combat portion of chapter three, but from everything I've read nothing gets better. I don't feel rewarded by the combat, by finding loot, or by learning more of this story that could be immediately ended if John would only speak one sentence. Instead we are running errands for strangers for no discernible purpose! Why did we even need a job? I have enough salt to buy every ingredient from every shop in town! \n\nThis game could have been so much more... without combat it might have had a great story (like To The Moon) with tighter pacing. If they really needed it to be interactive they could have made it a puzzle game and just cut the combat, maybe interspersing the puzzles within the narrative portions again to break things up. They could have made it more survival oriented where you are constantly moving east on a deadline: something is chasing you and you need to prepare, gather what people and supplies you can, and go before it is too late. Instead it's just so fake: all aesthetics and absolutely no substance. I feel like they invested heavily in the art, music, cartoon, and reviewers; they tricked me and it is too late to get a refund.", "timestamp_created": 1655322122, "timestamp_updated": 1655323445, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732821643352508545", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117005127": {"recommendationid": "117005127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300519854", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1504, "last_played": 1655264377}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1655264856, "timestamp_updated": 1655264856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116993460": {"recommendationid": "116993460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343394887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 890, "last_played": 1655642551}, "language": "english", "review": "A good story, pop culture references, the retro game music for a soundtrack and just plentiful bossfights who pose an adequate amount of challenge..... this game has it all!\nAlso, whoever thought of the jeep ride in Chapter 3, deserves a freaking raise!\nEdit: Sack the piece of sh*t who made the Isabel bossfight thinking the game would benifit from Sekiro's deflecting mechanics in that bossfight... that fight, as well as the stealth sections in chapter 6 are the only bad things in an otherwise brilliant game!\nAlso..\nWHY HASNT THIS BEEN ADAPTED INTO AN ANIME YET?", "timestamp_created": 1655243075, "timestamp_updated": 1655642755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116942262": {"recommendationid": "116942262", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041538301", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2564, "last_played": 1656974933}, "language": "english", "review": "super dope", "timestamp_created": 1655154576, "timestamp_updated": 1655154576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116931635": {"recommendationid": "116931635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844116929", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1322, "last_played": 1655139161}, "language": "english", "review": ">Comes from underground.\n>Doesn't elaborate anything.\n>Doesn't use words.\n>People befriend him anyway.\nhow", "timestamp_created": 1655139769, "timestamp_updated": 1655139769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715225517749786377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116926238": {"recommendationid": "116926238", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970201312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 214, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1346, "last_played": 1655098903}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Art, great story, great music.

The music is fantastic and really grabs your focus while you take in the vivid detail of the visuals in and of themselves. The gameplay is on the easier side, which I'm assuming is good for more casual players with some interesting mechanics in it. Putting aside my personal love of old-school RPGs and developed games within games, The Earth Born game is fun, great retro RPG that has clever, yet challenging mechanics interwoven into the outer game via item collectibles. I'd recommend watching a little early gameplay if you can. The game has good bones, but it really falls apart around halfway from a lack of focus, narrative and worldbuilding. I'd personally give it a 7.5/10 based on it as a whole.\n*SOFT NON-PLOT RELATED SPOILERS*\n[spoiler]The lack of world-building doesnt make you feel like there's as massive a world as what's should be perceived. It's almost as if there was no greater world, game-wise and development-wise, imagined outside of what was drawn in the trailer. The combat, despite being fun, can be too easy and relatively simplistic compared to other games in it's genre, even near the end when things ramp up. If you could roll or strafe in this, you'd be unstoppable with one hand. Good, immersive game mechanics pop up near the end that you don't get any time to get comfortable before it's over with.   If there was more to the story and world to give, then there'd be room for it, but it feels like 2 games sharing half a plot with another game in the middle that's ironically more thought out in some ways than the game itself (imo but it's a simpler game after all). The narrative weakness is what hurts the game the most. The lack of a real, fleshed-out bond between the two characters you're using. One is not really a character, but more of a plot device/game mechanic. There's no Lee/Clementine (The Walking Dead) bond or Joel/Ellie (The Last of Us) bond made here, despite an uncanny resemblance to Joel that could've really helped here.  It has the bones of something bigger, in how everything thematically could've connected better but it all falls apart because after a while, you have so many questions that never get answered before the plot is hijacked and you'll never get back to the greater \"why\" and \"how\" of the events before it's all over. I came in wondering where the road would take them and what would be answered, but left really feeling nothing from not only the questions left unanswered, but left unasked, and how none of it felt like it even mattered in the end. [/spoiler]\n*HARDER PLOT RELATED SPOILER WITH A SIDE OF RAMBLING*\n[spoiler] After Greenberg. The game sets itself up pretty well with the whole \"surrogate father/adoptive chosen child daughter\" angle and teases a Happily ever after for them before ripping it away in one of the worst (best) ways possible whilst revealing the why is something much deeper, advanced and potentially caused by said surrogate daughter. But when it get's to New Dam City, and they try to get deeper and worldbuild, it really backsteps.  I can let the child gambling slide if the government can let EA do it. I can let the town busywork slide because it's nice to be in a static location for a while. I can cook three silly-ass dishes for some soft-ass casino boss because I wanna see where all of this leads, but when you essentially rush to the end and have every character in-between be a plot device that eludes to a history never thoroughly explained in the game, I can't ignore that.\n\nIt's here along with the fact that every single character in this game has quite a bit of dialogue that you really see the weakness in John's silence and how, with rarely even an inner thought expressed, you can't really empathize with him as a guardian or even as a person. Sam talks for him every chance there is and every NPC is written to compliment him to make up for his lack of a soul to the point where Uva's dog has more personality. He isn't there to help Sam grow as a person, he doesn't have an opinion to run counter to anyone's nor is he isn't even there to be as a sufficient placeholder for the player. If you aged up Sam a few years and reworked the game mechanics, I don't think he'd have a purpose thematically. Even his backstory flashback is technically Sam remembering being found. They could've at the very least said that he gave her the name Sam. It would've given her a good primary anchor to the identity of \"Sam\", could've served as the foundation for their relationship and why she's extra insistent on being called by that, because it was the first thing given to her, by the first person she ever knew. \n\nI wouldn't have minded Isabel and Alva's thing hijacking the plot so much if they would've went into greater depth on the past and how they're connected to it other than the stuff after when you fight Isabel, which I feel wasn't supposed to be a first time you fight her given that she's pretty advanced compared to other boss fights and the context of her dialogue during the battle would imply that she fought him before.  (and is wasted multiple boss fight potential imo). \n\nI'm sorry but if one character does something stupid despite their intelligence and it changes the plot from \"stopping the world-ending miasma from destroying other towns full of innocent people to force evolution like the one we just came from and learning why its here\" to \"no time for questions about any established history, civilization or people before all of this, or even how Mother's personal account of things, just find Isabel and Alva\", then that's weak storytelling.\nI'm disappointed Earth Born didn't have greater parallels to the game given the setup. With as many locations that were in it, I thought there would be corresponding locations in real world. Big missed opportunity.\n\nIf they had a lot of ideas that couldn't be realized because of powers beyond their control then I understand, but by the time I hit Monkollywood, I got a little frustrated with having too many questions that not only was nobody answering, but nobody was asking.\nI have two characters; one that denies her past so fervently that it interferes with any exposition, is never explained in-depth nor asked about even when people who knew Mother pop up, and one that's more robot than the robots and essentially exists to chaperone the ultimate lifeform whilst spurring no emotional or storyline development in the process.\n I have Solomon, who's interestingly tied into the game, and teases you with potentially answering some questions about Mother's history but never delivers. I have another train full of movie-making monkeys out of nowhere that's fun but furthers nothing given that the Solomon connected doesn't explain a lot. \nI have no consistency when time distortion is introduced to the story. I have a subtlely advanced yet underwhelming mythical city purported to be the nexus of this evolutionary philosophy stuck in time, but can't accurately explain it's history, citizens nor the actual fruits of the starting humanity over and over  again to never produce a truly advanced society even after countless clones have been created. \nThe end really falls flat imo with a lot of questions just left hanging and leaves you with a lot of flowery, slightly pretentious words about how it's underwhelming ending righted the lost time and saved the world. Since Sam and John don't have a lot of special moments for us to see them develop their relationship, the result lacks impact. I rarely feel nothing after a game, especially a game I actually liked but this one did it. \n\nThere's so much space in-between New Dam and Ester that could've been explored, like Margolari's hometown. \n\nI'm tired of talking so I'm leaving it at this: It has good bones, but it's just that. No meat when you want substance. No brains when you want depth. You look past the aesthetics and perceive something less.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1655007144, "timestamp_updated": 1655007144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608075976371765137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116835813": {"recommendationid": "116835813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142071457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1195, "last_played": 1654982078}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far one of the best indie games I played.

I've seen users unironically say that this should be tagged as a visual novel. While I don't share that sentiment, I can not deny how much dialogue is in this game.\n\nFor me, this game is just barely a recommend. This review is more like an essay/tangent, so skip to \"Closing Thoughts\" after reading \"Gameplay\" if you're not interested in all that.\n\n[h1]Premise[/h1]\nYou play as John, a dopey-looking guy (if you exclude his mugshot in which he looks positively badass) who lives his life as a digger in the underground town of Potcrock Isle. An undefined amount of time before the game begins, John finds a girl during one of his excavations who he names Sam. They start living together as a sort of family, with John becoming Sam's guardian.\n\nThe game starts off with some daily life until stuff happens which kicks off the adventure. You get to follow John and Sam's adventure in which they meet a wide variety of people and visit several interesting places.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is devided into \"story\" areas where you can talk to NPCs and interact with the world, and \"dungeon-esque\" areas where you fight enemies and solve puzzles. These can overlap, but rarely do so.\n\nIn the dungeon areas you can switch between John and Sam with the tap of a button. John does the physical fighting and other heavy-lifting while Sam supports with her strange powers. You can also split up and control John and Sam seperately, a feature used for puzzles. John and Sam get additional equipment/abilities as the game progresses. Dungeons have several semi-hidden chests with extra goodies, such as gear parts, that you use to upgrade John's weapons. This made the loot feel worth going after and made finding these very fun.\n\nThere's a small cooking part of the game in which you pick a few ingredients and make food that you can use for healing and additional effects. Unlike most cooking systems, there is no general \"mistake\" food you can make. All \"unknown recipes\" are actual food items that you can discover by experimenting. This made cooking something actually fun. I was surprised by this.\n\nThe other half of the game is the NPCs and the world you interact with. Not a single NPC sprite is reused for two characters. There's an absurd amount of care put into the world and the characters, and when you're not bashing enemies in dungeons, you'll be experiencing this world.\n\n[h3]Earth Born[/h3]\nThere's a game within this game called Earth Born that you can play in certain shops. This is a simple turn-based RPG in which you go on a quest to slay the Demon King.\n\nYou have 7 days to power up your party and collect items and gear before you take him on. When you die, your party resets to level 1 and you lose all your items. The meta game is about finding a route and strategy on which places to visit in order to get the most powerful party within the 7 days. \n\nEarth Born isn't the main selling point of Eastward or anything, but I found it to be a fun distraction. It's more fun than Eastward itself in some aspects, which is very funny to me.\n\n[h3]Missables[/h3]\nThis game is missable item galore. To echo my TitS review:\n[i]\"Are you a completionist? Stay away. STAY AWAY!\"[/i]\n\nLocations are one-off and are not able to be revisited. This includes dungeons which have hidden chests. Shops have ingredients that are also missable and by extension that makes recipies and dishes missable. Some of Sam's ABILITIES are missable. Side-quests are missable. Do I need to keep going?\n\nI managed to keep my completionist demon locked away for this game, but I put this section here because I know how this can ruin a game for some people (including myself most of the time).\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is slow-paced and takes a while to get going. Even when it does, some parts feel like padding. Despite this though, there were a few hooks that kept me interested. What was Sam doing deep underground, encased in that orange cocoon? Why does she have strange powers? Who is the image of herself she keeps seeing? Will John ever say anything? Chapter 2 spoilers: [spoiler]What is the miasma? What is the purpose of the freaky human lab?[/spoiler]\n\nInteresting things indeed, and good questions! Then when I got to the ending I went: \"Ah. It's one of those stories.\"\n\nBy which I mean that while some of the questions you accumulate indeed have answers, most of them don't. It really feels like mystery for the sake of mystery. There are no answers.\n\nI also didn't get attached to any of the characters other than John and Sam, which is something I see as a failure of the writing. There were clearly attempts at endearing certain characters to the player, but something about the writing and pacing made this not work.\n\n[h3]John and Sam[/h3]\nI say I got attached to John and Sam, but that's mostly by virtue of playing as them for literally the whole game. John is already down a few points by being a silent protagonist who rarely emotes. The moments where you actually get to see John express any kind of emotion are so rare they can be counted on one hand, and even then they are so subtle you can miss them if you look away for even a second. Sam on the other hand, is a bright and cheerful girl who openly expresses her feelings and thoughts whenever she gets the impulse to do so. When no other NPC is available to do the talking, she's the one that does it.\n\nI liked their relationship, but not enough was done with it. There are several hints that John are a bit clueless about how to care for a child. Minor chapter 3 spoilers: [spoiler]For example, Sam is completely barefoot for the first 3 chapters. Another character gives her red boots to wear at this point, which she exitedly runs up to John to show off. \"John! John! Look John, boots!\" John awkwardly looks off to the side and scratches his head. It hadn't even crossed his mind that he should've given her some shoes. She's been running around underground on cold hard rocks with her bare feet. I'd like to think he feels some shame.[/spoiler] He also brings her into dungeons which crawl with dangerous monsters, and leaves her out of sight on several occasions.\n\nBut he gave her a shirt to wear, keeps her well-fed and rested, and gives her piggyback rides when she's tuckered out. He's not cruel, just clueless. On Sam's end, it's clear that she's fond of John. She doesn't blame him for anything and is his biggest fan.\n\nI found their relationship rather endearing, which is why it's such a pity it's not focused on. The journey should've been about them settling into their relationship in addition to the overarching plot. This would've also made the ending parts even better.\n\nThe final panel of the game would've been a perfect opportunity for John to break his silent protagonist trope as well.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nI feel like I'd wrong this game if I didn't bring this up. This is the best part of Eastward. It has some of the best pixel art I've ever seen. Towns are intricately drawn and unique-looking. As previously mentioned, not a single NPC is reused, they are all unique. Animations are fluid and abundant. Lighting is used to great effect. Truly, an absurd amount of work has gone into this part of the game, and I can't deny how good it looks.\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\nI had fun, but several things bog this game down. Pacing that's mostly slow but sometimes is all over the place, filler sidequests that are actually the main quest, missables, filler CHAPTERS, hit and miss writing, story with very few answers, missables...\n\nIf you like a slow-paced story with an interesting world to learn about, talking to NPCs, and a dash of beat-em up style fighting and puzzle-solving, you'll probably have a good time.\n\nIf you're in it for the action-adventure gameplay, dislike long dialogues/cutscenes and MISSABLES, you'll have a terrible time.", "timestamp_created": 1654938128, "timestamp_updated": 1654945071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790327131748199463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116802355": {"recommendationid": "116802355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055876398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1698, "last_played": 1650248477}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful atmosphere even though I haven't played the games it was nostalgic for, but the love that it has for those games really came through.", "timestamp_created": 1654928929, "timestamp_updated": 1681446957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116801407": {"recommendationid": "116801407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840932448", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1421, "last_played": 1655542255}, "language": "english", "review": "Now Eastward is a game that I think deserves a bit more attention than it did on its initial launch. It takes so much from classic Nintendo titles, like the 2d Zeldas and Earthbound especially, and jrpg elements scattered throughout.\n\nThe plot in a nutshell is basically a father-child adventure story that takes you to enclosed communities, open forests, thriving cities, and more as you trek to your destination eastwards. The plot on its own is solid enough but it is greatly enhanced with the inclusion of well written characters, all having their own unique personalities and motivations. The game's best and most emotional story beats come from how the cast interacts with eachother.\n\nThe visuals and music here are just breathtaking in each of their own ways. You can tell how much influence of those retro rpg titles have had on the whole making of the game. And yet, obvious influences aside, the game still manages to make itself stand out in both of those regard.\n\nNow the gameplay overall is the part of the game I have the most mixed feelings about. On one hand it feels really good when you are just casually exploring and solving puzzles. The puzzles being very well crafted mind you. But when it comes to combat, the game really falls apart as it always felt like the least polished aspect of the whole product.\n\nI consider Eastward to be a hidden gem of modern indie rpgs with how gorgeous the artsyle is, varied soundtrack, great cast, and its all wrapped around with a bittersweet story about love.\n\n8.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1654926805, "timestamp_updated": 1654926805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116800993": {"recommendationid": "116800993", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061366210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1659064751}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En primer lugar no esta en espa\u00f1ol as\u00ed que si no hablas ingles con fluidez no te enteras de que va el juego.

I really loved this game. It just really grapped me and made me want to keep playing. And I will explain why further down, but just know, that the criticism I'm going to give the game didn't really matter to me in the long run, and I would honestly recommend anyone try this game, if you can handle the very slow pace and a lot of dialogue. Just please complete the first chapter or 2 before you start judging the whole thing. As I will explain later it does have ups and downs and the first chapter is not what the whole game is gonna be like.\n\nSo first of all the art, music, dialogue and sound design is all top notch. The sprites are all distinct and no character looks totally the same. They really put a lot of effort into having a very wide cast of colorful and weird characters, of all shapes and sizes. I really loved all the characters  especially in chapter 2-5. \nThe gameplay is very standard, but does evolve over time. I wouldn't say it's great but it functions for what the game is trying to accomplice. \nThe puzzles are not too hard, they start out very easy and get \"harder\" but I was never stuck on any part. The boss fights was all pretty standard, but none was horrible to go through. \nOne minor point is that i feel like a certain boss got repeated way too many times. \nI really enjoyed the boss before the endgame boss the most, cause it wasn't like any of the others, which you can mostly just spam attack and damage tank. I didn't feel like i needed to learn how to dodge, when spamming the weapon you get from chapter 2 forward and healing worked fine. \nOverall the basic gameplay was fun enough to keep me hooked, and there was suprises and mini games along the way to spice things up. \n\nNow one thing that annoyed me a lot, was the stealth section later in the game... That really wasn't fun, but it was thankfully short. \nAlso i really disliked the whole premise of chapter 7. It was really tedious to play and probably my least favorite part of the whole game. Overall after chapter 5 I feel like It takes a slight dip in quality in terms of the gameplay, and It feels like the devs are padding the game and making it longer... \n\nIt was kinda annoying that enemies respawn if you leave a room and come back, so if you get knocked into the transition between rooms by an enemy you have to re-enter and kill everything again.. Doesn't happen that often thankfully and maybe I'm just a doof. Also you can run past most enemies, so it's not a huge deal.\n\nall and all even though i did feel like the game was dragging a bit and it never really peaked after chapter 3-5   it's still kept me going to the end, because i just enjoyed myself despite the things i disliked. I will not spoil the story but I felt like it concluded nicely. \nAs mentioned above I really only recommend this game, if you can handle a really slow pace. It's a very solemn and existential game, but it also has a lot of light and funny moments, and heart warming scenes between all the characters.", "timestamp_created": 1654829951, "timestamp_updated": 1654870173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116736181": {"recommendationid": "116736181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867469695", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1682407674}, "language": "english", "review": "that fucked me up\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1654804009, "timestamp_updated": 1654804009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116694787": {"recommendationid": "116694787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301834615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1088, "last_played": 1661995329}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1654723134, "timestamp_updated": 1654723134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116692406": {"recommendationid": "116692406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190970782", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1655073296}, "language": "english", "review": "wow. yes. bowsers inside story", "timestamp_created": 1654719410, "timestamp_updated": 1654719410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116685045": {"recommendationid": "116685045", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000102475", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1657986615}, "language": "english", "review": "niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "timestamp_created": 1654708461, "timestamp_updated": 1654708461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116670401": {"recommendationid": "116670401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056336580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1470, "last_played": 1654611897}, "language": "english", "review": "A very looooooong pan", "timestamp_created": 1654685449, "timestamp_updated": 1654685449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116667831": {"recommendationid": "116667831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194505993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1738, "last_played": 1654428537}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me cry I love it.

It reminds of how I got into gaming in the first place... character build up, humour, awesome music (by the composer who worked on Unsung Swan and Death Stranding ) and surprises. Eastward has heart - it reveals biases, daft idiots, the neighbour next door, the dude in the shop, friendship and teamwork. Just a couple hours in and wow I've got that addicting feel again, something not had for a while. Story telling is fantastic, it starts gently then pulls you in bit by bit. John is our next door dude - he's down to earth, says little, supports Sam even when she gets rebellious. He's the dude you can rely on to get things done. After an hour playing Eastward all that crappy stress from work is washed away.  There's some puzzles which get a bit tricky... Hint... learn how to smack bombs cos they'll get you out of difficult places. This is not Doom or CoD (so don't expect to get a dopamine rush or mindless action to chase 1000 points to get a colourful name tag), but more along the lines of jrpg's adventures like Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Trigger with a Secret of Mana battle system (not as complex though). \nAfter 15 hours, it's still a chill pill. In another dimension this game could be called a Chilled out journey to the East. There's a bit of a mystery but won't get too deep into it. Like who is Sam? What's happened to the planet? My only gripe is I wish there were more tracks. The few in there are great, but would like each dungeon to offer it's own score.\nAnyways, after coming home from work with a buzzing headache, 30 mins of Eastward and it's gone.

Even near the end it somehow just fell absolutely flat for me.\n\nBut really a wonderfully crafted game and probably a hidden gem to others. But I just don't want to touch it or give a hoot about it existing. Just \"another game on the shelf\" so to speak. There are my own opinions, granted. Hope others out there enjoyed it. I'm sorry I could not be one of them.\n\nPS - For what its worth, the sprite animation is truly phenomenal.

As a fan of Earthbound, I was looking forward to playing this game since I discovered it.\n\nWhat I specially like about Eastward are the story and the characters. The story will take you on an emotional journey where you will laugh, cry and be amazed at how extense the world of Eastward is. And both protagonists are lovely: Sam is an energetic, funny girl and John is a calm, silent man. I don't particularly like the choice that John doesn't speak at all in the game, but I was still amazed at how well his character was developed without him speaking. Eastward also shines a lot with the side characters. There a lot of memorable characters with insteresting backstories that you encounter throughout the game.\n\nThe game focuses a lot on the story and has a lot, a lot of dialogues. And I also feel like it has some filler that could have been cut from the game to make it a little bit more concise. I don't mind this a lot, because I really enjoyed learning more about the world of Eastward, but it may seem boring to other people that just want to experience the main story of the game. There are some slow parts of the story and some incredible climatic parts.\n\nThe gameplay is mainly focused on exploration and puzzles. It isn't something too unique, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. The puzzles are fun and there are some interesting mechanics in the game. I specially enjoyed that you can swap characters at any time betweem Sam and John and that they both have useful, unique abilities.\n\nFinally, the soundtrack is amazing. I played Eastward almost two months ago and I still listen to some of the songs from the game to this day.

"english", "review": "Eastward is a lovely game that manages to capture the feeling of adventure that Earthbound had like few others of the many inspired by it. Some people may be turned off by the slow pacing, but I think that the slice-of-life sections enhance the great narrative of a dangerous, dying world seen through the wonder-filled eyes of a young, optimistic girl.\n\nThe production value is off the charts, and employed brilliantly. Almost every single NPC (and there are many) not only has a unique set of (beautiful) sprites and animations, but their own personality and substories that make the world feel much more real and cohesive, as well as get you attached to it more. Eastward does not have the best gameplay, settling for a fairly basic if very serviceable Zelda clone with some twists, but oozes so much charm from every single aspect that I never found myself bored. \n\nSpeaking of production value, the pixel art is some of the best I have witnessed in any videogame. Every single location, even the biggest or least important, is adorned with detail, and every NPC is full of personality. Even most of the way into the game I found myself stopping to marvel at the level of detail that went into every single aspect of the art as well as many of the gameplay mechanics. A Dragon Quest spoof that holds a small role in the lore of Eastward's world is entirely playable, quite engaging and filled with its own secrets, there is a Breath of the Wild-inspired cooking system but with dozens of specific recipes, all with their own art and flavor text, and as mentioned before, an incredible amount of NPCs have their own little, unimportant substories that you can follow. Perhaps more importantly, the game is always funny and endearing, and sometimes heartwrenching or thought-provoking. There are some minor issues, like a very annoying stealth mission and a slightly underwhelming penultimate chapter, but the game stays strong for the great majority of its substantial runtime of about 20 hours.\n\nAbsolute recommendation for all but the least patient of gamers, which might find themselves a bit frustrated with the pacing of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1651788210, "timestamp_updated": 1651788800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715132713317871094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114996578": {"recommendationid": "114996578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012548743", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1021, "last_played": 1651769727}, "language": "english", "review": "Having just finished the game, I really enjoyed my time with Eastward. It's not perfect, but still a charming game, and I'm eager to play whatever Pixpil will put out next.\n\nThe game has incredibly detailed and vibrant pixel art, both for the environment and the characters, a great soundtrack and lovable characters throughout. Combat and puzzles are enjoyable, though both stay kind of simple even during the endgame. I still had fun throughout my whole playtime, though I can see how it can get too repetitive for some players. I personally enjoyed the ability to switch between John and Sam during gameplay, and how this affected puzzles.\n\nMy personal con would be the games pacing, and the story in the latter third of the game (Story Spoilers: [spoiler] particularly after leaving New Dam City, as I personally didn't enjoy the Monkollywood chapter, and how much additional questions are added to the games mystery during the last 2 chapers, while staying overall pretty vague with the explanations [/spoiler]). The game often throws a multitude of cutscenes at you, only occasionally interrupted by simple fetch quests, followed by more cutscenes. But whenever you get to explore a new area or play through longer gameplay sections, the game really hits it's stride.\n\nIf I had to rate the game on a numeric scale, I'd give it a 7-8/10, but depending on how you enjoy the story, and how much of a dealbreaker the rather simple combat is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1651770772, "timestamp_updated": 1651770772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114940513": {"recommendationid": "114940513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198824324849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1695269340}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Spanish please", "timestamp_created": 1651677364, "timestamp_updated": 1651677364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800908684730529785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114905676": {"recommendationid": "114905676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112702767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1351, "last_played": 1651626593}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a gift well-received; a bargain at $20.\n\nIt's a pixart action-RPG with immediate charm.

It does take a lot of inspiration from EarthBound, but mostly just its tone. Mother 3's slogan \"strange, funny, heartrending\" would probably apply here, somewhat. Mechanically, it's an action game that plays a bit like A Link to the Past. It has Breath of the Wild's cooking minigame, and also an entire game-within-a-game called Earth Born (get it?) that actually plays and looks very much like Dragon Quest.\n\nBut enough about what it derives from, let's talk about what Eastward does by itself. Eastward follows the story of a man, John, and his adopted daughter, Sam, who get kicked out of their underground home and have to venture across the ruined surface world. Along the way they stumble on some ancient conspiracy that Sam has some unclear at first link to. And they'll get to meet a lot of people, some good, some bad, but most complicated, and eventually change the world.\n\nThe art is gorgeous and the music really slaps. Actually I can't overstate how good the game looks. Finally, an EarthBound inspired game that doesn't look like a Mother 3 romhack, but has its own style. Every nook and cranny is incredibly well detailed, cities are full of life, dungeons are mysterious and foreboding. \n\nGameplay involves controlling either John or Sam or both to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. John is your standard action protagonist, and Sam has supportive abilities, and you can switch between the two, and keep them together or even split them up to solve problems like it's Banjo-Tooie. I didn't end up using Sam's abilities too often, it was just more expedient to shotgun my way through most enemy encounters with John. That said, there's cool bosses and plenty of hidden secrets to find if you like exploration.\n\nSo, let's talk about the thing most people might find problematic here: this game moves slowly, very slowly. At the time of writing, the any% speedrun world record is slightly over 7 hours long, which is half the time I actually spent finishing the game as a casual player. Granted, I barely touched Earth Born, but still. Most of your time will be spent watching cutscenes, and in a 2D top down game that means reading dialogue. A lot of the plot gets padded by what you could consider filler, which isn't helped by the fact that the \"mysterious conspiracy you discover by accident\" trope means you only discover the overarching goal when you're almost done with the story, so at many points in the game the narrative feels like it meanders around with no clear objective. \n\nJust like Mother 3, the story is chapter based, and most chapters involve moving to a new location, which has the side effect of making side quests impossible, since you might not be around later to turn them in (which is probably why they made Earth Born, which serves as basically the one side quest for the whole game).\n\nBut of course this all has a point: to make you spend time with the world and its characters. And I felt like that was a worthwhile trade. The game is full of interesting people that you want to learn more about, and it is cool to learn about the communities you visit. But, of course, you might feel different. If you're not a fan of somewhat contemplative character studies, you might come out of this thinking that a quarter of the story could be excised without losing anything meaningful.\n\nOne thing the game does not do very well is foreshadowing. By that I mean that the game will pretty much tell you in advance about things that will happen, and is not subtle about it. Whenever some catastrophe happened, I saw it coming. Either my brain is bigger than I thought, or Eastward is a bit too obvious about things. Or maybe that was the whole point. What this mean is that the bits that probably were meant to tug at my heartstrings just fell flat. Hence why I'm not sure \"strange, funny, heartrending\" fully applies here: it's strange, for sure, and really funny at times, but you can't really render a heart without the element of surprise.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed it. No matter how fast I would mash through some of the dialogue, I still wanted to power through to see what would happen next to those characters I learned to care about.

The story itself is interesting enough, albiet a bit predictable at times. The main duo in John and Sam are captivating and likable enough to keep you invested, as are most of the NPCs you encounter. If you're looking for a story-rich and easy going game with plenty of visual style, I recommend giving Eastward a try.\n\nThat said the game does lack in a few places, primarily in the gameplay department. While by no means bad, the core gameplay loop of combat is a bit on the simplistic side, with little variation as the game goes on. And while the story is fine enough to keep you going, pacing does drag a bit at times, often with very long cutscenes and dialogue expositions between relative brief moments of actual gameplay.\n\nOverall Eastward was an enjoyable experience and worth a playthrough, the final act in particular made excellent use of the game's core strengths in visuals and story. My only issue is that as a video game it can be a bit simple and repetitive at times.\n\n7.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1648660199, "timestamp_updated": 1648660199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113003198": {"recommendationid": "113003198", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995431394", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1431, "last_played": 1648528523}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and writing are charming, although linear.

Each region is a sight to behold and even random houses and shops are given a lot of attention.\n\nMost of the cast in this title consists of unique characters with very few examples sharing the same sprites. The game does its best to give every character, even the most minor ones, unique looks and personalities of their own.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787164462\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfaeA smooth gameplay experience[/h1]\nEastward's gameplay is done from a top-down perspective, or bird's-eye view. It can clock anywhere from 12 to 20 hours depending how slow you want to take it.\n\nUnlike most games of this genre Eastward follows a linear, chapter-based, storyline with little space for exploration and rarely offers sidequests. You move between regions after certain chapters but once you leave one you cannot go back to it.\u00a0\n\nWhile exploration is not the main focus of the game, some chapters feature larger open areas for you to visit and find secrets.\n\nControls are fluid and work very well. Although a controller is recommended, the Mouse + Keyboard setting works just fine and there weren't any notable issues with it, be it during combat or during puzzle solving.\n\nYou also have access to a very simple cooking mini-game, which has a slot machine to get better bonuses, and cooking is one of the best ways to get potent healing items early on.\n\nLastly there's Earth Born, a side mini-game highly reminiscent of old era RPGs as well.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc67Our two heroes[/h1]\nDuring your journey you'll control two characters: John and Sam. Both often travel together and you are able to freely switch between them (once you've gained control of Sam) and there will be times where each character will have to go solo for a while.\n\nJohn is often used to break things or move heavy objects out of the way. He is also the main fighter of the duo and will be used to kill 99% of enemies you'll face. Sam on the other hand can interact with the environment granting access to more places or dealing with stuff John can't break, however she can't kill the vast majority of enemies on her own.\n\nPuzzles often rely on each of the characters unique aspects, such as John's strength or Sam's power, sometimes requiring constant switching between each to open paths so they can progress. Most of the time the puzzles are fairly simple and don't get too difficult, although some can give you a moment of pause.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udde1Combat[/h1]\nFighting in Eastward is simple and straightforward: as John you whack things using a frying pan, or blow them up with bombs, or blast them with a ranged weapon. You are able to upgrade John's ranged weapons with gear parts found in chests.\n\nSam gains a ranged power that can paralyze enemies and leave them vulnerable to John's attacks giving good synergy. She also has access to other (optional) powers, but Sam's role, for the most part, remains firmly on the support side.\n\nEnemies come in a decent variety and you'll fight the small ones, big and beefier ones, and the annoying fast moving ones. All in all, the combat can get pretty intense at times.\n\nThere are also boss battles and most of them are well done with a few of them having certain gimmicks, but the game never gives you specific tools to fight bosses and leaves up to you to figure out the best strategy for them.\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfb6An amazing soundtrack by Joel Corelitz[/h1]\nJust like any story-driven game, Eastward features a great soundtrack library. The music from the game adds much to the current events of the game and enhances its atmosphere to a greater degree.\n\nMany of the tracks are instrumental in nature, but there's the occasional tune reminiscent of the 8-bit era which, thanks to the ambiance of the game, doesn't feel out of place.\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udf20Play it again, Sam (and John)[/h1]\nAfter you beat the game once you'll gain access to a \"Select Chapter\" option which amounts to a New Game Plus, allowing you to restart any chapters you desire. This alone can increase the replayability of the game by a good amount.\n\nBut some may ask: \"What's the point of playing it again?\" Maybe to get a chance to replay a part of the game you liked one more time, rewatch a cutscene you wanted again, or fight a boss you liked once more. Or maybe to find those treasure chests you may have missed in your first playthrough.\n\nThe interesting part about the Select Chapter is the amount of options given to you: the game allows you to keep your progression (Health and Upgrades), start with a pregenerated save, or start without upgrades.\n\nGames featuring New Game Plus are increasingly rare nowadays, so having one that does it, and does it in such a thoughtful way, is a big plus.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787167677\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udca6Shortcomings:[/h1]\nEven though it's a good game, this title has some problems in certain areas.\n\nThe story the game tells is fairly predictable and it doesn't have many surprising twists which, for a game that puts such heavy focus on them, is a bit of a let-down. For every moment that you play it's easy to guess what the outcome of a plotline will be or even what will happen to some characters (although the game did shock me more than once).\n\nThere's also the feeling that some characters are not fully explored or could've been made more important, held more weight to the story while other characters seemingly have important roles, but end up contributing very little to the plot overall.\n\nCutscenes sometimes drag on for a while at times, sometimes for too long, and at points where you might be raring to jump into action. There is no option to skip any cutscenes at all here.\n\nWhile the ambiance is done right, the dungeon design is always very simple, sometimes too simple. There are not many of them that require exploration and many of them are as linear as the game itself.\n\nSpeaking of exploration, there is very little of it in the game which is sad, maybe even wasteful, given how well crafted and beautiful the world of Eastward feels.\n\nPuzzles are not the high point either and while there are good ones, especially towards the end, but for the most part they're very simple and never feel too challenging.\n\nCombat itself feels a bit too plain and basic. While John has a fairly decent arsenal at his disposal, Sam's is locked into a single ability as the others take a long time to recharge which makes you feel like you should use them as sparingly as possible.\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcadFinal thoughts:[/h1]\nEastward is a charming game and, although a bit rough around the edges in certain places, it never fails to do what it proposes to: it tells a good story, has fluid combat and nice puzzles going for it-- all with great graphics and a fantastic cast of characters.\n\nIt's easy to see how much thought and care was put into this game and playing it was wonderful and memorable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1648443170, "timestamp_updated": 1651883293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861562848091125488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112940476": {"recommendationid": "112940476", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040438848", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4314, "last_played": 1680073790}, "language": "english", "review": "OBSESSED!\nyeah thats all i have to say", "timestamp_created": 1648418053, "timestamp_updated": 1648418053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506988584995269775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112935386": {"recommendationid": "112935386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075150465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1830, "last_played": 1645070873}, "language": "english", "review": "This is game gives me nostalgia.

It's all fine and dandy except for one thing. The story is lack luster. I wouldn't consider it the worst written plot but leaves you filling in the blanks. On the surface level it is great... that's it... just great. Which is kind of a shame because it had so much more potential. An almost masterpiece. Did I enjoy it? Yeah I absolutely did which is all that counts in the end.\n\nIf plan on getting all the achievements keep reading:\nMost things in the game are missable such as store food, ingredients for cooking, chests, etc. There is NO backtracking once you complete a section/chapter during your first run on the game. luckily for you, after completing the game you have access to  \"extras\" which allows you to travel back to previous chapters while keeping all the stuff you've earned. Here's the problem: there is NO cut scene skipping. This is a extremely tedious task to do because these cut scenes are sloooow that drag on and on one after another. You'd think that would of been an obvious thing to add to the game but NOPE. Have fun with that! It took me an insane amount of time struggling to remember what chests I was missing and had to constantly hop onto chapters which took forever to get to. There is no checklist for the missing ones so you just have to guess what chapter they're in. So here's a tip: your main priority should be those chests. Look up a guide. Make SURE you get every single chest before moving with the story. Don't be like me and leave it to be the very last thing. Another note, regarding food from stores. They refresh every now and then so keep an eye for any food you haven't eaten yet. Some ingredients and food are chapter locked. There are also cooking recipes that are ingredient specific and so keep that in mind.", "timestamp_created": 1648378418, "timestamp_updated": 1648378418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112885882": {"recommendationid": "112885882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283076640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1938, "last_played": 1682191139}, "language": "english", "review": "a little long but good!\n", "timestamp_created": 1648340193, "timestamp_updated": 1648340193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112877247": {"recommendationid": "112877247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196974217", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1515, "last_played": 1648327788}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't get it", "timestamp_created": 1648327808, "timestamp_updated": 1648327808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112872049": {"recommendationid": "112872049", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964316710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1082, "last_played": 1658635144}, "language": "english", "review": "Followed this game for years prior to release.

The gameplay is poorly paced and never rises above OK. The story ranges from OK to bad filler of an anime/tv show. The style and the world are almost worth playing the game despite its issues, but I wish the game was 10 hours shorter.\n\n[h1]Gameplay [/h1]\n  You play as both John and Sam as they team up to go on adventures. Using John to melee attack enemies and his bombs to solve puzzles. While Sam gets a ranged stun that doubles for some puzzles. \n\n  The combat is slow and clunky because your character gets no defensive options, and hit detection is spotty at times. Stunning with Sam then switching to John to kill is never worth it, because enemies recover too quickly. The later weapons feel bad to use, and later enemies charge quickly at you making it so either you have to play defensively or trade hits, both of which make the combat drag.\n\n  Puzzles in the game can be really enjoyable, when they split up your characters so Sam and John are on different parts of the room and have to help each other, it can be really fun. The issue is that most puzzles are not that, and tend to be simple walk around and use your characters ability to progress. In the final dungeon there were a pair of puzzles on right and left which was just using Sam's default attack to get around, the issue was it was the same exact puzzle, but reflected so you did the same \"puzzle\" twice in a two minute span.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n  The story has a huge problem, John is a silent protagonist which can be fine if written well. The issue is that the character never takes an action so I don't know if John cares about any characters outside of Sam. It's always Sam who speaks up for John, so it feels like John is a nothing character that is just there to do gameplay. Later on in the game a character declares their love for John, and I go \"why?! You've known him for a day, and he's literally said nothing.\" After 21 hours with this game, I still don't know who John is and that bothers me considering he was there the whole time.\n\n  The plot itself is OK, but some of the filler was driving me nuts early on. The whole 2nd chapter could be removed, and no one would notice. Later on, you do a fetch quest to get a thing, and right before you hand it in, another character goes \"oh, can I have that?\" and Sam being the creampuff that she is, just gives it to him. Then we have to do another 2 hours of running around to make up for that. There's not even a good pay off for that, it just felt like a waste of time.\n\n  Others have mentioned it, but later on in the story it gets a bit unhinged/kingdom hearts/legend of zelda timeline levels of magic evil darkness. It makes the later chapters feel cheap, because there never seems like there's any logic behind the \"villains.\" \n\nEnd of game spoilers [spoiler] The story claims they are making a greater better humanity and I get the impression that the god figures created let the power go to their head, but they all seem crazy when you meet them so it's hard to say if they were following any sane plan.

So here's my review:[/b]\n\n[b]A somewhat good game with a decent story, so I'll still recommend Eastward.\nMight want to consider giving this game a chance during a sale.\n[u]But make sure this game is for you first.[/u][/b]\n\nMusic and the graphics/artstyle of the game are easily the strongest features of this game.\nThe setting and atmosphere of the game are another strong point. I think I liked every location with the exception of the location on Chapter 6.\n\nPuzzles, which utilized both player-controlled characters were quite decent.\n\nYou will spend most of time watching cutscenes or talking to NPCs so be wary of that.\n\nCombat is a little basic and quite easy - I didn't die a single time throughout the entire game.\nEven the bosses were so easy that they felt like regular enemies.\n\nYou could technically tank all enemies since you have a lot of health and you get so much health from the food you make - you can even pause during combat to consume as much food as you want effectively turning you a god. \n\nThe minor exception is only the boss right before the final boss of the game - that was the only time I felt  nice to not only tank. That specific boss was a lot more decently designed compared to other bosses on the basis that she wouldn't drop dead after 10 seconds. Introduced a cool parry mechanic as well which you would only see again at a portion of the final boss (which was a shame).\n\nExploring was unfortunately lacking a little as well, because your path was severely restricted, either by natural blocks (e.g. thorny bushes you need to burn later) or by NPCs (Sam: \"we cannot go there, we need to go there first, John!\").\n\nThe slow start on Chapter 1 and the entirety of Chapter 6 also severely kill the pace of the game, the tension really started building up after Chapters 4-5 but then you go on Chapter 6 to do boring minigames.\n\nAt least you can skip Chapter 6 after completing the game, since you are given the option to start at specific chapters\n\nSome twists that take place on the final chapters don't make sense, for example [spoiler]how did Isabel know how to merge Charon and Alva, and why does Alva return as a ghost after merging with Charon? Why does Sam even come back to life after Charon is defeated?[/spoiler] \n\nThe game won't give answers to some questions that are raised throughout the story, but this isn't always necessarily bad, for example [spoiler]with the case of Sam[/spoiler]. However, there were cases were an answer to some questions was clearly needed to explain these twists - [spoiler]like the case of Isabel, Charon and Alva[/spoiler] - otherwise these twists feel like they come out of nowhere. To think of a comparison, see how Leila suddenly flies back to the starship after being blown out to space during the Last Jedi. \n\nIt sucks because these could have easily been solved with a few additional cutscenes and/or changes to dialogue, for example [spoiler]Isabel learns about how to merge Alva and Charon from the Mother or from Solomon[/spoiler].\n\nIt really felt like there were twists simply for the sake of having twists.\n\nAnd speaking of having things for the sake of having things, can I also mention that the game will also throw at you random out-of-place and borderline NSFW stuff like [u]stripper outfit you need to retrieve from a brothel to give to a character during a sidequest or a \"glory hole\" machine on a monkey train of all places...[/u] Yeah.\n\nStill a decent game, but quite a shame as the game clearly had potential to be much much better with a little more time and a little more direction.", "timestamp_created": 1647621961, "timestamp_updated": 1647622764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544270813465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112416555": {"recommendationid": "112416555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076884529", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1652989406}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game so far.

Along with a companion system that is very well done; being able to switch between one and the other on the fly with the push of a bottom, and each with their own traits, making the feeling of taking down an enemy with both of their skills easy to pull off and satisfying when it hits.  That along with how the gameplay can feel like it is changing with each level, while still keeping true to its identity.  Plus the inclusion of a game within a game (if you haven't played it yet, you'll find out) that goes even further to the retro style.\n-Finally the story: Oh my god, and anyone who makes the false claim that video games aren't art, need to just stop talking.   I was invested from start to finish.   NO SPOILERS, but the narrative is very well told.  I can't say there isn't a character that wasn't entertaining.  When the emotions hit, they hit hard.  And I got to say, this game probably has one the best silent protagonists, even able to present him with character without ever saying a single word.  While there are some parts that might feel like panning to some, I personally still enjoy them because it introduces more likable characters, while presenting others as very three-dimensional.

The visuals are outstanding if that's not obvious from the trailers. But you should only actually play this if you're a stupid nerd who doesn't mind reading, cause you're gonna be doing that for a good 60% of your playtime.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's literally Zelda but you play as two characters. The combat's incredibly basic, which isn't a bad thing except that it takes until halfway through the game for the more interesting enemies to show up. Puzzles are pretty straight forward, but satisfying (you won't spend hours stuck in a dungeon confused).\n\nWhen it comes to the story, it's a plot that I feel like I've seen before, but done pretty well. The main duo is very charming, and the towns you run across each have great purpose in the plot, and are just fun to explore. The only main gripe I have with the story is that I'm not super interested in the main antagonists.\n\nThe music's incredible, although I have one pet peeve with it. You'll be listening to a lot of the same upbeat cutscene themes over and over during dialogue. HOWEVER, the town, dungeon, boss, and overall rest of the soundtrack is amazing and really sets the mood they want for the game.\n\nLast thing I want to mention is that this game does a good job with its moments.

However, I am glad to announce that Eastward nailed it. Well maybe not the monkeys, but anyone else you meet will be great. They have their unique motivations, back stories, and fantastic visual design. Eastward shines in its artwork and carefully crafted facial animations and more. The journey I took with this game was long and very interesting. I won\u2019t deny the story did leave me confused at times, especially when the time concept got introduced, but overall, it was great and really felt outstanding in the pile of 2021 games that I have played. Honestly, as you play the game you see how much love and care the developers put into this. I got nothing but praise for this apart from a few nitpicks here and there. The soundtrack is always fitting and memorable, beautiful even. Food cooking reminded me of Zelda but had its own use and we will leave it at that. My only complaint is the combat. Even if it is a big part of the game, something more puzzle like would\u2019ve suited it more. The last few boss fights really showed how a more pattern-based combat could\u2019ve been more enjoyable even if repetitive. I would have rather had pattern-based combat of some sorts than a one move-based combat. Yes, you have a nice arsenal of tools at your disposal, but in the end it all comes down to John swinging his pan in the same motion repeatedly. In any case, the nice balance between puzzle solving, fighting, and exploring made combat a nice change of pace and the boss fights were great that I am willing to accept the version we have even if I would have loved a dodge button. Overall Eastward is a very interesting game, at first, I had no idea what I had gotten my self into, but the more I played it the more invested I got. At times it felt like a children\u2019s story and at times it rivaled the seriousness of games like God of War.", "timestamp_created": 1644267312, "timestamp_updated": 1644267312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109729886": {"recommendationid": "109729886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198427706093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1644252360}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of bugs make it very hard to play (crashes, being stuck out of frame).

Sometimes, though the bizarre plot got me confused and even frustrated as I couldn't understand some things, eventually though I figured it out. It's just confusing sometimes, that's all. The game is good, there weren't many fun things, a had a few laughs, but most of the time you just explore and read a lot of dialogue with very different characters, and not all of them are quite charismatic or interesting to talk to. The main protagonist doesn't any emotions, I don't even know if he has a personality, he is mute, doesn't speak much and you don't see any kind of emotions. He did show some emotions at a climax in the ending of the game, which was quite satisfying to see. This game is great, I loved the ending, the overall story is beautiful and interesting, the actual gameplay though might be a little tedious. Sometimes too much. I would rather read a book of Eastward or watch a movie (If they existed of course) than play it for 17 hours. Just a thought. 9/10 would be cool if they had some merchandise, I would kill for a Sam figurine\n\n__________________________What I hated, but it's not that big of a deal________________\nSometimes the same animations that are used and you've seen them several times gets annoying, like when you obtain a key or open a chest, it's just too long. Some cutscenes are too long to the point of annoying you out. \n\nWhat I disliked very much is when characters start rambling, the dialogue is just being skipped, you can't figure out, what are they talking about, and it's sometimes quite confusing. I hate this part, it didn't happen that often, but I am curious, so it was quite annoying to not being able to make sense of what they're talking about. \n\nPuzzles and fights were cool, game mechanics are working great, except mini games when you have to push the button at a certain point of time, this thing works kinda bad. There is a boss fight revolved around this, she swings her katana several times, and you have to parry the attacks, but the controls get laggy and you miss half of them or all of them, even the character just keeps swinging in wrong direction. This was the most frustrating thing\n\nAlso not a lot of explaining in the plot, you pretty much have to figure out for youself\n______________SPOILER ALERT____________________\nWhen I encountered Solomon on the monkey train I thought that this was a skip in time because of the fog, and the kid Solomon somehow got out of New Dam City and grew up as a teenager  I guess. And then in Ester City we encounter the old Solomon, I was very confused, like how the hell did he appear in an Ester City. It was never explained that Solomon created clones of himself, never explained who was Solomon, did he create Miasma, was he creator of Mother? What is going on, who the fuck is this antagonist? His goal was serving the Charon I guess, but I was just frustrated with this, only when I read in wiki fandom I found out that Solomon has clones.\n\nI didn't not understood the bit about  Alva in chapter 8. Is she like Sam? Born in a factory? What were those countless pods of Alvas? She has clones too? Why can't Isabel activate one of those clones and not just I don't know leave it behind? It was implied Isabel gave up and I don't know - just left. If Alva is dead, what will happen to those clones? Are they gonna die too. So many questions, unanswered, I don't get it.

Unfortunately, this is its only plus. The rest of the experience is a boring mess, a rambling chaos: \n        1) the plot makes little sense, for multiple reasons, e.g., the characters' motivations for adventuring (repeatedly risking their lives): the protagonist is a mute miner about whom the player knows nothing else nor will learn anything during the game; the co-protagonist/damsel in distress/little helper/daughter/... is a sort of magical creature/messiah/ghost/... with no other reasons apart from an instinctual curiosity for doing what she does and travelling the world; the world itself is as shallow as it can be, reduced to the basic terms both conceptually (nothing is told about it) and practically (your path is traced, rigid and limited); other characters are a mixture of freaks and stereotypes.\n        2) the game has no clear identity: it is inspired by classical Nintendo (FC, SFC, GB) RPGs but (as other reviewers also noted) consists mainly of clicking through dialogues, which are nauseatingly lengthy and terribly stupid; there is no need to play the Earth Bound mini-game, despite its being repeatedly mentioned throughout the game and often accessible during it (which is a pity, because merging the two experiences significantly would have given the experience some originality); vast parts of the plot and consequently the level design are incomprehensible/absurd, i.e., inconsistent or not justified enough in relation to the world building and (non-existent) lore, the sort of settings that could only be justified by asserting that the whole thing was just dream or something like that...\n        4) Many characters appear inserted wantonly, without finding any sensible justification. This does not impact the main characters for the sad fact that in most occasions they make even less sense. Relationships between characters are childish or utterly nonsensical throughout the game. As other reviewers noted, this is extremely serious a shortcoming for a game whose experience is dialogue-centric.\n        5) Dungeons do not make any sense, for the simple fact that they are not supported by any lore and therefore are as absurd as graphically pleasant, with enemies and puzzles as basic in their patterns as nice they are to look at. Gameplay in combat or otherwise hastly phases is not bad but could benefit form a different solution for controlling weapons, because with a mouse (I played with mouse and keyboard) it is too easy to turn towards a wrong direction, thus complicating otherwise pretty smooth encounters. The cooperation between the protagonists to solve part of the puzzles and an almost negligible part of the fights is a plus within this subset of the game experience but nothing so relevant to make me recommend it.\n        6) The music is unbearably repetitive and the grunts of the protagonist in combat unpleasant.\n\nAs a whole, Eastward can be seen as a sketch of a real game, a demonstration of Pixpil's potential, which has not bloomed yet.", "timestamp_created": 1643936374, "timestamp_updated": 1643936374, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567162215709686279", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "109423792": {"recommendationid": "109423792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064189190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1643922957}, "language": "english", "review": "+Visually mesmerizing.\n+So many unique locations.\n+Soundtrack is absolutely amazing.\n+Memorable characters and objects/vehicles.\n+End game bosses are well done.\n+Comes with an ingame game.

Sometimes it\u2019s a pleasant surprise, sometimes it's a disappointment and Eastward may be leaning a little too far to one side.\n\n[h2]Overview[/h2]\nIt\u2019s important to understand what exactly this game is before going into it. Because if you look at the trailer and the screenshots and all that, you might get the impression that this is some sort of Zelda-like action RPG. In reality, it\u2019s more of a visual novel that just happens to have a little bit of Zelda-like action RPG gameplay and some puzzles too.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nThe gameplay is less \u201cgood\u201d and more so just \u201cbasic\u201d, without much depth or really anything noteworthy about it. The puzzles are decent enough, but the combat is laughable. You simply hit your one button to swing at things until they are dead. You unlock new weapons as the game goes on, but instead of being better weapons, they\u2019re just more gimmicky and clunky compared to the one you started with.\n\n[h2]Story/Writing[/h2]\nThe bulk of your time (like 80% or so) is going to be spent reading dialogue and going through the story. As a visual novel fan, I am very used to this approach, but at the same time, that also makes me very susceptible to poor writing and that is unfortunately the case with Eastward.\n\nYou get this really cool setting and base plot and then an overall story that moves at glacier pacing and with some of the most overwritten dialogue I have ever seen in the genre. Conversations or scenes that could be cut to just a few lines are instead extended to last for dozens and it\u2019s honestly worse than some of the bloated visual novels I have read.\n\nThe entire thing is overwritten and prolonged, with too much unnecessary dialogue, tons of slow panning camera shots dragging out scenes, and a surprising lack of substance given the sheer amount of words used in the game\u2019s conversations.\n\n[h2]Game Loop[/h2]\nThe game quickly becomes this pattern of: read a bunch of dialogue, go from point a to point b, sometimes engage in combat there, more dialogue, head back to point a, more dialogue, and repeat. This becomes more prominent after you reach chapter three, which has you running to and from a city completing the most mundane of tasks. Unfortunate, because the city also demonstrates one of the game's strengths: its art and music.\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nWhat was once one of my most hyped indie games of the year quickly devolved into a boring loop of barebones combat, running from point a to point b, and so much dialogue that the game could easily be completed in a third of the time if the filler were cut away. Overwritten dialogue and story does not equate to good writing and that\u2019s ultimately what killed the experience for me.\n\nFollow my [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/3215371]Steam Curator Page[/url][/b] for more reviews + videos!", "timestamp_created": 1643399965, "timestamp_updated": 1643399965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70581519603729248", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108961909": {"recommendationid": "108961909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043877492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1643330956}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game that I really wanted to like.

For everyone else who was not turned off by this. Read on!\n\nPros\n- Your main melee weapon is a damn FRYING PAN.\n- An very unique and colorful take on a world that is trying to turn over a new leaf in the wake of an apocalypse. The world building and presentation always gives off this \"hopeful\" feeling juxtaposed against seemingly bleak odds.\n- A strong and colorful cast of main and supporting characters with distinct perspectives on the current situation of their world. The characters complement the world they live in very well with their \"just taking it day by day\" kind of attitude that gives off a certain relatable \"realness\" even though some of them can be downright wacky sometimes with their exposition.\n- A heartwarming story that takes a bit of time to get going. I really think the second half of the game after Chapter 3 is where the game's story and world are slowly fleshed out in a satisfying way\n- Very focused and phenomenal chiptune soundtrack that sets the mood just right, be that a creepy ominous situation or a very comedic one.\n- Fun Zelda inspired levels that has some fun challenges and unique puzzles that aren't all too frustrating head-scratchers.\n- Earth Born, the game within the game of Eastward is a welcome, enjoyable, and challenging addition to those who want to get their classic JRPG gears going. Its heavily inspired by the Dragon Quest/Warrior games with a slight time crunch twist and a unique item system represented by pachinko toys you acquire with tokens in Eastward's world. \n\nCons\n- Aside from my warning at the very beginning, the game's first three chapters are incredibly slow with overly drawn out fetch quests that seem to only exist to pad out the game's length. I've seen and read that this is where people usually drop off which unfortunate since it really gets going in Chapter 4 when the plot starts to pick up the pace and gets more focused. \n- Overall meh and serviceable combat system. Even though I'm given a number of weapons as well as powers, I really only used one or two of them to get me through the entire game with the others sort of feeling like gimmick weapons. Also, I REALLY wished they incorporated a dodge roll system as a majority of enemies in the game just tend to run up to you head on.\n\nConclusion: a lovely, cute, and heartwarming modern homage to everything we love about classic JRPGs and Classic Japanese Action Adventure Games. Even though it starts off pretty slow and has some questionable pacing, it certainly still paid off seeing it all the way to the end.", "timestamp_created": 1643328434, "timestamp_updated": 1643328434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108908145": {"recommendationid": "108908145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199030119174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1644261276}, "language": "spanish", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1643326328, "timestamp_updated": 1643326328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108891954": {"recommendationid": "108891954", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017178933", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1653331023}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, a great story.

All of the towns and backgrounds have an equal amount of time and attention put into them as well, very beautiful looking game, and the visuals are easily the best part about this game.\nGameplay 9.5/10:\nEverything about this games mechanics feels fully fleshed out, bosses and puzzles don't get repetitive and all feel unique and using new ways to use the tools given to you.  The dungeons feel just the right amount of length, I feel like some games dungeons like crosscode for example seem to run way too long (for my patience at least) but these feel the perfect length. The last two boss fights in this game are incredible and honestly I replayed them a couple times bc of how much I loved them. There's also a completely bonus in-game minigame which is a rougelite turnbased rpg that is very fun and I'll probably come back and put a few more runs into even though I've already beat the main game. The only complaint I have about the gameplay is when you and your buddy are traveling as a unit, the back one has a hitbox and can receive damage.  They do walk quite close to you but it's killed me more times than I can count and I personally find it very annoying especially with this games limited movement.\nStory 8.5/10:\nI think the story in this game is good but I have a couple gripes with it.  Keep in mind these are nitpicks that probably only bother me and you will probably have a better experience than me.  That being said, this is a grade-a, hot steaming example of why I despise the silent protagonist trope.  Sam alleviates this to some degree but the amount of things that happen right in front of John's face and he just sits there and stares. At least animate like some facial expressions man idk.  Like the arc of Isabelle is so good and works so much better for a main character of this story but it's just not the case.  Like I seriously think you can change like 3 story points to replace john with Isabelle as the main character and I like the story aspect like 3 times more.  I can't dock too many points because I think the story is very good otherwise and in the bigger picture a silent protagonist doesn't matter that much but I just find it painfully annoying.  One more thing about the story that includes spoilers, [spoiler]and this is another trope I hope dies along with the characters that are supposed to.  Seriously, why build up that destroying mother would mean that Sam would clearly die too, but then bring her back in the epilogue for no sensible reason, this is how you make me leave a game mad, thats what happened, the ending was so good and impactful and then the epilogue happens and I'm just fuming.  The least your can do is make it ambiguous and not explain how it would make so much sense for her to die. [/spoiler]  Once again this is a very personal opinion and you probably won't have any problem with it yourself.  I know I spent this entire section complaining but the story 90% of the time is good, the characters are charming and entertaining, and it knows how to get serious and hit you hard when it wants to.\nMusic 8.0/10:\nA pretty good all around soundtrack but there are probably only a couple songs I'll come back and add to a playlist, very solid though overall for the game. Some of the 'dialogue' tracks I call them got pretty annoying overtime though as they were used for like every dialogue cutscene maybe just needed something a little more subtle.\nAveraging the scores leaves this game with an overall with 9/10 which is quite deserved for this game, definitely would recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1643224913, "timestamp_updated": 1643224913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5813484787940979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108813694": {"recommendationid": "108813694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060192642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 890, "last_played": 1643469756}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful pixel graphics, great storytelling, memorable characters.", "timestamp_created": 1643200042, "timestamp_updated": 1643200042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108790290": {"recommendationid": "108790290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137227857", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1645, "last_played": 1643837496}, "language": "english", "review": "If you mixed the elements from Zelda, Mario & Luigi and Earthbound, I think this is what it would come out, and I enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1643161459, "timestamp_updated": 1643161459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580705404281616211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108734829": {"recommendationid": "108734829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210792775", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1565, "last_played": 1643387153}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros.\n\nGame is very pretty. \nMusic is good.\n\nThe game within the game is fun to play. \n\nPan vs sword. \n\nThe opening animation is a very pretty lie. \n\nCons\n\nQTEs in boss fights\n\nVery linear gameplay and simple puzzles. \n\nShitty diet version of Joel and Ellie with none of the charm.  \n\nPadding in the form of fetch quests or talk to person a then do it all over again until you reach person d to advance the plot.

An example of these games would be Undertale, Paper Mario: TTYD, Earthbound, or Wandersong. All of these games can be innocent fun, where both children and adults can enjoy them as there is no need for extremely dark themes or violence for older players to have fun. A game for children however is one where more complex themes or perhaps more dark jokes are avoided, where the characters are as generic as possible and the main plot never rises above the typical good/evil formula.\n\n    I knew going in that Eastward was going to be a bit of a slow burner based on the reviews. I thought that would mean that given time, Eastward would build up to be something more, but when act two hit I knew that it would never be more that what it already showed. When you want into small village, you meet a women you tells you to go meet the mayor. Within 10 minute, she un-ironically attempts to asks you blushing in a dress to go out on a date with the whole town backing her up. Literally the only prior action to this is wacking a couple of pigs with a frying pan. I'm not asking for an intricate high-brow story that defies all pre-conceived expectations with detailed in-depth unique characters, but there is only so low I can set the bar.\n\n    I should also note that, as you already know, the actual gameplay isn't anything to to talk about. You could compare it to classic 2-D Zeldas, but somehow it ends up being even more simplified than that.

This usually isn't a problem, but sadly the game fails to deliver in all other areas including characters (development), dialogues and the overall story.\n\nThe pacing in Eastward doesn't help either. It starts you off with the right 'adventure vibes' but that starts to fall apart around chapter 4. Although you can't grasp the full story you can't shake off the feeling that you are playing some kind of filler content. I'm not saying that everything in the game amounts to nothing, but the sheer amount of characters that get introduced and dialogues that play out feel extremely bland. You will remember those, not for the unique situations but for how tedious it drags on and on and artificially stretches the time you have to spent to get through the game. Around chapter 6 one thought started to cross my mind quite often: [i]When is this finally over?[/i]\n\nThe game takes inspirations from all the right places (90s anime, videogames like Earthbound/Mother 3) but it doesn't help Eastward have its own identity.\n\nTook me around 33 hours finish. You can probably finish it in less if you march through the game and don't look for treasure chests, cooking all recipes or playing Earth Born (retro rpg minigame within the game which was quite fun!). I can't help but feel that the game could've achieved the same (if not more) if it was 20 hours shorter.\n\nThe main problem with Eastward is that it's offers a really engaging start only to slowly but surely replace that with most tasks being a hassle to do.

The simple, character focused storylines and character quests ground this game and give it a certain charm that just makes you smile.\n4. As more of a casual player, I enjoyed [u]the relatively simple combat system[/u] displayed here. It isn't overly burdensome, but still allows for enough interesting mechanics and pathways to keep things fresh. \n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n1. Although I've enjoyed the combat so far, I can't help but feel [u]this game could have benefited from even more combat throughout[/u] to break up some of the narrative sections of the game. As I said, I'm more of a casual gamer myself, but even so, I found the game to drag significantly towards the middle.\n2. That brings me to my last complaint, which I'll basically sum up as [u]issues with the overall length, story, and pacing of the game[/u]. Eastward is a beautiful, charming game with lots to love as a casual gamer. Even so, I definitely felt the burden of this game's slow pacing. I'm about 15 hours in with no real understanding where this story is going or how long it's going to take to get there. Right now, I'm simply meandering from one low-stakes quest to the next with no real signposting of how this fits into the overall structure of the game. While I've enjoyed the simple, slice-of-life stories told through the calmness of the game, it's becoming increasingly difficult to stay focused within the game with no clear goals set before you. If this was 100% a casual game, this could have worked. However, with the sporadic combat and larger narrative moments sprinkled throughout, you're continually reminded that a larger story is going on in the background. You're just not included on what that story is, how it relates to your presence in the game, and when you will actually get back to that story.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nEastward is a joy to see, hear, and play. It harkens back to simpler times in life and puts heavy emphases on the small moments. It's truly something special and I'm glad this game exists with all of the nostalgia it brings. The pacing isn't great and the game struggles to find balance between its overall world story and the intimate moments of the everyday. I think with a slightly tightened up mid-section and perhaps a bit more from the combat/action - this game would have easily risen to one of my all time greats.

I do like the game, and I'd recommend buying it more than I would avoiding it, but only by a [i]very[/i] small margin. \n\nThis game had some pretty high highs, but it also suffers from having just as low lows in my opinion. There are 8 chapters in total, and while I was having a blast with the first five, the game takes a nose dive at the 6th. I found the actual gameplay passable; Nothing amazing relative to similar games I've played, but its mechanic of swapping between John and Sam, the two main characters, was interesting, and overall actually playing the game was bearable enough to keep me interested in the real meat and potatoes; that being the story, and environment and whatnot.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, I absolutely loved chapters 1 through 5. The game was still somewhat challenging at this point, the story was lighthearted fun that was carried mostly by its colorful cast of characters and gorgeous visual, all topped off with a looming sense of mystery, and a desire for answers. I was seriously debating whether or not I should recommend this game or not, but honestly the first two thirds or so of this game were just that pleasant.\n\nThen, of course, comes chapter 6... The best way I can put it is that everything from that point on feels like it was handed off to an entirely different team of writers who had no clue what was going on. The narrative they were going for gets completely abandoned in favor of something else entirely, the mystery is completely forgotten about it seemed, and is just haphazardly explained right before the penultimate boss, and all in all it just seemed like a jumbled mess. It wasn't [i]all[/i] bad, as the few returning characters from chapter 5 and prior were still pretty good, but after waiting so long for this game, it's hard not to be seriously disappointed.\n\nI could absolutely see myself going back to replay it, but only up until chapter 6; at which point, I'd just close the game and pretend I just played a really long demo to a game that never fully came out. Maybe the devs could do better with a sequel, and learn from their mistakes, but for now, that's all I've got to say.", "timestamp_created": 1642208876, "timestamp_updated": 1642208876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108012730": {"recommendationid": "108012730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150062381", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1642135979}, "language": "english", "review": "I have a few mixed feelings about Eastward but overall I feel like the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nPositives:\n-John and Sam make for an adorable team. John's silent protagonist angle works really well coincided with Sam's childlike wonder and curiosity. They have strangely good chemistry despite John never saying a word.\n-Art and music direction is beautiful. Some really well done sprite work and the tracks fit all the moods really well.\n-Combat feels satisfying, thought a little simple.\n-The games highs hit really hard. The emotional beats come through quite nicely.\n-Some clever and well written dialogue.\n-Once the main cast is established they have solid moments.\n-I personally really like the ending. Leaves things a little more open ended than they could have been but in a way that still feels satisfying to the journey.\n\nNegatives:\n-Game has some definite pacing issues. Some chapters feel like they needed more exploration and others feel like they drag.\n-Some of the side characters fall a little flat and the ones that are developed well wind up not getting used very much.\n-The story runs in circles just a little, and takes too long to find its footing. [spoiler] It would have flowed a little better if not for getting stuck in New Dam City for so long compared to the other locations in the game. [/spoiler]\n\nIf you're looking for a more story centered RPG, you'll probably enjoy Eastward. There tends to not be a lot of combat so if you're looking for something a little more action packed, you won't find it here.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

This game is great. I love it. I won't spoil the ending but it was definitely a phenomenal one.\nThe pixel art in this game is jaw-droppingly beautiful at ALL times. The music is great. Gameplay is great.\nI don't need to say any more about the good aspects of the game. It's just good.\n\nAnyways, that's enough gushing. Onto the few gripes I have with this game. No game is perfect, and eastward definitely has a few flaws.\n\n- The lack of unique music\nMy biggest gripe is that there is a LOT of reused music. I don't know if I'm just spoiled by games like undertale or what, but I found there to be a severe lack of music in this game. There's 72 songs on the OST, definitely not a number to scoff at, but with a playtime of about 24 to 30 hours, you're going to be hearing a certain few songs a LOT. There's a theme for silly things, evil things, happy things, and these themed songs get reused over and over. It got to the point where I could predict exactly when one was going to play. While this isn't the biggest issue in the world, it really kinda got on my nerves when I heard the same \"oh here's some quirky characters! here's the quirky character theme!\" music over and over again. For this reason alone I recommend you enjoy this game in chunks. Play a chapter or two, then take a break for a week. This way, the repetitive music won't drive you insane. Now that's not to say the music is bad. Far from it, actually. I LOVE Eastward's soundtrack. I just wish there was more of it to love.\n\n- The Beginning\nA lot of people seem to complain about this game's writing. I personally loved most of the writing and it drew me into the game's story, characters, and world; However, the first few chapters are really jarring, and it's not until a few chapters in that you really start to get used to the game. The first few chapters just kinda give you whiplash. They're not bad, they just confused me as a first time player.\n\n- Other small nitpicks\n> The way assets in the game are layered makes certain things, such as your weapon, get cut in half sometimes when brushing up against objects. Not a huge thing, but it kinda bugged me a little.\n\n> The cooking mechanic is great. Love it. But the ability to skip the little cutscene that plays after you begin to cook seems to... disappear at random? Sometimes I can skip it, sometimes I can't. There was a section at the very end of the game where not being able to skip the cooking cutscene kinda killed the mood a bit.\n\n- Conclusion\nOverall? I think if you like a good pixel indie game, you should play Eastward. It's fun, you get really attached to the characters and the world, and it's just overall a really really good game. While I have some gripes with it, overall it's an extremely polished experience, and if anything I think you should play it just to gawk at the pretty pixel art alone.\n\n8/10. Love this game.

I'm a big fan of SNES RPGs and pixel art games so that is what immediately drew me to this game and it is still the game's biggest strength. It's great to see what a well-made modern, 2D pixel art game can look like in the modern day. Characters all have interesting designs and are very well animated.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay and the story don't live up to the same standards and let the game down. Gameplay is very shallow and basic. Despite looking very much influenced by them, this game is not an RPG. There is no levelling up in the traditional sense and no weapons/armour to buy and equip. The game is entirely linear and things like weapon upgrades are mostly tied to the story. Instead, you just run from screen to screen fighting entirely optional enemies for no real purpose. Outside of a few mandatory fights tied to progression, you can skip combat entirely to no detriment. You might as well, because combat is extremely basic. There are no interesting combos to pull off, almost all enemies can be killed in exactly the same way, and there's no real reward for killing them anyway. Change screens and they all respawn anyway.\n\nThe shallow gameplay might be OK if the story was any good, but it raises more questions than it answers. The game introduces plot threads and side characters that never go anywhere and just get forgotten about. I kept playing thinking the game would eventually fill these things in, but it never does. These are some very fundamental questions about major characters too. Questions like: [spoiler]Who is John? What is his relation to Sam? Why was Sam found in Potcrock Isle? Why does Sam just forget major events, like Greenburg? Why has she forgotten who she is (or will be) and why does she have the split red/blue personality thing? Why does William have a robot called Daniel and a real son called Daniel? Why does robot Daniel need an operation? What is the relation between Alva and Isabel? Isabel suggests she was 'made', not born, for a purpose. Why and by who?[/spoiler]. The most the game will do is hint at answers to some of these questions and you have to infer the rest. The problem is, this extends to major antagonists like Solomon and Charon too. Who are they and why do they do what they do?\n\nIt's a pretty game but ultimately that's all.

The actual gameplay is incredibly simple Zelda-esque puzzle dungeons with a neat 2-person switch mechanic.

It shares a lot of themes with Mother 3, which is completely fine, but it's not really delivered well. It's hard to explain something so subjective but the dialogue felt very stiff and unnatural. The characters themselves from what I've played are very one-note, and it doesn't help that the main duo might be the worst part. Having both a gruff silent protagonist and an energetic kid sounds fun, but the former ends up standing there doing nothing most of the time outside of gameplay, and the latter is really overplayed and just has way too much text dedicated to shouting about whatever is currently happening in the story.

I want to give this warning to the people who are considering buying Eastward. If you are looking for a \"life changing story\" and a \"Zelda-like gameplay experience\" like some of the reviews are promising then you will probably be disappointed by Eastward.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nIts easy to praise Eastward on some corners. You would be hard pressed to find a person that wouldn't call the visuals beautiful, Sam has a nice energy to her, and the music serves its purpose even though the game could benefit heavily from more tracks. I wont dwell too much on these positives because they have already been stressed more times than you could count in other reviews, just take note that those aspects are there.\n\nThe main gameplay of Eastward would make you believe that the game is meant for young teens, I'm not a god gamer and I was almost never at any real risk of dying with the one exception being the epic anime samurai battle vs Isabel. Weirdly enough after this fight comes the final boss in which I only got hit once, The main reason why the game is so easy is it utilizes Breath of the Wild's food system which was one of that games biggest detriments. Since you can eat at any time during battle with no cooldown your healthbar isn't actually how many hearts you have its your number of hearts plus the amount of hearts you can get in total from all the food in your inventory which is an insane amount so getting hit is never really a threat. The puzzles are also very simple, I don't think there was a part in the game where i had to think for more than 10 seconds about what to do. None of this is inherently bad because Eastward is very much a narrative driven game, after all 75% of your time in Eastward will be spent reading dailogue so having easy access gameplay ensures everyone will get to experience the story. The problem with this is that the game depends entirely on the story, an area in which it falls flat.\n\nthe first two chapters of the game is strong and a good setup, The people in the potcrock isle think that the outside world is a dark place plagued with maisma and believe in dark god Charon (which is just a train). We as a player and sam as a character who has seen the outside world know that this isn't true and it makes us excited to get out of potcrock isle. The great part is the twist in which the miasma is a real plague and Charon is a real threat. This was a great twist and a good way of getting the player invested in the story and mystery. Unfortunately this is as good as the narrative gets and if you are interested in the mysteries that the story poses you are going to have to wait till the very end..... in which your questions will still not be answered. This is a serious problem in Eastward, it eludes to so many big reveals and that \"in time you will understand\", makes you wait for the entire chapters 2-7 in which the main story isn't progressed at all and mysteries are just reiterated, and then either very loosely gives you an explanation or doesn't mention it ever again. After playing Eastward i'm still just so confused about what what actually happens that it makes the ending, which tries to be emotional, just feel empty. Sam is explained away as a perfect evolutionary being but lacks everything that that would entail, such as omnipotence and omniscience. Instead she can just use magic? Why does Sam have a second soul bipolar personality living inside her? I understand its suppose to be her from the past but it's very apparent it's an entirely different entity that thinks and acts purely independent of Sam. Why was Sam asleep in a chamber underground in the first place? did she lock herself down there to stop the factories from activating? if that were the case she could you know.... just stop activating the factories. Who even is Solomon? He is very involved with time science but that doesn't really explain why there are three of him at different ages running around and why the keys that they have open the final door in Charon. Isabel is Heavily alluded to being a robot/test tube baby like 3 times and then never mentioned again. what was the cure that Isabel and Alva were searching for to? Why does Sam merging with mother at the very end stop the harvest? Why can Alva just be a ghost???? All of these are questions that I didn't have answered to me playing the game. I can infer possible answers to a couple but they remain pure speculation without concrete evidence. The longer I sat through the ending of Eastward the more and more I feel like it was taking heavy inspiration from the End of Evangelion, there's a lot of similarities to be seen between the two. What made EoE work despite its janky convoluted plot was its interesting characters and themes. Eastward has neither of these things, John is a silent protagonist that just does whatever, Sam is cute but not interesting, Alva and Isabel are somewhat interesting and their conflict resolution is alright but not enough to carry the game. The game almost has no themes or philosophy besides the refrigerator you save at that talks like a 15 year old kid who just read some John Locke and then smoked weed. The game tries to be philosophical and hits towards some deeper meaning but never talks about it.\n\nEastward wears a lot of its inspiration on its sleeves. Earthbound is the most obvious but I was initially surprised to see just how anime influenced it as well. The most obvious one is Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli as Miyazaki is a shop keeper in the game but given a different first name. I don't mind media showing off what inspired it and you are allowed to deviate from it but you should still be in the spirit of what is inspiring you. What I'm getting at is it's almost insulting to show off Miyazaki in a game where you add ample amounts of fanservice. The game goes overtly out of its way to add in a bunch of anime horniness whenever it can and It gets weird. At the very least the brothel in New Dam City makes sense, making us retrieve a dominatrix outfit from it is odd but it makes sense in the world. But for the love of god please explain to me why the monkeys have a virtual anime cat girl glory hole machine? like seriously? and out of the three girls that have some importance in the story and aren't 9 why do two of them have to have comically large chest? Ulva is a mature woman so i can see her character design reflecting that but its still out of proportion. And when you see the Alva replicas inside Charon my god they are just massive and for what? it doesn't add any personality to the story or characters and it doesn't serve any theme so why?\n\nEastward is far from a bad game but i seriously don't know who I could recommend it too. If you wanna play for the gameplay the story takes up too much time. if you want to play for the story the gameplay will be a boring slodge to get through, the non main characters aren't really interesting at all, and nothing really happens till chapter 8. And if you wanna play for both then you will probably be disappointed by aspects of each. The easy gameplay and nature of the story wants you to think its for kids but the off the walls story and \"adult\" moments makes it seem like its aimed towards an older crowd. \n\nthe most enjoyable time I had in Eastward was playing Earth born, in which I got both endings. I think Earth Born was a great addition to the game however whoever on the development team designed the gull knight fight can perfectly parry my ass.", "timestamp_created": 1641141902, "timestamp_updated": 1641184234, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76511228084564209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107150460": {"recommendationid": "107150460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041872457", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1843, "last_played": 1641138729}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story, there were some touching moments.

There's also a game-within-a-game; a small sort of roguelite take on classic JRPGs called Earth Born tucked away in many of the hub areas.\n\nSo far, I think the best way I could sum up both the praises and criticisms of this game is just by saying that it's very Chucklefish. It comes with all of the hallmarks that you'd expect from a Chucklefish game: There's a big focus on gorgeous visual design and animations to the point where the pacing sometimes feels sluggish, similar to how Wargroove could feel frustratingly slow; a lot of the dialogue tries to be that corny sort of charming, and some of it falls flat and feels almost irritating instead; there's a lot of super clear DNA from other games here, but they've managed to merge it very effectively and it doesn't feel out of place.\n\nAll things considered, if Eastward just rubs you the wrong way for some reason, you're in no short supply of gripes to bring up. There's definitely plenty of ammunition here if you're looking for reasons not to like it... But they're all kind of minor. It's just that kind of cheesey charm that will grate on you if you let it, but can just as well sweep you up if you want it to.\n\nThe gameplay is honestly pretty tight. The main game loop is similar to a 2D Zelda, but it starts to pepper in more mechanics - you can cook ala Breath of the Wild to fill up your inventory with powerful healing and buffs, you get a second character with their own set of skills, and you really start to realize that there's something special here the first time they split the two up and you have to hot-swap between them through a series of puzzles and obstacles to. It feels fantastic to team them up and tackle the split-party puzzles.\n\nOverall, I encourage folks looking for a kind of leisurely paced adventure with a charming and vibrant visual style and setting to pick Eastward up. But if you want something that takes itself a little more seriously, you may want to look elsewhere, or at least hold off until you're in the mood for something that tries to be a bit lighthearted.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter completing the game, a few more notes...\nMost of the original review is relevant for the whole game. Visually, Eastward is gorgeous from start to finish. The music is also excellent - and every time a new song pops up, it's absolutely a banger. Between some stunning graphics and incredible music, you get some truly breathtaking scenes. Where the game is strong, it stays strong! \nLikewise, where it's weak, it stays weak. The dialogue often feels grating, and it's made much worse by *some* characters getting different dialogue when you speak to them a second time, but you always risk getting the same long dialogue a second time instead. Without spoiling too much, there's a later part where this feels *especially* glaring. Honestly, the game needs a skip button for dialogue you've heard before, the same way you can skip the cooking scene if you've made that meal before. It would really help the most major shortcoming Eastward has.\nThe cooking gets a little stale later on. There's not really much way to find recipes besides rubbing three foods (and a spice) together and seeing if something comes up with a question mark. There's a lot of combinations that are possible from this, and it's hard to justify spending the time to try them all. Further, there's no reminder of what food has what effects, so it feels like best practice to just remember a couple of good ones and stick to them.\nFinally, just to address it, a friend had told me that they'd heard Eastward makes fun of fat people, so I tried to keep an eye out for that - but I didn't really see it. It doesn't really make fun of anyone, persay... but many of the characters are absolute caricatures, and a couple veer close to unfortunate, with several fatter characters being probably the most obvious. To be fair, it doesn't feel mean-spirited as much as a choice to give the animations more lively with bigger expressions and interesting body shapes and designs. They don't stand out as visual outliers in a game this eye-catching, and it's never teased or mocked or otherwise treated as a negative thing in the game's dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1640705891, "timestamp_updated": 1642653010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49570813775062561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106748041": {"recommendationid": "106748041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072165163", "num_games_owned": 914, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1640600173}, "language": "english", "review": "Dialogue clicker 2021.\n\nAmazing music and art, however.", "timestamp_created": 1640704406, "timestamp_updated": 1640704406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468570798635482788", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106732246": {"recommendationid": "106732246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057756988", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1640680528}, "language": "english", "review": "Eastward is an incredible looking game. This showcases some of the best pixel art I have ever seen. Not just environments, but  the animations and even background NPCs. The way they introduced 3D into the mix for lighting and particle effects. The towns are cluttered and the walls are scrawled with graffiti. There's a level of attention to detail here to make the world come to life that is rare, even in the best and most immersive video games.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing else lives up to that standard. Visually, it's stunning. In a good way.\nThe writing, combat and puzzles are stunning, too. But in a bad way.\n\nA solid 2/3rds of Eastward's story is DBZ-tier filler. The rest of it just doesn't make any sense.\nI honestly cannot tell you the theme of this game or what the story is ultimately meant to be about, it's so sorely lacking in any direction.\nNone of the characters really get a chance to develop because all their major events happen off-screen.\nAnd the dialogue is approaching CAD and Megatokyo levels of word soup that shouldn't be possible.\nMaybe it's just lost in translation or cultural differences, because I don't think you can really miss anything major, it's a fairly linear game.\n\nThe combat is serviceable, but never evolves as the game goes on. You get multiple different weapons, but you don't need to use any of them specifically to defeat anything. The same goes for Sam. Most of the enemies just mindlessly dash at you, which makes them bomb fodder. The ones that don't, you can usually put them away in two hits with the other weapons.\nThe boss fights are also pretty much the same. Aside from one or two where you need some timing to beat, they're boring and start to really wear on by their third phase.\n\nThe puzzles are basically non-existent. Despite all of the mechanics and different weapons, you solve them all in pretty much the exact same way, just in a different order. Every time. These puzzles easily take up 50% of your gameplay and none of them require even a moderate amount of problem solving. I spent more time waiting for platforms to come back than I did trying to figure out how to beat them.\n\nAnd honestly, the sad part is there was a solution to all three of these problems.\nJust let the other characters join my party!\nIf they didn't only exist inside cutscenes, I'd be able to get attached to them.\nThere are mechanics that exist in the game which could be taken advantage of by the other characters in ways that would have made the puzzles and combat much more interesting and fun. It's an absolute missed opportunity because this stuff is already in the game and the characters have the animations already. Would've taken nothing to add.\nLike John lifting things Sam can't. What if there was stuff not even John could lift and he needed help?\nHuge gaps that you couldn't shoot across. What if someone had a deployable drone that could pick up items/bombs?\nEnemies that you can't beat by bludgeoning them with your pan, so you have to enlist the help of someone with a cool sword?\nFor the sake of spoilers, I won't elaborate more, but there's a wealth of missed opportunities here.\n\nJust having those characters playable in the game would open up the avenue of having to be able to play through those plot critical off-screen events, removing the need for the awful filler arcs and the massive text info dumps that make up the majority of Eastward's run time to boot.\n\nBut at the end of it all, I still enjoyed the game. The Earth Born minigame is a lot of fun and pretty high effort as far as minigames go. I didn't encounter a single bug or crash and despite the writing, I still found the world and implied lore interesting enough that I wanted to continue.

Story is linear though and because of this there are missable things.\n- But fear not as you complete the game you will be able to replay chapters and such with inheritance from your last gameplay. Which is good as you don't have to replay the game in its entirety just to get missing things.\n- There are 8 chapters in total subdivided in subchapters with each having a plethora of quests to get by. They don't follow a recipe tough. So some chapters are specially longer than others. Particularly 3 and 4.\n\n* Pros:\n- Pixel art is superb. There is so much detail put into every single aspect of the game.\n- Animation is also superb at some points (if it was done with the same engine as the actual game).\n- Characterization is also superb. Every single extra is so detailed to an annoying point (1).\n- Music-wise is also superb. Particularly the entry song.\n- Gameplay mechanics are reminiscent of old games like Seiken Densetsu 3, Secret of Mana/Evermore with a few unique aspects. But WASD with mouse aim pretty much sums it up.\n- You play as two characters (Sam and John) switching back and forth depending on the challenge/puzzle. You are also able to \"detach\" from each other to cover a wider range of action/area. If that makes sense. With this in mind you can actually perform combos if you're quick enough, but don't expect this to be always true as this is not a focus of the mechanics sadly.\n- Puzzle-wise the game has plenty and they're actually pretty good with a good variety. Some puzzle requires you to detach. Other requires you to switch back and forth. You have hidden puzzles and time attack puzzles mixing these aspects.\n- Skill-wise John and Sam can be regarded as the warrior and mage/cleric. You will pick up upgrades and new \"skills\" as you go in the story. \n- Boss-wise this game is superb in the challenge aspect. Good variety and excellent mechanics for each of them. There are also a lot of mini bosses around.\n\n* Cons:\n- Up to chapter 5 the story is a roller coaster of emotions, but it feels logical although rushed. Chapter 6 onwards is just \"What the fuck?! Why?\" all around. Not bad, but it kinda breaks the mood of the previous chapters. Chapter 6 is particularly ridiculous tbh with no actual reason to be there.\n- (1) Being half story driven the game puts a lot of time into dialogues and \"cutscenes\". This is not bad if the dialogues and animation weren't so f'ing slow. Even if you speed up the text to fastest you can still feel you're growing old and fading away reading the HUGE amount of dialogues the game has. Also since the game is extremely detailed every extra has a lot of dialogues too. Some are good some as bad, but if you're that kind of player that likes to click every NPC in game expect to age and die. Remember the 25 hours put into the game? I'd say 15 hours is only dialogues + animations. \n- The story had so much potential, but by the end I felt relief beating the game. The script is not bad, but its not good either. The ending was not quite impactful as you'd expect from this game. Taking into consideration the other aspects of pros and cons I'd say they lost a huge chance for an epic story.", "timestamp_created": 1640531660, "timestamp_updated": 1640531660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810082674026489258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106542714": {"recommendationid": "106542714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379175971", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 272, "last_played": 1647902815}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

The story woven throughout the game definitely has its gut punch moments, and there\u2019s also a good amount of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.\n\nThe combat is real time, and there will be parts where you\u2019ll want to switch quickly between John and Sam, in order to deal the pain. You\u2019ll also need to switch between characters rapidly during some of the puzzles that you\u2019ll have to face off against. This also includes one of my least favorite puzzle types, timed puzzles. There\u2019s nothing quite like being a second or two too long and having to redo an entire sequence that leaves you pulling out your hair. Now that\u2019s not to say that at any time I was ready to throw in the towel, but I will admit that I did have to take a few \u201ctime outs\u201d and walk around a bit if I failed to complete the puzzle in the allotted time. \n\nThis game was just so unique to me. The story was bizarre, the characters you interacted with were sometimes beyond strange, but there was just something about this game that made me keep going. I literally couldn\u2019t stop playing this game. I needed to know what was going to happen next, what new twist was going to change the flow of the game, or perhaps how I felt about certain characters. This is a good game, when the credits hit I was sad, but I was also satisfied with the ending.\n", "timestamp_created": 1640125943, "timestamp_updated": 1640125943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106257384": {"recommendationid": "106257384", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981240711", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 979, "last_played": 1639090330}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclaimer: I haven\u2019t actually beaten the game yet, but I have gotten further than\u2026 82% of players at time of posting. I intended to write this up as I played, up to the game\u2019s conclusion, and I do kind of want to see how it ends to see if any of the narrative payoff is worth it. But I have to force myself to launch the game, there are days or even weeks in between sessions. So I offer this to you now, to perhaps save someone from buying it.\n\nAhem.\n\nPrior to its release, I was hoping Eastward would come out swinging in the leagues of Undertale, LISA, and Omori. An Earthbound-like game with lots of color and weird people and enemies to encounter. It is technically that, but it doesn\u2019t hit nearly as hard as the big players. The biggest reason for this is the game\u2019s writing.\n\nThe game stars John, a bedraggled man who does not speak (except for when he inexplicably does), acting as caretaker to the ever precocious young girl, Sam. John can cook and can hit things real hard, Sam is adorable and is.. magic? The game actively strives to not explain this, or have other characters even acknowledge it, for quite a long time despite it being the central plot.\n\nThe original version of this review recounted the problems with the story bit by bit as I played it, but there were so many minor and side events that don\u2019t matter at all to the story that I eventually had to just cut all the fat. So here is the condensed version- Most characters are just there until they aren\u2019t, and are victims of a weak, poorly-paced overarching narrative. The writers decided certain things need to happen and so the characters are there to enact those things or see (and rarely appropriately react) to them happening. There\u2019s a strange rollercoaster of moods that doesn\u2019t snap hard enough to really register as tonal whiplash, and the pacing and sense of stakes suffer for it.\n\nThere\u2019s.. a lot of things I could go on about. John\u2019s complete lack of agency, the utter fumbling of Sam\u2019s backstory, Jasper\u2019s character in its entirety (seriously I hate Jasper for so many reasons, and I'm not alone because I know someone who might have straight up stopped playing because of how much they dislike him). Threatening or enacting pointless deaths for no reason because the narrative demands a weightless tragedy that it\u2019ll forget about in five minutes. A few bits of random anime horniness. The pacing of the dialogue (and by extension cutscenes) is on the slower side and the writing isn\u2019t good enough to warrant it, and across a game this long it adds up to a lot of frustration. There\u2019s multiple very obvious plot points and the characters absolutely refuse to engage in them for the sake of a \u201ctwist\u201d later. There\u2019s a game within a game that is constantly brought up in the first Chapter, and is kinda mentioned as a background element in later ones, but doesn\u2019t really have any weight or meaning to its inclusion until Chapter 7. Save points are fridges with talking screens, each with its own Deep Message that means nothing at all. Minimal to no backtracking means the various new tools you get carry less weight and if you miss any resources they\u2019re gone forever.\n\nI originally thought the game was going to focus on the journey, being named after a cardinal direction. (This is NOT why it\u2019s called Eastward, by the way.) I pictured going on a long trek as John while he escorts little Sam to a vague destination. A cuter version of Last of Us. Then I learned about Earth Born, the ingame media giant, and thought it was going to focus on that, considering how much the kids talked about it in the beginning and gaining the ability to play it is one of the first things you do. The eventual payoff takes so long to come to fruition and ultimately it\u2019s just.. there. They made a mediocre game inside their mediocre game. It\u2019s another symptom of the team having a lot of ideas and little direction. For a game named.. Yeah.\n", "timestamp_created": 1640125079, "timestamp_updated": 1640125079, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 210, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71537858247756958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106222208": {"recommendationid": "106222208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449248702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1695467664}, "language": "english", "review": "Equivalent to a chef's kiss.", "timestamp_created": 1640076289, "timestamp_updated": 1640076289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106219933": {"recommendationid": "106219933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318162175", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 1352, "last_played": 1700045899}, "language": "english", "review": "Whole game is a complete mindfuck and I love it", "timestamp_created": 1640071850, "timestamp_updated": 1640071850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106214481": {"recommendationid": "106214481", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986998279", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1632120649}, "language": "english", "review": "The art, soundtrack, and visual design are all obviously very good.

I haven't finished it as of writing it, because i kind of just got bored of it. I want to discuss the pros first. The artwork in this game is absolutely phenomenal, its some of the best pixel art I've seen in any game. The backgrounds and environments are AMAZING. The characters as well are extremely detailed with very expressive and interesting personalities. Those are my pros for the game. The cons are pretty big though. I'd say for the 11 hours I played only 2 hours of that was actual gameplay. This game is cutscene HEAVY. There's always a cutscene around every corner and some of them last a LONG time. And if I WASN'T watching a cutscene the rest of my time was spent walking around, which I wouldn't call gameplay. I found my self just not that interested in most of them and it made me bored. another one of the cons is that the combat isn't very engaging and I felt that having to switch between both characters to perform any sort of combo was clunky. Overall I'd say, while this game has a lot of charm and clearly a lot of visual effort put into it, there's probably something better you could be playing. As I'm writing this I'm thinking back on the story and I hate that I don't know how it ends. who knows whether or not I'll go back to finish it. I don't like giving this game a negative review (I wish I could just select 'mixed') because I don't think it's a terrible, it's just not something for me.\n\nEdit:\nI came back to the review because I remembered so more things I liked and disliked about the game.\n\nOne more thing that I like about the game is the cooking. It's very charming and I think it was a very cute and unique way of doing cooking in a video game.\n\nOne more thing that I disliked was an aspect of the combat; there are no health bars. John has a few different types of weapons that he can use, and each type does different amounts of damage depending on the enemy type. But because the game doesn't have health bars you don't know how you're supposed to go about doing certain boss fights. There was one fight that I remember where I was using one weapon the whole time. it was taking me a really long time and because of that i eventually died. The second time I tried the boss fight I switched weapons and killed it EASILY. if there was a health bar that indicated the amounts of damage I would've gone, \"ah, this isn't doing a lot of damage, let me switch to something else.\"\n\nAnother thing that confused me was the gun/shotgun that you get. I could not tell how far the range on it was whatsoever. I thought it was going to be a direct upgrade from the frying pan, more range and more damage, but I would sometimes be point blank with an enemy and deal ZERO DAMAGE. it's frustrating.

I won't go into much detail because this game is primarily plot driven (which ultimately is why I chose to thumbs down this game) and fairly linear, but the plot is pretty generic which by itself isn't really an issue (the plot holes out the wazoo certainly are, but the story as a whole is such a mess you just sorta stop caring after the first 2 or 3). You'd be hard pressed to find a story, whether in game or book format, that didn't take SOME inspiration from something already done. However, what helps is to give it engaging aspects to make up for predictability or staleness of the story. Like say... Characters! Something this game claims to have a colorful assortment of! Buuuuut they're all generic as hell too, or just completely boring, underdeveloped and honestly? I blame the dialogue. The dialogue is pretty damn basic it's the type of dialogue you want a faster text speed for and for a story driven game, that's a problem. The most colorful thing about really any of the cast are their designs. The characters are either gone too quick to really get attached to them, boring as ever loving hell (which was the vast majority of them), or are just weird stereotypes hoping to come off as quirky.\n\nBeware, a spoiler teeming character rant ahead:\n[spoiler] Okay, I gotta rant about the main four or 'supposed' main four (I don't really see why the two lesbians were considered main characters on the main website when we interacted with them just about as much as we did Lee or the deadbeat Dad, William). John is the first one of two characters we play as and is categorized as a silent protagonist, which gets acknowledged. Alot. Like, we get it. He doesn't say anything. Now silent protagonists are fine, but when they heavily incorporated into the dialogue? It's probably a good idea to make them at least expressive when they're being talked to, and maybe even have them interact with items with personalized comments if you're feeling spicy. The point is to give the man some personality since you don't want us to get to know him through dialogue. Now, the game lured me into a false sense of security in making me think that we'd get John's thoughts on things as we progressed through the story, but nah that first bit after you leave the first major area? That's it. That isn't happening again. All John's has left in him are overused victory poses and head scratches for the rest of the game. \nNow next is Sam... She's mostly just a giant plot device and the central mouthpiece since John doesn't say shit. I wanted to like her. I really, really did. And for the first 10-15 minutes, I think I did! And then I didn't, lol. I dunno man, the pep thing was cute when she was fresh eyed learning about basic shit, but the corniness of the friendship spiels and borderline anime dialogue... I was getting tired of her really quick by Chapter 3 or 4. To the point, I felt nothing when she died (and I wish games would just commit to killing off a main character, you really didn't have to bring her back it really didn't do anything for the ending).\nOkay, next is Lesbian 1 (also known as Alva, but I'm sticking with Lesbian 1) who is a short one. She's the pink haired princess/inventor/guardian of the 3rd major area's town... as you can see alot going on there. Now her personality? She can be summed up in about 4-5 things:\nthe more likable lesbian\nlee's sister (I think adopted... Lee was raised by Lesbian 1's granddad along with her so I'mma just assume sibling relationship which isn't important, BUT I actually FELT something for Lee when I realized he didn't even know she was dead and was now on his own with the town.)\nbad cook\ngood inventor\nThere ain't much to her, frankly. They try to play the whole cute, contradicting trope of this girl being a super genius whose in charge while also acting like a bumbling, albeit very nice, fool with huge tits (they put a weird amount of focus in her tits when they're visible, fuck me there's this one scene toward the end of the game that had me wheezing cause of that, look up Isabella's fight) for quirk's sake. It's not a big deal, and I'll take her over the Lesbian 2 any day.\nOkay... time for Lesbian 2 (a.k.a weeaboo dyke, a.k.a dog killer, a.k.a corpsenapper, and a.k.a Isabelle) whom is Lesbian 1's girlfriend. There isn't much to cover about Lesbian 2 either. Main thing I'd say is that she has the disposition of drying paint... very possessive and overprotective drying paint. Plot-wise she's considered very powerful, but this is poorly shown because our fight with Lesbian 2 is probably the quickest bossfight in the game (though for some reason we don't dome her like we do literally everyone else). Her most noticeable traits include her big 'ol weeaboo sword and her inability to give a shit about anyone else aside from her girlfriend (which would be fine, but when you knowingly do it at the expense of everyone else's life well... let's just say I don't find it to be tragically romantic). Oh, and she killed Lee's dog when they were younger... for some reason. It came too close to her waifu or something, despite her knowing the dog. And then the writers try to damage control that whiplash comment by having Lee tell us, 'she gave the most sincere apology'. \nConsidering what she does at the end of the game, yeah, I'mma say cap on that one, Lee.\n\nP.S. In case anyone is feeling uppity about me labeling them Lesbian 1 and Lesbian 2, I'd like to elaborate a tad on why I did that. You see, the game's story puts... quite a bit of focus on this particular relationship. Why? Who knows, but I do know that when you have two fairly unmemorable characters having significant limelight as well as their relationship, well, you may wanna make them more memorable, or the relationship is all they end up being.\n\nP.S.P.S. Also can we have a moment of silence for Jasper's potential character development just thrown to the curve? You already did him dirty with that design, but the minute you open up a event for him to develop off of... we're done with him. You made me endure his clownery for 30-40 minutes and then when potential rears its head, you go \"nah, just throw him with the background NPCs\". \nFor-shame.\n [/spoiler]\n\nCombat... sucks. I wish I was just whining, but I don't think aiming my weapons with a game-pad should be as irritating as it is. Hitboxes can be choppy, like a miss looking as if it should've connected. Enemies are something of a respawning free-for-all. I guess they're that way to try and force you to utilize Sam's stun (because outside plot devices and two-man puzzles she's fairly useless) instead of just giving us a damn dodge button. Bosses... are nothing to write home about. They had a good thing going with the first one where they had you utilizing bombs to make it vulnerable to attacks... and then they stopped that trend almost immediately and instead you steamroll till like the last 2 bosses. Speaking of those 2, they introduced timing your attacks to 'clash' at the very end of the game. It would've been a nice mechanic to do for mini-bosses instead of spawnwaves.\n\nExploration was such a missed opportunity man. This one actually makes me sad because of how beautiful the environments look, but there isn't much point to them. There aren't any lore based secrets hiding around or new gear. The best you'll come across is some game currency (salt), heart orb piece (think LOZ's heart pieces), or 'gears' which are a required material to upgrade your weapons. The linear environment doesn't even have much to interact with.\nOkay, tangent over.

If you expect it to explain the majority of the details - you could not be more wrong. A lot of things are left unexplained, and it really makes me mad. I am the type of guy to read the lore notes in games, but there are none. All you're getting is the most basic explanation of what's happening. Also, sometimes things just happen, without you realizing what exactly is going on - don't get me wrong, it can be done really well (for example, Katana Zero), but this is, unfortunately, not the case. Characters like to speak in riddles, but the riddles don't make sense. They're just there to make it sound more important.

Involving the use of weapons and abilities to dispatch the variety of enemies and puzzles that are littered throughout. Weapons always felt good, even if some were more useful than others. I found myself defaulting to the Frying Pan and Bang-Bang Gun when I played- As those two covered most of what I needed when playing. I never felt particularly overwhelmed by the combat challenges. Bosses were fun and cleverly designed- And you are never long without options to fight whatever comes at you. With John's Arsenal and Sam's psionic abilities. While Sam did get reduced to being more of a stun option and puzzle solver- Her abilities did come into play when they were needed.\n\n\nThe story has strong beats. It starts off like RPGs of old, with the discovery of something of the wider world and the exile from the home village- Eastward starts off strong with a intoduction to the world that John and Sam live in. You see a myriad of beautiful spritework and music- Despite how dreary and down Potcrock Isle is meant to be. As the story picks up, the game's tone becomes apparent. A funny adventure that is willing to make some dire turns. And it's a strong start that continues until the half-way point.\n\nThe story begins to wane after this. Becoming a series of distractions that, while fun and do engage the player, aren't going to feel as connected or as important. Some parts left me rather frustrated, especially when the story does pick right back up, only to hit a very hard wall. And this repeats from the half-way point on. Sadly leaving the story with a number of loose ends and potential that was not quite reached. \n\nDespite all of this- I could not help but to see the good of this game. It's flawed. It's repetative- Very obviously padding itself out by making the player re-visit places they've been again and again and reusing resources a lot. But it's a game with heart. It's got that spark that you have to stop and appreciate. \n\nI want to see more from this world. The ending left me in a place similar to Mother 3's ending. But nowhere near as satisfied. And if I can't see more from the world of Eastward, then I'd love to see more from Pixpil.

What people say about this game being 80% cutscene rings very true. Obviously that number is just pulled out of the air but that sentiment comes across quite quickly. This game has made the unusual mistake of focusing way too much on story instead of gameplay. I am 5 chapters in and honestly, I would like to see how the story continues, but not enough to be held hostage by the game to do so.

You also have manual saves with some very philosophical save points that just add to the experience.\n\nDefinitely a big roller coaster of a game in the emotional department, and highly recommend everyone to give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1637979714, "timestamp_updated": 1637979714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104246542": {"recommendationid": "104246542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292308269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1680444328}, "language": "english", "review": "NOICE", "timestamp_created": 1637977222, "timestamp_updated": 1637977222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104245215": {"recommendationid": "104245215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180936462", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1704, "last_played": 1673869457}, "language": "english", "review": "soundtrack - nice\nvisuals - nice\ngameplay - okay\nplot -  meh\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1637976705, "timestamp_updated": 1637976705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104244888": {"recommendationid": "104244888", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993251936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1637977595}, "language": "english", "review": "I lost a night to playing through the first chapter.

On the other sits some fairly bland gameplay with some bizarre design choices. It is a game that I feel some nostalgia for despite the fact that it is undeniably a modern video game. \n\nThe games story starts out incredibly strong with a tightly knit set of core characters and connections as well as a decent dose of mystery and sinister overtones surrounding the Town. However, it is not too long before you begin to set out on a journey literally to the east. Unfortunately (no spoilers though) the quality of the story begins to dip and slows down considerably over the course of the game, only to begin to throw things at you in the last couple of chapters and then come to an abrupt stop. It is because of the strong start and well written characters that it makes the low points of this games story even more obvious. (and In some cases fairly nonsensical moments, fellow players of this game would be likely familiar with what I am talking about.) \n\nGameplay wise it is a fairly straightforward action combat game with few weapon choices (which are a bit too clumsy to swap between) and the occasional fairly easy puzzle solving sections. Generally, it is nothing to really write home about and it usually didn\u2019t get in the way of my enjoyment of the game, however as you near the end it becomes more and more apparent that instead of your power really increasing of the mechanics being built on top of in a logical progression, they instead change over time to be different rather than innovating on what was already there. Why new mechanics where being introduced as late as the last chapters is beyond me but they don\u2019t build on existing ones and therefore are a little confusing at first and feel out of place. Another awkward moment is a forced stealth section that has very little margin for error and some frustratingly placed checkpoints.\n\nWith all of this being said I still recommend Eastward, the games visual style and soundtrack alone deserve praise and it is still a thoroughly enjoyable experience despite its flaws. I will continue to watch this developer (Pixpil) with interest in their future projects\n", "timestamp_created": 1637967156, "timestamp_updated": 1637967156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54582822322845459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104206020": {"recommendationid": "104206020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237856532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1016, "last_played": 1641644313}, "language": "english", "review": " I love it", "timestamp_created": 1637964940, "timestamp_updated": 1637964940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104205876": {"recommendationid": "104205876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122676776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 442, "last_played": 1664301422}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego.

The pixel artwork, the soundtrack, the open world design (and the sense of freedom it gave the player) and the dungeon design are all still excellent and it seems crazy to me that the game recently turned 30 as it holds up so well today.  \n\nSo when a game draws favourable comparisons to Zelda, it piques my interest and I saw a couple of reviews compare Eastward to that series, among others.  Just looking at the screenshots you can see why, the pixel artwork, and top down view, the colourful world design.  But are those comparisons justified?\n\nWell yes and no.  First up, it\u2019s very slow to start, the starting area isn't particularly colourful and its pretty exposition heavy.  And this is a recurring theme through the game.  There is a lot of running backwards and forwards just to talk to characters, which can get a bit tiresome.  The game really shines when it lets you off the leash to explore, to solve puzzles and get into combat (which does feel very Link-To-The-Past-like) so being dragged into yet more plot exposition just makes you long for the next time you can get out there and play again.\n\nThe pixel art and animation is first rate.  It must be some of the best I\u2019ve ever seen and once you\u2019re beyond the starting areas muted palette the game really pops with colour and atmosphere.  The music is incredible and Joel Corelitz has created a soundtrack that will stay with you long after you finish the game.\n\nThe story itself is pretty good, if not exactly original, with some very likeable characters. I felt pretty strong Final Fantasy VII vibes and there were a couple of moments where I felt it was trying hard (and succeeding, to a degree) to elicit the same emotional responses as Square\u2019s masterpiece.  But the game is fairly linear, unlike LTTP, and there isn\u2019t much to do in the main world beyond follow the main plot thread.  It also seems to lose its way a bit towards the end.  The intrigue that had built up in the first two acts didn\u2019t get a satisfactory pay off in the third for me.  Perhaps I just wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention but I thought there was too much left unexplained.\n\nThere is quite a neat game-within-a-game Earth Born.  I tried it once and thought it was a cool distraction but since there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to save progress within this sub game I didn\u2019t really go back.  The cooking sub game was also really fun with you trying to discover new recipes by combining various ingredients you can find on your journey.\n\nOverall I\u2019d recommend Eastward, even if I did think the Zelda comparisons could only be made at a fairly superficial level.  To be honest the game it most reminded me of was Chrono-Trigger, which is no bad thing!  I enjoyed the time I spent in its world.  I\u2019d just caveat the recommendation with the note that you\u2019ll just need a lot of patience with the dialogue heavy sections.", "timestamp_created": 1637956333, "timestamp_updated": 1637956859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104165217": {"recommendationid": "104165217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204980420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1696861403}, "language": "english", "review": "love it, a gift from my beloved mate <3", "timestamp_created": 1637955246, "timestamp_updated": 1637955246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510424375534057617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104144522": {"recommendationid": "104144522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100777525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1635468934}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is simple but tight.

Good mix of exploration-story-combat and boss battles;\n4. Has mini-games inside the game (like a whole little story game);\n5. The insane controller compatibility;\n6.

I was also amazed by the awesome hand-drawn opening animation of the game. \n\nAs I personally did like all characters and was invested in the story with its mysteries, so that the long dialogs were not that much of an issue for me, I give this game a thumbs up and can recommend it to all pixel art enthusiasts.", "timestamp_created": 1637873788, "timestamp_updated": 1637873788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103938936": {"recommendationid": "103938936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141280169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1659384775}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect!", "timestamp_created": 1637872873, "timestamp_updated": 1637872873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103938212": {"recommendationid": "103938212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425867678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2573, "last_played": 1679839561}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story line, love the graphics and SAM is adorable.
