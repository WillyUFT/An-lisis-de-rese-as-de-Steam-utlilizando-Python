check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!\n\ndistraint is a 2D horror adventure game developed and published by jesse makkonen, who had previously released silence of the sleep in 2014. despite not liking horror games generally, let alone a indie horror game, i've genuinely enjoyed jesse makkonen's take on the genre and his style of games is unique and even distraint was particularly different from silence of the sleep. both had their own cool aesthetic and while both are great, distraint has better color and overall graphic/art design. you can definitely tell he got a lot better at almost all aspects of game development while making this, especially when comparing it to his first game. the sound design is something i also specifically want to single out, as i found it to be expertly crafted as it does a lot of the heavy lifting regarding the \"psychological horror\" aspect of the game. \n\nthe story itself is also pretty great, showing how greed or money can lead people down dark paths. while the simple controls can turn some players off, i liked how the dev managed to make such a simple game mechanically go a long way just off of the things like sound design, storytelling, and atmospheric horror. i really enjoyed this, and i am very excited to get to the sequel in the future. this is extremely advanced and sophisticated for what seems like a simple side-scrolling game. $5 full price can seem a little steep, especially because of the shorter length of the game (i beat it in just over two hours and got all the achievements in less than three hours total). for this reason, i recommend waiting for a sale and/or grabbing this in a bundle with other games. worst case, you can routinely find this for less than a dollar on sale fairly often.", "timestamp_created": 1691023947, "timestamp_updated": 1691023947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143288749": {"recommendationid": "143288749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344710427", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1691018031}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing amazing, but still a good experience overall.", "timestamp_created": 1691016574, "timestamp_updated": 1691016574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143008365": {"recommendationid": "143008365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326799469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1690629668}, "language": "english", "review": "good game to short", "timestamp_created": 1690622406, "timestamp_updated": 1690622406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142730683": {"recommendationid": "142730683", "author": {"steamid": "76561199231835198", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1690225076}, "language": "spanish", "review": "corto pero bueno", "timestamp_created": 1690240651, "timestamp_updated": 1690240651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142415549": {"recommendationid": "142415549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239337330", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1680665268}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]My review after playing the whole game with all the achievements:[/h1]\n\n[b]The good side:[/b]\n\n1.

Than why it is have puzzles? Because a brain propably not in 2 bit functions. The dev have to prepare you for the next status of your feelings.

At $4.99 for full price and generally less than $1 on frequent sale it is absolutely worth every penny. It's even available on Android and consoles if that is more your style. Honestly the hardest part of describing this game is trying to make it as spoiler-free as possible since the best way to play it is to not deep-dive into reviews or look too much into videos - going in as blind as possible is the way it should be played. It also takes only around 2h to fully complete.\n\n[b]I will however state one content warning:[/b] to those friends who may have difficulties with [spoiler]depression[/spoiler], [spoiler]talk of self-harm or suicide[/spoiler], or [spoiler]grotesque visuals and/or blood[/spoiler] it may be best to avoid playing it, or at least be very aware at the risk of that imagery. This game is heavily psychological and there are moments where it gets very dark and may affect your mental state if you are sensitive to it. Please do not put your mental health at risk. \n\nWith that being said, even with as dark and almost bleak this game may be, it's almost borderline beautiful. There are moments where you can really think about the cruelty of life and yet how important it is to live. Just how easy it is to fall into a depressive repetitive loop and feel unable to escape. The difficulty of trying to face your own personal demons and the struggle to not let them devour you. Or even the most important thought of all: just what is the price you are willing to pay to keep your humanity? Your morality? Your happiness? What price would you pay to manage to live? \nI never expected such a cheap little game I bought purely on whim to be nearly as memorable as it is. I first played this game back in 2017 and even now I still constantly think about it. \n\nIf I had any closing statements to this review it would simply be: please, if you can handle it, give DISTRAINT and the sequel DISTRAINT 2 a chance. They absolutely deserve it.\n\nThank you, Jesse Makkonen for sharing this beautiful piece of work.", "timestamp_created": 1685686782, "timestamp_updated": 1685687084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139179635": {"recommendationid": "139179635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825331199", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1685277122}, "language": "english", "review": "A complete masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1685309775, "timestamp_updated": 1685309775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139179218": {"recommendationid": "139179218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987565903", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1684067389}, "language": "english", "review": "Play as Price, who's career choice let him into a path he really regrets.

There are a few jumpscares but not too overwhelming.  The jumpscare here adapts to the moment, so it doesn't appear very randomly.  The BGM also developing the player's emotional. Sometimes there's no music in a certain place and moment to give an eerie vibes. \n\nFor gameplay, it's quite simple for me. Side scrolling with simple puzzle-solving to continue the story.

Strong essences are kept in small bottles as they say and that's the case here aswell. \n\nThe player takes on the role of Price, a young man working for a company that makes sure people will free their homes if for whatever reason they're not able to pay their debts anymore. The game is mainly composed of 3 such episodes where we have to deliver the bad news to an old widowed lady, a forest recluse and a drug addict. Character development does a good job in making the player empathize with both sides' points of view. Price doesn't like the fact that he has to make people leave their homes and the people don't blame Price (because it's his job at the end of the day) even though they have their own problems to deal with. \n\nPrice doesn't chase riches in a greedy manner such as his bosses do, even though him securing a partnership with the company made him chicken out from his initial goal (after he felt he caused so much suffering, he wanted to quit his job).\n\nThe story comes full circle. Years later, Price is told to leave his apartment by a young man who now is heeded not to repeat the same mistakes and knows all that Price went through. \n\nWe get to experience a dark twist in the ending, in tone with the vibe that the rest of the game had. \n\nThe use of sound effects, grimy pixel artwork and gloomy soundtrack emphasize important moments and the mental torment that the main character is going through, even if some moments are really dramatic and feel purposefully exaggerated towards that end. \n\n[b] Worth getting ? [/b]\n\nYES ! Distraint costs about 80 cents at a sale, it's a total steal even for the full price considering how well put together the whole experience is, even if short.

life, one where he is successful and can afford a higher standard of living - because with wealth comes happiness, right? To obtain the desired recognition from his bosses Price has to work hard and complete given tasks of property seizure without asking, doubting, disobeying, showing compassion\u2026 but as Price isn't a heartless individual his first assignment shakes him to the core. Questions concerning ethics and morality of his work resurfaces with a growing urgency and his conscience gets exposed to horrid hallucinations. Each step he takes brings him closer to his desired future life\u2026 the question is - does he still long for it for such a price?\n\n[i]DISTRAINT[/i] is a pretty good little game. It's a little bit weird to say that I had fun with it, when we consider that it's a psychological horror, but I have enjoyed my two playthroughs and even had a few laughs. The graphic design is rather strange but very appealing, especially the color tinting in different scenes. Music is also fine and helps to create the right mood when you explore, run for your life or just wander drugged up through halls.\nEverything in the game is rather simple and yet it manages to deliver disturbing and unpleasant feelings that are closely tied up to our society. Through the character of Price the game holds a mirror to our greedy souls and shows ugly things in it. Whole atmosphere of the game is heavy, unhappy and every time a flicker of hope shows up it gets stamped by\t[spoiler]an elephant[/spoiler] to the ground. So, if you are not feeling well, wait a bit before playing it and go find some cute kittens instead.

Instead, the Player is presented the WASD buttons as their means of moving around - though the only use comes from A and D, as the environments are all horizontal - as well as the E key for interaction and the Spacebar for access to the Inventory.\n\n What this game does interestingly is the simplicity with which it operates. The E key interacts with things that are interactable. Things that are interactable have an exclamation point appearing over the Player Character (PC)\u2019s head, whenever the PC is close enough to interact with those things (objects).\n\n If the Player collects an item, that item will go into the Player\u2019s inventory, which when accessed, can be navigated by using the E key, as the inventory is a wheel with items, with the item currently selected being highlighted and being used to interact with objects and things.\n\n That means that, to interact with things normally, the Player should go into their inventory and highlight an empty slot, for, otherwise, the PC will attempt to interact with things via the highlighted item.\n\n And that\u2019s pretty much it. The Player controls the PC, walks around with them, interacts with things and has a grand old time. Naturally, though, this is an Adventure game. Those come with the Stigma of having ludicrously stupid and obtuse puzzles that only get solved via sheer luck or the utilization of a guide. Does DISTRAINT have that issue?\n\n It almost does, but that is owed up to the lackluster information provided to the Player. Some puzzles feature more than enough information to be obvious, others feature far less information and, as a result, are a little more time-consuming than they really ought to. In any case, though, DISTRAINT shows restraint in the field of ludicrously complex puzzles. That is not wholly good, but it is definitely not bad.\n\n For what it is - a small, story-focused, visual storytelling empowered Adventure (puzzle-focused) game, this much gameplay is enough. 3/3\n\nPresentation\n\n DISTRAINT is a game relying on pixel-art to relay its visuals to the Player. In fact, it relies on some very good pixel-art\u2026 Though then there are moments when the pixel-art is questionable at best.\n\n An example of this issue would be the opening room. There\u2019s an elevator door, there are three ordinary doors, there\u2019s stuff in the background that looks very neat, and then there\u2019s the PC. The PC, ladies and gentlemen, looks silly. Goofy, if one will, for while the backgrounds and sets, and overall the areas in which the game takes place are aiming for an appearance that resembles reality - plausible is a good means of describing it. However, the characters all look a lot less plausible. Their bodies and heads are humongous, while their arms and legs are unbelievably thin twigs.\n\n The best way to describe the \u2018human\u2019 characters in this game would be to urge you to imagine a barrel with a big pumpkin on it. On the upper rim of the barrel, where the barrel ends and the pumpkin begins, are attached, on opposite sides, stockings that reach down to the lower rim of the barrel, then there\u2019s another set of stockings attached to the lower rim of the barrel. The head is the pumpkin, the body is the barrel, and the flimsy, thin stockings are arms (upper pair) and legs (lower pair).\n\n This really bothered me, as I found their appearances so unappealing, so disinteresting and caricature-esque that I was really not interested in playing the game, initially. Fortunately, though, the main focus is slightly skewed towards the environments, so there\u2019s less looking at the characters and more looking at the wondrous backgrounds.\n\n Though the impressive accomplishments of this game\u2019s Presentation do not stop there. I will call upon a game I\u2019ve reviewed recently - The Desolate Hope - and use it as a comparison. In The Desolate Hope, there was an effect similar to that of damaged film. It was monstrously intrusive and straining for the eye, and there was no option to reduce or remove it.\n\n In DISTRAINT, there is something similar. There is film grain, constantly present, growing more intense in some situations. That film grain is very well integrated into the \u2018visuals of the game\u2019, making it seem as though it is a mandatory part of the game and the experience it is providing. Not only that, it is quite tame AND one can set its intensity in the options menu.\n\n Right, more on that - the game features a very neat main menu AND an options menu. Strangely enough, the game uses the WASD keys to navigate the menu, and the E key to select things, though that\u2019s related to the Gameplay. What\u2019s neat is that THERE IS A TEXT-BOX stating that this is so. In many smaller, indie games - such as DISTRAINT - the control scheme is some wildly weird thing, and the menu operates according to these wildly weird principles, so the Player needs to guess which buttons do what.\n\n This clever means of presentation persists throughout the entire game. As mentioned, interactable objects are highlighted by an exclamation point when one is close enough to interact with them. There\u2019s also the fact that the font, as well as the size of the text, is very reasonable.\n\n Then we could get to the scares, as this is supposedly a scary game. The scares are all mostly visual, with accompanying audio cues, though the audio cues are not monstrously loud, coming in out of a very quiet audio scene. They are just sounds joining in the cacophony of the game. The visual aspect of them is far more interesting, and I\u2019ll keep it at that.\n\n More on the audio - the sound effects of the game are very crisp. That could be because they\u2019re a bit loud, or it could be because through their crisp loudness they work towards creating an atmosphere. An atmosphere of suspense and unease. Some objects let out their own sounds which grow louder the closer the PC is to those objects and fainter the further away they are, and then there are some sounds that seemingly originate from certain objects, but there is no visual indicator that it is so - in addition to that, they are not constant, so the imply that SOMETHING has happened whenever they occur.\n\n That creates tension and unease in the Player, which is the best way of going about making a horror game - none of this stinky jump-scare garbage - and DISTRAINT does it quite well.\n\n In addition to that, of course, the music is very fitting. Painfully drawn strings, almost like screams, though very subdued and distant\u2026 It isn\u2019t something truly exceptional, but it is more than just okay.\n\n One other thing this game does well is the subversion of expectation. I\u2019ll leave that up to you to experience, if you do decide to experience it.\n\n So, even with the issue of the weird-looking characters, and the issue of some very weird word presences in sentences (as far as I\u2019m aware of she can\u2019t do that - the \u201cof\u201d is needless), I would like to say that DISTRAINT\u2019s appearance is very proper. 2/3\n\n[Skipping stuff to fit in Steam]\n\nConclusion\n\n8/10. DISTRAINT is an impressively good game that suffers from a slightly repulsive character design flaw, which turns people off of playing it before even buying it. The game is, however, great. It is incredibly poignant and important, and I\u2019d urge everyone to play it, with the exception of squeamish people and those who are afflicted with trauma from past events in their lives involving suicide.\n\nFull review here: https://gemsimov.com/game-reviews/f/distraint---a-review", "timestamp_created": 1668712523, "timestamp_updated": 1668712523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125560530": {"recommendationid": "125560530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271154298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1668583132}, "language": "english", "review": "Relatively simple story and simple puzzle gameplay, but both are executed well and the game doesn't overstay its welcome.

Overall this game will take about 2 hours to complete\n\nI am thankful there isnt major jumpscares or is too..graphic/scary, however there are still elements of horror..especially the background sound which really brings up the creepy/horror ambience.\n\nIt is rather \"mild\" as it is not in 3D form however the sound really creeped me out at times. However be warned that some scenes are still quite gorey.\n\nYou move with WASD and 'E' to interact. And 'Space' to open up your inventory.\n\nSo you played as a character named Price. (oh..the irony of the name); I would say he's something like a property agent, to seize the houses of others..either because they couldnt afford to pay their taxes/mortgage..or because the rich wanted to build infrastructure over their properties.. oh f**k the Capitalism!\n\nSo alas..those poor souls..This game takes you through the consequences of Price's actions \n\nThere are savepoints even though you generally wouldnt die..except for the first part when you are being chased by an elephant. Other than that, its a safe-run.\n\nI would generally advice to follow this guide closely: https://www.walkthroughking.com/text/distraint.aspx\nIf you wish to obtain all 16 achievements. And if you miss them, you might have to playthrough the whole thing again\n\nI did miss one achievement however it was still in the earlier parts, so I had to just re-play it briefly.\n\nThis game is very impactful and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do. \n\nUncover what price does Price have to pay..\nand..everything comes at a Price..\n\nTags: [Psychological Horror] [Scary imagery] [Gore] [Dark] [2D] [Side-scroller] [Pixel Graphics] [Consequences] [Mind-blown]", "timestamp_created": 1664895372, "timestamp_updated": 1681841765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656665563583374023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123245684": {"recommendationid": "123245684", "author": {"steamid": "76561199191165661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1665816814}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like horrors because they are very scary, but this one is actually very good with a sad story.", "timestamp_created": 1664739968, "timestamp_updated": 1664739968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123172642": {"recommendationid": "123172642", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133750560", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1664651879}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Que h1jo de put4 es el peronismo!", "timestamp_created": 1664653904, "timestamp_updated": 1664653904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122838773": {"recommendationid": "122838773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930315263", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1664191546}, "language": "english", "review": "As is typical with some indie games, the art and audio are fantastic, but it lacks in a couple other important departments: puzzles, and story+lore.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like was that horrible things that happened to the protagonist were not earned. He didn\u2019t do anything terrible, and was just a regular guy, doing a job that nobody liked to do, all while being far more considerate of others than most other people typically would be. Honestly, the mental-imagery-manifested-in-the-real-world stuff felt really forced and just broke my immersion. Some problems with lazy writing, like yelling \u201cwhat the hell\u201d, didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe other problem was the puzzles, as they ranged from either too simplistic to being a bit of a chore, and they lacked any real challenge. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this by itself, because sometimes a game can sacrifice mechanics and challenge to focus on being a narrative \u201cexperience\u201d. But given that I thought the narrative was weak and a little too sweaty, I think this hurt the game more than anything.\n\nI understand the developer put this together in only 3 months, which is remarkable, but it\u2019s still something I can\u2019t recommend.

didn\u2019t like was that horrible things that happened to the protagonist were not earned. He didn\u2019t do anything terrible, and was just a regular guy, doing a job that nobody liked to do, all while being far more considerate of others than most other people typically would be. Honestly, the mental-imagery-manifested-in-the-real-world stuff felt really forced and just broke my immersion. Some problems with lazy writing, like yelling \u201cwhat the hell\u201d, didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe other problem was the puzzles, as they ranged from either too simplistic to being a bit of a chore, and they lacked any real challenge. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this by itself, because sometimes a game can sacrifice mechanics and challenge to focus on being a narrative \u201cexperience\u201d. But given that I thought the narrative was weak and a little too sweaty, I think this hurt the game more than anything.\n\nI understand the developer put this together in only 3 months, which is remarkable, but it\u2019s still something I can\u2019t recommend.

His job is to evict people from their homes, when they can't pay the rent or the mortgage. \nIt is very minimalistic, the graphics and game play is very modest. The puzzles are easy. All this is intentional, the focus of this game is all about the story, about the emotional impact on the player and about the message that is given. The guy perceives the dispair of those evicted people, and starts to question his line of work, feeling remorse feelings that are creeping more and more. He even begins to lose his mind and to see paranormal scenes. \nThe game is very thought provoking and relaxing. It makes you stop and reflect on the scenes you just perceived. \nHovewer, I simply must mention a big shortcoming that this game has. \nIn the third chapter the protagonist has to search for a person to be evicted in a building. The building is nothing less then a labyrint with all the doors and secret doors. To make things worse, the chapter is designed that you have to take some hallucinogenic drug in order to enter secret doors - and you have to find your way fast because the effect of the drug is limited to 7,8 seconds or so. There are 3 or 4 such sequences. If you fail to enter the right door, you often have to start over to the first sequence. I must admit, that part nearly ruined the game for me. Because it's just bad/irrational level design, and it's completely disjointed from the rest of the game. \nI had to consult a you tube guide to pass that chapter, and doing so breaks the immersion to the game. \nMany people complained about that part of the game, and many people even quit the game in that point. \nBut, I will give this game a positive review nontheless because of how deep and thought proviking it is. \nI hope the game maker doesn't repeat such obvious mistakes in his future titles.", "timestamp_created": 1657894643, "timestamp_updated": 1658076049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118733421": {"recommendationid": "118733421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880825637", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1657085544}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ya de entrada el juego te atrapa por c\u00f3mo se va desarrollando la historia, y los puzzles son muy entretenidos!", "timestamp_created": 1657694283, "timestamp_updated": 1657694283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118728632": {"recommendationid": "118728632", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112065950", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1657684297}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty spooky", "timestamp_created": 1657684380, "timestamp_updated": 1657684380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118671323": {"recommendationid": "118671323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087704525", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1657590574}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good short horror experience, it took me around 2 hours to 100%.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

The game tells the story of a Debt Collector who is attempting to become a partner at a large firm, but the actions he needs to do to get there slowly crushes him. Each location the player visits they need to remove someone vulnerable from their house.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot of narrative interactions, and item hunting. In order to remove the person from their house, the player will need to complete a task for them, this will involve going deeper into the maps. The items the player needs are easy to find, with only a few occasions did I become lost. That was mainly because in the last level you can shift reality, and in the shift I did not explore all rooms.\n\nThe story is the biggest selling point of the game. We start the game hopeful of the future and watch as your character is slowly broken each time he has to evict a tenant. We watch the character trying to reason with the situation. Each tenant does not put up a fight, or blame the player for their actions, instead they are dejected asking for more time or support with their situation.\n\nI won\u2019t spoil the story but it is interesting and worth the experience.\n\nDistraint is a great story and a fun game, it is really worth the play. At times you may get lost and I would advise a guide if needed, the puzzles are simple and the few action scenes offer little challenge. The game is simply worth it for the story alone and has been one of the most interesting narrative games I\u2019ve played yet.\n\nThere is a sequel to the game, and while I do not find it as good as the first it is still worth experiencing. It will leave the ending in a more hopeful situation.\n\nIf you want to have a look at the gameplay my video is right below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IW2AxVSBiw\n\nIf you are looking for other horror games with great stories all the ones I\u2019ve played are in my curator page:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41770172/", "timestamp_created": 1652829078, "timestamp_updated": 1652829078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115609203": {"recommendationid": "115609203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320536596", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 167, "last_played": 1687382379}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Incre\u00edble, m\u00e1s que un juego pienso que es una historia gr\u00e1fica con el prop\u00f3sito de concienciar de c\u00f3mo la avaricia corroe la sociedad y muestra la peor cara del ser humano.

You'll go to a location, solve some puzzles, some spooky stuff will happen, then you get a little cutscene, and move on to the next location.\n\nThere's some enjoyable stuff such as the art, horror aspects, & tripping out.\n\nIt's not a bad game, there just isn't much to it.\n\nThe puzzles are very simplistic. Most of them are simply: find object, take it somewhere, and use it. You'll never have a large inventory so there will rarely be a question of where something goes. There're also some poorly written puzzles. For instance, one part you need to find flowers for someone, and somehow Price knows they're in a locked room he has never been in before.\n\nThe slow moving speed is an issue that causes parts to drag out longer than necessary. Later on in the game there are segments where you move much faster, so there's no reason why that couldn't have been the default moving speed or been given an option to make that the default moving speed.\n\nThe characters are all one note caricatures that lack any sort of depth, which removes the emotion you might feel if these people had been fleshed out in some meaningful way. You're supposed to feel bad for old lady because she's old & nice. You're supposed to feel bad for guy in woods because he doesn't want to give up his cabin. You're supposed to feel bad for drugged up, dishonest party guy..... Wait, I didn't feel bad at all for kicking that piece of garbage out. Your employers are all super greedy and care about nothing but money. The problem here though is all of that is shown to be in Price's head. We never learn if they're actually good/bad/indifferent. In fact, the only thing we do learn about them shows them in a positive light towards the end of the game.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure what the point of this is or what message I'm supposed to take away. It seems like it wants to say greed, money, capitalism are bad, but completely fails to deliver that point. Am I truly to believe that the creator of this or anyone reading this would enter into a rental agreement with someone for X amount of money per month, have that person pay them less than X/nothing, and would be perfectly happy allowing that person to continue living there? Would never give them a notice that they need to start paying the agreed upon amount? Would never evict them if they continued failing to pay?\n\nIs the message that jobs that deliver bad news for the continuation of life/business should be done away with? Price didn't cause old lady to not pay her rent. Price didn't choose to build a highway that goes through where the guy's cabin is (which he was given restitution for if I recall correctly). Price didn't cause party guy to not have money to pay rent or procrastinate on finding a new place to live when he clearly knew ahead of time to look for a new place.

It is visually gorgeous with fantastic music and surreal, dark atmosphere. But everything else is a mess. Puzzles are unaspiring and gameplay has nothing interesting to offer. It just forces you to go from point A to point B while many times there is absolutely no logic at the protagonist's actions. The story is too simplistic, symbolic and clich\u00e9 and the characters are so flat that you cannot attach emotionally to them. Finally and worst, I'm sure that the creator had some good intentions but the political message I received at the end is morally problematic.\n\n\nManometer: 3/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Unique artistic approach. Nice pixelated 2d graphics with a unique chromatic palette and some nice visual effects. It is gorgeous.\n- Good mysterious, surreal atmosphere. Sometimes it is calm and sometimes it gets really dark. It switches from a dream to a nightmare and vice versa.\n- Fantastic music. It is the strongest part of the game and really enhances the atmosphere.\n- Simple but nice sound design that fits the visual aesthetics.\n- This long narrow format is an interesting choice. It is unique and could symbolize the linear path of the protagonist's life.\n\nThe bad\n- The narrative is too shallow and clich\u00e9. Dialogues are extremely simplistic. The story is naive with a lot of thin symbolisms like it is written for children who have to understand. The ending is as clich\u00e9 as it gets.\n- Characters are flat. They are caricatures that player cannot love or emotionally attach to them. You won't even care about the fate of old miss Goodwin.\n- Sometimes your actions make no sense at all. You just do them because there is nothing else to do. I don't understand why the protagonist gives that meat for cooking while knowing that it is human flesh. I don't understand how he is aware of the flower inside the locked room in the nursing home. And these are not the only examples that lack logic.\n- Gameplay has nothing interesting to offer. It just forces you to go from point A to point B. Puzzles are simplistic, uninspiring and unchallenging. I would have no problem if this was a more movie-like game without puzzles at all. But since puzzles are included, I have to judge them.\n- I felt that it often gets pretentious. Most horror scenes (these with the blood and the slaughtering) have no real reason of existence and they are there just to impress the player. It tries too hard to become a horror game as it packs some silly jump scares and some random \"scary\" sounds too.\n- I'm sure that the developer had good intentions, but I'm not sure about the political correctness of the outcome. I mean, the perspective it puts you feels wrong right from the beginning. The protagonist is the man who seizes properties and not his victims. We watch his life. His nightmares, thoughts and regrets. So what is the teaching? Do I have to believe that these \"wanna be golden boys\" are good guys forced to do bad things while feeling guilty deep inside? Why they don't just pick another job? Are they just naive? Do I have to feel sorry about them when they receive their fat monthly guilty paycheck? If I feel sorry about them, then what should I feel about the real victims?", "timestamp_created": 1638328819, "timestamp_updated": 1638370576, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104656727": {"recommendationid": "104656727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826938698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1609653460}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1638163598, "timestamp_updated": 1638163598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104570616": {"recommendationid": "104570616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178376082", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1638114047}, "language": "english", "review": "And when the mind fails, the body will follow...\n\"Severely depressed me : Well Shit...\"", "timestamp_created": 1638117669, "timestamp_updated": 1638117669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104526805": {"recommendationid": "104526805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413053164", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1610079358}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es bonito y entretenido, pero no m\u00e1s que eso\n\nDisfrut\u00e9 el juego lo mejor que pude de principio a fin y me sorprende que su creador lo haya realizado casi todo \u00e9l mismo en solo tres meses.\n\nSi bien su trama tiene un inicio prometedor gracias a su atm\u00f3sfera l\u00fagubre y misteriosa luego se queda corto ante las expectativas.\n\nTiene momentos que s\u00ed pueden generar un peque\u00f1o sobresalto pero no m\u00e1s que eso.\n\nLa historia tampoco es que sea una obra maestra, b\u00e1sicamente trata de dar una lecci\u00f3n de moralidad pero mal llevada al ser bastante superficial.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico es muy bonito y agradable de observar, aunque a veces puede cansar la saturaci\u00f3n de colores o la falta de estos en ciertos escenarios.\n\nLos puzzles generalmente son bastante sencillos y f\u00e1ciles de superar al punto de que se puede superar el juego en 2 o 3 horas como mucho.\n\nA pesar de todos sus fallos a mi me entretuvo y lo recomiendo para aquellos que casi nunca juegan juegos de aventura gr\u00e1fica porque vale la pena probarlo al ser un juego corto, bonito, entretenido y sencillo.", "timestamp_created": 1638101157, "timestamp_updated": 1638101157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104127732": {"recommendationid": "104127732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800697838", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1607008119}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good and also cheap game!

Each of these games can be finished in a single sitting.\n\nThe first game is a story about a disturbed man who's drive for success causes him to go mad. A man named Price who works for a real estate company has a job that has him going around to peoples houses and evicting them. The story is about how guilty he feels about it and how it's driving him to insanity. The horror in these games reminds me of Silent Hill and the puzzles where super easy, at least for me. The second game is the conclusion to the first one and answers some of the questions that were left over from the first. Although it wasn't as scary as the first one and the games story was a bit more on the nose with it's theme of a man fighting his own demons.\n\nI liked these games, the first one more so. If you want to play them then play both together one after the other. Play the first one on Deluxe Edition instead of the default one.

DISTRAINT sends a real message to it's players who are working for a company who only cares about money, destroying someone else's life along the way. Eventually the guilt will get to you one way or another and potentiality casing harm to yourself or to people around you.\n\nThe only really negative is the time length, it's extremely short but the message is out there in plain sight and is certainly worth the asking price. It's actually kinda a robbery from how cheap the game is.\nTotal Score = 79/100.\n\nSIMILAR GAME LIKE THIS? / REVIEWER PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE:\nDISTRAINT 2\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nDISTRAINT is a horror-novel style of game. It is dark and grim but also has its share of dark humor. The story progresses quickly which allows for several settings and scenarios. Your journey will last around two hours! The gameplay is simple but effective: You move left and right and solve puzzles to progress through the atmospheric story.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1\u25a1\u25a1 7 / 10\n\"What goes around comes around.

Despite having a slow-walking character, there are moments of story telling brilliance which shows through the at time witty, and at other times, intelligent, use of dialogue.\n\nBut are you one for simple mechanics and dreary atmosphere?

I understand this was a stylistic choice, but its one that doesn't really work or make sense to me.). \n\nThe audio is neat I guess but it gets kinda cheesey in the woods with the screeeech sound at regular intervals that is far more annoying and ear piercing than it is creepy. \n\nAs for the gameplay mechanics, this is one of the first places where this game fails to me. it takes farrrr too long to walk from place to place and this game has SO much walking. I would understand this if the walking was meant to be a nerve racking aspect, but when you are really just walking to find that one thing you missed, backtracking between rooms, cabins, and hospitals it gets very frustrating. A bit of a spoiler warning but there is a part where you are in a nightmare with a room full of the old woman you evicted walking around as different variations of herself with one crying in the middle. I actually had to look up the walkthrough for this part as I thought I had soft locked myself or something. In reality, the thing I was missing (after spending 30 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong) was that I was trying to talk to the crying woman from the wrong side. That's right. In this game some characters are approachable from either side and then some you need to be approaching them from the right side and be facing them properly. This mechanic was not explained nor introduced in any way which is strange considering the game doesn't at all mind absolutely ruining the experience everytime you save with the same dialogue \"game saved, whatever that means\". \n\nI tried. I really tried to give this game a second and third chance. After thinking I was softlocked but actually just missing a key mechanic that was never explained I got to another puzzle. A timed puzzle. And oh lord this is where I just lost my shit.  Maybe I'm just bad at puzzles, but considering im not the first in the reviews to be frustrated by this, I don't think it's just an issue with me. Not only is the puzzle timed, but it is also beyond confusing as the layout of the rooms and passages between rooms is terrible. Hallways or doors will lead to the right and then have a door in that room that goes back to the left without having to walk anywhere. It's confusing and frustrating, and having a timer that lasts about 5 seconds that you need to get through half of the doors doesn't help. What was at first a cool mechanic was then a frustrating obstacle that left me wondering what the hell I was doing wrong. \n\nNow for the plot and story which was something that I was actually interested in at first. As someone who is a big fan of critiques of capitalism and/or guilt this story interested me at first. But the symbolism, dialogue, and execution of this was so incredibly lackluster that I found myself groaning in boredom and having to quit playing the game entirely. This paired with the amount of slow, long walking that you have to do,  it becomes unbearable. \n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI'm sure some may enjoy this game, but I absolutely did not. I can see positive aspects like the visuals and atmosphere, but the rest of it is just so bland and uninspired. The only thing that sets it apart from a generic visual novel is the style with the big heads, but if you really want that kind of art style you'd probably find more success and interesting stories with big headed characters from edgy GachaLife tiktok compilations.", "timestamp_created": 1630276618, "timestamp_updated": 1630276618, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Like, why do all the characters look like toddlers wearing poopy diapers? Maybe there\u2019s something deeper, here\u2026 Perhaps it\u2019s a comment on the infantile, self-interested nature of greed? Maybe it\u2019s a reflection of Price\u2019s childlike hero-worship directed toward the heads of the firm where he works and his attempt to grow and gain power in a world that tends to regard him as meek and inconsequential? I don\u2019t have a clue. It kind of just looks like everyone in the game shit their pants. Whatever.\n\nAside from the weirdness, [i]Distraint[/i] proved to be a solid experience. While it curated some moments that will haunt me for a long time, for sure, it also knew how to be fun. (Throwing a drug-fueled eviction party for a soon-to-be homeless renter comes to mind.)\n\nThe story was somewhat simplistic but still thought-provoking. I mean, I never thought I\u2019d play a horror game about bankers or whatever, so I have no standard to measure it against. It still freaked me out, that\u2019s for sure: by the end, I was filled with a sense of dread because I knew that that if I was in the same situations as Price, I\u2019d probably wind up doing the same fucking thing.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the reason I have to recommend this one: the kind of horror that makes me look inward and examine myself is exactly the kind of horror I strive to find. So, if you\u2019re in the market for a horror story with a unique premise and are willing to make allowances for an\u2026 interesting\u2026 art style, you can\u2019t go wrong with this one.

Lo ten\u00eda en deseados desde hace un tiempo y ha sido ahora, mucho tiempo despu\u00e9s cuando lo he comprado. \nLa historia es muy entretenida y desde el principio vas viendo venir esas trazas de cr\u00edtica a la burocracia, al capital, etc. El estilo art\u00edstico y el sonido van tambi\u00e9n muy unidos a esta sensaci\u00f3n de decadencia, de tristeza o m\u00e1s bien de apat\u00eda y disociaci\u00f3n. \nConforme el personaje va entrando en esa espiral psic\u00f3tica y se va encontrando con sus decisiones morales, la historia parece que da un giro de 180 grados y que tambi\u00e9n lo vas a ver venir. Pero ah\u00ed est\u00e1 lo bueno. Este juego sorprende (y para bien) a cada paso que das. De lo que parec\u00eda un cap\u00edtulo de relleno muy sencillo para terminar, acaba saliendo un cierre para la historia brutal, que yo desde luego no he visto venir, pero que explica muchas cosas. \nEn definitiva, un juego recomendad\u00edsimo, gran historia, gran estilo narrativo, puzles sencillos que no dificultan el juego ni te sacan de la narraci\u00f3n. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1620139131, "timestamp_updated": 1620139491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91410820": {"recommendationid": "91410820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450141120", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1490, "last_played": 1620160229}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to pet the murder elephant", "timestamp_created": 1620129163, "timestamp_updated": 1620129163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91395697": {"recommendationid": "91395697", "author": {"steamid": "76561199166437230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1633432760}, "language": "english", "review": "the creepy and eerie atmosphere is just too damn good!definitely recommend this game solely for it's atmosphere and vibe!", "timestamp_created": 1620105712, "timestamp_updated": 1620105712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91246296": {"recommendationid": "91246296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327504149", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1619895760}, "language": "english", "review": "depression hits you so bad after this game", "timestamp_created": 1619895990, "timestamp_updated": 1619895990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91063246": {"recommendationid": "91063246", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061571539", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1619654566}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno, excelente historia y muy recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1619628152, "timestamp_updated": 1619628152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91021850": {"recommendationid": "91021850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022783458", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1587338323}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10", "timestamp_created": 1619554371, "timestamp_updated": 1619554371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468319565057754517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90892972": {"recommendationid": "90892972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312037193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1681141987}, "language": "english", "review": "You will start hating the rat race, your job and the whole concept of money after playing this game.

with the modern way of life.I am playing DISTRAINT 2 and went back to see what I wrote when I finished this one and I was surprised I didn't write a review when I finished this.This game does a good job in describing these mental issues with very simple and clear dialogues so people who are not suffering from these issues can get a clearer picture on what a person goes through,all though if I am honest only someone who is going through these things can really relate to this topic.Many horror games use symbolism to describe mental illness so in my opinion the dev wanted to make this topic clearer through very clear dialogues.\nI love the art style in this game,it is beautiful and yet in a way disturbing at many levels.The music is stunning for a small developer and the sound is also well done and adds to the atmosphere.\nThis game is a proof you don't need to spend big money to make a good horror game because for me it is what we don't see and don't know that is really

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1617454759, "timestamp_updated": 1617454759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410639703273773193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89579971": {"recommendationid": "89579971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867235207", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1695166657}, "language": "spanish", "review": "IS GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1617386883, "timestamp_updated": 1617386883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89531467": {"recommendationid": "89531467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835013150", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1617366366}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are into pixel styled indie horror this short game is amazing for you !\nBeautiful pixel graphics :D", "timestamp_created": 1617323549, "timestamp_updated": 1617323549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89410776": {"recommendationid": "89410776", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039437094", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1617261113}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego y es muy entretenido\n", "timestamp_created": 1617167071, "timestamp_updated": 1617167071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89208798": {"recommendationid": "89208798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965020822", "num_games_owned": 1540, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1629772620}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad es una historia que me dio que pensar,te lo recomiendo.", "timestamp_created": 1616878546, "timestamp_updated": 1616878546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89136339": {"recommendationid": "89136339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082837264", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1616790505}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego.

Te presenta al personaje a la perfecci\u00f3n en tan solo veinte minutos y fuera de lo narrativo, el juego muestra la jugabilidad y las mec\u00e1nicas de forma clara y concisa en tiempo r\u00e9cord. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n deja ver sus fallos casi de inmediato:\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n sonora para los momentos de intriga y tensi\u00f3n est\u00e1 muy bien lograda, el problema es que SUENA TODO EL RATO o bien en escenas en las que simplemente no pega una ambientaci\u00f3n tan creepy. Adem\u00e1s, los puzles son demasiado simples, lo que le quita bastante gracia a la jugabilidad. Sin embargo, estos dos fallos son minucias, aun m\u00e1s si los comparas con el mayor error del que padece la obra: el desarrollo narrativo.\n\nDistraint es una buena historia mal contada y esconde un mensaje que no sabe como ser transmitido. Lo que hace el juego es restregarte la moraleja de la historia a trav\u00e9s de alucinaciones, apariciones fantasmales y pesadillas que surgen de la mism\u00edsima nada (y eso sin mencionar los momentos gore que no tienen raz\u00f3n de ser a parte de demostrar lo  \"\"\"E D G Y\"\"\" que es la trama y... en serio; \u00bfQU\u00c9 L\u00d3GICA TIENE LA PARTE EN LA QUE USAS LA CARNE DE UN CAD\u00c1VER TRITURADO  PARA ALIMENTAR A UNA RESIDENCIA DE ANCIANOS? No tiene nada que ver con la forma de ser del personaje, con el tono de la obra y much\u00edsimo menos con su mensaje. Por suerte, esta es la \u00fanica parte del juego en la que ocurre algo semejante).\nY no solo eso; el simbolismo de Distraint es tan pobre que casi parece una broma (no paraba de reirme con la parte del elefante. Otro momento est\u00fapido sacado de la nada simplemente para impactar).\n\nYa que estamos, otro problema que tiene la historia es que roza el sobredramatismo en su tramo final y a pesar de que la esperad\u00edsima decisi\u00f3n final que toma Price tampoco tiene sentido teniendo en cuenta el intenso debate interno al que se ha sometido a lo largo del juego, el final me parece lo mejor que tiene que ofrecer Distraint (No porque se acabe XD, sino porque es una forma muy inteligente, efectiva y sorprendente de terminar la historia).\n\nEs una pena no poder recomendar Distraint a pesar de sus brillantes pero escasos aciertos narrativos y su precioso apartado art\u00edstico/sonoro. No es un juego horrible -ni much\u00edsimo menos- pero s\u00ed es una obra arruinada por la necesidad de impactar con escenas oscuras o \"\"\"A D U L T A S\"\"\" y por la incapacidad de contar una historia como Dios manda.", "timestamp_created": 1615044617, "timestamp_updated": 1615044863, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453172177076339722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87868199": {"recommendationid": "87868199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119447727", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1614911387}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!

It uses the protagonists house as a break from the main game. I always felt safe and more relaxed there (especially with the good atmosphere and sound-effects, as you can hear traffic) and this creates an effective contrast between the horror segments.\n+ Good attention to detail.

No necesita m\u00e1s que su bello pixel art, oscuro y bien trabajado y dos dimensiones para incomodarte, hacerte sentir mal y captar completamente tu atenci\u00f3n hasta que termines la aventura.\nConsidero que destaca principalmente en dos elementos. Su corte narrativo y como lo presenta y su apartado art\u00edstico. Price, quien es el protagonista al cual controlamos, es un empleado dispuesto a vender su humanidad a cambio de alcanzar la cima. En el proceso, a ra\u00edz de la culpa, experimentar\u00e1 alucinaciones o tendr\u00e1 pesadillas las cuales ser\u00e1n uno de los principales elementos de terror psicol\u00f3gico que podremos presenciar. El juego consigue darte alg\u00fan que otro sobresalto y hacer que sientas en todo momento que [i]las cosas no est\u00e1n bien[/i] gracias a situaciones m\u00f3rbidas (que pueden llegar a ser chocantes al ser tan repentinas) o el extra\u00f1o comportamiento de los personajes. Adem\u00e1s, algunos de ellos dejan entrever cierta humanidad, por ejemplo, Price con sentimientos de culpa o preocupaci\u00f3n, por lo que es f\u00e1cil ponerse en los zapatos de algunos o sentir pena por otros. Por el contrario, habr\u00e1 personajes que dejar\u00e1n muy expuesta la ausencia de su humanidad, por lo que ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil detestarlos. En resumen, su historia me encant\u00f3, no es para nada t\u00edpica, deja un mensaje muy claro, tiene un final inesperado y resulta ser bastante cruda y oscura. Esta es la segunda vez que lo juego, habiendo dejado pasar un a\u00f1o entre medias y reconozco que consigui\u00f3 volverme a sorprender en varios puntos.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2340284356\nSu pixel art es precioso y tan oscuro como su historia. La m\u00fasica en muchas partes ser\u00e1 reemplazada por sonidos extra\u00f1os que pareciesen provenientes de otro mundo o un silencio inc\u00f3modo. El hecho de que no sean f\u00e1ciles de interpretar, es para que estemos alerta ante lo desconocido y preparados para lo que sea que venga. La combinaci\u00f3n entre sus situaciones raras, apartado visual oscuro, sonidos irreconocibles y una historia cruda, forman una excelente atm\u00f3sfera de terror psicol\u00f3gico. Te das cuenta que est\u00e1s ante una buena ambientaci\u00f3n, cuando consiguen darte un sobresalto sin necesidad de emplear un monstruo. En este caso, estoy haciendo un poco de trampa ya que no solo hab\u00eda uno, sino tres de ellos, pero disfrazados de personas normales (un tanto calvas).\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2340279253\nEsta result\u00f3 ser para m\u00ed una experiencia bastante cinematogr\u00e1fica, gracias a las transiciones entre cap\u00edtulos, que resultan ser un fundido en negr0 muy prolongado, las franjas n3gras que ocupan una gran (gran) porci\u00f3n de la parte superior e inferior de la pantalla, una excelente calidad sonora y una iluminaci\u00f3n incre\u00edble. Me gustaron mucho todos estos detalles.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2340318342\nJugablemente es muy simple, por lo que se deja bastante en claro que lo que realmente debe tener peso, son los puntos que se\u00f1al\u00e9 previamente. Habr\u00e1 que buscar una serie de elementos en los distintos cap\u00edtulos y deducir en donde usarlos (muy al estilo de una aventura gr\u00e1fica en este aspecto, aunque mucho menos rebuscado como acostumbran la gran mayor\u00eda de los t\u00edtulos de este g\u00e9nero). Quiz\u00e1s, la implementaci\u00f3n de alg\u00fan que otro puzle no hubiese estado de m\u00e1s, ya que es un juego que se presta a ello. Al ser tan corto (mi primera partida la super\u00e9 en alrededor de 3 horas) y tan interesante en el resto de sus elementos, no se hace repetitivo, pero si creo que hubiese hecho m\u00e1s variada la experiencia.\nSu dificultad es bastante baja, en el sentido de que no cuesta demasiado interpretar lo que se debe hacer. A lo sumo, con lo que se podr\u00eda llegar a tener mayores inconvenientes, es en el hallazgo de alg\u00fan elemento que se necesite para avanzar, pero no deber\u00eda suponer un esfuerzo muy elevado o consumirte mucho tiempo.\nEl \u00fanico detalle que me gustar\u00eda marcar como negativo fue su men\u00fa principal. La navegaci\u00f3n por el mismo me pareci\u00f3 inc\u00f3moda y hasta me hizo creer en un principio que este juego no era compatible con mando. Con el resto de la interfaz (que tampoco es que haya demasiado m\u00e1s) no tuve problemas. Por ejemplo, la selecci\u00f3n de elementos del inventario me result\u00f3 bastante c\u00f3moda y r\u00e1pida.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nUna joya m\u00e1s del marco indie que vale la pena jugar.

You take control of Mr. Price as he battles his inner demons in a greedy world. Tasked with overseeing the removal of poor individuals from their homes for profit, Mr Price is haunted by the people whose lives he touches, and the ghosts of his disappointed parents. As his conscience weighs on him, his dark visions escalate.\n\nThe story itself is well written, but very depressing. It's not for everyone. The game puts a spotlight on disenfranchised people, and those who benefit from their suffering. Those with a sad mood might want to avoid this one. The game does offer a light at the end of the tunnel, but you see some bad stuff to get there.\n\nThe art direction is great. The Pixel graphics, the super wide aspect ratio, the small color pallets, and amazing post processing effects create something very harrowing and different. \n\nSound design is on par with the graphics. The music is pretty subdued, mostly focusing on atmosphere rather than memorable themes. It sets the mood well.\n\nThe weakest aspect is probably the game play. I don't mind linear games, but some of the world and puzzle design felt off to me. I just got done playing \"Little Miss Fortune\" which has similar game play, but that game flowed better than this one. It didn't turn me off, but I think some would be unimpressed by it's simplicity and constant backtracking. Navigating can be a bit confusing as some areas look similar, and the way the 2D environments connect can feel abstract at times.\n\nI quiet enjoyed this one and look forward to playing the sequel, which has been getting even stronger reviews.

It's not recommended for anyone who's already feeling depressed or sad, as it really is a tough game to stomach sometimes, with the atmosphere being depressing and rather cloying, meaning that your thoughts will dwell on the game and its events for some time afterwards. \n\nDISTRAINT is a 2D point and click adventure wherein you have to do your normal point and click stuff - go talk to people, interact with the environment, and solve puzzles. It's all done in a mostly fluid way, though I found a puzzle with mushrooms towards the end to be a particularly tough challenge of one's reflexes, when combined with a bit of pixel hunting to actually figure out where to go. But overall, the gameplay, while treading the well-worn path of countless adventure games that have come before it, is good. \n\nIt's the story that adventure games are known for, and as mentioned before, DISTRAINT tells a bleak and oftentimes too-grim-to-stomach adventure. There are a few moments of levity, and some sweet or uplifting moments, but overall the tone of the game is dark and depressing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, and I genuinely enjoyed the story, but sometimes it all just got a bit too much. Perhaps it was what I was feeling when I played it a while back, but it really is a toughie, for all the good character writing and emotional moments it offers. I'll have to check out the sequel sometime, as I enjoyed this one enough to recommend it to others. \n\nIt's not revolutionary, nor is it the most well-crafted adventure game you've ever played.

You talk with people and solve puzzles while trying to not lose your mind.\nPuzzles are quite simple but one particular section of the game was almost gamebreaking for me. The whole section where you're sniffing mushrooms is annoying and unnecessary confusing. I probably spent more time on that section than the rest of the game. Other than that everything was fine. Puzzles are not hard so they don't distract you from the characters and story for long and the whole game is very short.\n\nGraphics are again as the game itself are very simplistic but I loved the animations and the whole graphics design from aesthetic point of view.\n\nSound design for the game of such small caliber is well done. There are no voice overs obviously, but overall sound design is great, creepy sounds and atmosphere makes this a good game for october.\n\nThis game is a little gem, I don't even remember where i've got it from and it was sitting my \"crap\" folder until I decided to sort games by horror tag to celebrate halloween month.

Eres Price y trabajas en una multinacional con muchas propiedades y muchos inquilinos, algunos de los cuales pasan apuros para pagar lo que deben, y tu tarea es informar a aquellas personas que no han cumplido su pago que deben abandonar su casa, eres un desahuciador. \nPrice tiene conciencia de lo que hace y no le gusta pero quiere una vida mejor y al final no le importa el da\u00f1o que provoca con su curro; hasta que conoce a la se\u00f1ora Goodwin y su vida cambia y nosotros veremos ese proceso mientras se sume en una depresi\u00f3n que le lleva a tener pesadillas y alucinaciones que dan al juego un toquecillo de terror que hasta te har\u00e1 brincar de la silla con sus 4 jumpscares.\nJuego en el que destaca sobre todo que lo hizo un solo t\u00edo, Jesse Makkonen, y le ha quedado muy chulo y bastante decente sin llegar a ser gran cosa. \nTiene cositas malas pero no especialmente graves. Quiz\u00e1 lo peor sea que todo el juego consiste en hacer siempre lo mismo, andar por ah\u00ed buscando cosas que usar en determinados lugares para seguir avanzando, y al final es algo que cansa un poco y eso que es corto. Solo hay un puzzle que es distinto pero es tan f\u00e1cil que se desaprovecha. Tampoco es algo que critique mucho porque yo creo que el creador buscaba m\u00e1s contar una historia que desafiarte para avanzar, tanto es as\u00ed que ni puedes morir en todo el juego, y eso est\u00e1 bien pero un mayor componente jugable hubiera estado mejor. Tampoco ayuda que dichos puzzles, en su mayor\u00eda, no tengan l\u00f3gica alguna de modo que la gente que vas a echar de su casa te piden antes de firmar un favor que no cabe en l\u00f3gica alguna. Quiz\u00e1 sea fruto de la mente cada vez m\u00e1s tocada de Price pero creo que no es as\u00ed porque para eso salen esas partes perturbadoras para reflejar eso. Y tampoco esto es algo grave pero a m\u00ed me sac\u00f3 del juego un poquito porque cuenta una historia bastante realista con subtramas sin sentido.\nTodo lo dem\u00e1s muy bien, tanto la m\u00fasica como su aspecto visual (que es feo pero chulo a la vez) est\u00e1n conseguidos de forma adecuada, los di\u00e1logos son buenos y la historia tambi\u00e9n, acabando en un final que a m\u00ed me gust\u00f3 bastante.\nJuego recomendable aunque al ser del tipo que es, a muchos ni les interesar\u00e1 probarlo. Es muy barato as\u00ed que el precio no es excusa.

Now I know I've become a sucker for solo devs as of late~ But apparently I had even owned his first game \"Silence of The Sleep\" without knowing it, so that's pretty cool and I'll get to it one of these days! \n\nThen it hit me, they must have a hard time with promotions. Since I only saw this game from the hot deals Steam was having and was surprised why I had never seen (or rather paid attention to) it before! Reading the synopsis- I immediately thought of \"Drag Me to Hell\" and that cemented my decision to an already irresistible bundle of OG Distraint, an improved deluxe version and its sequel!! Alas, how will this turn out?\n\n\n[h1]\"Paid My Dues\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nPrice is a debt collector who isn't doing the best financially. So, in an attempt to not pass up a rags-to-riches offer of making partner with McDade, Burton and Moore- he agrees to some legally but not morally justified decisions by evicting three individuals. However, he may not be as resilient as he thought because his actions begin to torment him slowly at first.... but surely. Can he go through with it after all? \n\n[spoiler] ! Last notice. You've been warned. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) The Descent[/b]\nGameplay consists of 2D exploration and puzzle-solving, nothing too complex usually for a key item to unlock the next area or meet up with someone. Pick up an item, store it and then use it on another point of interest. If it sounds extremely simple, that's because it is which is a good thing! There is not even a button to run! Therefore, the controls are easy to master and don't distract you from being immersed in the well-crafted story, disturbing experiences as well as hopefully being able to take away the central lesson. \n\nInitially the game my seem cut-and-dry as it starts you off right away in the first distraint scenario and then plagued by the guilt shortly after. Then you return to your dwellings to start the next case. But you'll be surprised to hear it has a reasonable pace!\n\n[b](b) A Deadly Sin[/b] \nI thought the plot was the strongest part of the game. Price is not actually a bad person, not at all instead he's just doing his job or so he tries to tell himself. Seeing him bothered by how the eviction affected the three very different individuals showed his treatment of others is still very humane. This is also apparent in how he tries to make the process as smooth and considerate as possible by fulfilling their requests. Some took more of a toll on him than others, particularly the elderly woman in poor health.\n\n[spoiler]She could also technically be considered as the main \"antagonist\" because she's the source of his nightmares.[/spoiler] However, that would be presumptuous of me because after all Price brought it on himself and he has been shown to be rather materialistic as well by opting to get things like a new coffee maker and fantasizing of a better place, as is the aim of life after all.\n\n[b](c) Shred of Sanity[/b] \nThe game has a dark sense of humor and you often question whether it's appropriate to burst out laughing but then you do it anyways. There are many instances where you can \"pretend\" to match an obviously wrong item during your interactions which will actually hint at Price's defining trait- the ability to crack a joke and laugh at himself, the situation or both! These also nab you achievements and are just some harmless fun~ \n\nThere also some rarer 4th wall-breaking dialogue such as when you save your progress which only make you realize this is a game based on reality. Then it sets in- how the game makes you take delight in every moment. Price's bosses encouraging him to do a celebratory dance is a small sign of control and priming him to take pleasure in the work.    \n\n[b](d) Looking Out for No. 1[/b] \nI've probably touched on some of the horror elements; its close to home topic of debt, greed and what it can unleash. Now we'll explore more on what makes this scary. \n\n1st) The graphics- the grainy filter and design of the characters make them out to look barely human. This suits the central idea of Price selling himself for a chance at the grand life. For example, whether the grotesque and gory happenings that occur are real or has Price gone mad beyond saving? These hallucinations, nightmares although unnerving on their own; the often unknown sounds and excessively off-putting visuals. All these can be [spoiler]said to be symptoms of a mental illness playing out in extreme forms.[/spoiler] \n\n2nd) One section where he dabbles in an unknown substance to overcome obstacles as part of a puzzle subtly alluding to drugs of which is another indulgence he may well end up doing to ease his pain.\n\n3rd) [Spoiler] There's also the fact that regardless of how badly you want to have a say in Price's choices and affect the outcome, you'll find it's impossible and you have to bear witness to what unfolds[/spoiler]. Case in point, the ending which is a real downer and I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me self-reflect.\n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Not of Sound Mind[/b] \nI did encounter one interaction issue where the prompt to interact appears but is untouchable as if no description was written to begin with. However, perhaps most irritating is the slight delay or inconsistent near unpredictable nature of the prompt appearing when trying to examine stuff/people. When moving, the prompt doesn't appear- that's fine. So just stop right?\n\n But then you can only interact with them when facing at the right direction (often only one fixed one). It gets worse during one timed sequences! Of course, there's also how sometimes you can interact from an arm length's away and then others breathing down their necks. \n\n[b](ii) You'll Live[/b]\nI mentioned that the puzzles are straightforward but they required quite a bit of backtracking, I'm sorry \"backwalking\" for such a linear game. I also had times where I went \"huh\" at the logic of some puzzles. I get that the world, his mental state become questionable and so this is mirrored in the puzzles. Still weird though... \n\nThe scares also rely more on shock value and may have been a tad too violent, dare I say to the point of player desensitization. Unless, that was the point... There was one other baffling encounter where the same jumpscares were done twice in exactly the same way and it really bugged me.\n\n\n[h1]\"But Not The Price?\"[/h1]\n\nTo conclude, Distraint is an exceptional 2D horror adventure that easily stands out with its scarring premise and very realistic portrayal of how greed can lead to one's spiral of regret. It poses a genuine dilemma that's still relevant- whether a person is ever truly sure of the difference between want and need. The despicable decisions that Price (or rather you) resorts to and the horrid episodes to punish you remain the most iconic scenes. \n\nThough that does reputation fall short at times by certain vexing interactions and cheap scares. This short game is arguably worth the $5 tag and though you have the power to quit at any moment, you will find that desire robbed as it forces you to continue. The worst part is- you just might enjoy it.   \n\n\n[h1]8.5/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Apparently there's a direct sequel so we'll see how that goes~[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1595118615, "timestamp_updated": 1623436798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627721548080444336", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72916834": {"recommendationid": "72916834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202853083", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1594856250}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an excellent story-puzzle game which will keep you occupied for a couple of hours.

Basically you're like a repo man who goes around evicting people from their homes and it ends up serving as the basis for a sort of morality play.\n\nI wish I could think of something highbrow and capital-L Literary to compare this to so my high school English teachers would be proud.  I mean, there's got to be a story like this out there somewhere, right?  What keeps coming to mind, though, is that movie where Keanu Reeves gets a job at Satan's law firm.  Whereas that one dealt with pride up in the skyscrapers of New York, here you're down in the muck with good old money-grubbing greed.\n\nWhat profit a man if he gain a coffee maker but lose his soul?\n\nIn matters of conscience like this, the tension is always in the tug of war between the angel and the devil on your shoulders.  We hear an awful lot from the devil's end.  The author clearly relishes this Grand Guignol style and takes every opportunity to indulge in all its lurid excesses.  \n\nScenes light up like stage acts in glaring oversaturated spotlights.  Daring brush strokes of color, shadow and sound imbue the drama with a demented vitality.   Blood-splattered, carnivalesque visions of the surreal haunt the protagonist like Furies; and it's all played out by bobbleheaded little caricatures that give it the feel of a macabre puppet show.  Very striking.\n\nProblem is, the angel side of the battle doesn't get the same airtime.  A single concrete thread of nagging guilt runs throughout; but somber and touching as it is, it fails to counterbalance the manic energy of the game's dark side.  They're having so much fun that you get the sense they pull their punch a little, and it ends up weakening the impact of the whole parable.\n\nThey refer, for example, to the protagonist's family from time to time, yet this aspect of his character is never really developed in full.  It could have added some extra depth to his motivations and real emotional weight to the decisions he makes.  The story does manage to create some pathos, and even ends with a neatly tied-off loop; but it falls short of the real tragedy that it might have reached with a little more thorough attention to detail.  \n\nFor all its virtues, then, this game never quite manages to exceed the sum of its parts; but fortunately the parts themselves are all pretty good so you still wind up ahead.  Just not as far as you might have liked.\n\n\n\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page.

What I find it interesting is the story itself of the protagonist, Mr.Price and the deeds he did in order to achieve his goals. Aside that, it also tells a simple moral value to us, that in what we do, always be good. Now when it comes to gameplay, it's pretty simple to play. Graphics and musics wise are above expectations and of course, the story itself wins it all. It's brilliant as how the story is delivered out. So, in a nutshell, Distraint is an amazing game.

He does state this or that is disgusting and how can that be happening but does nothing to change it. Which goes into the old saying that actions speak louder than words. Is it sad? yes Can it be a bit depressing? Yes But as someone who doesn't go thru this world with mothereffing rainbows and butterflies and has seen the worst or knows the worse this world has to offer......not really fazed by this game.

The story is about an ambitious young man named Price who happens to be just an ordinary guy working for a greedy company that seizes people\u2019s property. In exchange for a partnership with his employers Price is sent to meet with three people who he must inform can no longer stay in their home. \n\nPrice is portrayed as a genuinely good guy who just wants to live a normal life. He isn't chasing after exorbitant riches; All he wants is a home that doesn't leak in rainy days but at what cost? As the story progresses he can feel that his humanity is gone, so the rest of his journey follows him dealing with himself and his choices along the way. His basic desires, rather than a hyperbolic chasing of wealth, shift the game to a neutral perspective that allow you to sympathize with both Price and the victims of his line of work. In conclusion the story is about \"regrets\".\n\nThe gameplay is kept simplistic but very effective and that works. Most of the time you would find items and solve simple puzzles. Creative mix of artistic design, sound with pixelated horror effects makes Distraint a very unique experience. The soundtrack is yet again very beautiful and just feels natural given the game's tone and the stuff you see in the game! I gotta appreciate that the entire game was crafted by one guy and that's pretty impressive and puts other games from similar genre to shame. Distraint's story is twisted but the developer also delivers positive [and negative] messages but how you take it is left upto you.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n-Skillfully told story that's very engaging and touching\n-Good use of dark humor \n-Soundtrack that just works really well...\n-Perfect balance of creepy atmosphere and some refreshing moments that'll keep you engaged with the 2 hour adventure\n-Compelling premise of self-destructive regrets\n-satisfying ending (wished if there were multiple endings)\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-No interactive dialogues \n-Some grammer mistakes due to poor translation\n-No way to rebind keys or change graphical settings\n-A bit too short\n\n[h1] My Rating: 8/10 [/h1]\n\nI bought it on sale and it was worth every penny. The duration of the game and the sale price of the game kinda balance themselves out in that aspect I suppose. It's on sale frequent number of times, so yes I recommend; do buy it.

It is not a very long game, and that is a huge plus for this genre.

Player is set repetively from one edge of map to another to complete those small illogical missions. Environment is changing after some progress so many many times you have to return and check if you not missing somehtin because you unlocking further progress path. Most of the times this path is where you already been. So typical mission look like this:\n- walk some rooms\n- at the end of this few rooms you find some item\n- you cant know where to use this item as solution is unlogical so you looking for place where to use it by clicking action key\n- you return to beggining finding out item destination\n- you unlock something on this rooms that will make further progress\n\nIts boring walking and searching like that. Desing choice was apparently made because of lack of content. So you just repeat same rooms 20 times. \n\nThis causes I will not return to this tile and I have mixed feelings as it had potential for something more. Decision about creating game in such short period was wrong. Distraint could be much much better game by desing if developer decided to add more content and exclude nonsense...\n\nBTW buy game that was released year before distraint - propably distraint is trying to copy it\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/253330/Neverending_Nightmares/", "timestamp_created": 1561846029, "timestamp_updated": 1562014569, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517202973365783691", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52195292": {"recommendationid": "52195292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125942930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1614475607}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un juego cortito y muy piola n.n algunos puzzles medio raros pero lo vale :)", "timestamp_created": 1561843193, "timestamp_updated": 1561843193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52180321": {"recommendationid": "52180321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041064198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1561424599}, "language": "english", "review": "Why do the slightly obvious upcoming noises still startle me even know I know they are on their way?", "timestamp_created": 1561840845, "timestamp_updated": 1561840845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52132320": {"recommendationid": "52132320", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971026821", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1547771015}, "language": "english", "review": "A well written, short game.

Like helping some guy find his dog is pretty damn spooky. However, I wasn't scared playing the game, it' s not that type of horror.\n\nThe visuals (including the gore), lighting, and sound all work together to create some really creepy scenes. The choice to keep the game in a very small aspect ratio works well. The scenes are eerie, they did a great job with the atmosphere of the game.\n\nHowever, by the end I was getting a little bored of running around. The final scene is contrived for no reason. Many of the other puzzles make some sense, weird sense, but at least there's some thought behind them. Also one of the puzzles has you running around in a time limit. Well, I can't go for that. It's a pain in the ass to have to map out a very similar looking area AND be reliant on a timer.\n\nOverall, Distraint is good and I enjoyed playing it. The small complaints I have are easy to forget about. The game is only a couple of hours anyway. Knowing all that I do recommend that game. It's unique and looks awesome! I gotta check out Distraint 2.\n\nCheckout my curator for more reviews!\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/26701155-The-Pepp-Selection/", "timestamp_created": 1556286439, "timestamp_updated": 1556286439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50308094": {"recommendationid": "50308094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076035826", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1612044986}, "language": "english", "review": "Was surprised by how good it was, despite getting it for free. \n\nReally creepy game, well worth your time!", "timestamp_created": 1556145502, "timestamp_updated": 1556145502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50293628": {"recommendationid": "50293628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239780110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1554300995}, "language": "english", "review": "less exciting than pumped bmx+", "timestamp_created": 1556076232, "timestamp_updated": 1556076232, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491266340017318726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50281518": {"recommendationid": "50281518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851034407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1556026137}, "language": "english", "review": "when first playing this game i didn't think much of it but as you go down the line you start to feel bad and the story shows this  and the more and more you play and though it may look like it doesn't have horror or anything to do with it in it the slightest bits but even the little jumpsarce's made me jump and think wtf is this and sometime's question it but the ending and all is where you get feels a lot i got this on sale not thinking much of it but defintinely worth the cash you should buy it outright sale or not this may not seem like a good review but why spoil the game without even playing you wont regret it unless you've got too highstand's\n", "timestamp_created": 1556022146, "timestamp_updated": 1556022146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50274186": {"recommendationid": "50274186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326416946", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 211, "last_played": 1570470372}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego muy bueno, con una historia interesante y puzzles ingeniosos.

All of the quests had an easy-to-follow plot that left enough mystery to thoroughly creep me out, despite its mostly minimalist art style. The moving backdrops were captivating, physics were smooth, animations were vivid, the sprites being cutesy bobble-heads never detracted from the creepiness, and the characters were all very unique and recognizable; matching the environments in which they were placed. The last part is important because, when a character showed up outside of the environment in which the player met them, it was immediately apparent that they were not supposed to be there, whether they were an illusion or an apparition, which remains an apt story-telling technique in horror games, but, I particularly admire this artist for making it happen in two-dimensional faux-16-bit. The different scenes of this game were so well-formed as individual, and at times extremely life-like spaces, that I was never confused about the mood each character and space were supposed to induce, every time they appeared on my screen.\n\nThis game rocked.\n\nBut I never write reviews and I wanted to give this game my wholehearted praise for its very small development team (I'm hesitant to assume it was literally just one dude??? That'd be sweet, and very impressive), also, its ease of access for casual players, and, MOST importantly, its accessibility for disabled players.\n\nI'm going to put at the end of this review, THIS IS A      D I S A B L E D  -  F R I E N D L Y   GAME!!!\n\nTHIS PC GAME CAN BE PLAYED WITH ONLY ONE HAND!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU HAVE ONE HAND, OR TWO REALLY SHITTY HANDS, OR JUST A GOOD FOOT, AND YOU CANT PLAY NEARLY ANY GAMES, then give this game a shot. It's a great mix between puzzle, story-based, and spooky.

Is it a good game? I will be reviewing the game with a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n     The story is amazing. It is an emotional roller coaster with traces of horror, sadness, happiness, and other emotions. If your not big on jumpscares and loud noises do stick with it because the pay off of the story is well worth it.\n\n      The music is great. It sets the mood without feeling too forced. It is used to make the horror feel even scarier or the sad moments more sorrowful.\n\n      The dialogue is great. Even if there is not voice acting the words in the text feel grounded to reality. Something a person in that situation would say and act.\n\n      Graphics are super good. It is dark and grim for scary and sad moments and well light for the opposite emotional moments.\n\nCon:\n      The game is short. This is a minor nitpick but the game can last you for like 1 to 2 hours.\n\nConclusion:\n       The game is amazing. It is a worth while experience from the starting title screen. I had a blast getting all the achievements and seeing the story. I know a sequal is made and I am super pumped to grab a copy when it goes on sale. The only negative is that the game is short but with how great the story and how many people made the game, the short length is understandable.

However, there are are no opponents and thus almost no fail states in the game.

Definition aside, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with this game. It was another impulse/sale purchase that I was drawn to because of the \"psychological horror\" tag and unique art style. I have to say, for a cheap/sale game it's definitely worth playing. \n\nAs I said, the art style gives the game a very unique feel. Although unsettling at times, I wouldn't say that the story is particularly chilling. Jump scares are scattered throughout the game without being gratuitous; they fit in with the story and occur at appropriate moments. In fact, towards the end of the game, certain things will tie in with moments experienced by the player early in the game. It's a nice way of bringing all the little story elements together. The jump scare music could be a bit much at times, but it wasn't terrible. I think my only other complaint would be the walking: there was too much walking at times, and the player character (Price) doesn't move very quickly. It was nothing that would put me off the game entirely, but it did prove a bit cumbersome in certain areas.\n\nAll things considered, this was a fun purchase. The story ends about as well as you might expect. The achievements aren't particularly difficult to obtain, especially if you're weird like me and try all sorts of random things (like obtaining water for your coffee from a very, very questionable source, ha ha). The game itself is pretty short, taking around an hour to complete. Definitely worth a look if you're into promising indie games/developers.

Abstenerse los amantes de los juegos de moda y los predecibles que no se atreven a salir nunca de su c\u00edrculo de confort. \n\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1547288607, "timestamp_updated": 1547289188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75026315450668335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48266400": {"recommendationid": "48266400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028818685", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1547261325}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game in a weird way... abit short (100% the game in 2.2 hours) but it was a fun ride.", "timestamp_created": 1547261449, "timestamp_updated": 1547261449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48249737": {"recommendationid": "48249737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131064087", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1547203183}, "language": "english", "review": "i finished this game in 2.5 hours but it was a fun ride i would highly recommend this and the second game as well", "timestamp_created": 1547203611, "timestamp_updated": 1547203611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48245412": {"recommendationid": "48245412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088485860", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1547178013}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

Con un trabajo as\u00ed, es imposible que no surjan momentos dram\u00e1ticos y que haya remordimientos.

El sonido ambiental y la m\u00fasica son simplemente geniales, dotando al juego de mucha tensi\u00f3n por momentos y una ambientaci\u00f3n genial.

Menudo juegazo de terror. Si no lo has jugado deber\u00edas hacerlo a la primera oportunidad que tengas si te gustan ese tipo de juegos porque te va a encantar, tanto por su jugabilidad tan original, como por su argumento y por las ideas y mensajes tan interesantes que muestra en esa aventura.\n\nSabiendo esto, poder disfrutar de una nueva aventura suya era, a priori, una muy buena noticia. Ya sab\u00eda que el juego era realmente corto, de unas dos horas, pero algunas veces la duraci\u00f3n es lo de menos si la experiencia es buena. Lamentablemente, la experiencia no ha sido lo que esperaba ni mucho menos, aunque esto no significa que haya sido mala, sino m\u00e1s bien insuficiente, demasiado plana y con un terror gratuito que no da miedo y que no tiene sentido ni porqu\u00e9.\n\nEl juego nos pone en el papel de un joven llamado Price, el cual trabaja para una empresa de embargos y su cometido es visitar a las personas para informales de que tienen que abandonar sus casas debido a los impagos. De hecho \u201cDistraint\u201d significa \u201cEmbargo\u201d, por si no lo sab\u00edas. Como puedes ver, no es que se haya comido mucho el tarro con el t\u00edtulo, y es un buen indicativo de lo poco que se lo comi\u00f3 luego para hacer el juego.\n\nEmpezamos a controlar al joven Price cuando se dispone a encontrar la casa de una ancianita a la que tiene que darle la mala noticia de que debe abandonar su hogar por el retraso en sus pagos. Ese hecho marcar\u00e1 tremendamente al joven Price, pero \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? Pues es muy buena pregunta, porque el juego simplemente te dice que esto es as\u00ed y punto. No hay explicaci\u00f3n, no hay motivo, no hay una historia oculta\u2026 nada de nada. Simplemente es as\u00ed y ya est\u00e1.\n\nEsto le resta mucha verosimilitud al personaje y a la historia en s\u00ed misma, ya que presenta unos personajes con muy poco fondo argumentativo, y quiere despertar unos sentimientos en el jugador que es imposible que sucedan porque lleva jugando 5 minutos escasos.\n\nHubiera estado genial que hubiera habido una historia de fondo, pero que va. Bueno, hay una historia, claro, pero no tiene ni pies ni cabeza. \n\nHay que tener en cuenta que Price se dedica a esto, desde hace tiempo, y esa reacci\u00f3n de remordimiento es insustancial y poco cre\u00edble, porque no va acompa\u00f1ada de un argumento que respalde dichos sentimientos.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, ese terror que muestra el juego tal vez sea el m\u00e1s gratuito que haya podido ver en un videojuego. Mientras desarrollamos la aventura, de vez en cuando ir\u00e1n apareciendo escenas dantescas. Cuerpos mutilados, sangre en las paredes, y dem\u00e1s casquer\u00eda aderezadas con algunos \u201csustitos\u201d a modo de apariciones repentinas acompa\u00f1adas de su correspondiente efecto sonoro. \u00bfY la raz\u00f3n cu\u00e1l es? No la hay. Simplemente ves esas cosas porque s\u00ed.\n\nS\u00ed, es cierto que al final del juego uno puede encontrarle una raz\u00f3n a eso, muy rebuscada eso s\u00ed, pero aun as\u00ed sigue siendo una utilizaci\u00f3n muy burda y gratuita del terror, que es utilizado m\u00e1s como una excusa para crear ambiente que como una raz\u00f3n argumentativa que explique el porqu\u00e9.\n\nEn su aspecto jugable, el juego presenta una jugabilidad parecida a lo visto en juegos como Claire o Lone Survivor, pero mucho m\u00e1s simplificado todo.\n\nIremos visitando diferentes estancias con sus respectivas habitaciones donde encontraremos algunos objetos con los que interactuar y que utilizaremos para resolver los diferentes puzles que nos presenta el juego, los cuales ser\u00e1n muy pocos y adem\u00e1s facil\u00edsimos.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente el juego es raro, bastante raro. Utiliza una paleta de colores apagados y chillones al mismo tiempo, con una especie de bamboleo en la imagen que bien pareciera que se ha roto en mil pedazos la sincronizaci\u00f3n vertical.\n\nLos personajes son cabezones al extremo, con unas almendras m\u00e1s grandes que sus cuerpos, y el triple de grandes que casi cualquier objeto que haya en pantalla. Por ejemplo, la mollera del personaje es como diez veces m\u00e1s grande que cualquier v\u00e1ter que nos encontremos en el juego. Ah\u00ed es nada.\n\nSin embargo, el aspecto visual es, en cierto modo, interesante. Es raro, en un ambiente raro, y eso resulta interesante de manera inexplicable. Eso s\u00ed, es bastante feo, para qu\u00e9 negarlo, pero tienen su \u201cencanto\u201d, por decirlo de alguna manera.\n\nEl apartado sonoro, por otra parte, es bastante bueno. Tiene melod\u00edas bastante bien realizadas y muy inmersivas, con ese toque de misterio y tensi\u00f3n que le sienta realmente bien al juego.\nDicho todo esto, igual te preguntas el porqu\u00e9 de darle un voto positivo. Bueno, la verdad es que el juego es entretenido, y aun no siendo un juego notable, no merece un suspenso tampoco. Podr\u00edamos decir que es de aprobado raspado y nada m\u00e1s. \n\nSu argumentaci\u00f3n es muy floja, su terror es bastante insulso y gratuito, sus puzles demasiado f\u00e1ciles y la manera de hacer al jugador part\u00edcipe del \u201cdrama\u201d que plantea es irrisorio, porque no est\u00e1 bien planteado al presentarlo todo atropelladamente y sin darnos tiempo a empatizar con los personajes ni con la historia. \n\nSin embargo, es entretenido durante las dos horas que dura y ofrece algo diferente. Su surrealismo es atractivo, aunque carente de explicaci\u00f3n, y puede presumir de tener una personalidad propia que en cierto modo es bastante atractiva e interesante. En definitiva, es un producto de bundle satisfactorio, pero poco m\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1545305785, "timestamp_updated": 1545305785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536064624786376953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47602643": {"recommendationid": "47602643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135074487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1544023054}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple and amazing, I got it free and it worth of my time.", "timestamp_created": 1545121505, "timestamp_updated": 1545121505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47600754": {"recommendationid": "47600754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106306580", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1545109526}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting, brief adventure game with a dark message to it.

It distracted me a great deal and I was ready to frustratedly play through the rest of it with gritted teeth. As I got further in, the story and presentation grew on me quickly. We play as Price, a man who evicts old people from their beloved homes in the hopes of scoring a partnership with a large company. As Price repossesses the property of different people, horrible nightmare creatures appear intermittently and nobody except us seems to notice. This is [i]very[/i] creepy, and would be even more so if the game wasn\u2019t at all times soaked in a creepy atmosphere that keeps us expecting these things to happen most of the time. The game\u2019s muddy, confused visuals seem to mostly have been for the purpose of reducing the amount of work for the developer. This title could easily have been a memorable experience if the most light-hearted of scenes weren\u2019t presented with the same creeping dread as all the monsters.\n\nWhat [i]Distraint[/i] does demonstrate is a very good attempt at short fiction. I\u2019ve repeatedly said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth using games over any other medium if you\u2019re not going to use interactivity in aid of the story, and that\u2019s exactly the problem with this one. There are a variety of point-and-click puzzles, but they\u2019re always totally bizarre and unrelated to what\u2019s going on. At one point we\u2019re visiting an institutionalised victim of our repossession, and before we\u2019re allowed to actually see her, we have to arbitrarily find a flower in another, locked room. This adds [i]nothing[/i] to the story, it\u2019s just padding to lengthen a very short game. What the developer would have done well to understand is that a short game doesn\u2019t equal a bad one. Indeed, [i]Distraint[/i] would have done better if it was shorter. In fact, [i]Distraint[/i] would have been better as a short story, because none of the unique traits of video games as a medium are utilised as part of its story. The visuals add nothing, the interactivity adds nothing, and ultimately its shortcomings just butcher what could have been a really good little project.", "timestamp_created": 1544575306, "timestamp_updated": 1544575306, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49487033486366272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47472245": {"recommendationid": "47472245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380671742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1544574120}, "language": "english", "review": "That's a great game with a really good ending. ty", "timestamp_created": 1544574312, "timestamp_updated": 1544574312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491266340017318726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47472088": {"recommendationid": "47472088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276840929", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1590403297}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un buen juego terror psicologico, si te gusta el genero seguramente lo disfrutes tiene una corta pero buena historia, los puzzle no son de gran dificultad pero eso no quita que te vayan a hacer pensar un poco en como resolverlos.\nEn conclusion \u00bfdeberias comprate este juego? \nsolo si te gusta el genero y aun asi te recomendaria esperar a una oferta aunque el juego sea muy barato, al menos que quieras apoyar al desarrollador en ese caso compralo que seguramente lo disfrutes.", "timestamp_created": 1544573664, "timestamp_updated": 1544573664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50354611873626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47471366": {"recommendationid": "47471366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025070619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1544569961}, "language": "english", "review": "Not much of  game but more like a interactive story with a two memory puzzles. \nNice atmosFEAR, GOREphics and STORY. \nMostly recommended in discount.", "timestamp_created": 1544570182, "timestamp_updated": 1544570182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437044709920883179", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47466200": {"recommendationid": "47466200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080021002", "num_games_owned": 1710, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 76, "last_played": 1544551352}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1544551378, "timestamp_updated": 1544551378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491266340017318726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47459198": {"recommendationid": "47459198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835438796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1557072813}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanto la historia y como un juego que es 2D del tipo pixeleado te haga estar incomodo o con miedo me encanto tanto que compre el 2 que tambien esta muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1544528397, "timestamp_updated": 1544528397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481801331043243408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47453760": {"recommendationid": "47453760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198864436488", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1544503588}, "language": "english", "review": "*Sigh*.......What can I even say?

After all, what we find scary is very personal and subjective. So, what kind kind of horror game is Distraint? \n\nThis horror story follows a man called Price, a young man with a hard life who's eager to make his name and find success in the world. To do so, he ends up working in the uneviable business of homes, or more specifially home eviction. In his desire to find success, he ends up in the unenviable job of being the man to kick people from their homes when they stop paying. This in turn leads to him felling guilt over kicking a kind elderly woman from her home, which sends him down a path of guilt and regret. Making matters worse is his own existing struggles of being poor and his parents being dead. This ties in with the games horror of guilt, greed, and regret. \n\nAs to how well it handles these things, that's a bit of a different story. Personally, I enjoyed the emotional struggle of Price. He is the underdog that we root for, the guy down on his luck that we want to see succeed. So, when the world and himself  beats him up for wanting a better life, you feel for him. This is made more apparent when even other people, the people he and his company kicks out understand and are ok with what he does. The old lady he kicks out is actually understanding towards what he does. It creates that feeling where you know a man is hurting over his \"mistake\", when other people understand why he did what he did. I think it makes for stronger, more believable writing.\n\nThe other \"message\" of the game, \"Greed is bad\" falls flat on its face though. That's because a) It's a very overdone theme that we all know what is will be said b) feels contradicted by the feelings of Price since he regrets his choice of wanting money and success over people and c) is VERY blunt and in your face about it, which almost always makes a message come off poorly.  There's a couple of points in the story where they explicitly state the message they want to send, which reeks of not trusting the intelligence of the audience. \n\nThe gameplay of Distraint is very simple. You move left and right, talk to people, and solve puzzles. You only have 3 inventory slots, and all the puzzles in the game require no more than two. It's all very simple. Areas are short and small and the puzzles are simple and easy to solve, minus one puzzle involving using mushrooms to navigate an area. That's the most complex puzzle in the game, with the other puzzles involving going to a place picking up an item, and using it somewhere else (I did like the dialouge that you get when you use items in places you shouldn't. It's a nice touch.) \n\nThe game is short and simple, so short that you can beat it about 3 hours. Distraint also doesn't have any replay value aside from some secret achievements. So, you have a short game that you only beat once, maybe twice if you feel like it. \n\nAs for stuff like visuals and audio, they're pretty good. Music is pretty minimalistic, but it adds to the ambiance of all the places you visit, and a couple of tracks are pretty good. The spritework and art is really good, with deatiled and dreary environments that add to the atmosphere. Character sprties look a bit odd, with the giant heads, but they're well made and look good as well. \n\nSo, in summation, if you're someone who enjoys horror games (psychological horror especially) or who likes short length games that you play once, then I think you'll enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1543278962, "timestamp_updated": 1543278962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

[/b] If this game interests you, go play that instead. You'll have a better time. That game is actually a survival horror game. This is just a corny, preachy storyline with silly puzzles and mediocre scares. \n\nThe storytelling in this game is extremely heavy-handed - essentially amounting to little more than propaganda against debt collectors. Like - we get it - it's sad when people get evicted from their homes. But what are we supposed to do about it? Just dismantle property rights and let people live wherever they want for free? I'm genuinely open to this discussion (while I do not agree at all with this premise), but the game clearly isn't. In this game, there's nothing to discuss. What's bad is bad, and there's no nuance to it at all. The villains are extremely exaggerated. And the game tries to make stupid jokes constantly, which really detracts from the atmosphere.\n\nTo top it all off - [spoiler] the game REQUIRES you to help the protagonist commit suicide at the end! [/spoiler] What a middle finger to the audience. I found it disrespectful to people who have been touched by suicide [spoiler] to force you into that scene in order to complete the game. [/spoiler]\n\nSo while I did enjoy the artwork and the atmosphere - the fact that it was created by a single person is not lost on me, kudos - this game's storytelling is far too amateurish to recommended. I'm glad I didn't pay for this. I certainly won't be playing the sequel. I adore point-and-click adventure games. I love survival horror games. I should be the target audience for this.

It details the story of Mr. Price, a young expropriator trying to finally secure himself a decent living...but at what expense?\n\nIf you liked games like The Last Door or Lone Survivor, or are into the styles of horror found in Fran Bow or the Silent Hill franchise and are looking for a bite sized horror experience you can burn through in a single sitting like a movie, Distraint: Deluxe Edition might be game for you. The game has a chillingly surreal and hazy dream-like atmosphere which does a great job at priming the player for some choice scares which, despite not being particularly original most of the time, always stick the landing. The way it handles its relatively standard themes is, if not particularly impressive 100% of the time, mesmerising in its own right, and the simple effective repetition of its elements result in a story that's both pointed and clear, not to mention concise.\n\nDistraint is a squarely two hour experience, and has a few puzzles which seem oddly obtuse, but the short timeframe makes it relatively replayable in a way similar to a movie being rewatchable, and for only five dollars its not too bad of a grab. The imagery and creepy atmosphere is helped by surprisingly well done sound design and presentation which ultimatetly sells the experience. For a foax-retro horror puzzler with no spoken dialogue or survival mechanics at all, the game manages to feel at once masterfully bone-chilling and cripplingly bleak, even with the simple set up and material.\n\nIf you're looking for a masterpiece, you won't find it here, but at the worst of times Distraint: Deluxe Edition still proves to be a creepy spine-tingling descent with Lynch-ian nightmare imagery you'd be hard pressed to find in a game without this one's laser focused structure. Grab it while it's on sale if you're particularly greedy, but you might find yourself feeling guilty about that particular vice.", "timestamp_created": 1542814755, "timestamp_updated": 1543026532,

I really don't want to say too much more because it's the sort of game that could be easily spoilered.\n\nThat's not to say it's flawless, it certainly has a few moments when it feels like it's slightly uncertain of what it wants to be. If you lose your sense of what you're doing and where you're going you suddenly become aware of how slowly the character moves and there is a relatively brief running puzzle that I didn't really enjoy and it felt like it didn't really fit the tone the rest of the game was hitting. It is also primarily about telling a story so it's not particularly challenging to work out what to do next so if you're in need of mind bending puzzles this probably isn't for you.\n\nOverall though, it feels polished and well put together in a way you often don't see from single person developers, and I probably should have gotten around to playing it sooner. :)", "timestamp_created": 1542562627, "timestamp_updated": 1542562627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45875851": {"recommendationid": "45875851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204050968", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1542525149}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid game that told an interesting story and made me jump 2-3 times.

If you always knew where you\u2019re supposed to be going and what you\u2019re supposed to be doing, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Unfortunately, there are several \u2018puzzles\u2019 that aren\u2019t obvious, and (if you\u2019re like me, anyway) you might spend a good ten or fifteen minutes just wandering back and forth, trying to find whatever you missed to advance the story. Even if you _do_ know where you're going, several areas require large amounts of backtracking at that same slow slog.\n* About the puzzles \u2013 too many just didn\u2019t make any sense. (Spoilers minimized) I found the dog \u2013 let me tell the owner. Why the heck am I volunteering to find meat? Why do I suddenly need a flower, and how does that make any sense for where to get it? Surely we could have just come back later, when the place was open?\n* Why is there a timed running puzzle in this game?! And why do I have to re-do the entire section if I miss it?!\n* About the story \u2013 the author certainly didn\u2019t feel the need to be subtle. \n\nI ended up looking up a guide after I missed an object on the second job that you had to backtrack to find and ended up wandering the entire area at our hero\u2019s slow, slow walk speed for what felt like forever. I kept the guide open (and was glad I did so) because of the number of puzzles that are just not obvious (at all) \u2013 especially in the retirement home; although the third job and your office weren\u2019t exactly straightforward either.  \n\nThe game was decent enough that, having started it, I went through to finish it (helped that the game only took about 1.5 hours), but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend it to others.", "timestamp_created": 1542173163, "timestamp_updated": 1542173163, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502644181251525879", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45805240": {"recommendationid": "45805240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866774249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1542170477}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Game!", "timestamp_created": 1542171185, "timestamp_updated": 1542171185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45804879": {"recommendationid": "45804879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866626940", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 209, "last_played": 1542166717}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!", "timestamp_created": 1542168755, "timestamp_updated": 1542168755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45802585": {"recommendationid": "45802585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076620823", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1542149100}, "language": "english", "review": "What you have to realize is that this is a wildly stylistic game and it is really easy to start nitpicking about the dumbest things. If you see people going: \"0mG tHe GaMePlAy SuXx\" it makes all of us roll with our eyes.. right? Distraint is obviously very story driven. Gameplaywise - what you expect is what you get really. There are some minor puzzle elements that can be decently challenging, but overall it is a very story focused game that tries to send a message. There is not much more than walking. \n\nNow what you can rightfully complain about however is how that story is delivered.\n\nI adore atmospheric experiences in gaming. Now the real masterclass of that is telling a story ONLY through visuals. A lot of artistic choices that seem irrelevant at first sight could play a significant role for the players experience. We learn by exploring, advancing in the game and without anyone saying a word it clicks for you. What the game is trying to tell you becomes a riddle and bit by bit you manage to grasp the full picture. \n\nNow Distraint.. doesn't have to much of that. It's a hybrid for that matter, given how it still has quite a bit of dialogue but it also becomes blatantly obvious that it's trying to go in that exact atmospheric direction. Dont get me wrong, it has atmosphere! And it manages to sustain that atmosphere well! Hell, I'd even go as far as to say it's a psychological experience. I'll explain what I disliked about it further below.  \n\nPersonally I'm not a fan of horror games, and I especially dislike jumpscares. This is tagged as horror, and I realize that I'm not the exact target audience with that, but I wanted to give it a fair try anyways. So take this with a grain of salt. Now tell me, is there really a need to scare me at any given chance if it doesn't pack any real relevance to the story? If anything, the absurd amount of jumpscares really put me off and I quickly became annoyed by them. This didn't take to much away from the distressing feeling, maybe it even added to the stress and general experience you feel while playing - but it definitely annoyed me and ruined my immersion at times. If jumpscares aren't for you this should be a big point to keep in mind when you consider buying, but there is definitely a reasonable amount of thought behind why it tries to scare you so much and really accomplishes that as well, I felt very uncomfortable throughout most of the playthrough but can't say I enjoyed the experience overall, and that is what matters most to me personally.\n\n\nIt pains me to give this a thumbs down because seeing how much effort was put into it and how many ideas took part in all the distressing and generally creative bits of the game it truly shows that someone gave this game a lot of thought. But it is simply not for me. Now the story is actually quite decent, and I really favor the not so happy ending it has as it fits the message of the game very well. Don't let it discourage you in any way though, for the price it is worth at least a try. \n\nFor fans of LIMBO, Inside.", "timestamp_created": 1542150992, "timestamp_updated": 1542151122, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487684726715087891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45799338": {"recommendationid": "45799338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356668802", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 149, "last_played": 1542177104}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego \u2764", "timestamp_created": 1542134610, "timestamp_updated": 1542134610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45798770": {"recommendationid": "45798770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115344546", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1542131600}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, muy buena historia, muy buen trama... pegu\u00e9 un salto de susto unas cuantas veces, pero la historia es exquisita.

[spoiler] Why does Price care about the old lady who can't pay her bills, even to the point of offering to house her in his own shitty home? Why does Price feel guilty about giving eviction notices at all? If he were a policeman, would he feel bad for arresting criminals because it would ruin their lives? His morals don't make any sense. How is doing your job greedy? The player is meant to feel empathy for the old lady, but only because she's an old lady... and her husband recently died I guess? He's not using unethical methods to forcefully evict people, so why the guilt? The 3 big bosses make it sound like he's an enforcer, but all he does is deliver the message and perform some odd jobs so the people aren't too sad about losing their home. The second guy didn't even seem to care he was getting evicted. The third REALLY didn't care it seems. So why is Price all broken up over it? \t[/spoiler] I understand what the game was trying to do, but it did not execute it well. \n\nThe puzzles were not challenging and made little sense logically. You end up wandering around interacting with everything until you find the next step, then you do it again with everything you just interacted with. [spoiler] You distracted the secretary and got the phone to ring? okay. now go to the 3 safes again and now the next one will open with no indication until you get there. Picked up some salt? what do you do with it? dump it in the coffee of course! makes perfect sense. not. grabbed a crowbar from the lady in the cemetary? of course the next step is to use it to prove to the groundskeeper that there's an intruder! instead of beating him over the head. They weren't all like this, but constantly interacting with everything again and again is not my idea of a puzzle. The matches/paper/log made sense at least, and had cues to find and use them. Why didn't a lot of other items? Inconsistent. [/spoiler] \n\nThe long walks with nothing to interact in-between was jarring and broke up the pacing of the game. Normally, when it's used, it's for a critical moment or revelation, but in this game it is constant. Expect to walk through hallways for a large part of the game with nothing to interact with. \n\nPacing of the game is slow. Instead of building up suspense or atmosphere, I found myself getting bored. Constant fade ins and fade outs. Long hallways with nothing.

Estoy hablando de la direcci\u00f3n del mismo, parece que el creador no ten\u00eda muy claro exactamente hacia que lado quer\u00eda tirar. \u00bfInvertimos tiempo en desarrollar personajes como los inquilinos de las casas, la justicia de las leyes.. o hacemos que el viaje del protagonista sea un juego de terror sin nada mas que contar? Mmm, supongo que podemos hacer ambas. Pero como suele decirse, quien mucho abarca, poco aprieta. \n\nPara empezar, este juego tiene un gran problema de jugabilidad y dise\u00f1o de niveles. Al principio no es algo de lo que te das cuenta, porque la historia avanza relativamente r\u00e1pido, pero en cuanto llegas al \u00faltimo inquilino te das cuenta de este problema [spoiler] \u00bfUsar setas alucin\u00f3genas para encontrar un trocito de un cuadro, que te abre una puerta, para poder llamar a tus jefes y contratar a una banda de BLUES...?? Wat.  Quiero decir, se supone que el juego habla del drama del desahucio.. no de dar vueltas hasta que te sale una especie de monstruo a indicarte hacia que lado no tienes que ir. [/spoiler]\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay elementos del mismo que me sobran totalmente. Quiero decir, no entiendo porque en un juego tan corto donde, literalmente no puedes morir, hay cientos de puntos de guardado. Mas all\u00e1 de eso, tampoco entiendo porque hay un inventario cuando la mayoria de objetos que tienes los vas a usar casi inmediatamente. Entre otras muchas cosas m\u00e1s.[spoiler] Los famosos cuartos de ba\u00f1o que siempre est\u00e1n, pero el protagonista nunca usa XD [/spoiler]\n\nMe hubiese gustado disfrutar un poco m\u00e1s las zonas donde puedes interactuar con los inquilinos, para poder conocer mejor su historia y como han llegado a esa situaci\u00f3n [spoiler] Cuando vas a visitar a la ancianita lo disfrute much\u00f3, aunque de nuevo, sent\u00ed que realmente me estuvieron haciendo dar vueltas como un tonto durante 20 minutos. Y la conversaci\u00f3n con la anciana es inferior a 3 minutos, \u00bfrealmente compensa? [/spoiler]\n\nY bueno, dejando eso atr\u00e1s, art\u00edsticamente el juego es muy bueno.  Los escenarios estan muy bien dibujados (a mano) y tienen bastante detalle. Con respecto a la duraci\u00f3n, yo lo he terminado en 1:40 horas y si hablamos de su precio, yo creo que es bastante asequible.\n\nPD: Gracias al autor por moverse e incentivar que traduzcan su juego al m\u00e1ximo de idiomas posible, es siempre de agradecer que los autores de los juegos colaboren con los fans para que estos puedan traducir su juego con la mayor facilidad posible.", "timestamp_created": 1541890322, "timestamp_updated": 1541890767, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511949479579925537", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45750147": {"recommendationid": "45750147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025848743", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1541882723}, "language": "english", "review": "Distraint was given away for free on Steam earlier this week to promote the successor Distraint 2.

Anyone who's finished, or even attempted to beat a vintage point and click adventure will find its puzzles to be painfully obvious, dull, and require a frustrating amount of backtracking. But, mechanical innovation isn't really what this game's about. Distraint is an interactive story...with very little interaction.\n\nBut,maybe that can be forgiven. How is the story? Well, that's a mighty subjective question. Distraint's narrative is a blood drenched cautionary tale of [spoiler] how working in debt collection leads to a self-destructive spiral of madness and guilt that invariably ends in suicide. [/spoiler] In my opinion, it handles its subject matter with about the nuance and subtlety with which Reefer Madness (Louis Gasnier, 1936) portrays stoners. There were multiple times I had to pause this \"Psychological Horror\" just finish laughing at its latest insane reveal. [spoiler] This includes a recurring jumpscare of a LITERAL elephant in the room, that comes barreling through walls like the Kool-Aid Man. But, don't worry. If you missed the symbolism, a character will eventually straight-up tell you the Elephant is actually your guilt. [/spoiler] So, no. Neither the story no the symbolism did anything for me. I also found the writing to be little more than an embarrassing litany of cliches. \n\nHowever, there is one area in which Distraint undeniably exceeds: style. And, WOW does it ever succeed. Credit where credit is due: this game looks amazing. The pixelated film grain, joyless color scheme and downright incredible lighting make keep the game visually engrossing. The audio isn't lacking either. Every bit of music is pitch perfect for the emotional tone each scene *tries* to evoke. Stylistically, there is nothing else like Distraint. Its artistic style succeeds where virtually all of its contemporaries fail: creating an ambiance of genuine dread. \n\nSo, if you want a few hours of depressing as hell eye-candy, this is WELL worth your time. However if you're looking for a game that delivers real psychological horror, I'd advise you keep looking.

For me, this was a very appealing experience for a kind of a side-scroller game I'm not too fond of. \n\nA more simple approach in graphics and the story, including the few puzzles included in the game mechanic itself and as an outside elemen, the athmosphere in the world you were put in kept you in a relative suspense throughout and the feelings progressed quickly from horror to sadness to guilt towards the end and the ending itself was well executed. \n\nThere were good horror elements and I was extremely happy to see there were no jumpscares to speak of. A word of warning, though; some of the \"surprises\" or \"jumpscares\" were somewhat disturbing in nature, but they were kept suble enough not to steer you away from the game.\n\nAs with any game, there were some problems. One of them was the use of up and down keys that you could define but were non-existent in the game (or at least I didn't find any use for them). Also finding certain things were a bit difficult although I blame myself more as I practically walked near it multiple times without realising what it was. There were also a few issues with the dialog progression, such as the main character finding a certain thing and going to the secondary character only to say he will talk to him once this certain thing was found. These small issues really don't matter as they're not game breaking glitches but you may find them somewhat frustrating.\n\nOne drawback is that the game itself has very little revisiting value once it is played through, but don't take my word for it as I only speak for myself. \n\nIf you are into games that have horror elements in them, like to solve some puzzles (they're not that hard, if you focus on them) and can withstand the probable crushing feelings that this game produce at the end, I recommend playing it.\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1541712353, "timestamp_updated": 1541712353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45708251": {"recommendationid": "45708251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094218305", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1556098276}, "language": "english", "review": "There is not much to say.

during a promotion ). It was fairly short, but it had well-balanced puzzles and good sound design. The art is good and the pacing of the story is alright. Gameplay is secondary to atmosphere and story, but not in an inferior sense! The story is the most important part of this game, and the gameplay is centered around this. The puzzles are simple and there's always dialogue or quirky text to tide you over in moments of boredom with the mechanics. \nMy only gripe would be the layout. In a particular level you need to run through specific rooms and doors on a timer to solve puzzles, but due to the game being 2D you have no idea which doors connect to which rooms and which hallways. The puzzles remain simple enough that it isn't too overly frustrating to blindly force your way through, but it is not very fun to get stuck on a timer and confusing layout when you KNOW the solution to the puzzle. \n\nThe story itself is a little mediocre in my opinion. More so in execution than in concept. I don't think the story was particularly suited to horror, and thus this game is not very spooky at all. The atmosphere is great, but after long stretches of time without actual depth to the scares and horrors you encounter, you realise that there is nothing that can hurt you in this game and that any actual death is scripted and intended. \n\n(spoilers for the plot below )\n\nThroughout the entire game our protagonist Mr Price is battling his guilt over taking away people's homes and properties. This guilt is what is driving him crazy and making him see things that aren't there - including his long dead parents, a zombified animal that chases him, and an old lady he evicted. ( This old lady haunts him the most, despite him meeting her only once and looking at about 4 of her items ) \nAs the story goes on however, he never seems inclined to stop doing the things that are making him feel guilty. Worse yet, a lot of the guilt that he feels is misplaced; he isn't responsible for the death of an elderly lady, he isn't capable of cancelling huge projects like a highway for a forest-dwelling hermit, and if he didn't evict the man that couldn't pay his rent his bosses would simply fire him and hire someone else to do it! \n\nBy the end of the game, our protagonist takes a position of CEO, a position in which he SHOULD be able to take responsibility and treat people kinder than the others, but instead he lets the guilt for his previous actions consume him. He gets fired, loses his home, gains debt, and ends up getting evicted by someone who is doing the job he once did. \nThe ending of the game shows that this game is part of a never-ending cycle of greed vs guilt, and it is an interesting thing to think about. Sadly, the game that comes before this ending doesn't do a very good job of showing the nuances in this cycle. Mr Price felt guilty over things he had no control over, and remorselessly continued doing the things that he COULD control, making him hard to relate to 'till the very end. \n\n\n(Spoilers End) \n\nOverall I recommend this game. It's price tag is very reasonable for the content and game-length provided, and despite its flaws it is an enjoyable and interesting experience. I frankly wish that it had focused a little more on improving the scope of its horror - or that it had put more attention towards the story and the motivations of our main character.", "timestamp_created": 1541679637, "timestamp_updated": 1541679637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45700342": {"recommendationid": "45700342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075397691", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1541673881}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game :)", "timestamp_created": 1541674076, "timestamp_updated": 1541674076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45700209": {"recommendationid": "45700209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073500320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1541673170}, "language": "english", "review": "I had this game on my mind for quite a long time but I had the chance to get it for free now in the promo of the release of Distraint 2!

A surprisingly good experience. I'm just gonna write my quick thoughts upon finishing it while it's still fresh in my mind. SPOILERS.\n\nThe whole concept of greed was done very well and reinforced throughout. I especially liked a scene towards the end where you keep drinking the water, yet you never satisfy your thurst even when you feel like you can take no more. The shift from being about to quit to staying with the company upon seeing the sign with his name on it is a pretty realistic scenario which was done extremely well as well. On a side note bonus points for his name being Price to really reinforce that materialism. I also found it interesting how the struggle between what's legal and what's ethical is shown. In all honesty you can have solid arguments for either side. \"If you had managed your money better you wouldn't be in this situation so you have no one to blame but yourself\" vs \"There is too much bueraucracy intentionally made to confuse you so it's not fair\", although in all honesty I am with the legal side slightly more. I also liked how the bloody corpse you see in certain moments turns out to be you in the future when you blow your brains out. Nice touch.\n\nThere were a couple of things I didn't like. Firstly, the ending was good which shows the never ending cycle of greed and ambition, but I'm not a fan of the implied suicide of the protagonist. The foreshadowing of the image was great and all, but don't make me write a fucking suicide note and pull the trigger. A minor nitpick is that I expected to be chased by the gravekeeper since his design was probably the most disturbing for me, but that didn't happen sooo... oh well. I also didn't buy the whole relationship with the granny. If anything she had a better life in the nursing home with other elders and a pet rabbit by her side when compared to living alone and rotting away. \n\nFinally for those who want to know I got stuck twice (which is a record for me since I suck at these sort of games). Firstly, I couldn't find the hanger so I was going crazy trying to get this old piece of shit to stop blocking the door.

demacido) es evidente que lo que busca el creador es contar una historia con la menor resistencia posible para el jugador, por otro lado en ciertas ocasiones el sonido esta sobre saturado en exceso, obligando a quitarte los audifonos o a bajarle el volumen, lo cual es una pena, porque en aspectos generales en cuento a lo sonoro el juego cumple con creces, metiendo tencion y poniendo al jugador en alerta con musica estridente, o bajando el tono para meter suspenso, graficamente maneja un pixel art mas que trabajado, con un cuidado a a iluminacion y sombras que para ser 2D, esta por encima de la media, con una paleta de colores deprimente, y para finalizar una historia que sin hacer spoiler, es muy pero muy oscura, que se ayuda de lo visual para alterar al jugador, pero se hecha o el menos en mi caso mucho de menos, la posibilidad de eleccion, no se tal vez un algo que desencadenara en un final bueno o en uno malo, lo que me lleva al mayor pero del juego, esta experiencia no gana nada el ser un videojuego, la interactividad no va de la mano con la histaria, si me vendes esto como un comic, o un libro, la experiencia seria practicamente la misma, por lo demas, personajes aveces con cambios demacido bruscos de personalidad, en un momento son hyper hostiles o temerosos, solo para que un dialogo despues sean nuestros mejores amigos, en conclusion una experiencia recomendable, pero

There should be more games like this, where story matters just as much as the horror. You don't need a jump scare to frighten someone, only a single thought that will make them feel uncomfortable because it lingers. The atmosphere surrounding one's struggle for remorse is quite enticing to the story.

Distraint tries to portray this from the point of view of an intern at some sort of property firm who has to force people to force people to leave their homes due for a verity of reasons and factors.  Well...just keep reading and find out.  \n\nDistraint: Deluxe Edition follows a young man called Price as he is forced to (as part of his job) remove an old fail woman named Mrs Goodwin from her home after she cannot pay the bills.  This sends Price into a deep existential crisis about his ambitions and the consequences of his actions the particular line of work.  Before I get into my criticisms of the plot I would like to stress that the atmosphere is very good and does it produce some good scares.  The plot has a very Silent Hill feeling to it with taking the emotions a person is experiencing and giving it a physical form; twisting it into some truly distressing scenes and concepts.  The smaller quieter moments are well paced and carry legitimate tragedy. \n\nRight, now that we have gotten that out of the way....\n\nI will always try to praise a game for attempting to fulfil or ape a certain game series like Silent Hill (We will never get another one short of a company imploding or the IP being sold off). The trouble with this game is a lack of nuance in the writing and a lack of subtly in the horror.   The three business men that Price has to win over in order to join the firm are so cartoonish and over the top they would not look out of place in a Captain Planet episode.  I understand that the game is trying to make its message clear to the audience but it goes so overboard that it stops being scary and ends up becoming silly.  Mrs Goodwin herself is meant to be the sweet innocent that was destroyed by a cruel and uncaring system: I know this because the game was so terrified that I missed her purpose as a construct that it keeps reminding me of it in long overdrawn set pieces that get tedious.  But to my mind the worst offender of this lack of subtly comes when a pair of hallucinations just flat out explain what they are meant represent; I rolled my eyes because not only of the bad writing but just how little faith the developer had in his audience to think for themselves.  The story itself when you look at it is not particularly scary.  There is potential due to the relevant themes but the execution is off.  I walk through the woods looking for a missing dog and I am assaulted by sound shrieks and spooky visuals popping in and out like the weak source jump scares they technically are.  It does not feel like a horror story but more a tragic drama that has horror haphazardly slapped on it.  I cannot help but wonder if the game had improved if it had lost the horror angle (or reduced it) and made it a depressing tale of a man trying to hold onto his Humanity in the face of promised wealth.  When the game is quiet and sombre it works better as a story, the ending itself (not going to spoil) is a great example of this. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly simple 2d puzzle solving.  You move either left or right examining everything for items which would help you process.  Think of it as classic point and click with the E key and space bar replaying the clicking and the puzzles being less convoluted.  As long as you use your head you should be fine as the items you find will work with what you expect the item to work.  A pair of matches, a pile of twigs and a fireplace (pretty easy to put together considering you need to light the fireplace), the rest of the game is spend walking from one place to another sometimes seeing something spooky and scary.  To be honest, this is fine. It works well.  It is basic but well done puzzle solving that rides real world logic. It is perfectly good.\n\nThe game runs very well, no flaws what so ever. \n\nDistraint should be a great game, there is good promise for something really interesting but it is bogged down by rather rubbish writing.

I have no idea what was going on or why it was going on. I wasn't sure if the main character was going insane, was possessed or if he was being haunted \n\n[*] Tedious problem-solving that typically required backtracking or going around in circles when you didn't know where to find what you were looking for. [spoiler] Ex. The 2nd 'mission' (or whatever you would like to call it) requires a piece of paper to light a fire, when the firelogs are damp. That piece of paper can only be gathered after a certain point, even if you looked in the trash can beforehand. I spent probably 5-10 mins looking for something and I didn't know what.

An example would be his fears manifesting into a scary animal and other hallucinations which leave you with a nasty case of the goosebumps.\n  The only downsides I can think of is that the gameplay itself can potentioally be a bit repetetive, and the game is quite short.
