I think the developers could have experimented a bit more with the abilities and given more of a challenge, but I enjoyed it overall.\n\nSome of the bosses are challenging and fun, but others, especially late-game bosses, are surprisingly easy. I was able to beat the second-to-last boss on the first try -- without even getting hit once. That's okay, I'm more of a casual player, but I do like it when the challenge ramps up so that I get a sense of accomplishment after completing a particularly difficult section.\n\nThe dialogue is absolutely awful, as if a group of average Redditors got together and wrote a fanfic about their favorite anime. Absolute cringe. I wish I could turn it off.

The metroidvania elements are pretty new and don't feel overwhelming in number, and unless you want the 100%, the back-track feels minimal. The platforming is what gets the crown. The curve of learning there is is amazing, you can go from passing screens like a Mario game to clean them super fast like Ghostrunner or Celeste (endgame). Combat and bosses themselves are easy to understand and you don't have to repeat them too many times.\n\nOverall, not only it's a good gaming experience, it's fun to play and its probably the first game that I want to read almost everything the characters say.

Esto adem\u00e1s se ve reflejado en un apartado gr\u00e1fico retro que pasa de los 8 a los 16 bits sin ning\u00fan problema y que nos har\u00e1 disfrutar si cabe a\u00fan m\u00e1s de la gran variedad de \u201csituaciones jugables\u201d que propone y del aliciente de encontrar todos y cada uno de los secretos esparcidos a lo largo y ancho de su mundo, todo sin dejar atr\u00e1s una buena dosis de humor absurdo que sin duda nos sacar\u00e1 alguna que otra sonrisa. No obstante, nada en \u201cThe Messenger\u201d es un camino de rosas ya que tanto las plataformas como los combates contra jefes son todo un reto que, salvo por alg\u00fan que otro peque\u00f1o desajuste, motivan a\u00fan m\u00e1s a continuar, sabiendo que su jugabilidad siempre resulta ser bastante justa. Una opci\u00f3n muy recomendable y que destaca por su originalidad entre la marabunta de t\u00edtulos retro en dos dimensiones.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- un juego de plataformas de 8 bits que a medio camino se transforma en\u2026\n- \u2026 un metroidvania de 16 bits;\n- jugabilidad retante y repleta de secretos y situaciones diferentes;\n- su sentido del humor absurdo;\n- su fidelidad al pixel art de 8 y 16 bits.\n\n[b]Contras:[/b]\n- es necesario avisar que algunos picos de dificultad pueden resultar frustrantes, aunque siempre justos;\n- algunos jefes intermedios son m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles que el jefe final;\n- alg\u00fan que otro checkpoint mal situado/ ajustado;\n- los extras recibidos por conseguir el 100% son bastante discretos.\n\n[h1]ENG[/h1]\nIf finding a classic and difficult (but not unfair) platforming game is already good news, \u201cThe Messenger\u201d reinvents itself halfway through the adventure to never stagnate and become a full-fledged \u201cmetroidvania\u201d that achieves our engagement like few others do and that we will refuse to abandon before completing its 100%. This is also reflected in a retro graphic design that goes from 8 to 16 bits with no seams and that will make us enjoy even more the huge variety of playable situations that it proposes and the incentive of finding each and every one of the secrets spread throughout its world, all without leaving behind a good dose of absurd humor that, from time to time, will undoubtedly put a smile on our face. However, nothing in \u201cThe Messenger\u201d is a bed of roses since both platforming and boss fights are quite a challenge that, except for some occasional mismatch, manages to motivate us to continue, knowing that its gameplay is always quite fair.

Since its initially trying to be a platformer, going back through those levels in the metroidvania context really falls short. I think they could have done a lot to alleviate the issue and made the game perfect. One coulda been to add some more movement related upgrades in the 2nd have to make going through the same rooms less tedious (something like shinespark).

It is actually at it's weakest when it tries to be serious or when the writters try to pretend they're smart, and the last stretch of the game and the rather abrupt ending can attest.\n\nStill need to go through the DLC. Hope the action retains the same quality.\n\nEDIT: Gameplay wise, the DLC is great, with plenty of challenges and a random ass final boss fight that's preceded with a really good challenge to your platforming skills (and a couple tricks the game apparently expected you to find on your own).

The game starts out simple. You platform across a series of extremely well designed levels using some of the best controls I've ever seen, with very high difficulty that never becomes unfair. But after 3 hours or so into the game, it turns into a metroidvania with world changing mechanics similar to Guacamelee that have you switch from the 8-bit to 16-bit era. But it still keeps the same tight level design from before and turns it into an open world game, without it feeling out of place! The game also has an extremely goofy, self aware tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that makes a ton of jokes about video game clich\u00e9s, but that doesn't stop the game from having a semi-serious story that's just as awesome as the gameplay. Did I mention that the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, in both the 8-bit and 16-bit eras? Honestly, my only criticisms are that it often tends to continue on when it looks like it's about to end and that its fast travel points are really far apart, causing you to have to backtrack a lot.

I'm going to continue.\n\n After a few hours, the game turns from a linear game into a metroidvania. I think the first part of the game is better but the unique thing about the metroidvania is that you switch between the past (NES/ 8 bit graphics) and the future (SNES/16 bit graphics). Your abilities are the same in both eras but the style of the music and parts of the level change. It's a very cool twist. \n\nAlso I just have to say -- the soundtrack to this game is filled with bangers. There are so many catchy and upbeat tunes. \n\nThe free Picnic Panic DLC was a nice cherry on top as well.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1697418485, "timestamp_updated": 1697418485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148311108": {"recommendationid": "148311108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369354973", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1697413316}, "language": "english", "review": "good game. very amusing dialogue", "timestamp_created": 1697415807, "timestamp_updated": 1697415807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148308250": {"recommendationid": "148308250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014311522", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 749, "last_played": 1697398875}, "language": "english", "review": "Very heavy on the platforming.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he started to help me. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

This is part 1 of the review, where I gave ti a recommended status before editing the review. part two will start after the dotted line:\n\nThe messenger is an interesting one. I jumped into it expecting it to start off as a Metriodvania off the bat...but it didn't. I also expected it to start out as tough as nails like a Ninja Gaiden game....but it didn't. So i am kind of in a weird situation as to how I should recommend this one....but i do recommend it.\n\nBasically if you like either Metroidvanias or just linear stages...I guess it is safe to say you are covered here. But I will take it a step further: Do you want a game that is just pure joy to play? If so..then The Messenger really delivers. There will be frustrating parts...but it is still just fun. It doesn't get deeper than that...like Contra....what makes Contra fun? It just is.\n\nI saw a few other reviews talking bad about the writing...but it isn't bad. There are some fun discussions in the game. However if you are playing games like these for stories....this might not be your genre then. Really look at the story and writing for Symphony of the Night. Would that be labeled amazing? And I actually enjoy the attitude of the Shopkeeper in this one.\n\nFor $20...you will probably get your money's worth. I got it for about $10 and already have gotten good play out of it for that price. I am not disappointed...and I hope you won't be if you decide to get it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is part two of the review, where I give it a thumbs down:\n\nThis game gets a thumbs down for one level the destroys any fun in the game. The difficulty curve is so steep that it goes from challenging to downright ridiculous. \n\nGlacial Peak\n\nI died 10 times more there than I did the whole game before that point. I don't mind a challenge, but:\n\n1. I can't stand ice levels\n2. This curve is way too steep. The game goes way too twitchy.\n\nI don't like giving a thumbs down over one level...but this game earned it. I did some of the following level, and it wasn't getting any better.\n\nSo my advice, unless you have an old monitor that you don't mind punching a hole through to get a new one, skip this game.", "timestamp_created": 1696301117, "timestamp_updated": 1696549543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147535578": {"recommendationid": "147535578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992283098", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2407, "last_played": 1696293950}, "language": "english", "review": "This is good", "timestamp_created": 1696294082, "timestamp_updated": 1696294082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147529114": {"recommendationid": "147529114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966282962", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1693844317}, "language": "english", "review": "Ninja Gaiden VI", "timestamp_created": 1696283660, "timestamp_updated": 1696283660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147522120": {"recommendationid": "147522120", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961738975", "num_games_owned": 931, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1696274339}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good platformer with great soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1696274390, "timestamp_updated": 1696274390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147479650": {"recommendationid": "147479650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054707019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1278, "last_played": 1696215549}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The aesthetics, music and gameplay really cash in on the nostalgia of people who were just awed by this 30 years ago. The controls are super tight and the difficulty hard but not unfair. \n\nThe first few hours - when the game is still completely linear - were a lot of fun for me. You expand your move set, start understanding mechanics better and improve at the game. Quite quickly you go zooming through the levels, which feels nice. The writing is fun. The first few bosses are hard enough that winning first try is probably not the default but easy enough that after a few tries you can get them. Once you beat the demon general the game becomes too trivial, a metroidvania and completely falls off a cliff. \n\nYou get the ability to revisit and explore all areas. That feels incredibly unrewarding though, the quests are super obscure, traversal takes forever and is nothing but a chore. I assume most people either use a walkthrough here or stop playing. For the rest of the game, all remaining bosses are gimmicky and trivial - including the final boss. My guess would be that the devs started crafting the first few levels and simply ran out of time. They included the metroidvania part to artificially increase the playtime. \n\nAfter 12 hours I have seen every area and beaten every boss of the base game and I wasn't even rushing it. I have tried the DLC for 15 minutes but it starts with a long gimmicky QTE sequence, so I stopped it again.\n\nIn the end, I'd recommend this game for people who a) enjoy tight platformers and b) appreciate the 8 bit nostalgia.

This is very annoying, and makes me wonder if other buttons could've been used for these. The controls aren't *bad*, they just feel under-tested.\n\nThe story is annoying. It manages to mostly make sense, but it's not... interesting. The characters are all jokes, and the dialog is only semi-skippable.\n\nThe attempt at pseudo-metroidvania doesn't work. It makes the game \"non-linear\" but in an uninteresting way. It's more \"use keys to open doors\" with the keys scattered around forcing replay of earlier areas in a specific and non-obvious order.\n\nThe difficulty is, I think, the game's biggest problem. The hardest parts are satisfyingly challenging, and the easiest parts are lovely tutorials, but they're not properly sorted. This uneven difficulty can lead to players less used to the genre giving up, or players more comfortable with the genre wondering why the game went back to being too easy and boring.\n\nOverall, these flaws don't prevent the game from being an easy recommend.

No one should feel compelled to finish it.\n\n\u201cThe Messenger\u201d oozes homage and charm in equal measure from the first moment of play. Its sleeve proudly bears many corsages (and other declarations of love) for Ninja Gaiden, Metroid, even a bit of Mega Man. It fires on so many cylinders: the aesthetic is amazing; the level design impeccable; the bosses are exhilarating and gorgeous; the soundtrack is wonderful. Even the writing is great, with its on-point mix of self-deprecating sarcasm and fourth wall breaks that keeps things moving both smoothly and humorously. In as far as I can tell, \u201cThe Messenger\u201d deserves every bit of praise it receives in these regards. Indeed, the first half of the game is an object lesson in how to harness the power of nostalgia as a means of creating something new-ish, if not necessarily truly novel.\n\nSadly, I didn't see much of the second half of the game. I stopped in the Underworld; I couldn't manage the climb where you have to outrun the lava. This section, as well as the chase sequences in the previous zone, laid bare a problem I had noticed at the beginning of the game. I'm not talking about a distinct lack of aptitude for platformers. It's true that I'm not good at them, but I'm not the same kind of terrible at platformers as I am at bullet hells. No, this was unrelated to my ineptitude. \u201cThe Messenger\u201d is inconsistent with it's controls in a way I haven't seen in a long, long time. Maybe ever, as far as my experience with the platformer genre is concerned. It was so pronounced that I found myself wondering if I was playing the same game as other people.\n\nThe issue isn't that sometimes the game will drop or delay an input. That happens with every game and is part and parcel with the hobby. In fact, I would rate \u201cThe Messenger\u201d as one of the most responsive games I've played in recent memory. Without fail, when I pushed a button, something would happen. The problem was that it wasn't always the thing I expected to happen. Need to make a big jump? It would happen. Usually. Sometimes, though, it would be a baby jump. Need to jump then glide? That, too, would happen... albeit far less reliably. Need to throw that not-grappling hook to grab the wall? Maybe it'll grab at ~six body lengths. Maybe you need to be within three lengths. Who's to say? The rope dart always fired, but whether or not it would work was difficult to determine since previous success or failure with it wasn't a reliable indicator for the situation at hand. Just took some damage during a glide or jump; must have been too close to that spinning gear/blade trap, even though my model never quite made contact with it. When riding a platform near an environmental hazard or trap, though? Character model passes clean through said hazard, sometimes up to the waist, like the thing wasn't even there.\n\nI suspect that many players, perhaps most, could soldier on through and complete the game in spite of the aggravation brought about by the above mentioned inconsistencies. While I could not bring myself to do so, it would be borderline criminal to forget how utterly enjoyable the game is until you reach your limit with the 'will they/won't they' controls. When all is said and done, it's the sense of magic and pleasure instilled by the first part of the game that makes it an easy recommendation. Go into it knowing that you could reach a point where you want to cloud-step on your controller. Armed with this knowledge, you will be better prepared for your own time with \u201cThe Messenger\u201d to include a more favorable ratio of delight to despair.\n\nedit: as a demonstration of my own ability to be consistent, reserved for exercising edit powers", "timestamp_created": 1694622720, "timestamp_updated": 1694622720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502631068229675293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146225739": {"recommendationid": "146225739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133544988", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1015, "last_played": 1696075100}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694615228, "timestamp_updated": 1694615228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146225694": {"recommendationid": "146225694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263314271", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 846, "last_played": 1699038175}, "language": "spanish", "review": " Un juego simplemente magistral.\n\n Una premisa simple, pero con much\u00edsimas capas.

It's almost like this game doesn't even know what the hell it wants to even be... It's as if 20 developers all worked on it except they all had a melange of ideas and decided they'd all service themselves and The Messenger is the end result.\n\nThis game tries to be some kind of Ninja Gaiden homage but it couldn't be further away from it... I mean Ninja Gaiden actually had class... this game is like it's autistic 2nd cousin. The plot is moronic, the enemies are dumb and the quality of life / game play mechanics are terrible.\n\nIt starts off linear, you run through about 11 stages of autistic platforming and near miss one shot deaths around every corner. Along the way you run in to what seem like cryptic secrets you just know are waiting for discovery. After a few hours the game flips on it's head and becomes some kind of Metroidvania style nonsense with really bad quality of life mechanics.\n\nThere are teleporters that take you to the previous area's you've been through but there are no quick travel points. The entire game you've been entering a shop that links to the same place but you can't just choose to travel to any one of your liking for convenience sake. \n\nIt's seriously heartbreaking when you have to re-enter an area and re-traverse the same locale for the 10th time just to get to another area because you haven't unlocked a portal there yet. Even if you manage to find the portal for a specific area, you still have to traverse the entire location to reach something you missed and it could be a very long way away.\n\nThis game is a slog in every sense of the word, I'm not enjoying it at all. It has potential, it was just wasted on poor choices from the developers. \n\nI'd rather play Ninja Gaiden and get my ass handed to me for making a minor mistake than have to slog through 15 screens of garbage platforming mechanics; just to reach some destination I've already been to but didn't have the ability to do the thing... terrible execution.\n\nThe only reason I even bothered with this is because I bought Sea of Stars and this game was a tack on bonus for $2... normally it's $7 on sale, I think it retails at like $14.99 or something but yeah, I wouldn't pay $5 for this. Definite skip...\n\nThere's only ONE take away in this game and it's talking to the merchant guy and pissing him off so he philosophies with you about actual emotional issues. It ends up being good advice and cheap therapy, other than that, the game is really dumb and boring.\n\nAlso there's some kind of brutal extended game after you beat the main story that forces you through a linear level based version of the game with collectables. If you so much as miss a single one, you have to traverse the entire thing right from the very first stage again in order to find all the junk you missed... and the developers deliberately put in 1 time only collectables and points of no returns to artificially extend this trash for more gruelling repetitive garbage you'd played through already... this game is just a headache.", "timestamp_created": 1694413529, "timestamp_updated": 1695399489, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481994450092315674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146099436": {"recommendationid": "146099436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000741039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1694478398}, "language": "english", "review": "A well-crafted and clever game that just keeps unveiling new surprises around every corner, brimming with personality the whole time.

The 8-bit and 16-bit artstyles are absolutely gorgeous, especially the sprites are exceptionally well done. Controls are tight and responsive (as should be expected from a platformer), and the movement mechanics the game gradually introduces all feel well explained and fit together nicely to create great platforming experiences. About halfway in, the game also introduces a switch mechanic that switches the whole artstyle, music and the soundeffects from 8- to 16-bit versions and is one of the coolest mechanics I've seen in a game bar none. Said switch mechanic also impacts gameplay in a big way I do not want to spoil, and it's cool to see little flourishes change between both versions of the game (all of the sprites being more fluidly animated in the 16-bit version, for example).\n Not far after the introduction of this mechanic, the game in a very bold move trades the whole concept of a linear platformer to that of a more open Metroidvania, including backtracking and finding hidden areas. For that, the game sadly trades some of the conciseness and good pacing it had beforehand which is a bit of a bummer, but the platforming and movement mechanics still make for an absolutely fun experience; it's just sad the second half of the game doesn't exactly stand up to the first.\n\nTo be clear, I still had an absolute blast even in the slightly weaker second half of the game. Pair all of this with absolutely outstanding music and well-timed humour and you get this gem. I myself got the game on sale for 5 bucks, but I would gladly pay full price for a game this good.

By watching some gameplay footage, it looked interesting enough to captivate my sights and, indeed, it was. The game is really cool, it has a nice aesthetic to it and the 8/16-bit art is gorgeous. Overall, the enjoyment one gets is not only nostalgia driven, but as a gamer that started its career in the 8-bit systems as a little child, it does hit some pretty nostalgic nerves in a very good way.\n\nSkipping this part and at the same time recognizing its merits, I\u2019d like to focus here on what this game does best: intertwining different aspects of a game. Everything within the game is woven and packed around the need to give a meaning to time travel within the game. So, because this is the case, the gameplay, the story, the storytelling, the world building and the plot are all tied together in this massive idea of the need for time travel. It does get explained quite well by the end of it and the unfolding is equally delightful to experience, from the transition the game has from platforming to metroidvania to its reveals of different aspects. I respect and also feel it like a blessing that we have a game that manages to be meaningful without trying too hard and with heaps of acidic humor/self-conscious jokes here and there. This is, by and large, the game strongest aspect, the platforming being the second one (and I love some good 2d platforms, I\u2019m an avid MMX/Metroid fan)\n\nThe combat, on the other hand, is nothing special and, as 8-bit games tended to be, quite repetitive. The same goes for the metroidvania aspect of it. It adds some hours of gameplay, but the backtracking is harder than it could be since the travel mechanic leaves you too far away to collect what you need to collect. \nThe hint mechanic, which helps you if you\u2019re stuck, is a great addition, since it removes the need to go online and look for anything. If you\u2019re stuck you just pay 300 in game currency and it tells you where to go. This gives you both a sense of accomplishment for knowing what to do on your own and a sense of \u201cI don\u2019t need to look for something in every corner, get bored and keep guessing\u201d if you don\u2019t know where to go. You can either farm the money (which is quite easy) or look for the next place to go, it\u2019s your choice. \n\nConsidering how the good aspects of the game are tied with the story, the post story adventure becomes a big \u201c?\u201d in my head since although it might be another story to experience, it\u2019s devoid of the game greatest asset by definition so it sounds meaningless and useless to me, although I might even finish it just because, but it also sounds like an extra not something to bash the game for.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to play a game driven by an idea and that feels like a love letter to fans. I\u2019m now, way more than before, looking forward to play Sea of Stars.

One of the best things about The Messenger is its graphics; all the environments and characters look gorgeous in both their 8-bit and 16-bit artstyles.  Another great thing is the witty, humor-filled dialogue, which is rampant throughout the first part of the game and unfortunately takes a backseat to the interesting but not as compelling lore in the second half.  The time travel mechanic is nice, if a bit surface-level.  The platforming feels tight for the most part, I enjoyed the cloudstep mechanic.  I did feel as though more upgrades were needed, as I was getting loads to begin with in the first half and then next-to-none in the second.  In general the second half is a lot weaker than the first, which is something to keep in mind.  I guess it's hard to fault the devs for this though, turning a mostly linear side-scroller into a metroidvania halfway through is ambitious and deserves to be lauded.  The Messenger also has some really tight music that blends perfectly between present and future states.  The weakest thing about this game is definitely the enemy variety.  You will see the same blue, red, and green demons a million times throughout the game, and they are not that interesting past the first level.  I really felt as though this was a missed opportunity and more interesting enemies could've been developed for the game's numerous intriguing locales.  Another thing I didn't like was the fast travel system in the second half.  I tried to break all the seals but after discovering I had missed one in an area where I'd have to play through the entire level again just to get to it, I didn't feel as though it was worth my time.  In general, the seals are a miss in my opinion.  I don't know what reward you get from collecting them all but it would've been great to have more of them along the way to actually encourage players to collect them without explicitly appealing to completionists.  One last thing this game messes up are instant-death scenarios.  Health becomes completely trivial later on in the game except for boss fights, and the only things killing you will be getting crushed or falling in a pit.  This, to me, feels like artificial difficulty, and it would've been a lot more tasteful to do crushing and pits in a similar way to Hollow Knight, where instead of instantly dying you take some damage and are teleported back to a safe spot.  Overall I liked The Messenger and I think it's an awesome first game for a clearly talented studio like Sabotage.  Definitely worth a buy especially at its sale price right now ($5).", "timestamp_created": 1693712228, "timestamp_updated": 1693714335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145539909": {"recommendationid": "145539909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120377907", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1695294964}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is more frustrating than it is challenging.\n\nNot worth anything over \u20ac5.", "timestamp_created": 1693677914, "timestamp_updated": 1693808746, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.37155681848526001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145539447": {"recommendationid": "145539447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860618012", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1699947872}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS AMAZING! \nPLAY IT NOW \n", "timestamp_created": 1693677442, "timestamp_updated": 1693677442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145535216": {"recommendationid": "145535216", "author": {"steamid": "76561199161078477", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1700609421}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego bien gooooood\n", "timestamp_created": 1693672971, "timestamp_updated": 1693672971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145535082": {"recommendationid": "145535082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027322928", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 934, "last_played": 1693803018}, "language": "english", "review": "God", "timestamp_created": 1693672816, "timestamp_updated": 1693672816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145530917": {"recommendationid": "145530917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158601846", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1129, "last_played": 1694274330}, "language": "english", "review": "The movement and combat is punishing yet satisfying, and the dialogue is both humorous and insightful.

It is a Metroidvania style experience. It felt like there was a lot less humor and cool moments to be had in this part, but I still had a great time, and by the end there were a number of additional surprises thrown in to make me glad that I kept playing.\n\nWhile I would have liked to have more gameplay similar to the first part of the game, I still had an amazing experience overall. The controls in this game are super tight and feel great, and the soundtrack is on another level! It's one of the few games where I actually plan on buying the soundtrack and listening to it while I slave away at work.\n\nSea of Stars comes out today, and I am really excited to jump into it and discover what innovative gameplay and surprises Sabotage has in store, but I'm glad I experienced The Messenger first.

I'm 5 years late to the party here and only discovered this unknown gem by accident because I liked this developer's demo for their upcoming retro RPG, Sea of Stars, enough to want to try their first game.\n\nWhat you get here is an 8-bit platformer parody game that seems mostly inspired by Ninja Gaiden at first, but gradually adds mechanical and artistic homages to other classics of the genre. \n\nThe controls are tight and there's a bunch of movement mechanics. There's your standard wall climbing, a horizontal grappling hook that lets you reach enemies, ledges, walls and rings at a short range and enables sudden speed boosts, a Wingsuit that lets you glide horizontally and slow down your descent, and an underwater dash which if used near the surface can be used to give you a speed boost into the air horizontally.\n\nThere's also shoes that let the Messenger join the club of H\u00f3fvarpnir, Orion, Jesus, Morgan Freeman, Jim Carrey and co. by walking on the surface of still water (or lava or peanut butter). The limitation is that you can't stop or change direction on the surface without sinking, so you have to always terminate the walk with a jump or grapple if you need to dodge suddenly.\n\nThe Cloudstep, this game's take on the double jump, lets you gain extra height and chain the horizontal movement mechanics together being airborne for extended periods. Here you're not limited to a fixed number of mid-air jumps. Instead, you're awarded an extra one every time you hit a lantern, an enemy or even an enemy's projectile with your horizontal or vertical sword slash, or with the strongest version of the shuriken. Combined with speed boosted gliding it makes skilled speedruns of this game into truly awe inspiring shows. \n\nThis is now among my favorite movement systems across all games, only behind the likes of the Quake series. \n\nThe music is as good as it gets on the NES, the dialogue is hilarious, and the level and enemy design is interesting and varied. The early bosses are a bit too simple and easy even for newbies to this genre, but later difficulty modes fix that.\n\nSave points are very common and deaths have very little consequence, so you're free to practice the situation you're having problems solving without having to repeat a big chunk of the level. Dying only prevents you from earning currency for movement/health/damage upgrades for a short time. But the currency is abundant (it only becomes a problem in New Game +) and you'll easily unlock everything in the shop  before you beat the game, even if you're dying often.\n\nAfter you've beaten 8 levels and their 6 bosses, the cutscene seems to be taking long and something big is happening, so you might think the game is done. You got your money's worth. After all, this was about as much content as each of the original Ninja Gaiden games. \n\nBut the credits aren't rolling.\n\nTurns out you're not done. Now the music, sounds and graphics switch to the Sega Genesis Yamaha sound chip and gorgeous 16-bit visuals. You go through 2 big levels, beat their bosses and you're in for another longer cutscene.\n\n\"Ok, now I must be done, right? That last boss was tough to figure out.\"\n\nWrong. You're at less than a quarter of the game. Now it's no longer linear level after level. It opens up into a Metroidvania. You can now revisit the 10 levels to explore parts that weren't accessible without all the abilities you've gained by now, including the one you just earned - The Messenger's other unique contribution to the genre: the ability to shift between the 8-bit and 16-bit versions of every level, and these versions aren't just reskins of the same thing. They fundamentally change parts of the layout, making for interesting 4d puzzles (I guess I should call them 3d puzzles since this game's world is 2d) that require you to shift multiple times between modes to access certain areas. They're not too hard, just an interesting twist that adds to the richness of already having 2 versions of all levels and their music tracks.\n\nAside from this refresh of all the old levels, you can now reach 6 new levels with 4 bosses. One of these levels has sections, including its boss, which are a flying shoot-em-up minigame! And once you've collected all the quest McGuffins everywhere, the last non-DLC level and its boss unlock.\n\nThen once you're done with that, the free DLC and the New Game + mode unlock. The DLC is 3 bosses on 4 levels, and they still keep getting bigger and more difficult. The first level is a surfing racer minigame reminiscent of Earthworm Jim's Andy Asteroids, or the Turbo Tunnel in Battltoads.\n\nThe last level here, the Voodoo Heart, is a series of speedrun races against a ghost image on a variety of obstacle courses. There's 25 sections and each loss gives you an easier obstacle course as your next section, and each win gives you a more difficult one. The first to reach 5 wins, uh... wins. This is my favorite level and I've spent by far the most time practicing it so far. Getting to the point where I can win all of the most difficult courses has really cleaned up my movement for the post-game challenge modes. Oh, and the boss after this level isn't your standard fight. It's a boxing minigame!\n\nThe New Game +1 option is an increase in difficulty. Basically a repeat of the whole game, but this time you take extra +1 damage from everything, bosses have more health, and deaths now incur an upfront cost in currency. You die permanently if you can't pay up. NG+1 lets you keep all your old upgrades, only losing your story/quest items that grant or ease up the access to certain areas. You get to pick just one of them to keep. Beat NG+1, and you get to pick another item and play NG+2 which is even harder.\n\nIn theory, if you live up to NG+14 or above (which means everything one shots you long before this point) and pick a new quest item each time, you start with all of them. This means the 0.01% of the players who can beat the game multiples times without ever taking damage are rewarded by basically skipping chunks of the game for a faster speedrun.\n\nI find it lame that you can theoretically cheese your way up there as well. A less skilled player can spend absurd amounts of time farming currency to pay for their deaths, and still reach high NG+ values, which were supposed to be signs of mastery of the game, not  hundreds of hours of farming. It's a perverse incentive, but that's remedied with the free DLC. Finding all the secrets on the DLC levels unlocks a roguelike mode in New Game +1 (or higher) called THE DEAL. This doubles your health and triples your damage, but you can no longer revive at all, so the currency becomes useless and a single death ends your run.\n\nI won't get into spoilers here, but I really like how the story of the game is meaningful despite this being a parody game. The big plot twist and a few of the reveals gave me shivers. There's hidden Easter egg visuals in the levels that prove many of the mythical stories you'll hear and discuss with the few NPCs are literally true. There's runes scattered in the backgrounds in some places. If you learn how they correspond to the Latin alphabet, you can get extra hints about the world's history. The lore stuff especially got me excited because I found this game by getting interested in the RPG that will be this game's prequel.\n\nOverall, this is the complete package. If you're a newbie to platformers, this game's gradual ramping of difficulty and good teaching methods will accommodate you. If you're a master of the genre and Shinesparking around Metroid games is second nature to you, you'll love the high skill ceiling here.

It's a fun game for about 75% of its runtime, and the first 1/3 of the game is somewhat better executed than the rest. Anyway I'm not gonna praise what it did right because I'm a nitpicky evil murderous bastard fuck so here are a few things I thought could be improved for The Postman 2.\n\nThe whole time travel twist was cool and an interesting mechanic but the metroidvania part of the game didn't feel as interesting, probably because the levels just weren't engaging or interesting enough to make it fun to revisit most of them. What carried this half of the game is the new look each level would get plus the extra few new stages. My number one gripe is DIFFICULTY. the game could have used some way more challenging levels and harder platforming, at the very least more creative level design considering the cool ass moveset you have at disposal. This is done a little in the DLC which is pretty epic but it's explored minimally and the main game could have used some of it as well. The issue with this is that the death system doesn't complement it. A Celeste-like instant respawn system would have been good but it might not fit the metroidvania aspect of the game, and the bosses would have been way harder (although that could have been a good thing considering the bosses can be cheesed way too easily as they are). even Deal mode wasn't that hard but i can't be bothered to play new game+ 20 times until the game turns into dark souls. \nOther than that, the music was consistently good, the characters are funny, the Shopkeeper is the goat, and the overarching story (apart form the last part which I didn't care for) was very enjoyable.\n\nOverall great game, needs more stories 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1692125387, "timestamp_updated": 1692126053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144232733": {"recommendationid": "144232733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390158815", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1692256949}, "language": "english", "review": "The dialogues of this game are freaking hilarious, one hour in game and I've laughed my ass off.

I was motivated to keep going thanks to the amazing soundtrack, fun boss fights, and funny writing. I am SO GLAD I stuck with it because the second half of this game has a twist that elevates it to something truly special. \n\nThe Messenger is a lot of things, but it is a platformer first. I think it does this well thanks to some really fun and satisfying movement. From the very beginning, you are granted a \"cloudstep\" which grants you an extra jump when you slash an enemy, object, or projectile in midair. You can chain these together, keeping you in the air for a long time if you're skilled enough. Later, you can even combine this with glides, grapples, wall jumps, and more. The levels are designed to be challenging, while still allowing players to be creative/expressive in how they approach them.\n\nGAMEPLAY (non-story) SPOILERS AHEAD:\n\nHalfway through the game, The Messenger becomes a Metroidvania, allowing you to go anywhere in the map. It's not perfect at this-- you must pay the shopkeeper to tell you where to go, or rely on some very vague hints instead. I resorted to a guide for this, as the rest of the shop upgrades are pretty expensive. This was pretty much the only thing about the Metroidvania portion I did not like. That aside, this half of the game is AMAZING. It introduces portals that allow you to travel between the future and the past. There are 16-bit graphics and music whenever you're in the \"future\", meaning the devs had to make every single level twice! It's not just a gimmick either-- this mechanic also has story implications, and quasi-puzzles designed around it. There are also much more challenging and fun areas introduced in this half.\n\nWhen all of these pieces are working together, this game feels like a masterpiece. This is not the case throughout the whole game, but very close to it. It has gone on sale for as low as FIVE DOLLARS, but it is super worth it even at full price. \n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1691130223, "timestamp_updated": 1691132657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143314267": {"recommendationid": "143314267", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121025433", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1847, "last_played": 1689865867}, "language": "english", "review": "its peak", "timestamp_created": 1691060257, "timestamp_updated": 1691060257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143308995": {"recommendationid": "143308995", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962596155", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2325, "last_played": 1690891337}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun if slightly tedious metroidvania.

high quality retro soundtrack, and comes with a wild story that starts with your village being invaded by demons, requiring you to deliver a message to a temple. I won't spoil the rest but needless to say it's a fun ride with some surprising twists and visual treats along the way.\n\nThe gameplay is mechanically tight and designed for speed running which ends up being to everyone's benefit. The blend of combat and movement means you hardly a need to slow down at any point; landing attacks refreshes your jump encouraging you to always be moving and you can attack horizontally or vertically while gliding through the air.\n\nFrom wall running and wall jumping, to climbing, gliding, and hook-shoting, there's a variety of movement that remains smooth throughout allowing you to maintain a constant pace as the world becomes a pleasure to get around. As such the platforming ends up being just as tightly designed and it can be very satisfying to blaze your way from A to B as you learn to master each environment.\n\nThe boss fights are a bit slow and tedious, and I know some folks find the shift in gameplay to be jarring but personally I found it all a delight and was happy to go along with the story. Even if it doesn't quite stick the landing narratively, I think there's high points here for a well crafted game, the ambitious events, and trying something different that provides a unique experience.", "timestamp_created": 1690298734, "timestamp_updated": 1690298734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142737265": {"recommendationid": "142737265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887034738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3071, "last_played": 1690250876}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily a S Tier game in my opinion, loved playing it, I got all of the achievements, the base game, and the DLC were both really fun to play, i wish the game was even bigger, but it is already pretty big, it has a lot of content, I honestly hope someday another DLC comes out, the boss fights are amazing, the creative part of the game is also awesome, getting all of the achievements was a hard quest, but I did it, and I have no regrets, i recommend this game a lot, it deserves more recognition, i havent even done 100% of it, and thats one of my next goals, the game is really fun to play, with a really good lore and good plot twists, and im not gonna spoil anything, but the extention of the story is great, I thought the game was quite short at first, because i thought the main game was over, but later i realized it wasnt, and that the game was not over, the game introduces really great mechanics too, so, i got all achievements of the game, i dont really know if that makes my opinion good or bad, but i played for quite a good while for now, here and on my videogame, (before getting a PC, i played a bit of the game on my videogame) so, im safe to say, as someone with great experience and all achievements in this game, The Messenger is a 10/10 game for me!", "timestamp_created": 1690251613, "timestamp_updated": 1690251613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142722847": {"recommendationid": "142722847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272259724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1015, "last_played": 1690067620}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like old-school Ninja Gaiden I am sure you'll like this title.

Fans of action platformers will love it, doubly those who enjoy the retro style.  Do yourself a favor and spoil nothing about this game for yourself before giving it a try.\n\nFew games create and preserve flow as well as this one.  Platforming and combat are blended together seamlessly:  Enemies aren't provided as a simple hindrance to level traversal, instead offering players more options of how to proceed through it.  New mechanics are introduced alongside new challenges, giving players just enough time to get used to their abilities before putting them to the test.  Challenges are tough but fair, leaving players neither bored nor frustrated.  Most areas give players surprisingly high choice on how to proceed through them, rewarding daring players with faster play without punishing players who haven't built up excessive skill.\n\nThe choice on how to attack a challenge extends to boss battles delightfully.  The one time I found myself seriously frustrated with the gameplay was during a boss battle when I was being forced to sit through the same series of attacks before I could even try to do damage.  This was especially frustrating as I had to repeat the battle many times, and had to slog through an easy early section just to get another crack at the hard part later on.  As I was lamenting this issue, I realized that I was making assumptions about the way the battle must be fought.  I changed my strategy to a more challenging and aggressive one, and immediately was back in the flow of the game.  Worse games wouldn't allow lateral thinking of this type, but this one shines.\n\nThe humor and the story are excellent, and the game never takes itself too seriously.  There's a surprising amount of heart that shows a love of the games this one takes inspiration from.  Even better, much of the story is given in short, optional bits that don't interrupt players who are having fun with the action.  They instead allow players a short respite and a peek into the world's lore in between bouts of action, which is a welcome juxtaposition.\n\nAnother benefit to the way the game delivers its story content:  Players can skip past it if they choose to replay the game using the New Game + system.  NG+ lets a player keep the abilities they earned over the course of their playthrough, and does an excellent job of preserving flow.  It allows players a second chance to play through the game and maybe experience things they didn't the first time without having to suffer the extreme frustration of having their muscle memory stripped.  Many NG+ systems allow a player to replay the game extremely over-leveled, trivializing gameplay and removing any fun.  This game's system neither punishes the player nor holds their hand.\n\nAny of the other great things that could be said about this game would spoil it for players, which I have avoided since I'm wholeheartedly recommending it to all.  This is a great 25 hours spent, and I'm eagerly looking forward to any more projects Sabotage Studio feels they want to give.", "timestamp_created": 1690136100, "timestamp_updated": 1690136100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142657993": {"recommendationid": "142657993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012093468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 975, "last_played": 1683061134}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Claro, aqu\u00ed tienes una rese\u00f1a.\n\nObra Maestra Atemporal, cuanto antes lo juegues mejor.\n\nDe nada.", "timestamp_created": 1690135729, "timestamp_updated": 1690135729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142583243": {"recommendationid": "142583243", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007465110", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1690031518}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to like this game.

Theres little to no enemy variety, the combat is fairly lame and the bosses aren't very interesting.\n\nThe changing graphics is a fairly interesting gimmick but thats all it really is, a gimmick. Only thing that changes are some level changes and a 16 bit graphic change, other than that little happens.\n\nThe game seemed as if it was trying to be funny, but frankly none of the jokes ever landed with me.

I cant say much without spoiling, but holy shit. I don't care if you're a fan of platformers or not, this game is one of a kind and deserves to at least be in your library. Play this game. Hell, watch someone else play it, just experience it somehow! (though the best experience will come from actually playing it ngl). The music is killer, the level design is well structured, the mechanics are tight and challenging yet masterfully approachable and very satisfying to get the hang of. The story is innovative and unique, yet classic in all the right ways. It's got great pacing and moves along at just the right speed, with a very clear separation between its multiple acts. The characters aren't the fullest, but i personally think that works in the game's favor (and, even if they aren't the most fleshed out, they're quite charming). I will say though, the game's humor is very meta, so if you really aren't a fan of that, you may not find it quite as endearing and clever as I did, but personally, i think it was done well. But the art direction is the best part. Oh the graphics! I could gush for hours about how wonderful and ingeniously done the sprite work is, but then I'd be spoiling the game. And I know that I probably sound like some retro pansy gushing over good sprite work (even though it is top notch), this game takes it to a whole new level.

The creators use this effect within the plot of the story which gives the game a sense of self-awareness and employs solid tongue in cheek humor. Most of the replay value will come in the form of speed running and the challenge stages. Outside of those two features The Messenger is an easy game to pick up and has a clean finish  [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td] Should you get it?[/td]\n\t[td] When the game first came out this was a great little indie title that harkens back to old school titles like Ninja Gaiden (the NES/SNES ones). If you enjoy a challenge from your platformer this is a good game to get. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td] Overall Verdict [/td]\n\t[td] 8/10. The Messenger\u2019s gameplay is tight, lets get that out the way. But what it does very well is sneakily build a world around it for what seems to be more to come from developer Sabotage Studios (if you\u2019re reading this you possibly know that Sea of Stars is the answer to that). The clean but intentional platforming puzzles between 8 and 16-bit is a cool idea and the seamless transition between adjoining soundtracks keep you in the mindset. Clocking in at ~13 hours to beat (getting all collectibles), I enjoyed my time with the game and excited to see what Sea of Stars brings from Sabotage Studios   [/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b] Setting & Writing: [/b]\nThe premise of The Messenger is one of prophecy that tells a \"Western Hero\" who will save them from the Demon King. Once the hero finds the ninja (you). You are tasked with taking the scroll the hero was carrying up to the mountain. What was funny to me was the Western hero telling you to travel east on your platforming journey. Just go east\u2026in a platformer (idk I found it funny). The game contains a comfortable amount of self-awareness making it pretty funny but not 4th wall breaking. Certain power-ups given to you by NPCs are given to you because \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have it at this point\u201d. However, once you arrive at the top of the mountain you\u2019re story isn\u2019t over. You are then sent in a time loop where you (the ninja) becomes the new western hero designated to deliver the scroll to the new hero (You went so far east that you came from the west for this new guy). Once the scroll is delivered, tradition dictates that you now become the NPC that looks over the new hero. Your first day on the job doesn\u2019t go well when you forget to introduce him with the ability to respawn. This is where the game truly begins. From here you go on an adventure to break this time loop and put the world on the straight and narrow\n\n[b] Gameplay system & Bosses: [/b]\nThe Messenger starts as a basic platformer having you move left for about the whole journey. Each set piece is typically capped off by a boss fight which has you learn the boss\u2019s patterns. After you learn these patterns, you tend to find your opening. But after the first act of the game, the game opens in almost metroidvania like fashion. On top of the platforming tricks you were taught in the opening of the game, you\u2019ll be tasked with using collected upgrades to go through and complete the task of the second act. These upgrades will help you traverse time-based platforming puzzles that require tight timing and precise platforming. \n\n[b] Quest, Mini-games & Challenges: [/b] \nThe Messenger does a good job of feigning its true objective. It starts out simple, go east. After a while though your quest becomes more open ended and requires you to revisit some locations you\u2019ve been to before and (with the help of your NPCs) some places you haven\u2019t. There aren\u2019t really any minigames per se in the game but there are hidden puzzle rooms (so challenges?) that truly tests your platforming skills. Completion of these rooms rewards you with a currency once collected gives you an upgrade for the protagonist.   \n\n[b] Miscellaneous (art, music, etc.): [/b]\nThe developers stayed true to a vision here. The played with time travel swapping back and forth between 8-bit and 16-bit visuals here. This is such a neat way to describe changes in time. This is also reflected in the sound design which is reminiscent of going back and forth between a NES and SNES. \n", "timestamp_created": 1687567415, "timestamp_updated": 1687567415, "voted_up": true,

Platforming is amazing, character movement is also very good, jumping mechanics etc.\n\nHowever, in the second half, game gets very boring with all that terrible backtracking. Backtracking is just very frustrating and it is the main aspect that makes the game boring. Its not like metroid or blasphemous or any other MV, its just donkey poo and kills the action all of a sudden and bam you have no idea where to go what to do. You buy a hint from shopkeeper and then go all the way back and forth on foot, without any teleport to make things easier.

Let me make this loud and clear, The Messenger, is not just one of the best indie games of all time, it's one of the best video games ever made. The Messenger is a action-platformer metriodvania, The best way I can explain it, is think of Ninja Gaiden meets Castlevania. The player takes on the roll of a ninja messenger who needs to take a special scroll to the top of a mountain to fulfill a prophecy to help save the world. Of course, there is much more to it than than, but I would rather not spoil it. Just believe me when I say this story is excellent. The writing is one of the best parts, not only it is charming and endearing, but also hilarious. The writers completely understand what players want from a game from the 21st century, it tells a great story, but also does not take it self too seriously. Characters have heart felt moments one minutes, and are yelling at each other the next. The banter between the messenger and the shopkeeper was top notch. Some of the funniest interactions between two characters I've ever seen in a game, they insult each other, they use massive amounts of sarcasm, all whiling continuing the story. Phenomenal stuff. The game play itself is absolute bliss. As I mentioned early, it really is ninja gaiden meets castlevaina. The messenger can run, jump, attack with his katana and use shurikens, All of it is concise, fluid, and fast passed action. Another game that does not cheat you at all, but I will say you better be quite skilled in this genre because this game does not **** around. The messenger starts hard and doesn't stop until it reaches masochistic levels of difficulty. If you have what it takes to get through it, I PROMISE it's 100% worth it. This game gives me the same feeling any soulslike does, even when a level that should take only 15 minutes to get through turns into a hr when you do get through it, it's gaming euphoria. The enemies, minimal platforms, constant movement does expect near perfection, but it's attention to detail, makes every level so much fun, despite it's high difficulty.\n\n*Spoliers Ahead*\nOne thing I do need to mention is the games massive change. For the 1st half of the game, The Messenger is really a linear 8-bit style Ninja Gaiden clone, and then IT happens. Without going too much into story details, the game *sends* the player into the future.....a 16-bit style NG / Castlevania-esque future, and then it hits you. 8-bit is the past, 16-bit is the future and it starts to combine the two styles in one of the best ways I have ever seen. Of course with the the linear level after level game play, it turns into an interconnected mteriodvanina style map, where the player needs to re-explore every level in any order they wish, with multiple news one also unlock-able. The entire change in design, sound, and game play was one of the coolest twists ever in a video game in my opinion, and going back and forth watching each level change from 8-bit to 16-bit and back was a dream. (The music also changes with it)\n\nThe Messenger, by Sabotage Games, was/ still is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Honestly, if I made a list of top 25 games, you can be sure this makes it. Everything from the game play, story, exploration, unlockables, all of it is just top notch. I can't wait for their next game Sea of Stars releasing in August, Sabotage Games is a new favorite developer of mine.\n\nOh! Did I mention the game has a free DLC that adds another 5-7hrs of game play?

However, I was kind of running out of games to play, so I decided to give various games a try, including this one. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by The Messenger.\n\nThere are two main reasons why I typically don't like \"old school\" games:\n\t\u2022 Your character typically can't do much: The difficulty from old school games typically comes from how limited your character is, not that the challenge itself is all that cool or interesting to overcome. E.g. in the original Megaman, your character could only run, slide, jump, and attack horizontally. Because of your character's limited moveset, enemies/attacks that normally wouldn't be all that challenging suddenly become so. E.g. an enemy who stays in the air a lot is a huge challenge since you can't reach them. I personally don't find this very engaging.\n\t\u2022 The overall pace of the game is very slow paced: Typically, in old school games it's pretty easy to die (e.g. falling into a pit or spikes means instant death. Checkpoints are far away and it's hard to heal so enemies dealing damage matters a lot). Therefore, you typically always have to play very methodically in order to progress. While I am fine with playing methodically for boss battles and certain encounters, I don't want to do so THROUGHOUT the entire playthrough. \n\nThankfully, Messenger doesn't suffer from these problems. I never felt gimped in any scenario, thinking that if my character could just do one thing then the game would be so much easier. The overall pace of the game is also decently fast paced, only requiring you to slow down for puzzle/platforming challenges. \n\nA big reason for this is that the biggest challenge in Messenger is not from the enemies, it's from the platforming. Enemies only take like a quarter of your health and can die in like 1-3 hits. So you can very often just run up straight to an enemy, attack them, and then kill them. So the enemies don't really slow the game down. It also helps a lot that you can move while attacking.\n\nThe platforming however is far more dangerous with multiple instant death scenarios (e.g. falling into a pit means instant death). I normally don't like this since I much prefer combat challenges than platforming challenges (which is why a game like Super Meatboy is a 6/10 for me). The bosses are also basically a series of platforming challenges. You typically dodge a number of attacks until the boss opens themselves to a very clear opening, and then you attack them. It's not really a constant mix of defense and offense, and more so geared towards defense (i.e. dodging through platforming). \n\nWhile the fact that the main challenge from this game comes from the platforming definitely reduces the score of this game (i.e. main reason why it's a 7/10 and not a 8 or 9), I still enjoyed this game. It's fun to simply move in this game and go to places. It's fun to kill enemies quickly. It's fun to use the grappling shot and close long distances quickly. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but just controlling your character in this game and doing shit is an enjoyable experience. I think this goes to show that while I don't like \"precision\" platforming all that much, I do enjoy \"spectacle\" platforming.\n\nIn regards to the progression system, it's pretty poor. You can spend currency to purchase upgrades that aren't exciting at all (e.g. increased health, lose less currency on death, etc\u2026). You can unlock a shuriken upgrade that's pretty cool, BUT it's only unlocked by finding a lot of pieces in platforming challenges. So you only get it near the end of the game, so you don't get to play around with it for most of the game.\n\nWhile the story isn't exactly all that interesting, I did enjoy the dialogue a lot. Specifically, your character interacts a lot with a \"shopkeeper\" that appears at most checkpoints. In every level there will be some new dialogue, and I just love the overall tone/humor of these conversations.\n\nOverall, Messenger changed my mind in multiple ways. It showed me that I can enjoy old school type games and that I can enjoy a game focused around platforming. While I didn't exactly find a new favorite genre like back when I discovered Spectacle fighters, perhaps the next old school game or platformer will change my mind :P", "timestamp_created": 1686448609, "timestamp_updated": 1686448609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139815900": {"recommendationid": "139815900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010249642", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1048, "last_played": 1695382655}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't finished this game yet, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games such as Ori and The Will of Wisps and the Rayman Origins series, basically any platformer in general.

The level designs are interesting and sometimes even has poignant little morsels, yes the enemies are a little repetitive, but placed right, still makes for an interesting challenge. The game  also earns its title by having one of the best movements by a gaming character, the ways in which you can soar across the screen feels very good to play.

Whether you\u2019re traversing a room riddled with traps, listening to the Shopkeeper spin a new yarn, or charging forward to give that one boss another go, every individual element combines to create an experience that feels genuinely refreshing. At times funny, at other times thrilling, The Messenger captivated me from beginning to end through its charm and challenging platforming.\n\nDirectly inspired by Ninja Gaiden, The Messenger is not just another retro 2D action-platformer despite what its appearance would suggest. While a familiarity with the Nintendo games of yore that serve as an influence will undoubtedly make the small improvements and shout outs all the more noticeable, nostalgia is not the overriding factor here. Instead, The Messenger uses your expectations of the genre to great effect, crafting a journey that continually surprised me even after ten hours of gameplay.\n\nIt starts with a simple intro that belies the true nature of The Messenger. Humanity has been crushed by a demon army, with only a small pocket of survivors still alive on a remote island who have been practicing for years awaiting the next invasion and the coming of a prophesied figure called the Western Hero. It is as clich\u00e9 and rote as it sounds.\n\nBut whereas other games would have you play as the fabled Western Hero, you are but a Messenger tasked with delivering a scroll to the highest peak in the realm. In short, you\u2019re a delivery boy, but one who is capable of defeating scores of demons and inciting fear into their hearts. From the get go, The Messenger is tongue in cheek, playing with genre expectations to craft a story that continually surprises with its irreverent tone.\n\nMuch of the charm comes through via the dialogue, most of which is a direct result of the NPC that you will interact with the most. The Shopkeeper is exactly what his name implies; he runs and operates the shop through which you upgrade your abilities and earn new items over the course of your journey. Yet more than that, he is the Messenger\u2019s constant companion, offering sardonic commentary on your progress while telling tales that serve no purpose. And as much as he all-too frequently offers meta commentary on the game as a whole, his changing relationship with the Messenger serves as a steady cornerstone on which The Messenger can build.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that the most dramatic and unnerving moments in The Messenger revolve around the Shopkeeper. His reactions, or the lack thereof, ratchet up the tension where there was none beforehand. The Shopkeeper is your best friend, your cheerleader, the person who will mock you relentlessly for every mistake, and is written to near-perfection.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the rest of the cast is anything to scoff at. I came to love the thick headedness of the Messenger as he failed to grasp the meaning behind the words of others\u2026like the ogres who love to work out, the wannabe necromancer and his evil talking staff, and the spirit who just wants to dig a hole. As brief as their scenes are, they leave a big impact, and create much of the joy along the way. Some jokes take hours to pull off, but when they hit, I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at how well planned it all was.\n \nOutside of the upgrades that you earn over the course of the game, the primary movement mechanic of The Messenger is called cloudstepping. Whenever you hit a projectile, enemy, or target with your sword, you can immediately jump again, allowing you to chain together jumps to get over obstacles and reach places you normally wouldn\u2019t have access to. This is a difficult move to pull off in the beginning, but it didn\u2019t take long for me to grasp its implications and chain together attacks so that I could stay continually airborne. It\u2019s a very cool mechanic that provides some measure of control over the normal double jump, and is a pivotal move in your arsenal through each of The Messenger\u2019s levels.\n\nProper pacing is oftentimes difficult to achieve, but here, it feels natural. The rate at which you gain new skills never felt rushed to me, with each new area providing plenty of opportunities to practice and work on your moves. My successes and failures were mine alone, and I never felt like it was a cheap mechanic or a poorly structured obstacle that did me in. This is a good thing, as the failures come repeatedly and without mercy, particularly during a boss fight. You do have a health bar, which provides some leeway when facing enemies but does little when you have to content with spike lined pits and other traps that will often cause instant death.\n\nAt least dying is a minor inconvenience due to the lack of lives. Rather than restart a level upon death, you respawn back at the nearest checkpoint with a small demon named Quarble tailing you. He\u2019ll follow you around until he either gets bored and leaves, or until he eats a requisite number of Time Shards, which is the currency used to purchase upgrades. It\u2019s a straightforward system that is not too penalizing while still providing some consequence for failure. It may not seem like much, but those Time Shards will be missed when you\u2019re itching the purchase the more expensive upgrades.\n\nA personal highlight in my time with The Messenger was the boss fights, which are as numerous as they are challenging. Their ever increasing difficulty is indicative of how strong the pacing is as a whole. Earlier bosses focus on simple movement mechanics or task you with using your new abilities to their full potential. I particularly enjoyed the end game battles, which are unforgiving yet so satisfying to overcome when I realized just how flexible the limited abilities at your disposal are.\n\nThough the main story is well-paced and balanced in terms of difficulty, that goes out of the way if you search for the optional Power Seals. These are collectibles that open a chest in the shop and are not required to complete the story. Which is good, as the hidden locations you find them in are by far the most punishing areas in the world. They require pinpoint accuracy and quick thinking to traverse, and are worth tackling later in the game once you\u2019ve grown accustomed to the controls and have developed nerves of steel. I tried my hand at a few of these, and while I struggled with most of them, they do provide some of the best platforming challenges available.\n\nIt\u2019s also helped by the design of the levels themselves. They\u2019re challenging yet fair from a gameplay perspective, but are absolutely gorgeous in terms of design and animation. Each level has a certain appeal to it, from muddy and thorny swamps to glacial peaks, which is further enhanced when you change between eras. The Messenger doesn\u2019t stick to the colour palette found in the NES and SNES era which allows for a greater variety and depth to the foliage and enemies you encounter.\n \nThe little details are what make The Messenger shine. When you dive underwater, the music is muffled to reflect the change in acoustics. A sword slash sounds noticeably different in the 16-bit era compared to its 8-bit counterpart. The way the eye of an enemy glints just a half second before launching across the battlefield. How a single level manages to be intimately familiar despite the changing times. There are so many small elements like this that don\u2019t do much by themselves, but added together, offer so much to the experience.\n\nAll this is to say that The Messenger is phenomenal. Its platforming and exploration are some of the best I\u2019ve played in years, the tight controls meshing well with a small but immensely enjoyable toolkit. It exudes character throughout, using delightful and witty dialogue to fill the world with charm against the backdrop of a beautiful world filled with secrets. With The Messenger, Sabotage blends all this together into a harmonious package that pays tribute to its forebears while standing proudly on its own.", "timestamp_created": 1686167948, "timestamp_updated": 1688333988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139701340": {"recommendationid": "139701340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383586641", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1083, "last_played": 1686855320}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Celeste realmente eclipso a este juergueado de calidad, 10/10 ojala alg\u00fan d\u00eda saquen el 2", "timestamp_created": 1686164460, "timestamp_updated": 1686164460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139636025": {"recommendationid": "139636025", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983988486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1617, "last_played": 1694649350}, "language": "english", "review": "Best flow-game I have played yet.

It's supposed to be a metroidvania, this should be a boon, not a bane. And yet, it grew old VERY fast.

Everything started to feel stale, even the humour I loved at the start of the game. \n\nOverall enjoyment score: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1684176400, "timestamp_updated": 1684176400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138337462": {"recommendationid": "138337462", "author": {"steamid": "76561199087407606", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1458, "last_played": 1689728041}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta bueno si lo recomiendo\nFuente: Cr\u00e9anme", "timestamp_created": 1684157888, "timestamp_updated": 1684157888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138325372": {"recommendationid": "138325372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082776929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1698882733}, "language": "english", "review": "v fun, boss fights are cool, challenging but not that hard. areas are unique and generally interesting. wish there were more upgrades/abilities tbh", "timestamp_created": 1684128618, "timestamp_updated": 1684128618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138323123": {"recommendationid": "138323123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856063283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1543, "last_played": 1684125491}, "language": "spanish", "review": "chilardo, buena curva de dificultad\n", "timestamp_created": 1684122086, "timestamp_updated": 1684122086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138311370": {"recommendationid": "138311370", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975640169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1693776200}, "language": "english", "review": "With a HUGE caveat I recommend this game.\n\nThe Messenger is some stellar game play - it's so much fun and a lot of really good ideas stacked into one. It's definitely hard, but it's hard in a fun way. The music is absolutely incredible. The game has some fun amusing parts to it and I don't wish to spoil too much but the way the game shifts its mechanics towards the end turns the game on its head. The New Game + is harder, but it just shows how great the game's movement can be as you run through the game again with all of your fun movement options. Absolutely enjoyed all of it.\n\nExcept...\n\nThe caveat at the end of the review - the Picnic Panic DLC made me hate this game. The last part of it is some of the worst gaming I've had to play in forever. I actually rage quit. I am almost to the point I wish I'd never played the DLC. If you want this game to be your absolute number one game of all time, do -not- get the Picnic Panic DLC.

The only \"gimmick\" at first is that if you hit something with your sword while in the air, you gain a second jump, and you can do this ad nauseum. This allows for a fun level traversal mechanic where you can use a combination of a jumping/spamming attack to \"float\" through levels, and allows for some interesting platforming sections, as well as a ton of fun ways to \"skip\" content for speedrunning.\n\nHowever, this section of the game starts to wear thin by the end...until you realize the game hasn't ended. I don't want to spoil too much here, but there is a very very different \"second half\" of the game that completely changes everything. And no, it's not going from NES graphics to SNES graphics.\n\nUp until that point, the game is maybe above average, with some great boss fights, but others very much not so great, and overly long levels that start repeating mechanics too readily.\n\nAfter that point, the game becomes a completely different, much better game. My only regret is that it takes ~4-5 hours minimum to get to the point where the game really snaps into place.

However, to properly talk about the game, you need to discuss some of those twists.\nAttack options are basic. You have a sword with short reach and long-range shuriken that are limited. But you have a lot of options for movement. Instead of a double jump, you have a Cloudstep, which gives you an extra jump after a successful sword attack. And it works on enemies, projectiles, or environmental lanterns. The best part is that you can combo multiple Cloudsteps. As long as you have something to land an attack on, you can keep jumping. And that\u2019s just the basic jump mechanic. Eventually, you\u2019ll get even more options that also work together, giving you a lot of mobility options.\nHowever, sometimes chaining these different moves isn\u2019t easy. Instead of doing what you want, you\u2019ll pull a different move, which is annoying and can lead to a frustrating death. The controls are precise, but the button layout isn\u2019t the best. For example, with an Xbox controller, you jump with A and attack with X. Precise Cloudsteps require both buttons, and you only have one thumb to press both. Yes, you can change the layout, but the default one should be better. But since it\u2019s a matter of skill, you\u2019ll improve over time.\nThe game starts in 8-bit linear stages, but after a few hours, they\u2019ll shift to 16-bit. And shortly after that, the game also changes to a metroidvania, which is a great twist. During that part of the game, you\u2019ll shift between 8-bit and 16-bit in the same stage, but only at predetermined spots. This dual-layer mechanic isn\u2019t new, but I love the implementation. The transitions are smooth, both in graphics and music. Speaking of music, it\u2019s great. Some tracks are amazing, both in 8-bit and 16-bit. The pixel art is also great, in both modes.\nThe metroidvania elements, however, are a bit lacking. You don\u2019t get new upgrades, there are only a few bosses, and the new items you get only open new areas. There\u2019s a lot of backtracking with only a few fast travel locations. At least it\u2019s easy to go back to the main hub. It\u2019s not that bad if you think the game is a metroidvania from the beginning, just with a lot of gatekeeping to keep you on the main path. But since the game uses that as a cool twist, you don\u2019t have that perception. Still, there are a lot of cool areas to explore, although the game lacks enemy variety.\nThe game is challenging but not hardcore. Collecting all optional items can be tough, but the reward is underwhelming. There\u2019s also a free DLC that adds even more areas, and it\u2019s a welcome addition. Most achievements are natural to get, but some are missable, and one in the DLC is particularly annoying. After beating the game, you unlock New Game+ with an increased difficulty if you want. In any case, lack of content isn\u2019t an issue.\nThe story is also interesting, with fun interactions with NPCs. But those, you\u2019ll have to find out for yourself. However, there\u2019s a plot dump out of nowhere near the end that feels awkward.\nI can see why some rate this game very highly. It has a lot of cool ideas and twists that were never done before, at least in this way. The game is fun and engaging, with great gameplay. But for me, it has some issues that prevent it from being an amazing title.

The 23 man indie studio, established in 2016, already made a massive splash on the indie game scene with their first release \u201cThe Messenger\u201d (and for good reason) and everything is pointing to them gearing up for another exciting venture, with their sophomore release \u201cSea of Stars\u201d. The developer's website can be found [url=https://sabotagestudio.com/team/]here[/url].\nThe Messenger follows a Ninja, tasked with delivering a scroll of great importance to the top of an icy peak, a perilous journey to save humanity\u2019s last bastion of hope against the ceaseless invasions of the horrible Demon King, his village off on the far Western shore. Donning the title of the Messenger, he sets off, aided by the ever quippy supernatural aid of the mysterious, robed \u201cShopkeeper\u201d.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[h2]CONS[/h2]\n- A bit too much backtracking at times, even for Metroidvania standards (though bear in mind it\u2019s a careful and subjective balance)\n- One bug (got stuck crouching in a wall, because of a moving platform)\n- Little, unskippable cutscene every time a power seal is picked up (there are over 45 in the game)\n- One leap of faith in the [spoiler]Forlorn Temple[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Wall grabbing[/spoiler] seems a little buggy in game\u2019s final area\n\n[h2]PROS[/h2]\n+ One of the best soundtracks (especially on the chiptune side of things) in video game history\n+ The greatest narrative I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing in an Action Platformer, bar none\n+ Some of the most wonderful writing (especially of dialogues and jokes within said dialogues) I\u2019ve witnessed, in and outside of the video game medium\n+ Awe-Inspiring use of genre-blending and environmental/visual storytelling\n+ Ridiculously funny at times\n+ Splendid philosophical moments\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nThe young, Quebec studio kept busy for the first two years of their establishment, delivering \u201cThe Messenger\u201d onto PCs on the 30th August 2018. Having done all of the game\u2019s achievements, barring one (because of my own carelessness), the game took me 20 hours to fully complete, and about 17 or so to fully complete a first playthrough (with the free Picnic Panic DLC).\n\n[h2]Music[/h2]\nThe game\u2019s composer \u201cRainbowdragoneyes\u201d has not only succeeded at making a masterful, electrifying soundtrack, but shows an impeccable musical competency through his use of leitmotifs, and his ability to make iterative musical pieces of varying complexity, that are never overburdening, as well as intelligently using certain distorting and compressing effects to seamlessly emulate the chiptune melodies of old, while still retaining a slick, modern feel.\n\n[h2]Gameplay & Controls[/h2]\nThe controls and general handling of the character are about as buttery as its gets. Your character is not just a ninja for show, cosmetically, he is a ninja master of mobility par excellence. And as you acquire more and more abilities for your traversal of the in-game world (which often intelligently and handily double as combat abilities), you will feel the flow of the game increase. Though, quite amazingly, the game feels tight and fast and snappy from the very beginning, even before acquiring the more interesting abilities later down the line (though not too late, thankfully!).\nThe beginning of the game is your standard affair for the most part: Run, Jump, Slash. The only unique ability at the start lies in the game\u2019s \u201cCloudstep\u201d. It entails hitting lanterns, candelabras, skulls and other debris stuck to the game\u2019s background walls (and, soon enough, enemy projectiles, too) to renew your jump mid-air, indicated by a tiny icon of a gust of wind/cloud under your feet. I will not spoil the game\u2019s other abilities, for it is a sensational joy to discover them on your own!\nAbout 1/3 of the way through the game, you will be faced with quite the surprise, and the game\u2019s first genre-blend/switch. Though I will not spoil more!\n\n[h2]Graphics[/h2]\nLittle remains to be said about the visuals, that is not clearly seen: A fantastic emulation of the style of the early NES games, with its main inspirations worn heavy on its chunky, 8-bit sleeve. The style morphs into something beautiful and altogether different later on, and that equally inspires awe within me, and fits with two of the game\u2019s main strengths: defying expectations and pushing the envelope of the mundane.\n\n[h2]Writing & Story[/h2]\nAs already mentioned in the summary and the game\u2019s introductory blurb, the writing of \u201cThe Messenger\u201d is as beautiful, as it is, at times, absurd and humorous; as basic, as it is philosophical, thought-provoking and complex. The game plays a careful balancing act, prolifically teetering on the edges (not unlike a ninja) of trope-y game and a philosophical, meta think piece. It lures the player in with a well-crafted, yet somewhat plain rug, only to pull it and make it fly as soon as the player blinks, high into the sky, enough to make the, at times, stereotypical, gamified world into a self-referential and clever joke, though never at the expense of the game\u2019s actual, main narrative. The game is always aware of what it\u2019s doing, but never in a self-hating manner, always simply in good-hearted, and thoughtfully analytical jest.\nIf I was to talk about the character of the Shopkeeper, about the many intrusions beyond the fourth wall, about the short stories, parables, philosophies, the clues of which are often visible in the game\u2019s world, as well as one of the most clever and loving integrations of a Credits sequence I have seen in any video game ever\u2026 If I was to talk about all this and more, I could write a whole essay, and I still may fall short in describing the game\u2019s splendiferous didactic, diegetic and thought-stimulating sides.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe Messenger is an experience beyond the scope of Steam\u2019s word limit, and my time limit, as are many video games made these days, and in the past. I\u2019ve stretched this service's limits while describing some of the seemingly simplest experiences this platform has to offer. The world of gaming is a world of boundless artistic expression. Whether it be a team of hundreds or thousands or the multi-talented effort of one or a few, there\u2019s never been quite anything like the video game medium before. I hope The Messenger is saved in the annals of time, in our collective appraisal of culture through its selective rememberance, for it is one of the most impressive experiences of all time. Displaying about every side of our humanity, that you can think of: Deep, funny, sorrowful, lonely, bitter, angry, creative, resourceful, \u2026 The Messenger and the story of its creation, are an ode to humanity.\n\n[h3]Thank You To Sabotage For Sharing Their Beautiful Art With The World, And Thanks As Always To Devolver Digital, For Remaining One Of The Greatest Havens For The Lonesome Creative And The Basement Studio Alike![/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1682624194, "timestamp_updated": 1685271617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557112276554107666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137384514": {"recommendationid": "137384514", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048998153", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 2073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2063, "last_played": 1683990030}, "language": "english", "review": "what can i say, im a sucker for ninjas", "timestamp_created": 1682622852, "timestamp_updated": 1689902598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137346704": {"recommendationid": "137346704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972907627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1152, "last_played": 1682553350}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si en alg\u00fan momento de la vida considero que algo es dif\u00edcil, recordar\u00e9 que termin\u00e9 este juego. \n\nEl car\u00e1cter metroidvania de este juego es totalmente secundario, The Messenger es un t\u00edtulo de plataformas puro y duro.

The first part of the game is great, solid platforming and challenging bosses. Then it all grinds to a halt. The metroidvania part of the game is half baked and unnecessary - and this is coming from someone whose favourite genre is metroidvanias.\n\nThere are four bosses in the metroidvania section and three of them are gimmick fights, unsatisfying and completely unlike the ones in the first part of the game.  \n\nThe story follows a similar trend, the start is intriguing but it splutters out with the music box conclusion. Introducing a major new character that close to the end was perplexing. The very final boss was defeated with a button mashing QTE and the ending was disappointing, it didn't feel like I was ending the curse cycle at all. \n\nThe Cloudstep technique was different and enjoyable, but adding the glide move makes it much worse and harder to perform. Following the trend of starting with something good and then ruining it.\n\nI quickly ran out of things to purchase from the ingame shop. There is a second merchant that then unlocks, but to unlock him it costs ALL of currently collected shards. I didn't know how to unlock it before I had thousands of shards collected, all of which were then wasted.

This one is very obviously inspired by the NES Ninja Gaiden games, though as other reviews have already alluded to it actually ditches its linear structure partway through and becomes a Metroidvania.\n\nNow, I recommend this game because it's both fun and funny. Moreso the latter, as the game has a charmingly anarchic and meta sense of humour. However, potential buyers should beware, as the game is not without flaws.\n\nMost seriously, the game has a few difficult sections that are actually required. In fact, I'd say the hardest parts of the game were mandatory sections over instant-death pits rather than any of the boss fights or optional puzzle-platforming screens. Those difficult platforming sections become even more of a pain when the game opens up, as now you have to traverse them in both directions. The lack of a traditional high-jump or double-jump further compounds the difficulty, as muscle memory from other games will get you killed a lot before you become comfortable with the game's core platforming mechanic.\n\nThere are a few other odd control problems. The game ports over the \"stick to any wall even if you don't actually want to\" part of Ninja Gaiden (and it doesn't get a pass just because it lampshades that fact), and the hookshot (sorry, \"Rope Dart\") just feels off for a number of reasons: it's too short, has odd timing, lacks impact, and often produces unpredictable results\n\nBut despite all that the game is still very fun, and many of its sections are extremely satisfying to play once you've mastered the controls.", "timestamp_created": 1677968140, "timestamp_updated": 1677968140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134061394": {"recommendationid": "134061394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082316168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1679028256}, "language": "english", "review": "fun game", "timestamp_created": 1677951319, "timestamp_updated": 1677951319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134013845": {"recommendationid": "134013845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013360077", "num_games_owned": 512, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1674272506}, "language": "english", "review": "I just don't feel very driven to continue on with the game.

Once you hit the halfway point of this game, it suddenly transforms into a SNES 16-bit metroidvania style game (a mix of elements from \"Super Metroid & Castlevania Symphony of the Night\") that's just a joy to play.\n\nWhen you get to this point - you will notice that the developers still keep the 8-bit graphics style by implementing \"time travel\" in their level design, using portals that take you back and forth trough both 8-bit and 16-bit style of graphics. This changes how you navigate through the many areas of this game, and is a true stroke of genius because you also hear the music alternate from their respective styles.\n\nAnother important element of the game is that is provides a very solid way to progress through it. You gain new abilities from the shop using currency you collect and items from certain areas/bosses, some that just show you new areas you can then access. I usually have issues with Metroidvania-style games because they give you a little too much freedom in exploring the entirety of the map, causing me to get bored or just flat out give up; but The Messenger plays fair by forcing players to pay up to show you where to go next via the shop keeper. It gives players an in-house choice of doing it on your own or asking for a bit of help for a price - rather than looking at a guide somewhere.\n\nThe boss fights are fantastic, with a small learning curve for their patterns but still provides a fun challenge to complete. There is a decent variety of them, unlike the standard enemies in the game - but the lack of different enemies doesn't make the game feel repetitive because it's just fun to constantly slice and dice through them in each area. The level design is just so entertaining, backtracking doesn't feel like a chore especially if you feel like collecting all of the green emblems (they remind me of the DK coins in Donkey Kong Country 2 & 3). Gathering the musical notes needed for the end game also felt a little Super Mario RPG inspired, where you needed 7 stars to reach the final area. It was just the perfect mix of nostalgia that puts this game over the top for me.\n\nMy only [ever-so-small] negative opinion about this game is the power up that allows you to attack while gliding - I didn't feel it to be as smooth as the developers most likely intended. It caused a lot of deaths and hours trying to get hard-to-reach green coins, but it may just be my lack of skill - so I can't be too hard on that opinion.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy to have finally get around to playing The Messenger. For anyone with a love for retro platformers/Metroidvania - it's a must play. For anyone younger that is new to this art style or type of game - give it a try - it's worth it at the game's price. At this time full retail is $20 but you can wait for a Steam Sale to catch this at $10-15, and at that price it's a must buy.\n\nJerk Score: 9.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1673455667, "timestamp_updated": 1673455827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130620273": {"recommendationid": "130620273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135959077", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1734, "last_played": 1682176214}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never played any ninja gaiden, or any ninja games but I highly enjoyed my time with this game.

Enemies doesn't have much challenge, feels like they're placed more as a part of the scenario for you to use the skills and do the platforming itself. Also the controls are very fluid, which is important considering the precision required to walk through the levels.\n\nBoss fights are nice, a bit easy - hardcore players may get frustrated on this - this is those games which you have to learn the patterns.

I gathered that the former was a sort of prequel (different genre and all) and it would be worth playing it in order to get the references in the latter. I'm glad that I played it, for whatever reason, because it's one of the best platformers I've ever tried.\n\n[h1]Game Impressions[/h1]\n[b]+ Art style:[/b] Amazing, in and of itself, but the game has a very cool mechanic: time travelling through portals (a seamless process, within the same level). While this makes for some entertaining gameplay, it's not necessarily original. What I find to be original, is how the art style changes between 8-bit and 16-bit era inspired, depending on the time period.\n[b]+ Music:[/b] Same as above. The music is worth listening to by itself. There are also two tracks for each timeline.\n[b]+ Writing:[/b] I didn't find the story being anything to write home about, but the dialogue is exceedingly funny. The characters don't take themselves seriously, constantly breaking the 4th wall. Even the antagonists are endearing, in a way reminiscent of Undertale.\n[b]+ Level design:[/b] Each biome introduces new mechanics that usually require you to get an upgrade at the nearest shop or to unlock it by completing a loosely defined quest line. These upgrades are not required to traverse all subsequent areas, but they make the process easier. One gripe that I may have is that despite these quality of life improvements, it can become tedious to run around a map trying to figure out what's your next objective (noting that the positioning of the fast travel portals are not always the best). Although that's partially my fault for not wanting to buy hints.\n\n[b]- Second shop:[/b] You can access the shop via multiple portals scattered around the map. The shop is always the same, existing in a pocket dimension. At some point, you gain access to a second shop, underneath the first. There, you can spend the acquired currency on figurines.

The upgrades feel rewarding, the challenges are pretty well designed, the story is solid, the soundtrack is very solid, the graphics are acceptable...\n\nSo why am I not recommending this game?\nSimple. The controls infuriate me.\n\nTo be precise, one single issue with the core gameplay has been the bane of my existence: The jump button does too many things that fight each other.\nAfter about 4 hours of gameplay at most and a couple upgrades in the shop, your jump key will make you:\n- Jump if you're on the ground\n- Double-jump if you're in mid-air and have slashed an enemy before landing (cloud-step mechanic)\n- Glide if you are in the air BUT do not have a cloud-step stored\n- Do a tiny double-jump for recovery [i]instead of anything else[/i] if you have taken a hit because taking a hit mid-air makes you fall uncontrollably otherwise\n\nI would like to reiterate: The list above is [b]on a single button[/b]. It's a mess. It's not even like the game has run out of controller buttons; in fact, it only uses one of the shoulder buttons and one of the triggers! But nope, instead the jump face button is a jack-of-all-trades mess and it has tripped me far too many times. Enough times that that corresponding button on my controller is now damaged which really didn't help.\n\nI got tired of it by the time I reached the ending. I picked up some cheats, annihilated the last couple bosses, saw how much content was in their postgame extra parallel universe shenanigans, and I gave up.\n\nMy hand hurts, I probably need a new controller soon, and I'm mad I spent so much time on a game that was so close to being good but kills its harder challenges with controls that actively fight you.\n\nWant a good metroidvania with solid controls?

I was halfway through the game going \"I'm definitely going to replay this shit\". And in the second half, the game opens up and goes metroidvania, and essentially asks you to replay the game. But now, all the levels you completed in 8-bit can be played in 16-bit and vice versa. It was an absolute joy to run through again with remixed graphics, music, and level design with all your unlocked gear, just tearing through areas while headbanging to kickass tunes. \n\nFavorite area was the cloud temple revisit. I think this was the exact point where I was completely in love with this game. The first time you visit with 16-bit graphics and music, and it's a very breezy run through blue skies and white clouds with a lighthearted SNES-style soundtrack. The second time, you play through in 8-bit with a raging thunderstorm in the background and the soundtrack turns into this hard-hitting chiptune remix that absolutely SHREDS.

game is fantastic.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nThe sheer amount of things The Messenger pulls off successfully is staggering. I was never a huge fan of 8-bit visuals but it started to grow on me and then suddenly we are transported into the 16-bit future and my mind was blown. Next stop, turning a fun action platformer into a metroidvania with you constantly jumping from 8-bit past to 16-bit future in order to get new items and discover new passages. I have never seen anything like this before and it was pretty great. And then, just when you become sure that the game has no more tricks up its sleeve, it throws a dragon riding sequence at you. Amazing! \nCombat is very simple but when combined with movement it feels great. You'll be slashing your way across the map, cloudsteping off of enemy projectiles and grappling to both walls and enemies. Boss battles are also very well done and I found bosses to be way better designed and more memorable than in some boss-famous games. I'm also very grateful to the devs for including a very generous checkpoint system. While The Messenger is not too hard, some areas are quite challenging but nearby checkpoints made sure I never got too frustrated. \nSoundtrack is just cool as hell, thats all I'll say.\nBut the biggest surprise for me was the writing. While the story itself is merely ok with some demons and time travel sheenanigans, the characters and their dialogue are fantastic. There is a crazy amount of well written humor which I did not see coming. One character in particular, a certain shopkeeper, is 4th wall breaking, hat stealing, storytelling, closet loving bundle of sarcarsm. I love this guy and he should be present in every future project devs decide to do! Besides him, we have our slightly clueless protagonist, a dragon who wants to be a butler, necromancer skeleton thats very sensitive about his height etc. I love all these guys.\nFinal thing I'll mention is DLC, Picnic Panic. Now, I usually wouldnt include DLC in a review but Picnic Panic is FREE, adds a lot of content and brings more unexpected things to the table (SPOILERS: like making final boss into a boxing match, Mike Tyson Punch out style).\n\nTHE BAD\n\nThere are few things I found to be somewhat less good, though. Most are nitpicks but some did make quite a bit of problems in my playthrough.\nFirst is the respawning enemies. Enemies respawn as soon as they are outside of your screen and not when you leave a room which I found annoying. It happens that you miss your jump and then land straight into a projectile from an enemy who was dead 2 seconds ago. I understand enemies and/or their projectiles are sometimes needed to traverse a room but rooms like that are few and far inbetween.\nNow, most challenging rooms are definitely those that lead to power seals or some other items. While most of these are challenging in a fun way, a few are just hair pulling difficult. Thankfully, insane platforming skills are not always necessary and you can sometimes brute force your way through the room by tanking hits and fumbling your way through which gets the job done but...doesnt feel quite right.\nAnother negative is that you, as far as I can tell, cant skip cutscenes at all. Not very fun on replays, especially knowing there is a huge info dump at one point in the game.\nMy biggest issue is gliding/cloud step combo with both actions being tied to the same key. For the most part of the game its a non issue but in more challenging areas I felt very uncomfortable with this control scheme.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThis game is so good. Its fun, challenging, got an awesome soundtrack and hilarious writing. I love everything about it..except those few annoyances I mentioned. Still, at some parts those little nitpicks made the game a very infuriating experience. Not very often, but sometimes. I am very excited for Sea of Stars now and I do hope Messenger 2 eventually comes because it does deserve a true sequel. Close to perfect, but not quite there.\n9/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1665438050, "timestamp_updated": 1665438050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123622342": {"recommendationid": "123622342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124559725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 920, "last_played": 1666420134}, "language": "english", "review": "First few hours: Dude... this game is dope \n\nLast few hours: Dude... this game just needs to be over already \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665377291, "timestamp_updated": 1665377291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484673231840133667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123463215": {"recommendationid": "123463215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971768558", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1665098305}, "language": "english", "review": "Ninja's, Time travel, simple in that you can just play this game when other games would be a hassle to get into.

Too many huge problems preventing this game from being fun, despite a good start.\n\nProblem 1: controls. It is one of these badly designed games that keep adding one key at a time, each time a new move is unlocked, until you have to play with too many keys. In this case, it's extreme: FIVE different keys with the left hand (they are jump, fire type 1, fire type 2, fire type 3 -- not kidding, and another key to walk on water). This is just BAD design. Two keys are ok. Three can be necessary but usually mean \"we didn't make an effort to improve the commands\". Four is invariably terrible design. But five? Five is beyond. In this case, it would have been so easy to economize. You'll want the \"walk on water\" key always pressed. There is absolutely zero reason to not keep it pressed, at any time. It should have been automatic (you dive anyway if you stop moving so that there is never a need to depress that key). At a certain point I was tempted to ask a friend to keep it pressed for me. Hint: when your game becomes accidentally two player co-op, it means that game-design wasn't exactly your destiny. Economize on  commands! E.g. double tap the fire key to shoot. This sloppy design makes me think this game was not made with either hearth or brain.\n\nProblem 2: difficulty curve. 99% of the game is easy/relaxing, but then there are these two stages that are 1000x more difficult than the rest. Most stages I could clear on first attempt, a few took 3 or 4 attempts. These two, they took 500+ attempts each. That frustrating and boring, and the player feels cheated because no other part required that level of skill or luck. The first one I endured. The second one made me quit. It was the biggest culprit, the 3rd power stone in the Elemental Skyland, where you are supposed to climb up to a power stone by hitting flames being fired at you. That's insane. \n\nAfter hundreds of attempts, I reckoned that the game (story, graphics, gameplay) is not nearly as good or as fun to warrant the huge umbalance effort, and I had to accept that I wasted my money and my time to that point. Hint: playtesting is important! There is no way these two stages, and especially the one I mentioned, survived playtesting.\n\nTERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

Si le sumas que est\u00e1 bastante bien hecho y equilibrado, tienes un gran juego, quiz\u00e1 no de sobresaliente pero s\u00ed muy por encima de la mayor\u00eda de lo que sale por ah\u00ed.\nVa de un aprendiz de ninja en un mundo donde solo hay una isla y pocos humanos pero tambi\u00e9n una leyenda que habla de un mensajero con una misi\u00f3n crucial, llevar un pergamino a lo alto de la \u00fanica monta\u00f1a del lugar y eso es lo que tienes que hacer t\u00fa, pero al cumplirlo a\u00fan te queda la otra mitad larga del juego donde pasa de ser un plataformero de acci\u00f3n a otra cosa parecida y m\u00e1s profunda y paso de decirlo, aver\u00edgualo.\nLo mejor del juego, al menos para m\u00ed, es el Tendero, el NPC principal y gu\u00eda, habla con \u00e9l siempre, intenta abrir su armario varias veces seguidas, p\u00eddele que te cuente una historia y c\u00f3mprale habilidades, hazlo y te reir\u00e1s seguro.\nEn todo est\u00e1 muy bien, gr\u00e1ficos, m\u00fasica, control, trama,... pero hay cosas que quiz\u00e1 no aceptes, yo creo que lo que m\u00e1s tiene en contra es su dificultad, es un poco alta y subiendo, puede que eso sea motivo para no comprarlo pero no por ser un fallo, el juego est\u00e1 bien as\u00ed. Por lo dem\u00e1s, honestamente, poco negativo puedo comentar, quiz\u00e1 la historia decae precisamente en el cambio de g\u00e9nero, hay situaciones un poco injustas, los coleccionables son algunas veces bastante insufribles de obtener, el DLC no est\u00e1 al mismo nivel aunque por otro lado desbloquea el modo chungo donde si mueres, a empezar de cero; algo que me molest\u00f3 es la habilidad de agarrarte a las paredes, el juego da prioridad a que tu personaje se enganche al muro al punto de anular ataques y todo, eso mal.\nBueno, no s\u00e9, para m\u00ed es un juego especial, no soy objetivo del todo y lo reconozco, pero salvo que no seas muy h\u00e1bil y el tema dificultad te eche para atr\u00e1s, debes jugarlo, punto.\n\nNota:8", "timestamp_created": 1658544434, "timestamp_updated": 1658544434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119189744": {"recommendationid": "119189744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035280489", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1092, "last_played": 1658862391}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgic and innovative at the same time, The Messenger features some original movement ideas that go beyond double jumps and wall clinging.

For those who are familiar with the original Ninja Gaiden for the NES, you'll be instantly familiar.\n-Level design(again, for the first part) is excellent.  VERY nostalgic in terms of design and graphics.\n-Humor is well written, for the most part.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n-How do you feel about pixel-perfect jumps?  Controls that dont' listen to you at least a 3rd of the time?  This is definitely the game for you if you like that kind of stuff.\n-Bosses are average at best, boring and obnoxiously tedious at worst.\n-Quarble.  I can appreciate the mechanic where Quarble technically \"saves\" you from death, but after the 400th time dying due to the fact that you touched a platform at the wrong angle and get sent back 14 rooms, and Quarble snarking \"Gee, maybe you should try jumping\" for the 4000th time, it gets real old real quick.\n-The 1st half of this game works like a traditional 8-bit NES platformer, with specific levels and areas.  The 2nd half [spoiler]turns to 16-bit.  The graphics are definitely better, the animations are smoother.  But it changes into a Metroidvania, and a really boring one at that.  Too much backtracking for not enough reward.[/spoiler]\n-2nd half has severe performance issues.

Its particularity is to offer two styles of gameplay - the 1st third is, essentially, platform with 8-bit visuals in successive levels while the final two thirds consist of metroidvania mechanics alternating 8 and 16-bit scenarios.\n\nThe first part is pretty much perfect. There is a wide variety of scenarios, enemies and bosses, with an exceptionally well-paced progression in terms of introducing new skills and increasing difficulty. In parallel, the story develops properly and there are humorous NPCs. The experience is pleasant until there is a turning point in the plot.\n\nWell, all the pleasant feeling fades away as the game becomes a metroidvania. Interactions with NPCs become increasingly rare, there are practically no bosses and new items to be collected witch represent significant changes in gameplay. It is true that the variation between 8-bit and 16-bit is a valid differential, including modifications to the - excellent - songs, but its benefit is nullified by the tedious backtracking, annoying repetition of enemies and the consequent progressive loss of engagement.\n\nThe Messenger is a clear example of a brilliant idea but poorly executed. It seems that all the inspiration was condensed in the first stage, being its continuity, except for really exciting moments in one of the new areas, dull. There are very high quality demonstrations of the implemented concepts, which, unfortunately, did not last over the 15 hours of gameplay, which ended with a bitter taste in the mouth.\n\n- - - [pt-br] - - -\n\nThe Messenger \u00e9 uma ode ao cl\u00e1ssico Ninja Gaiden.

H\u00e1 grande variedade de cen\u00e1rios, inimigos e chef\u00f5es, com uma progress\u00e3o excepcionalmente bem cadenciada no concernente \u00e0 introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de novas habilidades e dificuldade crescente. Em paralelo, a hist\u00f3ria se desenvolve adequadamente e h\u00e1 NPCs bem humorados, em especial o da loja de upgrades. A experi\u00eancia \u00e9 agrad\u00e1vel at\u00e9 que h\u00e1 um ponto de virada no enredo.\n\nPois bem, toda a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o agrad\u00e1vel vai se esvaindo \u00e0 medida que o jogo vira um metroidv\u00e2nia.

It is pretty much like your childhood dreams game coming true, when you were revisiting your favourite old platformer for the 10th time and thinking: \u00abOh, how cool it would be if there was a game about time-travelling demon-killing ninja fighting giant totem in the tropics\u00bb. To sum up all the amazing stuff about The Messenger there are:\n\u2022\tAmazing recreation of the classic old-school metroidvania experience, with smooth gameplay, challenging platforming and a unique idea of a transition between 8-bit and 16-bit dimensions.\n\u2022\tSimple though charming setting, which is built with great love, combined with funny dialogues alongside smart and unexpected breaks of the fourth wall. And yes, the shopkeeper\u2019s cabinet opening is one of my personal favourite WTF moments in the history of video games.\n\u2022\tThe soundtrack is completely worth its money even without the game itself. (Btw, check out amazing \u00ab24-bit\u00bb mixes made by \u00abTemmie Plays!\u00bb on youtube, they combine the awesomeness of both 8-bit and 16-bit versions and they are long enough to listen to them while doing your stuff without constant repeat button spam ).\n\u2022\tAstonishing pixel art, which is doing great in recreating a classic retro-platformer atmosphere and sometimes rewards you with pretty wallpaperable landscapes. \n\u2022\tAction-packed DLC which takes everything I loved from the original game and upgrades it, resulting in even more challenging platforming, new versions of enemies I just like to hate, and 3 new bosses, 1 of which (the totem) I consider the best in the whole game, and all of these in a Hawaiian style.\nDespite such amount of positive qualities the game has its problems too:\n\u2022\tIt is a good platformer but a bad metroidvania. I guess that it is the only reason why some people are giving a \u00abNot Recommended\u00bb to this game, but in my opinion, it is completely forgivable for this game, and here is why: [i] While creating a game which is basically a homage to old 8/16-bit games it is impossible not to sacrifice some gameplay properties to look more like such game. [/i] In 90-s, when resources for making games were limited, there just were no other options for some metroidvanias where we have to play as a melee character to make a not spam-click-centred battle system or to fill the world with tons of content like in a Hollow Knight. They also mostly relied on platforming, the same way this game does and does it great, so here I have no idea what complaints are about. Talking about this \u00abtransition\u00bb when a game turns into a metroidvania from a linear platformer I also do not understand what these backtracking-unhappy people expected from a game which is even tagged in a shop as \u00abMetroidvania\u00bb. I 100% admit that after playing the Hollow Knight backtracking here feels like a little bruh moment, but for me, it still was an enjoyable experience to revisit all of the locations to look at them in a 16-bit appearance and search for a power seals. And I am not even talking about the introduction of new cool locations such as Riviere Turquoise and Elemental Skylands.\n\u2022\tPoor enemies diversity. The annoying but not so big problem of this game, which somehow can be partially indulgenced by my comment above (Like, I do not remember old platformers having 50+ types of enemies). But anyway the problem is real, and I wished to see much more location-unique monsters. The only such example in the whole game is the 2 types of mushroom monsters at the Quillshroom Marsh. Sad but true.\n\u2022\tGathering collectables is much more enjoyable than the reward. I liked the whole idea of the power seals, it was nice and challenging to find them all, but I had much more expectations about what the chest in the shop hides inside. Like, it still was ok, but I expected more. I could be much more satisfied if there was a key to some secret and super-hard location at the end of which we could have received the reward from that chest +golden character skin after equipping which we finally were rewarded with the best trophy \u2013 \u00abWhy are you gae\u00bb-like monologue from a shopkeeper being unhappy about modern videogame trends.\n\u2022\tThere are too few shopkeeper quotes after the metroidvania part of the game kicks in. That is just sad because this dude creates a huge percentage of the atmosphere of the game.\n\u2022\tTiny figures of not even all mobs from the game with a poor description are a lazy way to utilize not-needed time shards.\nThe only thing I can say in conclusion: I goddamn love this game with all of its imperfectness, because it has its soul and it was developed by enthusiastic and motivated people, the real Messengers \u2013 not because they tried to earn money on some product after some market analysis, but because they wanted to give us a story to enjoy, a message. And I think that the message was carried successfully, now waiting for the story to continue in the Sea Of Stars.\n[b]I give this game 9/10\nThank you kindly for reading this one to the bottom!\nWiro Doloran[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1655149124, "timestamp_updated": 1655149520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562357425689697266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116833322": {"recommendationid": "116833322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255360026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1358, "last_played": 1629921434}, "language": "english", "review": "YOU GET TO DO THE THING!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1654978637, "timestamp_updated": 1654978637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116819879": {"recommendationid": "116819879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984836968", "num_games_owned": 1188, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1655925534}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No s\u00e9 como no pod\u00eda haber jugado este juego antes.

Grabbing the walls and dodging the projectiles. The first boss fights are the best. Every single area haves different enemies, mechanics and objects that you need to interact with, every single level isn't similar to other one. \n\nBut when you reach the top of the mountain...\n\nThe gameplay doesn't change at all but in my opinion becomes a little boring;\n\nYou start going once and once again to the levels, reading and trying to decipher the prophecy, paying atention to the level. Drains your patience, your soul and your time so thats why there is a hint in the shop.\n\nTalking about the levels there is something interesting. The game doesn't increase the difficult with adding more variety of  enemies or making stronger, only increase the number of enemies in the level and anoying things to fall down and get hit by an spike. More saws, spikes, enemies, walls, moving saws, cliffs makes it more stressfull for the player to complete the level quickly and that's why the game gives you more health upgrades. I currently have 300 deaths and I'm pretty sure 200+ are from falling off a cliff and dying from a saw.\n\nIt's stupid adding more variety of enemies or even adding more upgrades when you can easly jump around the enemie and continue or spaming the hook to kill enemies and bosses. Good amount of upgrades in my opini\u00f3n, having more resources to kill the same 3 global enemies and the 2 or 3 added per zone it's unnecessary.\n\nI really like the soundtrack, Bamboo Creek theme and Autumn Hills are my favorite. Amazing job from the soundtrack team, you can easly identify a level only with the music.The background of the levels amazing. The sprites and sounds very well, i don't want to think how long took to make them.\n\nThe sense of humor is priceless, i laughed a lot with the conversation between the shopkeeper and the mesenger. \n\nThe characters have their own personality that constrast with the other characters, you can easly see this when the messenger talks with everyone, maybe the game doesn't have much characters but they all pretty good.\n\nI recommend The Messenger if you haven't played other Metroidvania games or if you're new to the genre is a very good game to start.\n\nThat's all and thanks for reading!.                                                                               -Y.", "timestamp_created": 1654414699, "timestamp_updated": 1654427751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116486000": {"recommendationid": "116486000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168748794", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1658483220}, "language": "english", "review": "A great platformer", "timestamp_created": 1654368458, "timestamp_updated": 1654368458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116452544": {"recommendationid": "116452544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005550457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2669, "last_played": 1673072861}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game, it can be real pain sometimes but it is fun.", "timestamp_created": 1654311313, "timestamp_updated": 1654311313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116403240": {"recommendationid": "116403240", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345337293", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1693375869}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Rap\u00e1ndoselo estaba cierta hermosa,\nhasta el ombligo toda arremangada,\nlas piernas muy abiertas, y asentada\nen una silla ancha y espaciosa.\n\nMir\u00e1ndoselo estaba muy gozosa,\ndespu\u00e9s que ya qued\u00f3 muy bien rapada,\ny est\u00e1ndose burlando, descuidada,\nmeti\u00f3se el dedo dentro de la cosa.\n\nY como menease las caderas,\nal usado se\u00f1uelo respondiendo,\nun cierto saborcillo le dio luego.\n\nMas como conoci\u00f3 no ser de veras,\ndijo: \u00ab\u00a1Cuitada yo! \u00bfQu\u00e9 estoy haciendo?\nQue no es \u00e9sta la le\u00f1a deste fuego\u00bb.", "timestamp_created": 1654220773, "timestamp_updated": 1654220773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116299214": {"recommendationid": "116299214", "author": {"steamid": "76561199057481492", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1654302003}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing fucking game!

Once you reach the middle of the game, there will be big revelation (which blew my mind). The new game mechanic will be introduced which might surprise you.\n\nThe dialogues in this game are witty and funny, especially with the Shopkeeper. The mechanics are simple but hard to master.

The enemies design is good but none of them really stands out, nevertheless, the boss fights are done incredibly well and definitely the highlight of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, The Messenger is a game made with love and passion for the old classics but also manages to infuse some modern aspects of video games as well.

As one of high-profile indies, temptation got the better of me and I singed a deal with the devil. My excitement was short lived though and disappointment prevailed very soon into my adventure. I should have read the fine print before inking my signature...\n\nThere are two main and very 'in your face' issues this rather innovative spin on action platformers suffers from. First one are Shopkeeper's dialogues which are basically disgustingly cringe 4th wall nukage fests appealing to elementary grade schoolkids, and the other is unfortunate emulation of gameplay shortcomings arising from technical limitations of NES era. Every enemy and their projectiles disappear/reappear as soon as they re-enter the screen. When you kill an enemy it will be there when move out of frame and back again, joyfully shooting at you as if the last two seconds never happened. It happens EVERYWHERE by design.\n\nMy plan was to simply import old saves to unlock achievs and avoid further brain damage but devil had other plans. Against my better judgement I decided to play through it again before posting by far my harshest ban worthy review. For even the devil deserves a 2nd chance right? Well don't ask me how but mental preparation did something to me and I was able to tolerate both issues now and somehow enjoy the rest. Hopefully knowing that does the same to you.\n\n* * *\n\nIt starts of as pretty promising Ninja Gaiden homage with very pleasing 8-bit aesthetic, music and well measured mix of platforming and combat. Difficulty and variety being just right, supported by a simple story of carrying an item to a sacred mountain to fulfill a prophecy. Straight out of '80s playbook. Soon enough you find your first shop where you learn you can upgrade your character a bit for Shards dropped by enemies (more health, damage resistance, ranged weapon, etc), stuff that'll make progress easier basically.\nShopkeeper is kind of a meme character as his main purpose is to make fun of the genre by excessive text dumps and preachy moral stories. Both are optional but c'mon who wouldn't exhaust every dialogue option? I can tell you each and every one can be skipped at no loss whatsoever (Lightfoot Tabi + Jump buttons skip all text at hyper-speed!) but topics about Level Area, Ability, Weapon, Boss should be read at least once for story sake.\n\nThis goes on for about 10 Level Areas filled with enemies, secrets, collectibles, bosses, and shops which btw double as a save-point. You'll need the latter as deaths can be frequent depending on skill ceiling, mostly due to insta-death pits and occasional traps, combat is surprisingly forgiving considering era it's emulating. Areas are pretty diverse and interesting, each with own catchy music (my fav being Bamboo Creek). Worth mentioning is music becomes muffled when you submerge and adds to generally polished experience.\n\nSoon after reaching the summit at around half-way point game switches to 16-bit aesthetic and looks closer to a modern platformer! Every bit of asset is faithfully recreated in high fidelity including sound. Even more unexpectedly at around 2/3 it further expands into a Metroidvania. For that item you were carrying all this time was actually a Map.\nThis lets you overview the whole world you've been traversing, revealing countless missed secrets in fairly easily readable map. Main goal turns into finding additional 6 items delivered by cryptic objectives, how much depends if you paid attention to environment. Shopkeeper expands its inventory with more goodies at this point and world becomes saturated by 8/16-bit points where you can flip aesthetic which in turn affects room geometry to unlock previously blocked paths. Pretty neat.\n\nWhat I liked the most is overall care put into world cohesion and gameplay mechanic. There's a lot of little details to keep you interested for more. Even the story is okay when you exclude Shopkeeper as other characters rarely suffer from being obnoxious. Progress and difficulty is well paced, with handful of spikes regarding certain collectibles, but nothing that can't be brute forced.\nBoss fights are also among the best I had. Challenging but fair and more often than now you'll have enough time to adapt to changing attack patterns on first attempt before getting brutalized. Later on in NG+, if you took 'THE DEAL', you'll slice through them like hot knife through butter. That was extremely satisfying btw!\n\nDLC can be accessed after beating main Boss and reloading that save again. It's characterized by harder version of base game with emphasis on platforming and lots of death pits. It's good but controls are not as tight to support complex movement patterns.\nNew Game+ isn't just tacked on but offers [url=https://the-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/New_Game_%2B]rarely seen[/url] extra content and challenges. This is where game became really fun for me and I played even after getting all achievs, something I rarely do if ever. Felt great plowing through base content like a speed-running God with my old transferred gear and newly acquired DLC skills :)\nOf course you'll be dieing a LOT with penalties so severe it would result in aneurysm for where it not a simple file save-scumm trick.\n\n* * *\n\nBesides witty but still very annoying Shopkeeper and NES combat limitation which I learned to deal with there isn't much to whine about. But it's unlike me to leave this section empty so here goes.\n\nMetroidvania part is somewhat lacking in new player abilities. Only one is found and enables highly circumstantial walking on liquid. Other items you found only serve one-time purpose and send you backtracking on insufficiently densely placed fast-travel points. Most of late-game frustration comes from backtracking and not knowing where to go. Although there is an option to buy yourself out of the problem it requires time consuming money grind, in an otherwise well balanced economy. As a completionist my problems solved themselves by exploring the whole map and filling gaps but those wanting to just get it over with may get stuck in last quarter.\n\nThis also ties with with map design. Although easy to read for missables, its simple single color rectangle room design makes is practically impossible to discern which room it is and its individual configuration. Leading to false information when you finally get there and even more backtracking.\n\nI also wish developers quit emulating NES-like stuff down to every detail and create a modern quick save/load/restart mechanism for those not wanting to put up with last century state-of-the-art. Just to load the damn game you have to sit through slow menu slides and endless blinking confirmations when you just want to redo last section ASAP. Latest save is kept in memory btw, so hard game restart is required to load safely backed up scummed save. Someone please tell them to quit this nonsense practice.\n\n* * *\n\nCrazy how giving it a 2nd chance completely turned me around and left me wondering where else that happened without me even knowing, not only in gaming but in life in general. It is what it is though and who knows, maybe a 3rd playthrough turns me around again, making me right the whole time?

When you're in the startup animation of the [spoiler] squirrel glide [/spoiler] you can't grab onto walls which is frustrating. Plus, in hectic situations when you are trying to just jump out of somewhere you're needing to basically mash the jump button and then you end up dying because you can't get out and you can't see clearly enough if your character has the icon for cloud jump because it has no contrast against some backgrounds.\n\nI've played a ton of platformers and rogue-likes with platforming elements: rogue legacy, hollow knight, spelunky, etc. but this game makes me feel like I'm working extremely hard just to get the ninja to jump over a wall. My hand was actually in pain and I had to rest from playing. It just feels so stiff, especially while using the [spoiler] squirrel glide [/spoiler] powerup - when you are anticipating horizontal momentum and get virtually none then just fall to your death. It's very frustrating.\n\nThe shop seems to encourage farming but the farming mechanic is really weird, unless I'm not understanding it correctly. For example, collecting 200-300 um.. currency.. is a good chunk in this game. One of the upgrades cost 1000, how exactly can you even get that much? The only way to acquire more money is to die then the area gets sort of reset, and a portion of your earnings goes to pay for your revival anyways. It's unholy backtracking mixed with grinding. Basically, knowing that information means you would just choose the easiest most profitable level and plan on collecting all you can then intentionally dying, over and over again. I don't know.\n\nNext, let's talk about boss mechanics, some of it is memorization which is okay I guess, but almost every time the bosses use a new move on you it's a sure thing you will take damage because it's a surprise gotcha attack that you would have had to know about before hand as there is no time to dodge. That being said, I really don't believe there is any amount of innate talent, or cautious technique from a skilled player that could get through the game without falling victim to the gotcha deaths. And speaking of gotcha deaths there are other instant or near instant death things like bottomless pits, being crushed, and certain things that do huge damage (3 of your 4 points without upgrades) which means you're dead if you didn't have full health.\n\nSome things just feel lazy or done for the sake of increasing difficulty which is okay I guess? But for me personally I didn't really like it. For example, there is an enemy that you see literally copy pasted on every single level and he just keeps shooting fireballs at you. The fireballs can pass through walls so you always have to contend with him. It gets really old when you're trying to enjoy the beautiful levels or just want to focus on your path, but instead it's always -- fireballs! Why do they go through walls but then your throwing stars cannot? It just feels fatiguing to endure.\n\nFalling from high places and having to redo a long sequence of jumps. Please limit these situations...\n\nFlying enemies: why can they fly through walls and why can you not slash diagonally or up? I can't believe in the history of games we still haven't realized that backing up strategically so that the flyer eventually lowers its level to yours so you can hit it with a straight on attack is terrible because it breaks the game flow. Man, I'll tell you Zubat really did a number on the gaming industry, seems like every gamer is conditioned to love and hate bats. Game designer memes: it's not finished until i make the bat mobs. hehehe. I'm not asking for the moon here, and there's already a crouching slash. Just basic QoL stuff.\n\nAlso, maybe I'm just not that far yet but... if I'm a ninja is there no dash attack? Imagine I'm about to be hit and I know I can't avoid it because my walk speed is to slow but it's a long drawn out telegraphed thing, that's really no fun at all. It's just something that you can't stop but you're forced to watch and endure like the Oscars on TV. But if there was an opportunity to use skill to get out of that situation, then it would open the door for more options and exciting gameplay and allow for a higher skill ceiling. In a platformer, mobility is everything\n\nI really do respect this game for it's very cool retro feel, the menus, the dialogue boxes, the pixel art, all are actually amazing. And I get that it's trying to recreate something like shinobi or  ninja gaiden or whatever for the original NES but sometimes being too faithful to the original is a bad thing, like in movies adaptations have to be made (cue the haters, lol). I think the magic of that era can still be captured (including the difficulty) without also porting the frustration factor and stiff controls in full.\n\nIf the game devs ever read this: please just put in ledge climb up. please take away that awful air technique, it's just unnecessary. It's momentum very rarely outperforms cloud jump + [spoiler] rope dart (grappling hook) [/spoiler].\n\nThe music, it is fine generally, but that same tune gets very grating, there needs to be more variety. Again, the idea of being fully married to recreate the NES style hurts here as the music is then less expressive. The music doesn't always have to be in your face, crazy adrenaline action music. It can sometimes be slower, atmospheric and relative to the environment the character is in. Even if the music still sticks to the chiptune style, it can become more expressive and the volume needs to be attenuated with more crescendos and decrescendos to improve the tone and don't be afraid to use the triangle wave for a longer smoother sustained voice.\n\nAnyways, there's so much potential in this game, but maybe a sequel could be made and another chance would be had to redo some mechanics and gameplay ideas.\n\nAnd just so you don't think I'm a super duper hater, things I love about this game:\n-basically every piece of art, the bosses especially the big ones are so cool, the backgrounds, the fading, the menus, dialogue box, and the shop (my favorite place in the game hands down).\n-the dialogue is very good, story is to the point and cut all the fat, great. The shop dialogue is hilarious and in good taste\n-the objectives are clear, how things work is very clear\n-most of the boss themes\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1651946432, "timestamp_updated": 1651946432, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462855517864227295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115065170": {"recommendationid": "115065170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125804895", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1652392797}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game", "timestamp_created": 1651882793, "timestamp_updated": 1651882793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941185235977173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115022966": {"recommendationid": "115022966", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972068818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1622610220}, "language": "english", "review": "Great gameboy game", "timestamp_created": 1651815650, "timestamp_updated": 1651815650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115000223": {"recommendationid": "115000223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335226099", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1651774816}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a much better game than I expected.

It's mostly decent, certainly learned a lot of lessons that Infernax didn't despite coming out 4 years earlier, but it also shills for that one pseudo-intellectual who some call \"Mari Kondo for incels\".  If you want to be spoon fed pop philosophy secondhand by an attention-seeking hack, you're much better off with Zizek or something.  Or, you know, you could actually engage with philosophy on your own or with decent academic sources instead of reactionary cranks.\n\nAs an aside, rope dart is broken.  Several bosses, including the final boss, are basically negated by the fact that it lets you act with a window of invincibility, meaning you can just keep yourself invincible while dealing damage.  I believe the \"Leg Day\" guys were meant to be broken by it, but it's sometimes clearly more than intended, such as with \"Did the Thing\" and, again, the final boss of the game when he does the tracking laser attack.\n\nAlso, despite the writer fetishizing ancient knowledge like so many reactionaries do, there's simultaneously a really explicit contempt for \"primitive\" people and cultures, which I find a little confusing.  This is completely beside the caricatures in Picnic Panic, which I don't think it would be useful for me to try to discuss.\n\nAnyway, here's hoping the one writer has grown out of his incel phase.

A seriously incredible soundtrack, genuinely funny dialogue with a ton of meta humor, some fantastic pixel art, and tight and satisfying platformer gameplay are enough for a great experience, but The Messenger manages to go above and beyond with its twist mechanic introduced halfway into the game. I personally believe that the game is better experienced without detailed knowledge of this central twist, so to avoid spoiling anything, all I'll say is that it is a true mark of dedication to the craft and worthy of high praise.

The combat is extremely good, the only downside is that it definitely would've been nice to have a few more bosses in the game to get to use the cool combat on.

The comedy is really good and always funny too so it works really well. \nThe first part is completely linear with a couple secret rooms you can find which contain a collectible item (once you collect them all you unlock a special thing), though after the first part it becomes like a semi metroidvania where you go back throughout areas you already explored while travelling between the past and future using portals placed throughout them. There are also a few new areas and a few new bosses in this section of the game, though you'll probably be wanting more. I call it only a semi metroidvania because you don't collect many new powers or things like that during this part of the game, instead its using what you've already gained throughout the linear portion in combination with the time travel to discover the new things in the areas, though there are a couple items you gain and a new ability too. The metroidvania section is probably a bit weaker than the first section, though still very fun and doesn't feel like a chore at all, though some more of the fast travel portals would be nice bc occasionally it'll get a bit annoying to go to a few locations which don't have their own portal.\n\nOverall an amazing game with only a few minor issues, mainly all of which are about the second portion of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1646700381, "timestamp_updated": 1646700381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111753602": {"recommendationid": "111753602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315853653", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3096, "last_played": 1647029414}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un excelente juego de plataformas, para aquellos que quieran darle una oportunidad solo les dir\u00e9 que este \"NO\" es un Ninja Gaiden....", "timestamp_created": 1646672124, "timestamp_updated": 1646672124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111685158": {"recommendationid": "111685158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161657621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1646581610}, "language": "spanish", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1646581636, "timestamp_updated": 1646581636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111661825": {"recommendationid": "111661825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210742632", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 960, "last_played": 1670904757}, "language": "english", "review": "shopkeeper my beloved", "timestamp_created": 1646557024, "timestamp_updated": 1646557024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559101581573486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111642792": {"recommendationid": "111642792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258269919", "num_games_owned": 2057, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2424, "last_played": 1656788936}, "language": "english", "review": "Was in the mood for some 2d metroidvania - platforming game lately and decided to try this one finally - couldn't be happier i did.

The \"portals\" you use to traverse the map are in terrible spots, there's no way to just start at the beginning of a \"level\" and I think it would have been much better to be able to either use the save points or even the stores to get around the maps. Also, there are things that transform the maps that you don't know if you should use or not and if you're wrong then you have to backtrack which is a real pain. I feel like they designed the game this way to make it take longer to finish but all they did was make me not want to finish the game. It's a real shame too because the first 4 hours were amazing.\n\n\nOld: I love this game, it\u2019s a perfect blend of old school and modern games. If you like games like this, this is one of the best I\u2019ve played in years. Also, be sure to get \u201cStrike of the Ninja\u201d for your first upgrade, you will use it more than anything else early on.", "timestamp_created": 1644693165, "timestamp_updated": 1650039757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110001527": {"recommendationid": "110001527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023736053", "num_games_owned": 872, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 240, "last_played": 1644607990}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute writing, but I didn't have that much fun with the gameplay in the end.

[spoiler]Hay otra \"peque\u00f1a\" habilidad que es la de andar por agua y lava que solo funciona para zonas muy concretas, pero que son igual de importantes si quieres avanzar en el juego.[/spoiler]\n\n[b][u]PLATAFORMEO[/u][/b]\nB\u00e1sicamente este apartado junto a la exploraci\u00f3n son lo que hace el juego divertido, si bien no debes dejar que te de una mala impresi\u00f3n por los primeros niveles del juego por su dificultad para ni\u00f1os de 6 a\u00f1os ya que luego se va poniendo m\u00e1s interesante mezclado partes pasajeras con partes desafiantes (sin llegar a los niveles de dificultad de Aeterna Notics) e incluso un poco de pensar (m\u00e1s que nada observar tu alrededor por unos segundos m\u00e1s de lo acostumbrado). La mec\u00e1nica para explorar despu\u00e9s de pasado cierto punto de la historia lo hace una experiencia refrescante ya que aunque pases por muchos sitios que ya estuviste lo har\u00e1 en su mayor\u00eda de veces ser una experiencia \u00fanica de nuevo. Un dato que pueda ser interesante por si a mas jugadores le pasa es que hay muchos lugares de v\u00e9rtigo, cosa que a mi a pesar de tener v\u00e9rtigo hasta en los juegos (si te sorprende no lo digo en broma) pude jugarlo sin problemas eso si a veces con algunas pausas de lo tenso que estaba.\n\n[b][u]HABILIDADES[/u][/b]\nAqu\u00ed vamos a lo importante del juego junto al plataformeo, y es que a pesar de que exista \"solo\" una habilidad es m\u00e1s que suficiente para tenerte totalmente enganchado porque es una manera totalmente diferente a la que nos tienen acostumbrados en todos los metroidvanias, todas las habilidades que te dan son \u00fanicamente para progresar linealmente, hasta cierto punto del juego no podr\u00e1s desbloquear la opci\u00f3n de explorar de nuevo todas las zonas (dejando de ser un juego lineal) y cuando seas capaz tendr\u00e1s una \u00fanica habilidad de backtraking que estar\u00e1s us\u00e1ndola todo el tiempo y en todas las zonas. Si no te gusta juegos \"desplazamiento horizontal 2D\" que no sean metroidvanias y por lo tanto quieres lo cl\u00e1sico de desbloquear poco a poco habilidades tipo doble salto, dash, etc y es lo \u00fanico que crees es la \u00fanica formula que funciona no lo compres (si te gusta los juegos de plataforma, sin dudarlo), pero yo por mi parte te invito a que lo pruebes que tampoco es un juego caro, yo soy fan del genero a lo cl\u00e1sico como muchas habilidades y que cada una sirva para explorar toneladas de lugares secretos con puzzles, plataformeo y de todo; y The Messenger me a dejado m\u00e1s que sorprendido y satisfecho.\n\n[b][u]COMBATE[/u][/b]\nAqu\u00ed es donde m\u00e1s flojea el juego, los enemigos pr\u00e1cticamente todos de 1 hit est\u00e1n muertos excepto 1 [spoiler] por su logro[/spoiler]. Es un juego enfocado en la exploraci\u00f3n y plataformeo por lo tanto la \u00fanica dificultad en ellos es saber esquivarlos o eliminarlos seg\u00fan el caso para que no molesten. A veces (no siempre pero dir\u00eda que es bastante habitual) son usados para algo m\u00e1s ya os dar\u00e9is cuenta si lo jug\u00e1is. Importante aclarar que aunque este apartado no sea el m\u00e1s \"elaborado\" de todos el combate es muy fluido.\n\n[b][u]JEFES[/u][/b]\nPoco dir\u00e9 aqu\u00ed para no hacer spoilers, solo comentare que son extremadamente f\u00e1ciles, algunos solo con darle un poco al cerebro y veas la forma en la cual los desarrolladores ten\u00edan pensado que hicieras ese jefe lo har\u00e1s sin problemas ya que de por si llegar a esas conclusiones no son para nada complicadas y aplicarlas son igual de f\u00e1ciles. Si intentas ir a lo bruto si que podr\u00e1s morir alguna que otra vez. Entonces la pregunta del mill\u00f3n \u00bfque gracia tiene entonces implementar los jefes? Lore y [spoiler]poder avanzar en el juego[/spoiler], son divertidos si no eres un obsesivo de la dificultad de extrema y pueden ser una forma relajante y divertida de amenizar el juego despu\u00e9s del plataformeo, que algunos tienen su aquel.\n\n[b][u]HISTORIA[/u][/b]\nUna historia que parece tirar a lo clich\u00e9 al inicio y que al final te dar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de una sorpresa y momentos bastante graciosos. No tiene un lore muy extenso y es lo suficientemente interesante para dejarte con las ganas de terminarlo. Como siempre esta parte es es muy subjetiva pero considero que no es mala y aunque no pueda gustar a muchos es innegable que es bueno.\n\nLa parte art\u00edstica y banda sonora no veo la necesidad de comentar nada ya que es puramente gustos, si estas leyendo esta rese\u00f1a te har\u00e1s una idea el tipo de banda sonora que te espera y tambi\u00e9n viste por las im\u00e1genes como es.\n\n[code]Resumiendo.

You play as a young ninja who, in line with an ancient prophecy, is tasked by a legendary hero to deliver a mystical scroll to the top of a high mountain as part of mankind's eternal war against an army of demons, only for it to turn out that you've let yourself in for more than you bargained for.\n\nWhile the game is overall very good, it has some flaws that I should probably touch on first before I explain what makes the game worthwhile - while they weren't a big deal for me, they might be for others.\n\nThis one might be kind of a spoiler, but then again not really because they more or less show it wholesale in the trailer: the game is a linear 8-bit style platformer for a good while, but once you hit a certain point in the game it throws two curve balls at you. First, it changes the graphical style from an 8-bit style to a 16-bit one, and then shortly after it reveals that the linear game you were playing actually has an open map that connects the levels together like a metroidvania. It's a clever twist, but I think that it wasn't implemented as well as it could be. Typically in a metroidvania style game you're hunting for items and powerups that both allow access to new areas as well granting you upgrades and new tools that increase the strength and versatility of your characters. While in this section you will be hunting down items, for the most part they're just keys that are only useful in getting past very specific obstacles, and don't really give your character any kind of powerup or new abilities, with a single exception to the rule. It's odd because the game does have upgrades of this kind, but they're either given to you for free while the game is still linear or bought for crystals that you can gather anywhere in either phase of the game. I think maybe the devs should have held back at least some of the movement abilities like the climbing claws, wingsuit or rope dart until the metroidvania part of the game to make it a bit more engaging, though the design of large parts of the first half would have to change to accommodate that. While there are new areas to visit during the second half of the game, it also feels short on bosses when compared to the first half. Overall it kind of feels like the game has peaked when the linear half has ended and settles into a bit of a lull in the early parts of the metroidvania, though things pick up again as you near the finale. Overall I think that if you're eyeing this game because you're a fan of metroidvanias and this one has the metroidvania tag on it, maybe reconsider before buying (though there are other good reasons to get this that I'll get into.)\n\nOne other thing that's a mixed bag is the game's writing. This is a very tongue-in-cheek kind of game, with 4th wall breaking jokes abound. Most of these are at least amusing but it can get excessive at times, especially when there's a serious enough story underneath it all about the curse afflicting the world and your role in the grand scheme of things. Of course there's always time for humour even in a serious story, and it's not like the jokes are unfunny, but it sometimes feels like the balance here is off. The worst offender is Quargle, your little demon buddy who's pulling double duty as an explanation for how you can continue when you die as well as your penalty for death. He eats a certain amount of the crystals you gather shortly after you respawn, but that's not my real problem with him. My real issue is that he shows up to taunt you in between you dying and respawning. This becomes annoying very fast because A: his jokes by and large aren't that funny and B: you'll probably die a lot in this game, especially if you suck like me. He just amplifies the aggravation that you might start to feel if you're struggling with a tough platforming section or a hard boss. At a couple of points the game teases the prospect that they might do something with his character but ultimately he ends up just stuck in his role as an irritation. The other characters, thankfully, are at least less annoying and for the most part better written. There are a couple of real standouts, especially the blue-robed shopkeeper and a handful of other memorable minor characters.\n\nWhile I've just spent a while talking about the game's flaws and mixed parts, I still strongly recommend the game. This is because despite the game's difficulty and the flawed parts, it's just immensely fun overall. The game's controls are great and the levels are expertly designed. Even the parts of the metroidvania that should be kind of a slog aren't because the game's platforming controls and level design make even the act of backtracking through areas engaging and challenging. You start out with your basic jump and the ability to swing your sword, with the one gimmick of being able to gain additional jumps in midair by landing hits on enemies and certain environment objects with your sword before you land. To this the game adds a ranged attack, the ability to climb on walls, glide, and grapple to climbable walls and enemies with a rope dart. Then the levels demand that you combine these abilities together to conquer a gauntlet of obstacles that are often demanding but incredibly satisfying to conquer. The game also demands the same skills from you in its boss fights, all of which are very fun and probably the highlight of the game overall.\n\nAll of this is emphasised by the game's excellent presentation. The game is distinctly retro-styled, but in the good way where it's evocative of the old style of 8 and and 16 bit games, but absolutely superior to the way most of them actually looked thanks to many subtle improvements. It's quite similar to Shovel Knight in that way. The game's soundtrack is comprised pretty much entirely of bangers too. Both the graphics and sound are yet further enhanced by the game's final distinctive gimmick - you'll have already experienced the switch from 8 to 16 bit by the time the metroidvania begins, but that aspect of the game is yet further enhanced when it reveals the fact that you can repeatedly change between the two styles during ordinary gameplay by passing through time portals. The two graphical and even sound styles change from one to the other utterly seamlessly, and the effect is really impressive, but not only that, you'll be required to do it in gameplay to solve puzzles and progress in the level, because the layout of the level is often different in the other timeline. They could have built the entire game around this gimmick, but in my opinion they use it just the right amount, where it's there just enough to make you think and add some additional complexity to traversing the levels without becoming intrusive or obnoxious.\n\nOverall you do need to have the right expectations when going into this - just because this game has the metroidvania tag on it you shouldn't come in expecting Hollow Knight or something. What you are getting on the other hand is just a very fun and challenging platformer with great retro visuals and sound, and a decent story despite some potential foibles in regards to the consistency of its pacing and tone. Hopefully the devs come back and either make a sequel or at least another game like this - the game has a free-LC chapter playable postgame that's more of the same excellent gameplay but with clear signs that the developers have learnt from the shortcomings of the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1642287066, "timestamp_updated": 1642287066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550827443599700928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108091670": {"recommendationid": "108091670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215255631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1642271675}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En The Messenger tomamos el papel de un ninja que debe llevar un pergamino esencial para la salvaci\u00f3n de la humanidad, adentr\u00e1ndose en un viaje a trav\u00e9s de un mundo devastado en donde le esperan muchas amenazas.

Realmente parece un juego de NES, si te gustan los juegos retro, entonces este es tu juego.\n\nEl \u00fanico punto malo que puedo dar sobre The Messenger es que durante una parte del juego se puede volver algo tedioso, pero no a un punto en donde la experiencia del juego se vuelve super tediosa o mala en si, simplemente es un poco de pereza. \n\nEn lo personal se a convertido en uno de mis plataformas favoritos, su gameplay, su est\u00e9tica, su sensacional banda sonora superaron todas las expectativas que tenia sobre The Messenger, un juegazo que recomendar\u00eda a cualquier amante de los Plataformas. <3", "timestamp_created": 1642283865, "timestamp_updated": 1642348248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108081071": {"recommendationid": "108081071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291789366", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1682, "last_played": 1642273645}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome platformer with tight controls and interesting dialogues.

Definitely worth checking out if either of those things are up your alley.\n\nThe Messenger is rather light on the story side of things and features a very small set of characters, but the interactions you have with them are hilarious and thoughtful. Lots of witty banter accompanied by surprisingly deep life advice, and The Messenger isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. The visual aesthetic is carefully crafted, with each area feeling distinct, and the soundtrack is an instant classic. Combat is simplistic and nicely complements the fluid movement system. Movement really opens up after a few upgrades, and the...uh...grapple hook...quickly became one of my favourite tools.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, we can break that down into (1) knowing your objective in the game, (2) platforming, and (3) bosses. As for (1), there can be moments in the game where you aren't sure where to go, but it turns out you can expend some in-game currency for a clear sense of direction if you don't feel like figuring that out yourself. I think that's great. The platforming (2) is straightforward for the most part, but I can see how it would be tricky if you're new to platforming games and aren't super comfortable bouncing off things for a while without your feet touching the ground. I was pleasantly surprised with the level design, it's some of the funnest platforming I've tried to date. Definitely a few tricky sections, but those were a welcome challenge and never got too frustrating. I can't really say the same for the bosses (3). If I had to estimate, I'd say about 33% of the bosses were too easy (early game), about 33% of the bosses were the *perfect* mixture of challenge and fun (late game), while about 33% of the bosses were just unnecessarily frustrating (mid-game). In particular, there were a few boss arenas with insta-death mechanics that really pushed my patience, especially when they seemed to take forever to kill. The worst offender though was a boss who would, in his final stage, move to a location where he could only be hit by ranged attacks. That would be fine, except for the fact that you're only given a finite number of ranged attacks. So if you miss all them, then you have to restart the entire fight, and cross your fingers that your timing is better next time. All that said, it's worth emphasizing that the ~33% of bosses who are good are *really good*.\n\nI'm happy that I finally gave The Messenger a try after having it on my radar for a while.

It's not every day that I find a game that's a challenge to put down every time I play it. Everything about this game is fantastic: the art, the music, the controls, the dialogue etc. This is why it pains me to say that the Messenger has a few glaring issues that would've ruined the game if it wasn't so fun to make up for that fact. Despite this: don't think, just buy this game.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Story[/h2]\nIn a small village of ninjas lives the last surviving members of humanity. One day, a legendary hero arrives at the village to stop the demon king and gives our main character a scroll that he is tasked with bringing to the top of a mountain. The story unfolds as you play the game in some pretty interesting ways. Despite having a solid sense of humor, when the game attempts to be serious, it succeeds. My only problem is the game doesn't feel like it had a satisfying conclusion. You play this entire game to save your village, and you don't even get to see what happens to them or the other characters you met after you defeat the final boss; the game just ends.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nThe gameplay is where this game really shines. The Messenger has some of the tightest controls and interesting movement options I've ever seen. The grappling hook and glider especially create great momentum that makes movement have weight. The cloud step is also a blast to use (hitting enemies awards you an extra jump) allowing you to stay in the air for a long time and makes combat especially satisfying. The bosses are some of the most creative I've ever seen and finally beating them after memorizing their attack patterns is quite fulfilling. This is also true to the rest of the gameplay, with each death making me eager to get back where I left off. The game also has a unique way of respawning, with a debt-collector character following you around and taking the money you collect instead of lives. Like Celeste, it makes death feel a lot less frustrating. But the coolest part of the gameplay is the time travel mechanic- allowing you to switch between an 8-bit style and a 16-bit style, which is travelling 500 years into the future in in-game time. In some places, they use it super creatively (like in the butterfly boss fight, the magic fireflies, and the differences between the future and past of several areas); and for most of the game it just unlocks different passageways. The optional collectibles provide some pretty challenging rooms and is rewarding to get them all. The special item it unlocks is awesome without being overpowered. And while you can't get it until almost the end of the game, you get to use it in all of the free DLC. My only [i]very[/i] minor gripe is I felt they could've done more with it and sometimes getting to a certain area in a time period can be annoying. \n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Art/Music:[/h2]\nSpeaking of the time travel mechanic, the art in both styles is just so cool. After playing the game only in the past in the beginning, seeing areas you've already traversed in 16-bit is awesome. The 8-bit style reminds me of Shovel Knight and the 16-bit style is straight-up beautiful. I cannot describe how awesome the soundtrack is. Each area has bopping music, and changing the \"instruments\" used between the future and past was a nice touch.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Dialogue/Humor[/h2]\nThe messenger has a pretty good sense of humor, mostly coming from the shopkeeper and the death screens. While some dialogue comes off as a bit cringey, it really grew on me. There're lots of meta jokes, and the shopkeeper's stories were genuinely interesting. So make sure to chat with him as much as possible when you go to the shop. The death screens have some funny degrading jokes from the debt-collector character which are amusing for a while. It's definitely not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]My Big Issues[/h2]\nEasily the biggest problem with the game is fast travel- or lack thereof. The game starts out linear, and this part I would consider masterpiece game design. That is still present when the game becomes a metroidvania, but is spread thin by egregiously long backtracking. This could mean you have to travel half an area just to get to the one you need to get to. I ended up going through half of the Autumn area like 6-7 times to traverse the map, to the point where hearing the music (once one of my favorite tracks in the game) became ear grating. Once you need to look for the music notes, you only get hints (\"prophecies\") to go off of. These are easy to misinterpret, and you could travel an entire area to find a music note and then realize you were wrong about what it meant. This is heartbreaking to me because it would be [i]so[/i] easy to fix this issue. Simply have fast travel points at all of the portal checkpoints and spawn there in the last time period you touched it with. Prophecies are super cryptic, and finding out what they mean could be made a lot easier with an encyclopedia with important pieces of dialogue written down on it and details about each area to consult later. I'm not going to remember those after not playing the game for a week. And for my most minor issue: the money sink. I get it was a joke, but it bothered me that the money wrench (what you need to unlock the time sink) costs equal to the amount of money you have. I didn't discover it until I had been collecting time shards for a while and had almost 3000 time shards that I had to lose for a joke, preventing me from buying toys in the money sink. It's a cool idea though.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\nThe Messenger is a masterpiece- no exaggeration. It has some of the best game design I've ever seen, and is ridiculously fun to play. Once you power through the backtracking sections, there is magic to be found throughout the whole game. This easily cracks my Top 5 games of All Time list. Buy it on sale or not- it's well worth it.\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]8/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Art/Music[/td]\n        [td]10/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Dialogue/Humor[/td]\n        [td]7.5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Exploration[/td]\n        [td]5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Overall[/td]\n        [td]9.5/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1640816214, "timestamp_updated": 1647480866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106844764": {"recommendationid": "106844764", "author": {"steamid": "76561199165863683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1641502283}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La polla\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1640804578, "timestamp_updated": 1640804578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106837623": {"recommendationid": "106837623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396608959", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1642258267}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, I felt overloaded with nostalgia with the SNES graphics and music.

It starts off as a great 8-bit styled platformer, with clear inspiration from the NES Ninja Gaiden series. Thankfully, it's not nearly as difficult (i.e. frustrating) as those games were but overall a fun little gem. What it does - does it well but there are a few things that frustrated me. [/h1]\n\nThe game turns into a great Metroidvania game. And it's a really good one. I mean, on some level, it doesn't really do anything new, but it just does it all so well. I still have a few gripes (I always do), so I'll just mention them in passing during the review.\n\nThe controls are tight, but I wish the floating mechanics were not as easily confused with the double jump mechanic. Although that may have been a deliberate decision for level-design reasons.\n\nThe graphics are great. The boss designs are also awesome, animations are fluid, and the scenery is unbelievable in the \"16-bit\" version.\n\nLevel design is really good, secrets are just hard enough to find, but not painfully obscure as to be frustrating. One thing that deserves mention is the humour. Decent non-toilet humour with good timing, I mean, when's the last time I saw this in a game? It made me laugh multiple times simply by being funny and not \"over the top\".\n\nDespite the positive aspects there are definitely things I did not like. The first half of the game contains roundabout 12 levels after each one and it was fun. That was the best part for me but after that when \"The Prophet\" started - it went downhill - atleast for me. The forced metroidvania aspect was unnessecary and visiting the same areas multiple times because of \"a riddle\" is also something I did not enjoy. Why isn't there 1 teleporter per map-chapter?

I'm not kidding. It may seem like I have loads of hours more on other games, but The Messenger stands out over the rest as my favorite. \n\nAmazing platforming and challenges that'll test your skills. The best video game OST I've ever heard. Amazing areas both in 8-bit and 16-bit, awesome story, hilarious comedic moments, and so on. \n\nIt's a shame this game hasn't gotten the recognition it deserves, because holy crap, it's amazing. I'm really sad that the other two planned DLC's aren't going to make it, but at least we have Sea of Stars, a prequel to The Messenger that plays more like an RPG, coming out sometime in 2022(?). Of course this isn't about Sea of Stars, it's about The Messenger.\n\nI think everything plays out really well, and there's a lot of replay value in so many different departments of the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to play, BUY THIS ONE. This is the one game I have to say is absolutely worth playing under any circumstance. It might not be for everyone, which I understand.

Can't say how the story as a whole goes, but it was entertaining to read up till now and what kept me going.\nBut at the end of the day, the gameplay itself far to often is just frustrating, and out to waste your time.\nBeing a platformer, you need to make often fine careful and precise movements to get around, vertically and horizontally, wall climbing and stuff included. Unfortunatly as you try to move around you will find you are fighting the game and its controls more than the level design itself. You need to drop down quickly and grab onto something right as it comes by? Well you're character is a stiky fellow sometimes, he might not be fond of letting go, and keep getting stuck to random things around you, things that might leave you in deaths way. Or sometimes when aiming for the specific area you want to get stuck to, it decides no... you were just a bit off and it's not going to be forgiving with you an inch too high on this moving platform, when normally even being a full half body length too low seems to still suck you onto a passing wall when you don't want it to.\nAll this when enviornmental dangers are often one hit kills, forcing a respawn back a few screens possibly to the last checkpoint. Now most areas you just get a bit annoyed at at first, but later on they start stacking these difficult fine precision areas together several in a room and all with various timed and moving kill elements. At this point, it just becomes frusterating as hell that your character isn't doing what you want.\nIf they want this type of difficulty in moving, they needed to make various changes like letting you slide/drop off of a wall by holding down, not needing to jump, or to be able to climb up a wall by just pressing up to get onto it, again not jumping. If it sticks you to stuff randomly and you can't easily get off in a controlled manner that's smooth with your previous inputs of trying to go down/up before it did that, it just causes random delays and gets you killed.\n\nCompared to the castle of pain in Hollow Knight for example, I died there plenty, but I felt it was my fault, I learned and got better. Issues with the characters controls in context of the provided challenge were, yes present, but minimal and often avoidable or just a completely random bug once in a blue moon. Here, I am feeling like easily 90% of my deaths in a certain tower end up being due to my characters inability to do what I'm trying to tell him to do, and being hard and slow to recover when that happens.\nAnd example is in hollow knight, to get around you'd dash sideways in the air. If off by an inch you start falling but still sideways so you have a little wiggle room on the distance in most cases. In The Messanger, you'd use a grapple hook (equivelant), that you use to pull to a wall. If you're distance was an inch off, it wiffs and you just fall to your death, cue restarting the entire challenge, and yes they quite often force you to have to rely on it at the very edge of its usable range mid jump over death traps. So with issues like character control and methods of movement as they are, it's starting with a core that's more prone to failure and problems if you try to give it challenges requiring fine control and quick accurate movement of your character. So of coarse... that's what they did, put in those challenges and later on with failures of a single one to be executed correctly on the first try and often in sequence starting you back in previous rooms. So questionable controls, hard level design, semi harsh time punishment, and you'll quite possibly feel like this game is just wasting your time and doing it's best to piss you off. Oh, and there are more than a few other issues with controls, some inputs not working, not queueing reliably, and other such that happen less often but are still present in areas.\n\nSo overall while I am wanting to finish this game, I really don't see myself doing that anytime soon as long as I have better and more FUN games to play out there. A shame as again I wanted to see where the story goes, but I want to have fun and a fair challenge while doing so.", "timestamp_created": 1637877062, "timestamp_updated": 1637877062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449835747480392456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103882855": {"recommendationid": "103882855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048827681", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1107, "last_played": 1690496452}, "language": "english", "review": "It's beautiful, it's fun, it has a lot of gameplay.

On the negative side are not very variable enemies and not so inventive story and maybe the absence of co-op multiplayer which would make it more suitable for family playing. Is it suitable for children? Well, definitely not for the pre-school ones but children at the age of 10+ should enjoy it.\n\nPros:\n- level design\n- RPG elements\n- variable environments\n- reasonable difficulty\n- controls\n-

game! Another retro throwback paying homage to Ninja Gaiden or Shinobi with a comedic twist.

I was so wrong! The controls are tight and the movement is intuitive and satisfying. The game starts you out with limited abilities and lets you discover new ways to move, without holding your hand, through brilliant level design akin to Mega Man X. The game constantly evolves as each new ability gives you new ways to approach obstacles and the amount of care and detail put into each stage is evident throughout.\n\nThis game is a 2D action platformer that evolves into a metroidvania. It appears very linear and short at first, but later reveals itself as a much larger game with enough depth to keep you occupied for hours on end. The gimmick that everyone is familiar with, is the ability to switch between past and future, which also switches the game between 8 bit and 16 bit graphics. But this ability is more than just a gimmick to switch aesthetics. It adds another layer of strategic depth to the game that keeps the stages feeling fresh when the metroidvania style gameplay calls for the player to traverse stages that were once completed in order to discover something new.    \n\nThe characters in this game are unexpectedly hilarious and continuously break the fourth wall to communicate the self-awareness of the devs and the tributes they're paying to classic metroidvania titles, ninja gaiden, 2D platformers and more. The story ebbs and flows, expertly weaving in great storytelling, with tension and comedic relief. The game handles progression well and never overwhelms you with things to do, and yet, it somehow still gives you the freedom to make choices and complete the game in whatever order you wish.\n\nThe Messenger takes classic retro platforming and injects new life into it. The level design is nothing short of spectacular and the different level mechanics sprinkled throughout the game will keep surprising you and challenging you in unexpected ways. This game feels very familiar and yet very fresh. It does so much with so little, once again proving that passionate game design and attention to detail can create an exciting and fresh gaming experience without the need for modern graphics.\n\nI couldn't put this one down until I had finished a full playthrough and I'm tempted to dive back in again. The Messenger is fun, challenging, funny, satisfying, endearing and addictive. It had me blown away by it's intelligent level design and creative use of game mechanics. It had me in stitches laughing at it's amazingly self-aware humour. At times it had me wanting to throw my controller across the room in frustration, only to win me back when a moment of clarity allowed me to execute the perfect combination of well-timed moves to complete a challenging section in the most satisfying way possible.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. It truly is a special title that I will be raving about for years to come.

So when I tell you The Messenger is a single player game and its also my favorite game you know this shit slaps. Not only is the movement so slick and so perfectly crafted but the combat is as well. The Art style is incredible in 8 bit and its other form (which I don't want to spoil). This brings me to my next point, which I will talk about lightly since Its a great part and you should experience it yourself. But halfway through the game I thought it was the ending I said wow this was a good experience then they added a whole new element to the game which Is not in any trailers, so I didnt expect what happened after that boss.

The level design and graphics remind me of some NES-era classics such as Megaman and obviously Ninja Gaiden. If you like retro Cave Story like graphics, linear Megaman-like levels and a bit of Metroidvania influence, you really should play this game.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\nThe levels are way too much fun to play! After a certain point in the game, you get to explore previous levels in a new way, kinda turning it into a Metroidvania. Some people dislike this aspect, since the levels themselves are pretty linear. I kinda like it, but frankly it doesn't add too much to the game - the levels continue to be pretty linear, you just go back to them with a few twists, in order to get some stuff you missed. I think it's pretty fun to revisit the old levels, but I wouldn't go as far as to call that a Metroidvania.\n\nMUSIC\nOn a scale of 0 to Celeste, this game gets a solid 9 for the soundtrack. It makes the gameplay even more enjoyable. It's the kind of game where you catch yourself playing the music in your head even after a few days off of it.\n\nENEMIES\nEnemies are the one bad point in the game for me, though. They are very boring, some of them only stand still spitting fire, while others just run blindly from one side of the screen to the other. There's only two enemies that react to you besides the bosses, and I think this is a missed opportunity to introduce some fair difficulty in the game.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nNot a hard game. It's very fun to play and you won't get frustrated out of dying too much. And even if you die too much in a certain spot, there's almost certainly a save point waiting for you as soon as you get through the obstacle.\n\nHUMOR\nAlthough the humor from this game is not for everyone, I actually laughed out loud at some dialogues. They REALLY enjoy breaking the 4th wall in this game. The Shopkeeper is a pretty funny guy, too. You can tell that the developers actively tried to insert as many funny stuff as possible in this game.\n\nAll in all, this game was a great find, I'm very glad I bought it!", "timestamp_created": 1635088972, "timestamp_updated": 1635088972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101536763": {"recommendationid": "101536763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231949660", "num_games_owned": 395, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1685091875}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Fun 2D platformer/metroidvania with legitimately funny writing and a really cool mechanic.\n\nWith fun gameplay, great writing, and great music and art, the Messenger is a brilliant game.\nA lot of area variety and mechanics, especially a mechanic which lets you travel seamlessly through time, changing the aesthetic and music from 8bit to 16bit.

"playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1633719898}, "language": "english", "review": "This game emulates the 8-bit and 16-bit experience a little TOO closely, in my opinion. Right down to grating music and graphical glitches. Enemies forget they are dead the moment they leave the screen. Menus are clunky and annoying to navigate. \n\nAnd if you die, you may have to backtrack through 2 or 3 rooms to get back to where you were.\n\nThose are just minor complaints, however. I have two big complaints:\n\n---\n\nFirst, the game doesn't speak a consistent \"language\" when it comes to exploration. \n\nFor example, sometimes you can climb up a wall off the top of the screen and it will take you to a new room. Great. Other times, you climb a wall, expecting to go to a new room at the top and you are greeted with invisible walls you can't grip, or you bump your head on something off-screen. Lame.\n\nEven worse, there is this graphical pattern they USUALLY put above pits that lets you know you will die if you fall down them. If you're sharp and notice the pattern is missing, you can sometimes find secret rooms. Great! But SOMETIMES the death-pattern is missing, so you jump off expecting a secret room AND THEN YOU DIE ANYWAY. \n\nW. T. F.\n\nIf falling ALWAYS made you die, it wouldn't be a problem. But it's inconsistent. And they've littered secret Power Seals all over the place, so you have to be attentive and explore every nook and cranny to find branching paths. \n\nRandom beatings totally kill the spirit of exploration and curiosity.\n\n---\n\nSecondly, they overload the control scheme too much. This is the biggest reason I'm giving this a \"Not Recommended.\"\n\nA jumps. While in the air, you can attack something and then hit A again to jump. So far, so good. It's a clever system, and I like it. There's also an upgrade that restores your jump when you get hit. No problem there.\n\nBut then you get an upgrade that lets you glide by, guess what, hitting and then holding A in the air. Not only that, but you can't simply hold A to jump and then glide. No, you have to explicitly press A a second time while in the air and then hold it. If your jump gets restored mid-air (because you hit something or got hit), it's impossible to glide without using your jump because they're on the same button.\n\nYou might see where this is going. There's too much stuff on A. With all those conditions attached, it can be hard to predict what your character will do when things get fast-paced, leading to frantic button-mashing.\n\nFor example, you might hit A and hold it, expecting to glide, but you just fall instead because you forgot to press A a second time. Or you might hit A and hold it to glide, but it actually jumps without gliding instead because you attacked something recently. Or all you want to do hit, jump, hit, jump, but you keep randomly gliding when you don't want to.\n\nDid I mention that gliding changes the direction of your attack, which can make you plummet to your death because you missed what you were attacking so your jump didn't get restored?\n\nWhat a mess. The optimal strategy is to mash buttons and hope for the best. I hate it.\n\nThey could fix this by assigning Glide to a different button. And just making it always glide when the button is held down.\n\nThere are other things I hate about the controls, too. Like if you press left or right and then jump while your analog stick is angled even a TINY BIT down, it might make you drop off a wall instead of jumping\u2014or drop through a thin platform. Really unexpected.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, not everything is bad about this game. The grappling hook is quite fun, for example. Some of the dialog is clever.

You battle your way through a few different areas with a boss battle at the end of each area, slowly revealing the plot to you as you move along.\n\nOnce you get to a certain point though the game opens up in true \"metroidvania\" style and that's when the fun begins. The world is pretty large and there's definitely a fair amount of backtracking but between the tight controls and the handful of skills and traversal techniques you unlock along the way, this game never fails to make you feel like a total badass as you hack and slash, jump, grapple, cloudstep and swim through the world.\n\nThe game also has a pretty amazing soundtrack and an entertaining and comical cast. It's fairly well written and the story doesn't fail to compel you even up to the very end. \n\nThere is a new game + but I don't really foresee myself playing this again with the massive backlog of games in my steam library but some might see fit to make several playthroughs. \n\nI really enjoyed this one and would definitely like to see more from this developer.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1633299240, "timestamp_updated": 1633299240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100398128": {"recommendationid": "100398128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311267097", "num_games_owned": 913, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 1437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1238, "last_played": 1633307765}, "language": "english", "review": "When I opened the Messenger for the very first time, I heard, saw and felt that 8bit classic UI and music and I was surprised at first but then no more, but rather I became nostalgic and impressed by how the game starts off and by its UI especially and even the initial cutscenes which were made using the same technology, that kind of intro made me feel so relaxed and at ease, it was very nice. Fast forward a few minutes to when you get to play and that feeling of relaxation becomes a feeling of anticipation, excitement, and eagerness to just see more and just play the game, it was a mystical way to start a video game and sure enough, the more you want the more the Messenger provides!\n\n\nTo start things off, I just want to say that this game is incredible, great in almost every way a Metroidvania can be in my opinion (a balance between being a platformer and a Metroidvania). The music in this game steals the lights and charms the audience, it's so energetic, fitting, and vigorous and I think the music alone deserves its separate review.\n\nThe Messenger wants you to finish your mission with a smile on your face and it does that by having a beautiful sense of humor throughout the game, entertaining NPCs, and the famous shopkeeper, the cornerstone of our mission.\n\nAs a ninja, you are tasked with an impossible task, to BE the messenger and do what messengers do, to deliver a message, to carry meaning, to create hope, and to accept responsibility, and I think one - arguably important - way to interpret the message of this game is how a team's hard work can pay off and how creatives we humans can be, such as the people behind this game because the Messenger is the embodiment of creativity and beauty.\n\nWhen you play a ninja game, the expectations of the game should be to feel like a ninja and to play like one, and surely it's the case here, the movement is swift, smooth, and keeps on changing and evolving. Now you add to that some of the best dramatic, absolute fire of soundtracks, and you have got a gem of a video game in those two aspects on your hands. The music just goes way too well with the gameplay it's a miracle of a combination in this regard.\n\nThe Messenger is all about moving fast and doing ninja stuff in a world where time and space are relative, and with how Metroidvanias work in terms of upgrades and progressing, I found myself set for what I called in this game the \"when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in\" experience which was kind of my experience, every time I thought that this game can't possibly have any more content or do any new stuff the game would just prove me wrong one time after another and that was done always in such a refreshing manner that it's nearly impossible to feel stale or bored throughout the game.\nTo think about that how those small indie games have such a significant amount of content and a full of life content with no repetition or blind duplication makes you think about what are the big and AAA companies doing out there?\n\nThe Messenger takes place in many environments and worlds, and it varies in its difficulty based on the world you are in. Some of those worlds have bosses to beat and what's fun about those bosses is that they aren't all just the bad guy to beat and that there's more to it than just beating them. All of that aside, the bosses' fights are hard, challenging but fair and they are affected by your skills and how well you know the game and can use your tools set and furthermore, the bosses being not just the raw bad guy makes it more interesting and intriguing to beat the boss to see what could possibly happen next... which is pretty much a very short yet a deadly accurate way to describe this game: what could possibly happen next?\n\n\nThe Messenger is an example (among others) of how good those genres are, it's truly incredible how platformers and Metroidvanias are always surprising me game after game of how good they can be, I feel happy as  I write this review, I feel happy for having played the Messenger and I feel happy for being a fan of those genres.\n\nThe biggest things I will miss are the music... and the shopkeeper, of course.\n\nToo good to be real.", "timestamp_created": 1633212388, "timestamp_updated": 1633212388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595034658908843994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100336548": {"recommendationid": "100336548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088582213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1263, "last_played": 1633146834}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played a funny game since Duke Nukem 3D", "timestamp_created": 1633136820, "timestamp_updated": 1633136820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100284124": {"recommendationid": "100284124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028345784", "num_games_owned": 1031, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4841, "last_played": 1694679339}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: \n+ Beautiful level design\n+ Incredible soundtrack\n+ Best speedrun community of any game (full disclosure, I'm an Admin there, but honestly it doesn't need much administration)\n+ Excellent speedgame for entry level players and experts alike\n+ TIGHT platforming; the game is so smooth and fluent it's a delight to play\n+ Interesting abilities and movement tech\n+ Some stuff I can't mention because it'd be a spoiler\n+ Seriously like 60% of the game is too good to mention!

This is mostly because the argument can be made that the game changes how it progresses halfway through. At first, it already satisfied me with a platformer that had fun level design, boss fights that kept getting better, and especially the smooth controls that feel satisfying to master. Upgrades to the kit of our ninja were relevant at all times, all working together to make cloud stepping work very well. And the game also gives you enough opportunity to master the mechanics, with minimal punishment on death and unlockable abilities that\u2026 may be a bit too helpful, and also very cheap to unlock with the in-game currency. Halfway through the game however, progression switches from a level-to-level basis to a 16-bit Metroidvania with time travel. This gave us the ability to revisit all of the levels but in our own desired order, which was generally fun to do as they hadn\u2019t seen just a graphical upgrade, but entire layout changes. However, the Metroidvania aspect of the game isn\u2019t very good, mostly due to the world being linear instead of interconnected, forcing us to go through entire stages just to reach a destination. It also didn\u2019t really give much of an incentive to explore beyond the required story-locked upgrades that are only used in a specific part of the world. Granted, I did still have a lot of fun exploring these levels again, especially with the reward gained from the free DLC that, in its own right, was a fun experience for those looking for more content from this game.\n\n[hr]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/764790/The_Messenger/", "timestamp_created": 1632161223, "timestamp_updated": 1689078871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554729998111724854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99625001": {"recommendationid": "99625001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085723595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1993, "last_played": 1623690125}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, I feel like I robbed the developers for the price I paid.", "timestamp_created": 1632060128, "timestamp_updated": 1632060128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99530113": {"recommendationid": "99530113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043651673", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1667111422}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores indies de todos los tiempos!", "timestamp_created": 1631925766, "timestamp_updated": 1631925766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99518475": {"recommendationid": "99518475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014869611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1631837830}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't play much platform games, i didn't even play Meg-man, but i know a good game when i see one.

Its hard to remember what I didn't like about the game at the outset, other than it felt like another throw back ninja game with platforming and old school boss fights. I liked the way the story was playing out and everything, but it didn't suck me in.\n\nFast forward the better part of a year and I picked the game up where I left off, right about in the middle of a difficult area where I needed to go in a direction I'd forgotten, and do the thing with the stuff. Within about 20 or 30 minutes I'd decided the controls really were super responsive, the world was just challenging enough to be hard but not mind-numbingly difficult, and the music was a nice touch.\n\nThis game wasn't really what I thought it was going into it, and there are likely plenty of other reviews that either praise or lament the fact that at some point the player's experience changes. So let's just say if you want a super linear story line with no sense of humor and just generic game play, look elsewhere.\n\nWhat you're getting into in The Messenger is half platforming combat and half puzzle / treasure hunt. There's fun upgrades that make the game both easier and your character more able to get around in the world, and there are plenty of difficult sections if you want to test out your skills. As noted, the controls are good and it's few and far between the moments you can blame anything other than yourself and your own game play for a death.\n\nBiggest gripes are that some of the things you're asked to collect through arduous skill puzzles aren't really worth it, and that if you're not dying a ton you can upgrade everything reasonably early on. The game isn't reliant on, and does not in any way need, the special items you can get, so just playing through and making sure your base gear is as topped up as you'd like it is enough. \n\nBuy this game if you like 2d, retro style platforming games, especially because this game has looks from the NES and SNES era, a soundtrack to match, and will scratch that itch. The combat isn't the hardest thing ever, but some dedication to actually knowing how to use a 2d sword helps. You'll enjoy this game if you give it time to do its thing, are great at getting around in the world, and if you use a controller versus say, keyboard and mouse.\n\nDon't buy this game if you don't like dying a bunch if you're not a platforming pro, if you're not into retro style games, or if you don't like having a fetch quest in a part of the world you've already been to. You'll be asked to do some back tracking, and if you have zero patience for anything this one might start off too slowly to keep your interest.\n\nIf one was going to summarize the message that's being delivered here in this game it would likely have to be something about how games can entertain you and challenge you even if they look like they're a throw back to another era.", "timestamp_created": 1631697981, "timestamp_updated": 1631697981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99356413": {"recommendationid": "99356413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017320610", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 1354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1635446729}, "language": "english", "review": "at first i thought i liked this game because it was a quick fun 8-bit platformer with tight controls and a high skill ceiling.\nbut when i thought i reached the end suddenly the game goes PSYCHE!\nand turns into a massive 16-bit metroidvania with exploration, and deep mechanics\n\nthis game kicks major ass\n\nalso the talks with the shopkeeper are A+ writing", "timestamp_created": 1631647200, "timestamp_updated": 1631647200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493734508752822876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99312489": {"recommendationid": "99312489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139719418", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1632802449}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10", "timestamp_created": 1631573901, "timestamp_updated": 1631573901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99311575": {"recommendationid": "99311575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394273098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1005, "last_played": 1678824858}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un t\u00edtulo muy entretenido, dificultad justa si te gustan los retos, controles muy bien logrados y una m\u00fasica pegadiza como las de anta\u00f1o.

After seeing this game make The Completionist's Top 10 Indie Games list, I knew this had to be something special. It took me over a year, but I finally got around to playing this game. And man, I didn't pick a better time to play this game. The message in this game is just what I needed to hear right now at this point in my life. I was seriously really surprised how relevant the messages were to me in this specific moment. I will try take the lessons I learned from this game with me through the rest of my life.\n\nAside from the story/message, the gameplay is near PERFECT. The movement is really satisfying. My only issue is the entire game seemed kinda... easy. There were a few bosses that challenged me but none I couldn't beat within 5 tries. But overall, I liked it. It was a nice game to breeze through and enjoy. Not to say the game didn't have its hard moments. The DLC in particular was a bit harder, and there was a boss I spent a good 30 minutes trying to beat. But don't get me started on some of these achievements. The \"Star Messenger\" achievement took me over an hour to get, it was by far the hardest part of the game. It's almost too hard, like it contrasts with the rest of the game because of how hard it is. But the feeling of adrenaline finally getting the achievement was totally worth it. The \"I Swear It's My First Time\" achievement was pretty challenging too, in a fun way. Took me about 20 minutes with the help of a guide. Granted, I had to replay almost half the game to get to it, but by then I'd learned all the controls so it didn't take long. It was actually really fun to go back and start from the beginning, just to see how much better I'd gotten at the game. I only died a few times getting there.\n\nOverall, the game is really good.

Sabotage bills themselves as a team dedicated to making modern games that remind us of what we loved about games of the 80s and 90s, and if you're old enough to remember playing the NES and SNES when they were new, you'll find a kindred spirit in the people at Sabotage. \n\nThe Messenger does very accurately evoke what a great NES/SNES game felt like, but is also bursting with creativity and original ideas, fulfilling Sabotage's mission of bridging retro and modern. You probably already know the central conceit of The Messenger - the fact that it shifts from 8-bit to 16-bit and back again- and the 8-bit portion really does feel like a great game from the NES era. The 16-bit portion really does look and feel like a great SNES game. The way they're married together, the mechanics involved, and the game's self-aware meta-referential sense of humor are distinctly modern. \n\nAs I said, this game kept surprising me. Every time I thought I knew what it was, it twisted again. But what really keeps you going forward is the action platforming gameplay. Showing that they do truly understand classic games, Sabotage knows that what really makes games fun is that they're.. fun to play. Fun comes first. The Messenger starts out with quite a simple set of controls and commands, and slowly adds more and more complexity with new abilities to suit new obstacles. Then it mixes and remixes everything you've learned to keep challenging you. The controls become intuitive, and you continue to adapt to new environments. \n\nI found the difficulty to be pretty much spot-on. There were both platforming challenges and boss fights that took me many tries to complete, but always seemed doable. The game is not easy, but not unfair. Most of the time, it took me just the right amount of time to pass a challenge room or a boss. \n\nThis truly is a love letter to classic games, but it is not short on new ideas. Sabotage's follow-up, Sea of Stars, currently in development, shows the same sensibility; a deep love for classic games, along with a trove of great new ideas. Looking forward to seeing what these guys do in the future.

Siempre a\u00f1or\u00e9 los juegos de anta\u00f1o y pensaba que ya ninguno pod\u00eda conseguir lo que ha conseguido The Messenger porque he jugado algunos videojuegos indie modernos de estilo retro pero ninguno se ha acercado a mi coraz\u00f3n tanto como este.\n\nJuega The Messenger y alimenta tu esp\u00edritu ninja. \u00a1Ahora!\n", "timestamp_created": 1627425410, "timestamp_updated": 1630861837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548700809478759766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96467035": {"recommendationid": "96467035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198957921881", "num_games_owned": 548, "num_reviews": 374, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 592, "last_played": 1627510555}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] \ud835\udd40\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd64 \ud835\udd6a\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd63 \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd66\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd5f \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd60 \ud835\udd54\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd6a \ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd64\ud835\udd54\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd60\ud835\udd5d\ud835\udd5d, \ud835\udd5e\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd58\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd63! [/h1]\n\nSomething terrible happened to the Ninja Village during a normal, \"training day\"... As you, a nameless ninja, are training with your friends, having fun, throwing shurikens at one another, you hear a THWAP... and then suddenly, everything you've ever known changed in a blink of an eye. DEMONS, invading your village, killing your friends, and just as you reach for the Ninja Elder, he falls down with one last request... To take a scroll to the highest peak. As you're saved by a hero, you embark on a journey that's serious... Seriously hilarious haha! It actually is.\n\nYou play as The Messenger, a nameless ninja who's tasked with taking a scroll to the highest peak... And as you're doing that, you might feel frustrated because of paths you cannot reach, or pits you can't jump over to see what's on the other intriguing side... Do NOT fret, as the game is split into two parts: The first part is a linear platformer while only after beating a Demon General do you actually see the game for what it really is: A MASTERPIECE. You also meet an enigmatic shopkeeper that is specialized in jokes... and he's as comic as he is mysterious -- Well, he will also upgrade your talents for Time Shards. Gameplay-wise, the game involves, at first, a lot of grappling hooks, a lot of climbing, a lot of slashing demons, throwing shurikens and obliterating bosses... Then comes the second half with the game-mechanic that actually changes the ENTIRE gameplay: Timeshifting... You'll find yourself timeshifting to reach those high places and discover more collectibles. Also, to advance the second half of the game, you'll have to switch time then find key spots to gather some key items and prevent some terrible events to happen in the Future; the future that you can then shift into and go see these events NOT unfold. \n\nThe pixel-art is something to behold here; it's amazing and helps contrast the Past from the Future as when your Ninja is in the past, the graphics look more like NES, while when he goes to the Future, they are more like SNES graphics. It's really well-done.\n\nThis game is the best pixel-art platformer I've had the pleasure to play on Steam. It's a 10/10 game and I got it full price and have NEVER regretted it. It's an underrated gem with maybe a clich\u00e9d story but very original mechanics and environments that change with time. Also, the Shopkeeper is funnier that most \"comedians\" these days, it also helps that there is no voice-acting. One could just say that the game was perfectly made.

They even did a free DLC for it which you can access once you have completed the main game, there's also new game plus which I wont spoil the additions but it adds to the replayability.\n\nIf there was something I could see that would be a beneficial addition to this game is if they had the time to develop it is an additional boss rush mode so you can redo those fights as some are really enjoyable but a lot are locked behind new game plus if you do want to re-do them.\n\nAnother addition that would be nice whether via dlc or the next game is having another character story, I wont spoil for those who havent played it but there's a character you meet further down the line who you have a fight against, it would be interesting to learn more about them but I can see why they may not have done that with this as it would take the spotlight away from the character you play as. That's not to say another character is needed, the game is incredibly fun as is but just a thought more than anything.\n\nAnyway if you liked those old school ninja games, and like some good retro music would highly recommend, its one of my favourite games i have played this year :)\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1626212318, "timestamp_updated": 1626212318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95664417": {"recommendationid": "95664417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335252776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1029, "last_played": 1679141971}, "language": "english", "review": "This is literally the funniest game I had played in my life. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1626184287, "timestamp_updated": 1626184287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95643013": {"recommendationid": "95643013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033625323", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1626145046}, "language": "english", "review": "Had a blast playing this game and really enjoyed the writing and boss fights.

This review has some SPOILERS.\n\nThe first half of the game is a pretty good Ninja Gaiden-like game, but the second half is kind of a poor metroidvania that reuses the levels and enemies of the first half.  Except those mostly linear levels were designed for a different kind of gameplay, it just doesn't work in a metroidvania style.  You get only one new traversal ability in the second half and it is used once outside of the level where you get it.  This is a problem because good metroidvanias make traversing old areas again fun by giving you new traversal abilities or changing the enemies.  This doesn't happen here and all that pointless backtracking you do in the second half is a chore as a result.\n\nThe bosses all tend to have long phases where you can't damage them.  So you just end up waiting (sometimes minutes it feels like) for the chance to deliver a few attacks before you get stuck in the no-damage phase again.  This makes the fights feel rather long and repetitive.\n\nThe writing is pretty good and a lot of the jokes land well, but there is little dialogue in the second half of the game, and the final boss is introduced in an agonisingly long lore dump cutscene just before the final dungeon.  It almost feels like the final boss is the writer's DnD character he insisted on plugging in the game because it doesn't relate to the rest of the adventure at all.  It would have been more elegant to weave in little bits of this mystery into the narrative instead of dumping it all in one shot at the end.\n\nThere are 45 special power seals to collect in the game.  Some of those are very obnoxious to get.  Once you have all of them you unlock a better ranged attack.  No cutscene or anything.  And it's so close to the end of the game that you will have few opportunities to use it.  It was a completely letdown.\n\nSo as you see there's just a ton of little things like that that sour the experience.  I really wanted to like this game and I'm a big fan of including a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois langage option, but I was ultimately left pretty disappointed.\n\nThe music is really awesome though.", "timestamp_created": 1626029936, "timestamp_updated": 1626029936, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506310939788818359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95548281": {"recommendationid": "95548281", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085854003", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1659211330}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si te lo recomiendo con los soundtrack una buena historia y un elenco XD", "timestamp_created": 1626020496, "timestamp_updated": 1626020496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95503782": {"recommendationid": "95503782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289932706", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1256, "last_played": 1626245142}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1625961916, "timestamp_updated": 1625961916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95486438": {"recommendationid": "95486438", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013299486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 795, "last_played": 1625935982}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]APPETIZER[/u]\n\n\nWhat else can be said about this [i]almost[/i] perfect game!\n\nIt has everything!

There aren't too many types and expect to encounter the ones at the beginning of the game appearing even in the final stages of your first playthrough.\n\nThis is not as detrimental as it sounds since the game's emphasis is more on platforming than anything else. Monsters are mainly there to provide an additional challenge, keep the balance of action/platforming fresh, or work as jump off points using your 'Cloudstep' ability in order to traverse through the different stages/levels.\n\n[u]Final Note:[/u]  If you're not into retro 2D action platformers or metroidvania esque games, then I would suggest you pass on this one.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b] \u2013 Almost everything about this game is executed flawlessly and with passion.

There is so much content, I've spent over 20 hours in the game, beat it, got all the collectables and there's still more to offer. For the completionists, the achievements aren't grindy, in fact, you can do all of them in a single play-through, if you're smart enough, except one or two which require new game plus. Speaking of which, new game plus is actually a really fun way to experience the game again, unlike a lot of games, it can actually completely change how you approach the game by letting you keep all the items and if you take \"THE DEAL\" then it can be very challenging.\n\nI went The Messenger completely blind, I bought it on a whim.

Has a good sense of humor, amazing music, and really awesome sprite work for both the 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the world. Solid game play albeit a bit difficult at times. My two biggest issues with the game is the amount of backtracking you have to do to get 100% and how after fully upgrading your gear, money stops having a real use. About halfway through, the game becomes a metroidvania, giving you free reign to explore all the areas, uncover new ones, and gives you some fast travel stations to help get around. My issue is that the fast travel hub only has 6 stations and this is simply not enough IMO. The fast travel points are spread out pretty far apart in the world so, sometimes you'll have to backtrack through one or two whole levels just to get to an item you couldn't get to before. At first it isn't so bad but by the end it really starts to drag. As for the not having things to spend money on, around half way into my playthrough I was able to fully upgrade everything. The game acknowledges this and jokes about it, adding a literal money sink to the shop, wherein you can spend money on little figures of enemies that get displayed in the shop, a neat addition but, still not worth spending money on. The game does this a few times actually, where it will acknowledge a flaw the game has and joke about it, but doesn't really fix the flaw. Another example being the shopkeeper makes a joke about the wall climbing claws and how sometimes when you're trying to just fall straight down you'll cling to the wall instead. Not a huge issue, since overall the game is very polished but, I do find it odd that they didn't just fix these issues instead of making jokes about them. All in all, its a very solid game, the highlights being the visuals, the soundtrack(Seriously the music is godly) and the dialogue, while the backtracking is probably the biggest issue I have. Would give it a solid 8/10 if I had to rate it, and I think even at full price for $20 its worth picking up.", "timestamp_created": 1625460929, "timestamp_updated": 1625460929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95062766": {"recommendationid": "95062766", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138624410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1641051810}, "language": "english", "review": "great game! highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1625432714, "timestamp_updated": 1625432714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95054418": {"recommendationid": "95054418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066349554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1625424155}, "language": "english", "review": "Really solid, 8/10\nMoving feels a little slow towards the end though, makes backtracking a bit of a pain.", "timestamp_created": 1625424256, "timestamp_updated": 1625424256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95041558": {"recommendationid": "95041558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388390539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1681930099}, "language": "english", "review": "Paperboy 7 is a very fun game and it is very different to the other Paperboy games in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1625411895, "timestamp_updated": 1625411895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95030602": {"recommendationid": "95030602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368688694", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1627688773}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Retro feel and music + really fun gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1625401821, "timestamp_updated": 1625401821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95027322": {"recommendationid": "95027322", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971095972", "num_games_owned": 930, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1625396948}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a humorous and nostalgic game, and I loved it at first.

I had the luxury of playing the game completely blind, because I bought it on Humble Bundle, looked at two or three screenshots, then decided to redeem it. What I thought was going to be another cheap indie pixel platformer turned into one of the most fun games that I've played in years.\nI'll say this, if you find the game interesting from the screenshots alone, don't bother reading reviews, you'll get MUCH more out of the game playing it knowing as little as possible.\n\nThe graphics are very similar to something like Shovel Knight where they mimic the old retro styles, but updating them ever so slightly. Making them look like how we think we remember an old NES game like Ninja Gaiden looked like back when we first played it.\n\nThe gameplay is insanely solid. One of the best feeling platformers I've played in a long time. My only issue is with the wall climbing. There's one glitch that happens frequent enough that I tried to avoid wall climbing as much as possible: Sometimes you just get stuck, you can jump off and reset, but it just feels bad when you cling onto a wall then hold up, but just stay in place when you're in the middle of the wall.\n\nNow, probably my favorite part of game was the music. I'm not a music critic so I don't really have the vocabulary to explain why I like the music as much as I do, but what I can say is that, outside of Hideki Naganuma's work, I haven't actively searched out the soundtrack for a game like this since Dustforce.\n\nMy biggest complaints mainly just come from the DLC. I didn't like the surfing minigame, the totem boss had an instant kill that roadblocked me for almost a half hour, the last half of the DLC just isn't all that fun to play, and the DLC unlike the main game wasn't designed as a metroidvania, but instead as a normal linear platformer.

The messenger is an interesting combination of classic ninja gaiden and a metroidvania \n\nthe game honestly starts out nearly perfect, the movement throughout is super fun and fast pace allowing the player to fly from screen to screen if they're fast enough,  Another strength of the early game is the character dialogue.  While it doesnt happen super often, any interaction you have with the shopkeep is always pure gold.\n\nThe games level design and boss fights perfectly complement the awesome movement. Each boss is completely unique and adds something new to keep the game interesting.  All the levels are awesome to speed through, each element feels like it is placed with a purpose which makes each room feel different from the rest\n\nThe downside of the game is the second half (bar the final area/boss).  At the second half, the game suddenly switches to a metroidvania, (the first half was not), and somewhat drops what made the first half work.  The dialogue between you and the shop keep all but disappears, and while the movement stays the same, the general game play slows down quite a bit, turning into a bit of a collectathon.

I'm never jumping again.  I think I've fallen into more pits here than in every other game combined.  \n\nBig pits. Little pits. High pits, low pits.  \n\n[i]Pits of lava and pits of ice, pits with blades that rend and slice.  \n\nDrowned in rivers of pristine blue, and sank in bogs of quicksand, too.  \n\nCrept carefully 'round the pits of slime, yet still fell in them every time.\n\nI'd scaled mountains, touched the stars. \n\n'Midst twists and turns I'd climbed so far!\n\nYet slid upon the snow, and then\n\nI plummeted back down again. [/i]\n\nI remember playing Ninja Gaiden when I was a kid.  I died a lot in that, too, but it kept you going with cinematic cutscenes which were pretty novel for the time.  The story made you want to find out what happened next, which helped you to push through all of the cheap deaths and level restarts.  Point is, if you're going to make a punishing game--especially these days, when there are so many options--you've got to give us a good reason to stick around.\n\nI'm not so sure they do that here.  \n\nThey don't even really tell you what's going on until the very end.  The rest of the time it's all just played for laughs and the characters you meet are only there to deliver fourth-wall-breaking riffs, like one of those Twitter threads where everyone's trying to show off how snarky and clever they can be and nobody cares about anything they're saying.  It's a very self-indulgent sort of style.  \n\nLook, if you want to make a retro tribute to Ninja Gaiden or something, then just do it, keeping in mind that those games at least tried to tell real stories that fit the nature of the setting.  That's what Axiom Verge did with Metroid.  You don't need to keep reminding us how savvy and genre-aware and above-it-all you are.  Yeah, there can be comic relief, but it's supposed to be exactly that: a break from otherwise meaningful events.  When every character is a joke, it just spoils the immersion.\n  \nOr if you want to go the other route and make an affectionate parody of old video game conventions, that's fine too.  In fact, there's a brilliant idea perfectly suited to that purpose at the heart of this game: using different eras in graphics to tell a time travel story.   (They should have focused on that and explored it much further.)  Then you can be as wacky as your heart desires; but in that case you really need to stay in better contact with the player.  It's hard to maintain a light, funny vibe while you're sending us off to the pits for long, lonely stretches of torture.  \n\nThere's a part near the end when all of a sudden they take off the clown nose and expect us to sit through a long straight-faced cutscene, and all I could think was, \"wait, am I supposed to be taking this seriously now?  It's a little late for that.\" \n     \nThese two sides of the game clash terribly with one another. They don't go far enough either way to commit to a course, and as a result never manage to find their voice.  It's too bad, because this really is a creative and ambitious game.  You can only hold players at an ironic distance for so long, though, before they start to lose interest, especially when you're beating the @%#& out of them with your other hand.   \n\nFor all the self-conscious irony of the story, the gameplay is all business.  It starts off so easy that you wonder whether that's part of the joke, too; but after a while the difficulty goes through the roof and mostly stays there.  Their main thing is this ability where you hit stuff in midair and spring off of it to jump farther.  You're going to be doing that a lot, and most of the tougher platforming sections revolve around pushing it to the extreme while giant pits yawn beneath you.  \n\nYou do see quite a bit of improvement in your skill over the course of the game, but overall the challenges feel like they're more about memorization and setting you up to fall into sneaky traps than straight-up pushing you to master a set of abilities.  It dampens the sense of any payoff for all of your efforts, like no matter what you do they're going to find a way to screw you.    \n\nFor example, there's one level where you have to escape from this huge monster and if you hesitate the slightest bit at any point you have to start all over.  It's filled with obstacle after obstacle, all calibrated down to the micron to trick and frustrate.  \n\nYou'd expect that kind of deviousness in a slower-paced puzzle-platformer, but in an action game like this--especially once you have to start backtracking all over the map--it ends up feeling like you're spending hours in stop-and-go traffic.\n\nThe results speak for themselves.  I was once a sane man; but fall into one too many pits, and next thing you know I'm rhyming like Dr. Seuss to vent my frustration.  \n\n[i]Now gather 'round and hear the lesson of my sorry tale:\n\nAll ye who seek to play this game must be prepared to fail.

You can tell a lot of heart and soul went into this game, but not all is positive.\n\nThe art and music are fantastic and the general gameplay flow is smooth. You move, you jump, you have a melee attack and can throw a shuriken. If you hit an enemy while in the air, you get an additional jump and this can chain infinitely. It's a speedrunners dream and moving through the stages and levels is fun.\n\nHalfway through, the game suddenly transitions into a metroidvania, and that is where it gets annoying. To progress (and find collectibles), you need to do a lot of backtracking, visit the same screens over and over and just generally waste a lot of time walking. Fast travel is only there in limited form, so that means, again, more walking. My question though is: why? I mean, the game was fine as a linear platformer. Why does it have to transition into a metroidvania(-like) halfway through?\n\nIt doesn't even make much sense. You only get one additional ability during that time that only opens up one thing. The only reason you can now get collectibles you didn't get previously is because the time portals now opened up, and some paths are only open in one time. I feel like that isn't really the point of a Metroidvania - isn't the point of those games to get earlier collectables or paths that you couldn't previously get by using later equipment or abilities? There is a clear structure and inspiration of those games, but nothing in place that made those games fun.\n\nThe jump from linear to open world is somewhat jarring and doesn't add too much to the game overall, aside from two new areas. It just seems to pad the game length for no good reason, as the game is somewhat short even with that in place. It took me about 8 hours or so to finish the game with all collectibles and even getting stuck at one point, as one of the items you need to continue is not at all obvious and you either need to use Google to figure out how to start the process or get lucky. Or pay ingame money for a hint, I guess, though I did not try that.\n\nOverall, the game is really good, but it does have a few frustrating points. The gorgeous art and music and flowing gameplay contrasts harshly with the pointless metroidvania-like second half (with all the fun of those kind of games removed) and some frustrating boss fights that stretch on for too long, especially later on.

It is much more.\n\nIt tells the story of you, the \"messenger\" chosen from a ninja village when the world is threatened by a demon attack. You have been given the task to deliver a scroll to ultimately save the world. \n\nAs you traverse along the world, you pick up some necessary abilities and fight some bosses. These bosses have some nice designs, but some in the first areas are pretty simple.\n\nNow where does this game stand out? For starters, the dialogue is hilarious. The shopkeeper NPC in this game has incredible lines and stories that have legitimately made me laugh out loud. The shopkeeper is one of my favorite NPC's in any game, probably just beaten by Sans from Undertale. The self-aware humor is great and just what I love. It's only sad that these conversations with the shopkeeper seem to diminish towards the end of the game, where they happen only sporadically.\n\nThe OST is great and it sounds just like old 8-bit tracks. Especially the one for Quillshroom Marsh, which is so fire that even the mushrooms in the area start singing along to the song sometimes (lol).\n\n!Spoiler warning past this point!\n\nNow this is great and all, but where the real love for this game comes from, is that it literally switches genres about halfway through. Yes. At the point where it seems like you're going to defeat the final boss, the game becomes a metroidvania. You travel into the future and then, the game switches from 8-bit to 16-bit. Now from this point on, you can go back to the areas that you have already traversed to pick up quest items. There is even a hilarious scene where the shopkeeper reveals that the scroll you were set out to deliver was actually the map for the game.\n\nIn the areas where you've already been, there are now these portals that let you switch from the 16-bit future to the 8-bit past and vice versa, which means that they had to make the entire map twice. Incredible. The way this was implemented had me saying \"wow\" to myself for some minutes.\n\nThe metroidvania aspects of the game are very well fleshed out and some boss fights even incorporate the dimension-switching which was really slick. \n\nThe Messenger is an incredible indie experience and I can't believe I didn't review this before, as this is a sleeper hit, and I'm HYPED for Sea of Stars, developed by the same people that made this, set to release in 2022.\n\nIn conclusion, the way this game just blew me away and surpassed my expectations will forever stick with me, as this is a top-10 game for me (at least as of right now) \n\nIf you want to try out a great indie game, give this a try. You won't regret it.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1621453589, "timestamp_updated": 1621453589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92267806": {"recommendationid": "92267806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198804067398", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1055, "last_played": 1621376295}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a gamer moment.", "timestamp_created": 1621447269, "timestamp_updated": 1621447269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92238977": {"recommendationid": "92238977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068826679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 275, "last_played": 1621742545}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is infuriating, but rewarding.

Paying homage to the legend of the past Ninja Gaiden on NES. It has very witty writing with a lot of \"4th wall breaking\" elements, intertwining game mechanics with the story, which actually surprised me, as I followed the story more closely than I usually do in this kind of games, as I\u2019m more of a mechanics kind of guy, who doesn\u2019t care that much about the plot.\nThe difficulty level/ curve is, I would say, right in the middle, or maybe slightly above, as I didn't find it hard to progress. It never really made me grind the levels, but on the certain points I had to retry couple more times that I would like to admit, until I learned how to do it properly. The game never felt unfair and my character deaths resulted more from me making mistakes, rather than something forced by unjust game design. Which actually made me want to learn and master the game more. The bosses are fun to challenge, with attack patterns being clearly defined, so you don\u2019t have to pray to Rngesus, just git gud. Maybe some of the early ones being a tad to easy.\nGoing back to 8/16 Bit graphic style is nothing new at this point, but is very well done and has a fantastic music to match, with a fun new gimmick to top it off.\nOverall The Messenger feels like the definition of \"labour of love\", as it is done, in my opinion, by people who understand what an essence of fun was in 2D platformers with \u201cmetroidvania\u201d elements in it, with old mechanics refined and some new ones added on top of that. I purposefully don't want to go in to details, as I had great joy going in blind on my first playthrough.\nHaving said all that praise I should probably point out some bad stuff, but honestly it is really hard without being nitpicky. I think if you don't like this \"wink, wink, nudge, nudge\" sense of humour or you don't like games that require you to learn by repetition, or maybe you require the game to handhold you through it and I really mean arrow pointing the way all the time kind of handholding, because you have in game tools to help you find what to do next (no drawing maps on piece of paper required), then maybe you won't like it.

Baring these few exceptions, the game is really well balanced. \n\nThe Messenger starts out as a fairly straightforward (and solid) Ninja Gaiden-like platformer, but then it opens up into a metroidvania-style game; at first, I was really put off by this transition, and actually stopped playing the game for a while (it just wasn't particularly gripping at the time). However, upon returning to complete it, I found myself having quite a bit of fun tracking down the various secrets and items in the game. \n\nThe DLC is a nice addition, but it is very light on content and it introduced the Voodoo Totem which is by far the game's worst boss fight. The DLC was free content [u]and[/u] it was solid, so, really, one can't complain much.\n\nThe game's story was fine. The humor was hit or miss -- sometimes they relied too much on the kind of silly billy humor that is typical of the clinically unfunny (I'm sorry, but I don't know what to tell you if you think \"do the thing!\" is funny. It isn't). The game itself is very absurdist -- which is fine, I just don't think it was well executed. So, by the end, I found myself skipping all of the dialogue. In all honesty, had they simply forgone 80% of the dialogue, this aspect of the game would have landed a lot better for me. It felt like they were looking into the camera and winking at the audience every chance they got, which gets old fast, and the game is by no stretch short. \n\nThe game's art direction extremely good; it expertly straddled the line of being playful and cool.  \n\nOverall, The Messenger is an enjoyable experience, and worth the full price of the game -- an absolute steal if it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1620568255, "timestamp_updated": 1620568255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51711803674697876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91695499": {"recommendationid": "91695499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184546629", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 937, "last_played": 1620306218}, "language": "spanish", "review": "uuuusi el mesinger ta weno ete si", "timestamp_created": 1620546898, "timestamp_updated": 1620546898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91668182": {"recommendationid": "91668182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157032368", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2262, "last_played": 1620505687}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best games i have played", "timestamp_created": 1620505735, "timestamp_updated": 1620505735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555440604686737061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91659518": {"recommendationid": "91659518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198817568874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1734, "last_played": 1620510678}, "language": "english", "review": "Just an awesome game, Thank you.", "timestamp_created": 1620495773, "timestamp_updated": 1620495773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91657612": {"recommendationid": "91657612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080632860", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 378, "last_played": 1620493163}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game, btw is easier than ninja gaiden ;)", "timestamp_created": 1620493547, "timestamp_updated": 1620493547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5121498703956604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91642674": {"recommendationid": "91642674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420382912", "num_games_owned": 970, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1620615359}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good", "timestamp_created": 1620476401, "timestamp_updated": 1620476401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91634482": {"recommendationid": "91634482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999798031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1650689462}, "language": "english", "review": "One of bests 8 bit Retro game ever\nI love The Messenger", "timestamp_created": 1620464564, "timestamp_updated": 1620464564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91592844": {"recommendationid": "91592844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972610203", "num_games_owned": 5390, "num_reviews": 166, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 504, "last_played": 1652310494}, "language": "english", "review": "This has quickly become one of my favorite games ever, no lie.

The 8 bit music is amazing, the shopkeeper has hilarious (and philosophical) dialogue options.\n\nAs your journey progresses you get more skills (like a wing-suit, a grappling hook, and more).\n\nOnce you get to the Tower of Time level, however, things start to get interesting. You go 500 years in the future and the 8 bit graphics and music get upgraded to higher quality 16 bit graphics, like you went from Nintendo to Super Nintendo. Same with your character, he gets a fun new sprite. Go a little bit further however... Just when you think you might be at the end of the game... suddenly its a full Metroidvania. You get a map, time portals that switch between the past and future, a bunch of hidden secrets to find, and new power-ups scattered around the map that require thought and full use of your accumulated abilities to get. \n\nIt's a pretty epic game, the writing is great, the plot is great, the level design is great, the music is great.

The Messenger proved that expecting a run of the mill side scrolling experience from developers that know exactly what makes such games go from good to great was a mistake I was happy to discover I made.\n\nFrom the outset, The Messenger appears quite rudimentary as far as gameplay is concerned. Story wise, it\u2019s not what I\u2019d call \u2018original\u2019, but it\u2019s definitely a nice twist on a tried and true formula. Some sprinklings of humorous meta-dialog, some 4th wall breaking, and other surprises were a nice touch. If you\u2019ve played a side scrolling platformer/action game from the 90s you know exactly what to expect\u2026 \n\nUntil you don\u2019t.\n\nOnce the gorgeously animated and visualised pixel art environs soak into your brain, the game seamlessly genre-flips along with a fresher aesthetic coat of paint, which is tied directly to the narrative \u2013 it\u2019s excellently put together and had me slow clapping at a point. There was still room to further explore the idea of mashing the separate aesthetics together mechanically, but suffice it to say that it was totally unique and like nothing I\u2019ve really experienced before.\n\nWhat the game absolutely nails, however, is the music. An absolutely gorgeous soundtrack that is everything a chiptune/Sega Megadrive fanboy would love - thematic, diverse, nostalgic to the max. It\u2019s easy to see it was an integral part of designing The Messenger, something I found really elevated it above other similar offerings.\n\nThe experience is definitely a love letter to games of the era, with flavourings reminiscent of Super Metroid/Castlevania, and side scrolling action games like Shinobi. So with that, you should expect back tracking, some serious platforming, some cool boss fights and secrets/hidden rooms to discover.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished the game, you have the option to jump back in for NG+ for an added challenge and an opportunity to collect things you missed the first time, plus a few extra bonuses, but after 15 odd hours, I\u2019d say I\u2019ve had my fill.\n\nA hidden surprise of a game that took me far too long to get onto, with layers of design depth I never considered before.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1619411629, "timestamp_updated": 1619411629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90909272": {"recommendationid": "90909272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106549135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1192, "last_played": 1618959138}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing in every part.\nThe graphics, the music, the dialogues.\nTop notch.", "timestamp_created": 1619371337, "timestamp_updated": 1619371337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501510560512542725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90905567": {"recommendationid": "90905567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008652777", "num_games_owned": 780, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1075, "last_played": 1619366602}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good story.

The level design is great and varied. The writing is funny and clever. The music is the best videogame soundtrack I've heard since Furi. At about fifteen hours to complete, it's pretty much the perfect length, too.

Not only does it do this fantastically well, it also keeps surprises hidden that will continue to keep you chasing bosses and secrets until the final credits roll, and even further into the free DLC expansion offered up.\n\nAs most other reviews (and the game's description) will tell you, The Messenger is deceptive with the original style of game being a 2D platformer being thrown out the window only about 4 hours into the game, maybe a bit more or less depending on your skill level. It then takes this simple premise of going from screen to screen in standard 2D platformer fashion and flips that concept on its head, turning the game and all the previous areas you've explored into a full-featured metroidvania where hopping between time rifts teleports you from the past to the future and back again all while making minor changes in the world that might require a specific time period. It continues to expand as well, as there are more areas to unlock after you make the jump to metroidvania, so you aren't just retreading the same ground as you already did. Most aspects to the gameplay change are really interesting, from the improved graphics to higher quality music and more, with The Messenger doing a really good job of making both time periods. There are also some fantastic setpieces and bosses that play with the time period hopping, some of which are visual feasts just as much as they are skill tests. However with this change, while extremely interesting and to my knowledge, unique, is one that I also feel is pretty polarizing. There is a certain charm to the game that is a bit lost by the fact that you may need to backtrack through certain sections over and over again, and the game doesn't feel as well-crafted as a proper metroidvania does at certain times and there absolutely is a kneejerk reaction of annoyance for sure when your next objective is two areas away from the nearest fast travel portal and not even a new area at that. Its not all bad though, as exploring some of these previous areas in the future time period offers a surprising charm that alleviates some of the woe, and even exploring other newer areas in the past time period offers the same charm.\n\nApart from the issue of backtracking and the oddly infrequent fast travel points, The Messenger has a few flaws, but none of which that I would say should stop anyone from experiencing this game. My only other real gripe with the game comes from the fact that I think that the game suffers a small amount from not being built from the ground up as a metroidvania since there really is only one type of collectible throughout the game, and there are no secret items to collect or secret upgrades to keep you exploring every corner. In fact, you can buy an upgrade with in-game currency that reveals all the collectible locations on your map, pretty much pointing out the only real reason to truly explore. These collectibles do serve a purpose however, unlocking a special upgrade once you've collected all 45 in the game. I did go out of my way to do this, and unfortunately I can't really recommend doing this outside of completion/achievement reasons, since the upgrade isn't nearly as worthwhile as I expected it to be.\n\nDespite some flaws and twists that change the game for the better or worse depending on your view, The Messenger is a uniquely fascinating game that really plays with the notion of what modern \"retro\" games can really be. It definitely deserves all the praise it gets and I think sets an extremely solid groundwork for what a potentially phenomenal sequel could be if the rough edges were filed down just a bit. Anyone who's interested in this game should definitely take the leap and experience one of the most interesting experiences in the modern retro wave and I definitely recommend it wholeheartedly.", "timestamp_created": 1618973812, "timestamp_updated": 1618973883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90650505": {"recommendationid": "90650505", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088346542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1625596979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been awesome!!

So it's story time. Long ago Humanity was almost wiped out due to the appearance of a fierce Army of demons, but the survivors made a cliff side village and trained for a prophecy foretold that the demon army would return.\n\nBut it also told of a hero flying in from the Western Ocean to bring protection and knowledge in the form of a scroll to be delivered by a lone Warrior and that lone warrior would be known as the messenger.\n\nOkay let's talk about the likes about the game, now to start the story is really good on the surface it seems like a simple story basically fight the evil demon king and save the world, but it's actually a lot more profound, which delivers its profoundness through comedy and optional dialogue.\n\nThe comedy in the game is pretty good while not laugh out loud funny, it's very enjoyable especially the shopkeepers dialogue. The characters in the game are really good, even npcs and some boss characters like the Cyclops bros or the queen of quills.\n\nThey're pretty interesting and have some fun dialogue, my two favorite characters have to be the messenger and the shopkeeper they have some pretty funny dialogue.\n\nthe graphic/art style for the game is very, very good especially when you acquire the ability to time travel and you can switch between an NES style to a super famicon style of graphic/art style, the transition to both are quite good and both styles are very good and very nice to look at.\n\nThe game's levels are very good, pretty varied with lots to see and explore with forests, underground caves and mountains and with the ability to shift between 16 bit to 36 bit art styles it opens up whole new pathways to explore.\n\nThe music in the game is really good with a lot of memorable tracks, I also love that when you dive under the water the track changes, but it still stays the same. It\u2019s the same thing when you're switching between 16 bit and 36 bit it's the same theme but change depending on the graphics.\n\nThe action is very good and fun, with plenty of tough bosses and difficult platforming to keep you on edge, the game is hard, but there are also a plenty of save spaces so you don't have to worry about the game being too hard.\n\nThe game is still quite hard especially with some of its bosses like the queen of quills or the demon General but they can be beaten with time and practice and learning their patterns. The enemy and bosses are pretty good they have some interesting designs like that stone Golem from the cave level or the boss at the end of the Tower of time.\n\nThe platforming is pretty good, nice and tight to control especially when you're able to get the glide power. I also love how this game pays respects to other games like Ninja Gaiden while still poking fun at it a bit. The game also has a great DLC called Picnic Panic that lets you play a whole new area and have a whole new story to play after you complete the main game. \n\nBasically all the likes for the DLC is the same for the main game great music, great level design and great Graphic/art style. I will say that I definitely love the final boss fight that was fun and hard.\n\nOkay let's talk about the dislikes and honestly there's not really a lot to dislike about this game, well I do have to say the game and its DLC Panic picnic does end on a pretty big cliffhanger.\n\nAnd there are some parts that are pretty frustrating like the first demon General boss fight and trying to get some of the achievements like the Star Messenger achievement.\n\nNow with that said, The Messenger is a great retro styled Metroidvania action-adventure game, with a really good story, very, very good graphic/art style and really good music. Now if you liked games like Ninja Gaiden I highly recommend getting this game.", "timestamp_created": 1616015136, "timestamp_updated": 1616015170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88598739": {"recommendationid": "88598739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083172777", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1398, "last_played": 1616311806}, "language": "english", "review": "When you hear him say picnic panic............................................................", "timestamp_created": 1616001968, "timestamp_updated": 1616001968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88598337": {"recommendationid": "88598337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066475492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1615956542}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a variety of wonderful locations, nice pixel art, good music, and platforming that's unique and reward skilled players by opening up more possibilities on how to get through a map if you're skilled enough. The writing is funny, and there's an interesting twist partway through that adds a bit of puzzle solving to some sections. There's extra challenges to get collectibles if you really want to push yourself, and there's actually a suitable reward for doing so. I think it's pretty neat.  \n\nHowever, I can't ignore the multiple poor experiences I had with this game. Slight spoilers ahead, this game becomes a metroidvania at some point, and expects backtracking. I don't mind backtracking too much, but the way this game handles it is extremely poor. \n\nFirst off, there's very few fast travel points. Half the areas in the game don't have one, you have to travel to a nearby zone and walk. This includes places that are mandatory to visit more then once, but nope, no nearby fast travel point.  \n\nSecond, the world isn't really cleverly put together like it needs to be for it to work. You don't unlock very many useful shortcuts, and often the map doesn't tell you but there's plenty of sections where it looks like you can get somewhere by your map, but you can't, it's locked or impassable. Combine that with very few fast travel points, and you've got to replay 5~15 minute sections you've already done multiple times to get what you need done. And that's if you don't end up running into a brick wall. Yeah, running into things you can't get past is common in a metroidvania, but this game seems to revel in making these annoying sections leading up to the impassable wall, so you waste time going there, probably waste time figuring out there's no trick and you just need an item (yes, it's not always obvious that an item is absolutely required), and then you have to waste time going back to a checkpoint with a shop. On top of this, the twist often ends up adding some extra annoyances to getting to certain sections.  \n\nThird, your upgrades don't really make early sections that much faster, they're still a chore to navigate. Sometimes you can be a bit clever and make a section faster, but it's up to the level design to let you, and too often it doesn't. On top of that, this game loves instant death mechanics. Crushing, falling into pits, lava...that's not really a \"bad\" thing for a linear platformer, but for a game where you're backtracking a lot? That can quickly get annoying.  \n\nIt's not a bad game. There were a lot of cool sections that I enjoyed. I just think the game trips over itself in the second half, and becomes very annoying when it didn't need to be.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1616001465, "timestamp_updated": 1616001465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516443192958831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88576357": {"recommendationid": "88576357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119324032", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 942, "last_played": 1675563042}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty damn good", "timestamp_created": 1615968641, "timestamp_updated": 1615968641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88570237": {"recommendationid": "88570237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068581349", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 310, "playtime_forever": 1889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1889, "last_played": 1615894289}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Amazing story and gameplay.

If you can't get enough old-school platforming goodness, this will surely scratch the itch; but I can think of so many better examples that deserve the coveted \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" or even \"Very Positive\" rating from steam (most direct comparison being the recently released Cyber Shadow).\n\nThe first half of The Messenger gives you some solid old-school platforming with some interesting enough mechanics and a bumpin' soundtrack. If you've watched the trailer, you'll likely know that one of the main draws of the game is going to be the \"time-travel\" mechanic from 8-bit to 16-bit. It does a few interesting things here and there, but I ultimately found it to be pretty gimmicky, and it didn't keep the gameplay fresh enough to warrant the artificially inflated slog through the last half of the game's mostly recycled content.\n\nIt seems to me the game could have benefited from some way to move faster through the world and make the backtracking feel like less of a chore. The situations in which you can reliably speed up your character are so limited and uninteresting, I just feel like that in combination with the unnecessary padding killed the enjoyment for me.

It features a rather unique take on a typical double jump called \"cloudstepping\" that recovers your jump when you hit an enemy, a projectile or an object before landing, allowing to jump again and again and again if you manage to, thus staying in the air for a long time and feeling like a cool ninja.\n\nAnother unusual trick of this game is that it consists of two distinct halves (though it\u2019s not a 50/50 split in terms of runtime, more like 40/60 or even 30/70, but it\u2019s still sort of like Act 1 and Act 2). The first one plays like a strictly linear, \u201ckeep moving to the right\u201d platformer, while the second one lets you freely roam the old locations and discover their new secrets (as well as paths to some new locations). Metroidvania elements are still pretty light here, and you\u2019re unlikely to get lost or to discover something wholly unexpected, but it does add a fair sense of exploration. I would agree with a common complaint about mild repetitiveness, though, as fast travel points are scarce and the map is not very interconnected, which leaves you to go through some parts over and over again.\n\nHowever, where I think The Messenger shines best is at the base platforming / combat. The aforementioned cloudstepping, along with a few more typical mechanics like propelling yourself forward with a grappling hook or bouncing against enemies from above (and along with just generally well-programmed movement basics), creates a very pleasant gameplay loop. It\u2019s just one of those nice indie games where traversing the levels and slashing away at the enemies feels so smooth and satisfying. I think it\u2019s also a great game for speedrunning, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.\n\nI also really liked the first half of the story, told mostly through optional conversations with the local shopkeeper; it had some witty, self-aware and well-written jokes (the text flows as smooth as the platforming here) and culminated in a seriously cool twist that felt both ridiculously funny and ingeniously planned at the same time. The second half impressed me much less, as it tried to get more serious both with metacommentary (talking about the nature of storytelling but saying nothing particularly interesting or new) and with general worldbuilding (which in the end amounted to a rather typical fantasy backstory awkwardly delivered in a sudden big infodump right before the final level). The shopkeeper also started to feel like an overly blatant author's mouthpiece here. But, honestly, by that time the story had already delivered more than I tend to expect from this kind of games, so I didn't mind such hiccups at all.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty accommodating: if you're experienced with the genre, you'll probably breeze past most of it while feeling good about your skills, but even if not, you're unlikely to get overly frustrated either. The length is just right to not overstay its welcome too: you can complete it in about 12-15 hours, and getting all achievements doesn\u2019t even require a full second playthrough, only a small part of it.\n\nAll in all, The Messenger is a really easy recommendation, and should work well either as a gateway game for the genre newcomers or as a worthy addition to a long list of favorites for the indie veterans.\n\nIf you\u2019re going for all achievements, I recommend looking up \u201cI Swear It\u2019s My First Time\u201d (the only achievement where a guide is pretty much mandatory) once you\u2019re done with \u201cAct 1\u201d; you won\u2019t be spoiled on anything important but will get an extra little challenge that I personally found more fun and less difficult than it looked, and that added a bit of variety to \u201cAct 2\u201d.\n\nAlso, please do try to open the cabinet, repeatedly, unless you are being asked to (in that case, please do try to NOT open the cabinet, repeatedly).", "timestamp_created": 1615664617, "timestamp_updated": 1615664740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698593378067016602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88367650": {"recommendationid": "88367650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018770577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1615648867}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything you want out of an indie game.

The Messenger is so stupidly good, and probably one of my favorite platformers of all time. The Messenger has everything a good 2d platformer, or even game in general, should have. The combat, although simple, is insanely satisfying. Just running and constantly slashing is just so fun. The abilities are all fun and pretty necessary, giving you a reason to want to get them. The story isn\u2019t really that impactful, but it\u2019s memorable and FUN. This is also just one of the *coolest* games, and probably not for the reasons you would think. Unfortunately, talking about it even remotely would spoil it.\n\nThe cloudstep mechanic is one of the best combinations of genius and fun. This is probably one of the most unique gameplay mechanics in this game, and it is SO. GOD. DAMN. FUN. Anything that you can hit, including projectiles, will, when you hit them, give you an extra mid-air jump. This is great for platforming, it's very fun to use, and it can save you from death very simply. This is honestly one of the best platforming mechanics in a while, but unfortunately it would really only work in a game like this. Thankfully this game works with it *extremely* well though.\n\nI mentioned the story and humor before, and they are TOP TIER. In my head at least it has that classic Devolver humor, but I think what I think of as Devolver humor came from this game. The humor is on point, it\u2019s meta, and it\u2019s just really good comedy. I can\u2019t really mention the story without spoiling, but it doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s funny.\n\nGive this game the praise it deserves.\n\nObjective - 8/10;\nSubjective - 8/10;", "timestamp_created": 1615162235, "timestamp_updated": 1616054985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560005664825439453", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87958763": {"recommendationid": "87958763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061378848", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 869, "last_played": 1598039231}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried playing through this game a few times now and it is a lot of fun.... for the first half.
