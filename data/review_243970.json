After finally picking it up on Steam Sale this past summer, I can positively say this is one of Klei Entertainment\u2019s most critically underrated titles deserving of more attention.  \n\nThematically, it\u2019s basically a heist game where your group of agents have to infiltrate rival corporate locations for intel, money, equipment, programs and extra personnel.  You need to strategize every engagement because of the constantly increasing alarm levels which add new layers of stress for your escape, such as more [i](armored)[/i] guards, cameras, drones, daemon programs and additional mission objectives.  All of which work in tandem for a variety of challenging playthroughs.  \n\nWhat really makes Invisible Inc. stand above the rest is how the game is brilliantly crafted to force every decision as a balance between risk & reward.  Do you knock out a guard, only to have him wake up several turns later and actively hunt for you?  Do you continue exploring the level for more safes, even after completing mission objectives and finding the exit?  Is there enough time left for your escape before heavy reinforcements arrive?  Is it worth buying items/augments, or better to save that money for special A.I. programs?  The difficulty begins to shine when you start realizing your choices have consequences.  Unfortunately, there is a \u201crewind\u201d system available so you can spam your way through every level, if you so desire.  This handicap aside, Invisible Inc. is refreshingly engaging for anyone looking to expand their library of stealth strategy games.  It\u2019s fun, intense and smart, with good voice acting, cool music and stylized artwork befitting the genre. \n\nBeyond the base game and DLC expansion \u2013[b]Contingency Plan[/b]\u2013  there are a number of great mods designed to supplement Invisible Inc.\u2019s variety of gameplay options and extend its replay value.  You can fine tune the exact number of days before your final mission, adjust the quantity of guards per level, alter how much money you can loot from safes, define the number of rooms per mission, etc.  There are even community made agents, loading screens, A.I. programs / daemons, mission objectives, item & augment rebalances, plus quality-of-life updates.", "timestamp_created": 1691801505, "timestamp_updated": 1691816427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566343784332275391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143781860": {"recommendationid": "143781860", "author": {"steamid": "76561199088106002", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 475, "last_played": 1654958555}, "language": "english", "review": "Wtf I got this game in a bundle and guess what, when I open it EVERYTHING was visable. smh. those bastards at klei NEED to stop making misleadingg titles", "timestamp_created": 1691675037, "timestamp_updated": 1691675037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488624602556228638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143349474": {"recommendationid": "143349474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113851305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 11719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10867, "last_played": 1692367289}, "language": "english", "review": "An old, comfort standby for me.

On rare occasion you can get really bad luck (happened to me once in 28 hours of play).

And why should one when doing all of the above gives better optics for your product?\n\nBut there are those- time itself is irrelevant to some games, I can play a game released in 1986 and enjoy it, because it was thoughtfully made and designed well, and so I can enjoy it. I can play a game that was made well and out in 2007 even if any commentary referencing it is that it is skippable.

Most roguelikes I have played also do not go beyond combat simulators, even if in the end I do not hate them and can play them, like Slay the Spire. Klei roguelikes are always deeper though, and well thought out and competently designed. I've only put in an adequate amount in Griftlands because real time gets a bit overwhelming for me to get into, turn based is faster to learn. This game has a good story\u2026 I'll say it\u2026 but more importantly it knows that in a game reliant on runs, the gameplay has to be very good and compelling. And it is. Once I've seen through the story bits, I'm always going to skip it, and involuntarily I find myself doing so. But the game is very good. The mechanics are coherent, the AI has a discernable logic that still has you in tough situations (limitations in your playable characters' ability used well) and the procedural generation is very good. Beginner difficulty has everything lined up if you think through the situation and yet it gets tense, and experienced difficulty changes this so that the layout is not laid out so perfectly\u2026 and there, I find myself having to put the characters in situations where they are spotted, where I have to think forward, and so on. Rarely I find that a mechanic allows me to not expose them to the enemy in that particular situation as well. Yet, I find it good and stimulating, and while I'm losing missions I'm also winning them.

stealth and turn based strategy I\u2019ve seen in a game as of yet, and it achieves by making everything understandable at a glance without ever being too complex to make you feel cheated by it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLet\u2019s start with the base mechanics of the game:\nYou control multiple characters who move on a square grid (but still capable of diagonal movement).\nThe map has no elevation nor terrain-based hazards so it simplifies movement into movable squares or not.\nWeapons and items are straightforward such as \u201cstun a guard for 3 turns\u201d or \u201cturn invisible until the start of your next turn\u201d.\nThe game won\u2019t have you guessing, there\u2019s no randomness besides the map generation, no percentage to miss or to be seen or not by a guard, it always communicates to you what\u2019s going to happen, while still relying on your common sense to not run into an unexplored room.\n\nAs for stealth:\nEnemies have two cones of vision, a narrow one where you\u2019ll be noticed and held at gunpoint on the spot, and a peripheral one where they\u2019ll see movement and investigate it once it\u2019s their turn, furthermore many environmental objects such as desks, crates, safes and more can be used for concealment, couple that with the ability to peek through doors, around corners and to predict the enemy patrol path and you\u2019ll be able to move through crowded rooms like a shadow.\n\nCombat is optional, and you\u2019ll have many tools to stay out of trouble, from hacking enemy drones to scout ahead to using decoy and teleporters to get around a problem.\n\nAnd to conclude the gameplay overview, it sometimes plays like a roguelike, you\u2019ll have 72 hours to complete as many missions as you can before the final one, get all of your agents killed and it\u2019s back to square one, but with some new unlocks.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nNothing to write home about but it serves its purpose, someone sniffed you out and raided your base, you were able to escape but now your AI is on life support, and without it you\u2019ll be crushed immediately, this way placing you in the shoes of an elite group of spies for the most advanced espionage company in the world, you\u2019ll have to find a way to get your AI on its feet while collecting info about who commissioned the raid.\n\n[h1]X-Factor[/h1]\nAs for graphics, it\u2019s the classic Kilei style, very cartoony but also very well animated, and music follows suit.\n\n[h1]Downsides[/h1]\nThe game plays a very cruel way, it makes extremely easy for you to savescum and it goes as far as being built into the game\u2019s mechanics, but if you want to challenge yourself and not do it the game will just as easily take away over 10 hours of progress from your doomed save.\n[hr][/hr]\n\nIt\u2019s a great game even if a bit anxiety inducing, never knowing what awaits you in the next room and even a wrong step could mean your run is over, but still, very

You do a couple missions in procedurally generated levels with the goal of unlocking additional operators, cybernetics, equipment, and skills in preparation of a final gauntlet. \n\nI think my biggest problem with Invisible Inc. is that it feels like there's not enough here. This feels like a proof of concept rather than a full release (though I haven't played the Contingency Plan DLC). Every level is essentially the same; you scout with your operator who reveals hackables behind walls, you hack those to reveal the next room, you avoid the guards (who have some of the most pathetic patrols I've seen in a game thanks to the procedurally generated rooms), reach the objective and get out. \n\nThe entire thing plays very slowly. You need to be extremely cautious, so you'll have turns where you walk up to a door, peep through it, and then end your turn because you need the guard to look the other way. It's tiresome and repetitive because this is how you approach every single room in every single level. You can unlock some other abilities, like being able to make sound later on, but the core gameplay is this cycle of approach, peek, wait, move. \n\nOne of the biggest problems I had in my time with Invisible Inc. was not having enough options to buy things.

It might be the best roguelike I have played. \n\nIt is fundamentally, Metal Gear Solid meets tactical gameplay, and it is a masterful combination of both elements.  It also has a very cool pace where every mission starts slow, as guards don't search for you seriously and the devices you need to hack into are not well secured, but as you get noticed more, and you continue through your objectives, more guards get spawned, everything becomes better guarded, and guards get more aggressive. This makes every mission feel very tense, and with a very unique sense of buildup; missions will usually start with you rapidly scouting for your objective and taking over the facility, and usually it ends with you scrambling to clutch a sprint towards the exit. It is tense from start to finish.\n\nAs with most roguelikes, there is a steep learning curve to this game; however, the developers were kind enough to include two \"learning\" modes for the game: a beginner mode that has a lot of rewinds, level retiries and generally forgiving gameplay, to a more challenging experienced mode where every mechanic that seems inconsequential starts to come together, as you realize that every decision that you make factors into your success or failure. As a roguelike, if you lose, it's game over, so everything counts.\n\nLastly, as my only major gripe with the game (and in certain way, ironic), is it's absolute cliffhanger of an ending. While the DLC fixes the small issue I had with the campaign being too short (only 3 days long, expanded to 7, giving you more time to take bigger challenges and assemble a stronger team). I am not particularly bothered by the direction, as I don't necessarily want a \"good\" resolution to my efforts, but I feel extremely cheated out of a proper resolution at all, which just made want more. I just *need* to know what happens after the ending, and since this game is 8 years old at the time of this review, and Klei does not create sequels (unless you count Don't Starve Together I guess), there's close to 0 chance we will ever get a proper resolution for the story.\n\nWhich is another noteworthy thing about the game: I know that the bar for roguelike stories are *very* slow, and while it doesn't get super developed (I'd think Othercide is a better example of a fully fledged-out story), the moments that we get and the character interactions that exist make the immerssion into the universe so much deeper, that it just makes me wish that the game resolved its own plot threads.\n\nTL;DR, if you like stealth, tactics, or roguelikes, but this game.

You'll take a party of two starting agents (with the ability to recruit up to four) and challenge various missions across the globe, over the course of 72 in-game hours. Every outing takes some time off the clock, and your ultimate goal is to build up your team before tackling the final mission.\n\nSetting this title apart from other stealth games is the addition of Incognita, an Artificial Intelligence capable of hacking corporate mainframes to provide your party with additional benefits during a mission. Not only will you be sneaking around, dodging and subduing guards, and carrying out your objectives; Incognita will also be taking down network devices, sabotaging drones & defenses, and generally making life miserable for the opposition. This is very much a \"Man & Machine\" collaboration, where both sides must be synchronized if success is to be achieved.\n\nReplay-ability comes about from the procedural generation of maps (ensuring no two maps are the same), the vast array of available agents with their own strengths & weaknesses, the number of Incognita programs available and the plethora of strategies available for tackling a mission. Unlike most games, there is no \"one strategy to rule them all\", as your time is limited and gaining specific types of gear is not guaranteed. The addition of an \"Alarm System\" during missions also encourages players to quickly proceed, as opposed to slowly stacking the odds in their favour; you won't be pinning multiple guards with one agent for very long if he's to escape in time. Nor will you be guaranteed the \"best gear load-out\" for your agents before the game ends.\nFurther expanding on this, you're provided with a wealth of customization options to tailor the game exactly as you wish. And with extensive workshop support, plus a community that's made a huge amount of supporting content, the possibilities are endless.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn-based strategy or stealth games, I highly recommend picking this game up. While underrated, it's a great example of Klei's breadth when it comes to making quality games and really nails the creativity of indie games in general.", "timestamp_created": 1679346398, "timestamp_updated": 1679346446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682879507541656494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134883579": {"recommendationid": "134883579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334630334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1679142937}, "language": "english", "review": "No controller support.", "timestamp_created": 1679143053, "timestamp_updated": 1679143053, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474167883396148682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134771508": {"recommendationid": "134771508", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972650789", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 1713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1713, "last_played": 1498698486}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent turn-based tactical/stealth roguelike.

The game encourages you to play quickly but carefully with the alarm system, and using information warfare to find enemies, plot their paths and learn the level layout is really fun. Rewinds minimise very annoying unlucky situations thankfully, and the game encourages you into really fun play by encouraging you to keep guards awake as long as possible so you don't have to pin them. Incognita in general is an incredibly enjoyable tool to base the management of the game around and hacking/managing the energy economy can be super fun.\n\nHowever, the cons are steep and I think disqualifying for some rouge like enjoyers. This could be a situation where it's a lack of creativity or imagination on my part, but I just find that certain characters are just so much better then others to the point where it makes many of them obsolete. Playing the game without internationale is incredibly annoying as it requires spending so many action points to constantly hack terminals and so much recon to discover hackable objects in rooms instead of just scanning them walking by. Then you have a bunch of characters which every time you get you just kick yourself for not getting anything better: rescuing Shalem, Decker or Banks (archived or not) can make your run feel so much worse then getting one of more interesting characters like Dr. Xu, Nika or Sharp. This tended to make all my runs feel samey, as I'd always basically start with internationale and one of the aforementioned interesting characters, since doing anything else just felt like punishing myself for no reason.\n\nI'm really fond of this game, but I can understand if others find it niche: if you liked into the breach or enjoy tactics, stealth and rouge like games, this game will really speak to you. Otherwise, it's a bit of a chance, but one I think you might find really fun.\n\nPS: This games world design, world building and aesthetics and characters are all great: it saddens me to know this IP will likely be in limbo for all eternity since Klei is mostly working on don't starve these days. One of my dreams would be for this game to get a sequel of some kind or an animated prequel series, as there really is a lot of untapped potential with this IP.

A turn-based stealth game with a unique, tense gameplay that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It combines exploration, stealth, short and long-term planning in a procedurally-generated environment that stays fresh and unpredictable even after 50+ hours.\n\nIt will take you on an emotional rollercoaster - from initial confidence to total devastation when you make mistakes that end in a disaster, from doubt and despair to exhilaration when you manage to get out of a seemingly hopeless situation. Rarely any game makes me feel this way.\n\nYou play as an underdog, not an overpowered superhero like in most games. You have no chance in direct combat, outnumbered and outgunned by guards who become absurdly overpowered later in the game. You're like a mouse in a room full of cats. Your characters are not muscular super soldiers like in XCom but fragile individuals with their stories and personalities (and stylish outfits). The only advantage you have is intel and planning. Game gives you a lot of info and it's up to you to make best use of it. That's one of the reasons why I absolutely love this game.\n\nI think Invisible Inc. is not wildly popular because it's quite difficult (especially for beginners), nerve-wracking (with increasing alarm and the need to constantly analyze) and it's not a shooter like XCom. Tutorial doesn't cover everything, so you'll need to experiment and figure out stuff on your own and you will fail a lot at the beginning.\n\nIf you're feeling it's too hard for you, watch [url=https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewKay/playlists] Andrew Kay play [/url] - it will help you bring your game to the next level. And it's a roguelike, so it's meant to be replayed on a higher difficulty, just like chess - you don't quit after one match. \n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect to me - gameplay, art style, writing, sound & music, voice overs...

There's lot of difficult decisions to make, tension and suspense, but at the same time the game maintains a very enjoyable lightheartedness, both in content (a bit of dry humor here and there, the way the characters dash about, the snarky comments and fun enemy exclamations, ...) and in gameplay experience (you're not really heavily punished if you fail missions and campaigns but you simply fail and move on; the preference for sneaking around instead of attacking, ...), which makes this game such a perfect companion to spend from 20 minutes to several hours with.\n\nAlthough you can KO guards and even kill them, the idea is that those are secondary options and you try to remain hidden and supersneaky.

Enemies are varied in strength and capabilities and how they look, there's humans, drones, daemons, ..., all very fun and cool. Nice little background story with a few twists. The whole thing is just very enjoyable and very, very replayable. Floor layouts are procedurally generated so it's always a new challenge. They are also always neither too easy nor too difficult, so the procedural generation is really top notch. And there are endless combinations of characters, gadgets and upgrades, and even play styles. Graphics are crisp and stylish (while extremely light on GPU requirements), user interface feels smooth, it all fits perfectly. \nI suspect this will be a game I will be coming back to a lot for a very long time.", "timestamp_created": 1673178135, "timestamp_updated": 1673178135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130068190": {"recommendationid": "130068190", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992392252", "num_games_owned": 956, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3127, "last_played": 1695721800}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic turn-based stealth RPG, and I cannot recommend it enough if you're into any of those labels.\n\nThe biggest weakness of the game is also its biggest strength, and that's that all of its maps are procedurally generated.

The new items and especially the new hacking abilities that are added can really give the game even more variety. For example, there is one hacking ability that stops all passive hacking power increases (meaning the only way to get power is through using certain items or hacking consoles on the map), but also prevents the alarm from going up at the end of every turn until you do something yourself that causes the alarm to go up.

It almost feels like they wanted to be a roguelike, ala a precursor of something like Hades, but I just didn't feel driven to replay the exact same game with just slightly new people and slightly different loadouts.

At twenty hours in, I feel like the $1/hour price tag has been well worth it.\n\nI would imagine a lot of the negative reviews came from players whose strategies weren't working out, and they blamed the game for being \"poorly-designed\" rather than changing their tactics. Like many rouge-likes, this game doesn't hold your hand, the tutorial was very minimal, the only way to understand effective strategies is try them out and adapt your approach based on your failures. There is also some game knowledge required to build an effective run (I'm reminded of the flagship fight in FTL--you're not expected to beat it the first time you reach it; it's [i] supposed [/i] to feel overwhelming). I found that process of discovery and adaptation very rewarding. My heart rate went through the roof the first time I played the final mission.\n\nFor what it's worth, there is a built-in \"save-scum\" feature (basically an \"undo your last turn\" feature) that has limited uses per run, and the number of uses decreases as you increase the difficulty. Some might scoff at this, but I actually appreciated it and felt like it was a fair inclusion. It really helps speed up the learning process. On the beginning difficulty settings, if you try something that doesn't work and your agents die, you can just restart the [i] turn[/i], rather than having to restart the entire playthrough.\n\nThis game feels hugely underrated.

And while Invisible Inc certainly has as much polish as any of these titles, it lacks in substance.\n\nMy biggest complaint with it is that, despite looking like it's a deep and complex game, it only really lends itself to one style of play. Items, characters, and programs are completely unbalanced, bottlenecking the player into using the same strategies and same loadouts every playthrough if they want to succeed. Any deviation from the norm results in swift and unfair failure. Too many options, too little substance.\n\nMost of my experienced/expert mode playthroughs devolved into me failing on the 3rd or 4th mission because I misclicked, or because of some unforeseen bullshit which the game threw at me. As an example, sometimes guards will show up from behind corridors which you have no possible way of searching. Sometimes the game will throw an armored guard at you, despite you having no way of knocking out that guard yet. In such a situation, what are you supposed to do, except die and retry the game from the very beginning? Usually, a roguelite is supposed to foresee issues like this arising, but apparently, Invisible Inc never thought to do so.\n\nEnemies will always outnumber you, often 6:1. This is a problem when your only weapons have a cooldown of 3 turns. I get that it's a \"stealth\" game, but there's no real option for being stealthy when all of your avenues for escape are completely blocked off. Your only real options most of the time are 1) die or 2) escape the mission without obtaining all the loot available. And if you choose 2), then you'll be undersupplied for future missions. \n\nIt's also way too unforgiving, even for a roguelite. Characters are knocked out in one single attack. This is extremely problematic when your party size is a paltry 2 characters. Thus, if you make even 2 mistakes, or get screwed by 2 bouts of dumb luck vis-a-vis procedural generation, then congratulations: game over. The only way to truly avoid these situations is to utilize a very specific loadout, or get lucky with loot. \n\nItem-wise, Stim Packs and Cloaking Devices are absolutely essential, and are the only items which make the game remotely playable. On the character front, Internationale is head and shoulders above everyone else. What's the fun in customizing different parties if my party size is only 2, and I'm effectively FORCED into using one specific character for every single playthrough?\n\nI could probably figure out ways to consistently clear the harder difficulties if I had the patience to deal with all the game's frustrations.

The best and worst of [i]Invisible[/i] is the randomness. You will lose [b][i]a lot[/i][/b] as you are trying to learn. Sometimes tactics\u2026sometimes dumb luck. Dumb luck get you killed? That\u2019s it. Start over. These challenges made it interesting enough to keep starting new runs even after failing 15-20 times.\n[hr][/hr]\n[i]Invisible[/i] is a Roguelike, turn-based, stealth game that relies very, [b][i]very[/i][/b] heavily on randomness for nearly everything. The intro screen warning was completely correct, you will fail\u2026a lot. Many failures will happen because of dumb luck. Normally, I hate that. After ~10 hours, I figured I was going to vote [i]Invisible[/i] down, but I found myself continuing to hit restart until I finally was good (and lucky) enough to finish a game on Experienced. Since [i]Invisible[/i] managed to hold my attention, despite a mechanic that normally causes me to throw my controller, I figured it deserved the thumbs up.\n\nGameplay is smooth and [i]mostly[/i] intuitive. Picking up how to play is easy, but mastery comes from figuring out how to best combine your skills, knowledge of enemy behavior, hacking abilities, and gear. Mission difficulty scales nicely, and the challenge is figuring out how to use what gear is randomly available to the best of your ability.\n\nGraphics are good, but the music is the real prize. The excellent score never got old despite 30-ish hours of playtime.\n\nA single (successful) playthrough is only 5-8 hours. This is about perfect. Long enough to feel like you developed a good team and accomplished something. Short enough that getting completely screwed by randomness doesn\u2019t feel too wasted.\n\nThe one gameplay thing that bugged the ever-living crap out of me was the non-intuitive turn order. The first unit to go is always the last unit from the previous turn. Plus, the click-to-select isn\u2019t very clean. No matter how awesome you are with a mouse (I\u2019m only medium-awesome), you still fail to select something ~10-20% of the time. Embarrassingly, I lost way too many missions because I moved the wrong agent, or didn\u2019t notice the objective never actually went into my inventory.\n\nThere is no going back. I\u2019m a bonehead. I\u2019ll make bonehead moves here and there\u2026or I won\u2019t notice I have the wrong character selected\u2026etc. There is no pre-turn autosave or pre-mission autosave. I mean, I get it\u2026if I was the shmuck who gave a dumb order, that\u2019s on me. But I really don\u2019t like having my game ruined because of a gameplay error\u2026or when you click \u201cgo\u201d and your brain instantly screams a deep, slow [b]Nnnnnnnnoooooooo![/b] \n\nThere is a \"rewind\" button that let's you correct a mistake one round back, but you only get to use it ~3 times. While this might seem like a good option for boneheads like me...you will probably [b]really[/b] need those in a later mission to prevent getting screwed by randomness. A very limited undo button would go a long way to making the game safe for me...along with copious [i]Warning[/i] labels.\n\nThere is an option when you start your game to allow \u201cRedo Mission\u201d\u2026but the game ridicules you if you select that, saying, [i]That\u2019s not how the game is meant to be played[/i].  I didn\u2019t select it, but I should have. I enjoy games more if I\u2019m not worried about gameplay glitches\u2026or being a bonehead.\n\nFinally\u2026randomness is both the best, and worst, part of [i]Invisible[/i]. I\u2019m not talking \u201cchance of success.\u201d Actions always succeed\u2026or you know why they won\u2019t (like armor). Everyone gets knocked out or killed in one hit. Randomness is in the available missions, mission layout, type/location of enemy spawn, and gear. This is good because no two playthroughs will be the same, and you have to adapt your approach based on what is available. Not getting good weapon drops? Adapt your team to become the ultimate ninjas. Get lots of good hacking early? Use that to give you better intel and planning instead of gear for more diverse agents.\n\nRandomness can also be a curse. Most Roguelikes let you plan how to approach the game. Your agent who is all about cyber might not get any useful drops. One mission, enemies might spawn on the other side of the map\u2026the next, three enemies spawn in the room you are using to hide from patrols. You might not get any armor piercing weapons. If that happens, you almost can\u2019t deal with late game baddies, and the final mission will be nearly impossible. This randomness makes it very difficult to play when you are learning. You will fail frequently, and early on you won\u2019t know if you lost because your tactics sucked\u2026or if it was just dumb luck. I really don\u2019t like this. If I lose, I want my lumps and bruises to be a lesson.\n\nSome people claim there is a magic strategy to always win. That\u2019s too bad, because despite how annoying the randomness can be, the only real fun I had was in trying to adapt to what I was given.

If... the binds are a little... awkward, to use. I fully recommend using a keyboard and mouse, as that's what Klei has designed the interface around, but the controller and track-pad(s) on the Deck work if that is you're only option. Might take a little bit to get used to A being \"end turn\" and Y and L4 being \"peek around a corner/door\" mode both.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]The game itself[/h1]\nWhat a wonderful game. What do you get when you mix Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell \"ghost\"-feeling, Metal Gear AC!D 1/2's turn-based Stealth functions (without the cards) and X[-]COM's commander-turned-based-commanding-actions mode? You get \"Tactical Espionage Turn-based Action: Invisible, Inc.\"\n\nThe stories twist kind of sets up for a possible sequel, so hopefully Klei does that, because I feel the game could expand in some areas with a sequel. But as it is, having an \"Endless\" mode, higher difficulties, the [b]ability to even customize how easy/hard you want the difficulties to be[/b] is a huge huge huge thing in terms of replayability, and unlocking \"agents\"/units to use in addition to Incognita's hacking abilities to pick-choose before starting a run is nice.\n\n[strike]My only complaint is that after I finished a run, I exited on the \"start new run\" menu and... my completed save was ate. This isn't a HUGE deal, but it's very frustrating to see my progress be ate by that because I didn't want to start a new run just yet.[/strike]\n\nEdit: ^This apparently isn't true, thankfully. Seems the game DOES save your unlocks independent of the save file so it being \"ate\" isn't a huge deal. I do wish Klei at least was upfront about that, giving me anxiety and panic about that.\n\nFor the $2 or so that I paid for it on Sale, it's [b]ABSOLUTELY[/b] worth playing.

I still end up in impossible situations and have spent hours trying to get one of my unconscious agents back from the other side of the map. By now, this is one of my go-to games when I also want to listen to an audiobook, as the game provides enough input to keep me engaged but isn't high-paced enough to require my full attention at all times. I absolutely love the world of this game and wish Klei would play around with it more - there's plenty of potential for further DLCs or a second game and with the concept of rogue agents, there's a very quirky and broad character pool they could pull from. While I have my faves (Internationale & Dr. Xu), all the characters have different mechanics that allow for variation in strategy and utility.\n\nI've seen other reviews mention that the game punishes anything other than \"the one true playstyle\", to which I would say that the game can be pretty punishing to any playstyle as you never know how levels are going to develop. Also, Invisible is a lot better at this than some other games I've played. I love a game in which you can choose to be as sneaky or as aggressive as you want and still have to fight for your win regardless. What works well here is that you can also adapt your playstyle with every level - some will be easier done in full sneak mode, others are small enough that you can barrel through hack n' slash style and get to the exit real fast, you can modify and upgrade your agents/equipment in whatever direction you want (as much as the game allows through random gen).\n\nIs the game truly limitless? No. Does it need to be? Hell no. It provides the perfect variety to keep you engaged again and again, without being too complex to learn or difficult to keep track of with skill trees and such. You can play it every day or dip into it every couple of weeks/months and have a great experience regardless.\n\nI'm a sucker for appealing art style in my games and this is a very sleek and attractive game. The music is great and often raises the tension of a level when I do listen to it.

Its pixely graphics might not look like much, but it's a very complex game that has immense replay value as a roguelike tactical stealth game. I've seen some silly reviews about the game that seem to miss the point, so I've decided to put forth mine given how I've at least played the game enough to know what it's like.\n\nThe game punishes you for making mistakes in a way that is very consistent with the genre. If you're sloppy, get spotted too often, let the site raise alarm, you will risk getting caught, getting shot or having to abort the mission objectives. It can quickly turn into a scramble for your agents lives. But if you're smooth, you do things by the book, you're careful, you will go through the enemy complex like a handful of ninjas.\n\nIf you've only played a little you might get some idea about what's the one winning strategy you need to adapt each map, or how the game can be simplified down into a few tips, but once you get to start to know what you're doing, you'll be able to throw all of these tips out and realize how much leeway the game usually gives you even on seemingly hard maps. And as easy as it might be to think that there's one winning strategy, the reality is that you can have fundamentally different approaches to how you play, even on Endless where you can basically get anything you fancy with time, you can focus on killing or knocking out guards, on avoiding them, distracting them, cloaking your agents, you can shoot or hack or disable cameras, etc. the list is so long, with almost every type of game element you have many different choices what to do, how to use them.\n\nI'd say already vanilla Invisible Inc has at least 1000 hours worth of game time easily (I'm over it between my different accounts on different platforms and I'm still happy to play it), and then you realize that there is the option to mod this game, adding new agents, new rules, new items, or just re-balancing the whole game to give it a new feel and make it fresh and challenging again.", "timestamp_created": 1655309567, "timestamp_updated": 1655309567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738557100296020508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116639014": {"recommendationid": "116639014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023093118", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3081, "last_played": 1676220455}, "language": "english", "review": "underrated", "timestamp_created": 1654620491, "timestamp_updated": 1654620491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591836750507354736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116476690": {"recommendationid": "116476690", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984899141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1654551307}, "language": "english", "review": "Hot older woman is the captain.

This is a turn based, tactical, strategy game that will test your ability to think quickly, and make tough decisions.  I loved the Mark of the Ninja, and this game shares a lot of the great characteristics of that game.  This is an easy game to recommend to anyone that enjoys stealth based strategy games.\n\nWhat's Good:\n-This is a gorgeous game visually.  Klei really outdid themselves here.  I think this game looks even better visually than the Mark of the Ninja.  Invisible, Inc. opts for a more futuristic, almost cyberpunk theme and setting.  You will be breaking into state of the art facilities w/ cameras, security guards, armed robots, and many other high tech things.  The characters all look distinct, and the animations are also top notch.\n-This is a highly skilled game that will challenge you ever single level.  I think that the devs did a great job of finding new and innovative ways to challenge you as you get deeper into the game.  You'll need to learn how to avoid the security guards, hack the cameras and locks, and work together w/ your partner to collect as much data as possible, before escaping.  I learned something new every level that I played.\n-The learning curve is fairly steep initially b/c of the amount of information you'll need to take in.  Fortunately, all of the information is easily accessible to you.  You'll quickly figure out how to navigate the facilities, hack the systems, and collects as many goodies as possible.  \n-There are a bunch of different agents and tons of weapons/enhancements that you can either find or purchase.  There are always several ways to complete a given mission.  Stealth is the name of the game, but if you want to go guns blazing or knock every enemy out, that also gets the job done.\n-This is another game that has a ton of value and will keep ppl on their toes for many hrs.  I played for just under 6 hrs, and I barely scratched the surface.  If you want to complete everything and unlock all the agents, it will likely take you at least 20-30 hrs.\n\nCould Use Some Changes:\n-This is technically a roguelight but it plays more like a traditional linear game that forces you to start over if you lose all of your agents.  Although, there are lots of agents and tons of cool 007 toys to play w/, their isn't a ton of diversity between runs.  This is mostly b/c the agents are basically the same, except they start off w/ slightly different base stats or tools.  You can use any tool/weapon w/ any agent as far as I'm aware so this limits replayability a bit.\n-The learning curve is steeper than the average game.  There is quite a bit of information to take in on your first playthrough.  The tutorial is okay, but isn't as comprehensive as I'd like.  I suspect the devs want players to experiment and learn on their own.  This may make less experienced players feel a bit intimidated early on.\n-As cool as this game is, it also feels very familiar.  There are a ton of turn based strategy games on the market, and Invisible, Inc. doesn't really add anything new to the genre.\n\nConsensus:\n-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  Invisible, Inc. is a really easy game to recommend to pretty much anyone, but especially turn based stealth fans.  Klei Entertainment seems to never miss when it comes to strong game design, unique visual presentation, and engaging gameplay.

Set in a near-future world of mega-corps and bionic enhancements, your team of operatives must infiltrate a series of increasingly fortified enemy lairs to retrieve resources, weaken enemy capabilities, and ultimately defeat your nefarious corporate foes by, ah, ascending an AI to godhood.\n\nIndividual missions play out as top-down tactical games of cat-and-mouse between your operatives and an interlocking web of enemy guards, surveillance cameras and security systems. Things start quiet and escalate as the passage of time, enemy alerts and completion of objectives increases the facility\u2019s alarm level, until murderous robots and corporate goons are pouring from their lairs to hound your agents to the exfiltration point. This lends every encounter a compelling arc of emergent narrative, and delicious risk-reward calculations as you jeopardise everything for just one more gadget or bit of currency. Progress within missions as well as between them carries over, you see, and stealing a powerful bit of enemy technology or rescuing a superior addition to your roster will bolster your chances of success for the rest of every short-ish campaign. While failure can be frequent and punishing in this unforgiving game, pulling off a perfect heist as the net closes and the excellent music builds to a crescendo is about as pulse-pounding as 2D turn-based tactics can get.\n\nFeeding into each mission is a meta-game of time and resource management, as you jetset around the globe selecting more-or-less challenging and rewarding missions in preparation for the final showdown. Mission difficulty escalates as time passes, meaning you\u2019ll sometimes fluff a campaign and leave yourself with essentially no chance of success, forcing a restart. Over repeated campaigns, this can rob the tame early missions of some of their excitement and challenge. On the other hand, the mid- to late-game usually remain rock solid even after numerous replays; only occasionally will you run into a brick wall of difficulty. Invisible Inc is relatively successful \u2013 for a stealth game \u2013 at making failure interesting, with plenty of options for clawing victory from the jaws of defeat, as well as offering interesting trade-offs regarding what, or who, you\u2019ll sacrifice in interests of the greatest chance at your final victory. Designed for repeated playthroughs, the procedural generation is mostly great, but can lend some levels a same-y feeling, although you\u2019ll likely start skipping the somewhat generic cyberpunk plot after your first couple of runs through.\n\nOverall, Invisible Inc is a unique and hugely compelling stealth tactics game, with all of the visual flare and game design excellence you\u2019d expect from Klei. Same-y levels, a forgettable plot, and punishing difficulty which can lead to repeated campaign restarts perhaps hold it back from all-time classic status, but offers dozens of hours of fun in a captivating stealth sandbox before you\u2019ll tire of it.", "timestamp_created": 1643171939, "timestamp_updated": 1643171939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108711292": {"recommendationid": "108711292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025081074", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1650793964}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting variation on XCom games where the random element is almost eliminated and most of what happens is completely deterministic.

But unlike the aforementioned game, this one doubles as a stealth game where you have to avoid detection by cameras, guards and drones, and in that regard it provides a pleasing and rewarding experience when you are able to succesfully navigate the levels.\n\nIt has to be said that if you're more of a casual or leisure player, then this game is not for you, given it's intentioanl difficulty. But if you enjoy roguelikes or tactical turn based games then this might just be your thing (as it is for me).\n\nAlso it has to be noted that, for an indie game, this has a suprisingly good production value. From the sleek and nice UI to the sharp visuals and animations to the voice acting, this indie title goes beyond what is usually expected which is a plus.\n\nIn short, I can easily recommend this game to fellow roguelike, stealth and tactics enjoyers even at full price.

I would also recommend it even if you aren't fans of existing games in those genres.\n\nI don't really love any stealth games or tactical RPGs, but I've always liked the ideas of those genres, and this game fulfills what I want from those types of games. \n\nTurn-based gameplay is a surprisingly good fit for stealth, as it allows you to pull of corny movie-like sneaking around. You can elegantly move your agents around guards, instead of just waiting for the guards to move away like in most realtime games (in realtime games it's generally to risky or unclear to weave around guard's line of sight). That's the biggest strength of this game, you're never forced to wait around. In fact, you can't wait around, because the longer you stay in a level, the more dangerous it becomes. You might not like the game if you don't like timers, but I find it really exciting, and you never just \"run out of time\", the level just becomes more threatening.\n\nThis game is also rarely a slog like a lot of tactical RPGs. Since you don't need to kill people, there's never a boring part of a battle where you're just finishing people off. Almost every turn is exciting, and once you find the objective, you just need to escape the level. Killing is a tactical option, but not a requirement.\n\nI'm not a fan of roguelikes at all, but this game is a very very good one, and it hardly even feels like a roguelike to me. There are randomly generated levels and permadeath, but the campaign is several hours long, and you're given multiple retrys on the normal difficulty. As someone who's completely sick of rougelikes, these are welcome design choices, and if you DO like permadeath you can play on a harder difficulty. I never feel RNG-screwed in terms of trying to build up my team with items and abilities, although you'll need to learn that a lot of items are nearly useless.\n\nAgain, I'd highly recommend this game

I haven't had that problem doing anything else, so I'm assuming this is some kind of bug with the game. Which is lame because I've been having so much fun with this game.[/i]\n\n[u]Quick Summary:[/u] Invisible Inc. is a fun and challenging turn-based stealth game. Somehow it seemed more complicated at first than I was anticipating, and definitely benefits from playing through a few levels first to learn the mechanics. But the procedural maps, meaningful decisions, helpful UI, game-replay unlocks, and a story that hits the right tone makes what could have been a repetitive game into a challenging and addictive one that I keep coming back to.\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u] The game is a turn-based stealth game, and handles this genre-mix well. You play through a series of missions that you get to pick, which all basically play out the same way: find your objective and get out. It\u2019s a fun core gameplay loop since the procedurally generated maps throw you against new problems every time. Plus each mission type gives you different rewards.\n\nYou have an AI hacker that allows you to disable or convert enemy security systems, but each hack requires power. You start with two operatives per play-through, with the ability to rescue two more by the end. Operatives can be upgraded in 4 categories with credits: speed, strength, hacking, anarchy. Each one improves an attribute, but sometimes they're are also required at a certain level to use certain items.\n\nEnemies are highly encouraged to be KO\u2019d and not killed. A KO will last a few turns before they return alerted. Pinning KO\u2019d enemies stalls their recovery time. If an enemy \"notices\" you, they will check out the area. If they see you, you get one movement space to hide or take them out. If you can\u2019t, your operative gets taken out.\n\nEvery turn you take increases the alarm by one slot. Every 5 slots increases the alarm by a level, which introduces new obstacles to completing the level. It really serves the race-against-the-clock story theme and makes for some tough decisions: is it worth spending more time to steal credits and loot? Or is it smarter to finish the level as sooner?\n\nThis is the strength of the game: Difficult decisions. Your decisions matter. There might not be enough time, money, carrying slots, incognito power, or some combination to do everything you\u2019d like to do. So you have to make well thought out decisions to complete the levels successfully. It's pretty fun.\n\nAlso, after finishing a play-through (successfully or not) you receive XP which goes towards unlocking new Operatives and Incognito powers! I think that\u2019s awesome. More games should do this. In other words, the replay value is great.\n\n[u]User Interface:[/u] The UI is very helpful in this game. The hud has most of the information you\u2019ll need (you can open a character sheet to see operative stats). And actions you can take towards objects/enemies pop-up next to them on the field.\n\nBut the most helpful thing is all the viewing mode options. The art style is in a style that's kind of thin and tall. So the map is way too cluttered with the default view. But they give you all sorts of ways to get around this. My favorite is the \u201clow wall mode\u201d (shortcut T) which I turn on immediately every game. There is also a tactical mode by holding down ALT, and you can rotate the orthogonal angle with E and W. Personally, the \u201cLow Wall Mode\u201d is more than enough, and makes for a more convenient time. Very helpful visual features.\n\n[u]Difficulty:[/u] I recommend starting in easy to learn how the game works, and then increasing it later. Some things you need to stumble through to understand.\n\n[u]Atmosphere:[/u] The story centers around a secret organization that is attacked by some totalitarian force. It\u2019s all a bit vague, and perhaps bland? But it does a great job at serving the gameplay. It\u2019s just enough story to sell you on your role and mission. Basically the story is very light. The art style is hit or miss. Personally the emphasis on stealth, and the music to support it, is what gives this game its character. You really feel like a secret agent breaking in and getting out, either totally unnoticed or just in time. Cool concept.\n\n[u]Conclusion:[/u] Invisible Inc is a great package. It has challenging stealth and strategy, immersive decisions, a fun story concept, and good replay value.

[/i] was my first introduction into XCOM style, turn based tactics games, and it was also one of my first introductions to the roguelike genre, with its permadeath, random level generation, and fail-forward progression. All things I love! So I must admit, I have something of a soft spot for the game. \n\nJust like many of Klei Entertainment's other games, it's very stylish. The dark, geometric figures of the characters are wonderfully detailed, with accents of color and light. The animations capture a lot of personality, too.\n\nThe story is solid. The AI system that your firm relies on, Incognita, is dying due to a lack of power following a corporate assault, and it's your job to get her back online. You have to strike back at the corporations by stealing from them, and by finding a new host for Incognita, in order to get the firm back on its feet. The game is undoubtedly inspired by the cyberpunk genre, but it's a touch more cyber than punk. The world the game takes place in, whose lore can be discerned through various voicelines and files, is just detailed enough to capture one's imagination and lend to the credibility of the corporations' power.\n\nAs far as sound goes, alarms blare, robots and turrets chirp and hum eerily, footsteps thunder, guards chatter.  Gunshots ring out across the halls. It all works. The soundtrack, though short, is full of hopeful melodies, menacing synths, and pulsing beats, and really enhances the atmosphere and tension.\n\nGameplay is not very XCOM like, despite the similarities. Enemies need direct line of sight to fire at you, meaning you must have no cover, and for them to even get a shot, must either stumble into you or directly seek you out after having been aggro'd. Considering guns and ammo are scarce and killing incurs a cleanup fee, you will mostly be reliant on avoiding detection altogether, using melee sneak attacks to knock out guards and guns for only the most troublesome (well, unless you are playing with Draco). Random levels mean you don't always know what to expect from enemy spawns and patrol patterns, or the positions of objectives. Difficulty wise, it's hard, but doesn't usually feel unfair.\n\nThis game has some shortcomings. Certain builds and playstyles are much more effective than others, making certain items and agents have little to no utility. You will likely lose a few times before you find the winning combinations.\n\nAll told, Invisible Inc. is a very stylish, exciting, and mechanically solid game with a good amount of replay value. It's relatively pretty short, though sweet, with a surprising amount of depth and richness both in its mechanics, its world, and its artwork. It feels like a classic example of independent developers forgoing the bloat so typical in this industry, by cleverly doing more with less.", "timestamp_created": 1630166079, "timestamp_updated": 1630166079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98213920": {"recommendationid": "98213920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046971300", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 18472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17975, "last_played": 1681763459}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2584\u2591\u2591\n\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2591\n\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2580\u2591\u2591\n\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\n\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2580\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2580\u2580\n\u2588\u2591\u2584\u2584\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2584\n\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2591\u2588\u2584\u2584\nInvisible Inc 2 please", "timestamp_created": 1629905024, "timestamp_updated": 1638288372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98138794": {"recommendationid": "98138794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363893652", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59529, "last_played": 1685878135}, "language": "english", "review": "it's pretty gud....spent some time on it", "timestamp_created": 1629796118, "timestamp_updated": 1694856399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98123443": {"recommendationid": "98123443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211405799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1992, "last_played": 1636102058}, "language": "english", "review": "It's hard, challenging and sometimes extremely stressful but makes you feel so happy with you clear a mission on the very last turn.

Each character can only take a few steps and maybe check a terminal per turn and that's it, very few enemies in the first levels and when they start to work together they become extremely difficult to deal with pretty fast.\nI can tell that whoever designed the gameplay here doesn't have a clue about what makes turn-based games interesting. \nTurn-based gameplay must have you accomplish relevant/interesting things every turn, not waste your steps through empty repetitive levels\n\nThere is also a visibility problem, it's sometimes hard to understand the floorplan.\nThe rooms are empty and visually very repetitive. Wether you're in Lima or Paris, there's no difference.\n\nI got this game because someone compared it to FTL, but no way, I got tricked again.

You are given the bare minimum of resources to accomplish your missions, and you must learn to use them well. Every step your agents take through each guarded facility must be chosen carefully. What devices you should hack and when; whether or not you should spend a precious attack turn to take that guard down; these are serious decisions.\n\nFortunately the game features a well-thought-out difficulty curve. On lower difficulties, guard patrol patterns are simpler and more predictable; the alarm level more forgiving; and the player gets more \"do-overs.\" Once you master the basics, you can tweak these settings for a stiffer challenge.\n\nOne cool thing about this game is that it features almost no randomness beyond the layout of the levels and the starting positions of the guards. Once you learn these things, there should be few surprises. Your agents will live and die based on your own tactical decision making, not thanks to bad rolls.\n\nVery cool game that calls for a lot of patience and precision.

pure gameplay, art, and design perspective, this game is overall pretty excellent. \n\nThe Good\n- The art style and animation is an absolute delight. It's gorgeous, seriously. I could get used to the pop cyberpunk look of bright, detailed models.\n- The characters I've found so far are all interesting, with their own unique quirks that lend themselves to specific playstyles on an agent-by-agent basis (an already good game design concept turned up to 10.5 here).\n- Controls are simple and quite intuitive. Item/ability cooldowns rather than use limits really lend themselves well to the overall gameplay.\n- Level design is on a procedural basis, so no two missions will ever be exactly the same as far as layout goes, which is a solid nod toward to feel that the game is going for. You know just enough to know you have a target somewhere, but it's up to your agents in the field to actually figure everything out on site.\n\nThat being said\n- Level design is on a procedural basis, so you'll find a lot of reused assets, and none of the different corps seem to have their own truly aesthetic, which is a definite missed opportunity.\n- Mission variety could be better. You have a slate of mission types (a rescue mission, and a couple minor variations on the smash-and-grab principle) that don't vary (at least up to this point, so this may simply be an Act 1 quibble rather than a full-game quibble).\n- Music is your standard cyberpunk background music, with little to nothing in the way of audio cues for any sort of events, good, bad, or otherwise. It maintains a low level of tension during missions, but that's about it. Another missed opportunity for creating unique corps (I know, I know, unique and corporate are generally anathema to each other, but nobody confuses Coke for Pepsi either).\n\nOverall\nIt's a low rent, roguelike Phantom Doctrine/Shadowrun, and that's not a slight on the game in any way.

Another \"Dark Souls of [insert video game genre here]\" trying to be hip with it. And just like every other \"Dark Souls of [insert video game genre here]\" it fails by being cheap and piss poorly designed.\n\nPros:\n- The voice acting is alright\n\nCons:\n- Lack of Necessary Information\n- Lousy RNG\n- Repetitive Dialog\n- Repetitive Music\n- Repetitive Levels\n- Lack of Options\n- UnSkippable Dialog\n\nIt's like Invisible Inc is designed to be deliberately frustrating for every wrong reason. Once again, the game tries to be challenging by just not giving players anything to work with. Even worse is moves that are supposed to give crucial map information, don't. You can peer through a door into the next room, but half the time it won't show you the guard or the camera, only that the room is covered in survailence. GREAT! So how am I supposed to breach if I can't even see the camera to deactivate it and the guard is going to pop me the instant I open the door?\n\nAll the hackable objects have no useful descriptions and no indication of what effect they'll have on the map if you hack them. Power is a precious resource. I shouldn't have to spend power to hack every generator on the map to find the one that shuts down the lasers! \n\nObjectives aren't highlighted and the game gives you no layout of the map. Imagine the Navy Seals raiding Taliban Strongholds without first spending months practicing in mock floor plans until they're as familiar with the layout as the people who live there! And you're supposed to be commanding a super elite squad of infiltrators! DUR HUR! Let's just go in blindly and get us all killed! That's exactly what happens 9/10 times. Even the original Thief had the decency to at least give players a crude drawing of the level with some annotations in the margins.\n\nAnd of course these developers think they're being cute by randomly generating everything, including map layout. Because the developers are so lazy they have to have an algorithm design their levels for them, some maps are just going to be generated in a way that screws you over, full stop. Meaning you're @#$%ed from the get go, the only solution is to die.\n\nYou'd think that'd be easy to accomplish in a game like this. But no. Because for no reason, there is no option to start the level over. You have to find armed guards to suicide your entire squad... THEN you're given the option to start the level over. And this process can take over 20 clicks. But I guess pulling up a menu and clicking \"restart\" in two clicks like every other game ever would make too much sense and not be ZOMG HARRD CORREE enough.\n\nAnd because you'll be playing the same levels over and over again like a slot machine, the same dialog sequences play at the beginning of each level. They cannot be skipped through. And after the characters finally shut up, all sorts of pop ups about objectives and @#$% start popping up! For @#$% sake! I know the objectives! There are only like four of them in the whole game and any idiot can figure them out! Stop cramming text boxes in my face that I've already read twelve dozen times and let me get on with it!\n\nSo the whole point is that you die and get to keep experience and any characters you've unlocked and blah blah blah blah blah. Except the game is only \"hard\" because it's random and offers players few options in combat. There's often no thinking involved in figuring out creative ways through a level because the game just isn't designed to give you anything to work with. At no point will you ever feel particularly clever for maneuvering around some obstacle. Most of the time you get by the same way you always do only it worked this time because you were lucky.\n\nSo who is this game for? Stealth fans? Stealth fans will be frustrated by the rudementary and cheap stealth. Turn based strategy fans? Well... there's not much in the way of strategy. RPG fans? Oh, sure, you can level up but this is even less of an RPG than a Ubisoft game. Roguelike fans? The RNG adds zero variety. Every level is the same regardless of how it's generated, only most of the time it's generated to @#$% you over from the start.\n\nSo, I guess if you like pulling the lever on a slot machine this game might be for you. Granted, it's only slightly more involved than that, but the result is essentially the same down to the flashing lights. Only you don't get money if you win. You only get to go on to the next level and do it all over again.\n\nEDIT: 2/22 Before I uninstalled I did discover that you can restart the level without having to get suicided by the guards. But the tooltip on the option explains that you will forfeit this playthrough and have to start over. It *doesn't* say that you will be given the option of restarting the level after it's done doing its pointless score tally like it does after every mission. Again, it's this lack of communication that is one of Invisible's biggest problems.", "timestamp_created": 1613432272, "timestamp_updated": 1613979224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473255276679992676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86752839": {"recommendationid": "86752839", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970254766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1613428911}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Invisible, Inc.[/b] is a run-based, procedurally generated, turn-based, tactics game, set in the very cyberpunk future of 2074.  You play as the Operator of Invisible, Inc, a private team of stealth operatives on the verge of being wiped out by the combined might of of a group of rival super-corporations.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of tactics-based shooters like [b]XCOM[/b], where you give orders to your units on a square-tile based map. The big difference is that the game revolves around stealth and hacking: enemy units are very dangerous and your opportunities to kill them are infrequent and strongly disincentivized.\n\nA single run of Invisible, Inc. takes about 7 hours, and consists of 6-9 prep missions and the final mission. The format is similar to [b]FTL[/b] and [b]Into the Breach[/b]: each run is randomly generated, and you play until you win or lose. The runs are interesting enough that I found myself thinking about what I was going to do on my next run while I was playing the current one, and that's high praise indeed.\n\nEvery decision you make has consequences. Like Into the Breach or [b]Slay the Spire[/b], it's a high-information game: Mousing over an enemy unit or piece of hardware will tell you everything you need to know about it. The immediate results of every move you make are displayed before you make them. Also, even though the contents of the levels are random, the results of the actions you take are not.

Still I decided to boot it up and give it a try.\n\nI was not disappointed in this games ability to deliver intense and addictive game play. This isn't a game that is trying to be another XCOM type, which has already seen a lot of games try to emulate its popular turned based tactical combat through the typical use of the cover and surprise to overwhelm enemies. A formula that worked very well, but which has started to become overused in the market.\n\nInstead, Invisible Inc. has reinvented itself along a stealth variant that forces you to consider each move carefully, with the focus on being 'Invisible'. Weapons, while available, play a somewhat limited role. Instead, its up to you to plan your moves carefully, peaking around corners or checking behind doors before moving into the open. Throughout each level, you can risk searching for loot which give you additional advantages, such as augmented abilities which boost movement or hacking abilities. Dont take too long though, as the security level of the mission increases as the turns go by. Increases security levels bring about more cameras becoming activated and the deployment of additional guards among a few other things. This pressure ensures that you make decisions between searching for loot and completing the mission, as you can easily get wiped if caught out in the open. \n\nThe incorporation of 'hacking' and the AI system adds an additional layer of complexity as you utilize your AI to remove barriers, open safes, disable cameras & turrets, or hack terminals which contain software programs (daemons) which can impede your mission by adding penalties additional penalties. \n\nThe inclusion of a number of upgradeable skills, additional agents that can be freed and a variety of different equipment to be found help ensure that game has some feeling of progression has more developed agents are needed for increasingly difficult missions. The missions themselves are interesting, aside from special missions, you can select between detention centers, cybernetics labs, and security vaults to name a few. Each have their own reward which further help you in your missions. \n\nIts pretty well polished, I didnt notice any bugs or other issues. \n\nWell worth picking up!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1611361175, "timestamp_updated": 1611361175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85021045": {"recommendationid": "85021045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083574396", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2700, "last_played": 1611064379}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is Incredible.

You might like it though? \n\nPlayed through the campaign once, enjoyed it at first, but then it became a slog as I kept playing and especially neared the end. The things I disliked about this game others might really like: \n- Every map is randomly generated, even the final level, so playthroughs are likely going to be very different - but that also means levels aren't perfectly polished. \n- Enemies aren't visible when you start a level, so on the first enemy turn a guard might just [b]A P P E A R[/b] and immediately spot half of your team, putting you in situations you can't really get out of.   \n- Increasing the difficulty only amplified my frustrations, as it reduces chances to reset the level and generate a new map. (Which is basically just more of why my first quirk bothered me)\n- There's no guarantee you'll get useful upgrades, or be able to build a team to your liking: you start each campaign with two agents of choice, then any others you find are completely randomized. Upgrade shops are randomized as well, meaning you might ONLY get loud guns that merely stun enemies.\n- There's basically only two characters who talk, and none of the ones you control directly say anything relevant to the overarching story. [spoiler] Except during the final mission. [/spoiler] \n- Enemies can't be killed without setting off alarms and making the game significantly harder. Guns have limited ammo that can't be reliably refilled. Even KOing guards doesn't pay off, they can get back up pretty quickly and set off an alarm.\n- Your AI Hacker can't do that much to provide assistance; I felt like this was somewhat misused, but it was probably due to balance issues\n- Maps have zero information when you're dumped into a mission with only the type of objective provided to you. Some people like figuring stuff out, I hate doing it when I'm being timed\n- You can't take your time on any mission. The longer you take, the more security a level gains. Getting spotted irreversibly increases difficulty for the rest of the level. Making mistakes is punished significantly harder than most other games, to the point where I restarted levels if one of my agents was spotted.\n- The ending ruined it for me. [spoiler] Your AI was behind the attack on your organization, in a gambit to be uploaded to a CPU that controls a ton of missiles. The AI rules the world, but spares the main characters. Congrats you helped the villain. [/spoiler] \n\nIf the above are things that sound like they'd make the game more fun for you, power to ya. It just wasn't for me.

[/b]\n\nThis game is notable in several respects that might be not immediately obvious:\n1. Because of very limited number of missions (between five and eight, not counting the introductory one and the final missions. DLC gives you some more time, but the game gets more difficult and throws new tricks into the mix as well) that can be done in a single campaign, getting overpowered is extremely difficult compared to X-Com and it's other imitators, where you only have any serious time pressure at the start, if at all. This solves some of the many balance issues prevalent in X-Com clones. The player gets more powerful with each mission, but the enemies don't lag behind, and choosing the missions and benefits that they grant is never as simple as picking *the biggest shiny thing*. [b]You need everything you can get. And you have very limited opportunities to get it.[/b] \n\n2. RNG level-generator is among the best I've seen since 1999. It consistently creates new, tricky levels using very limited number of assets. And it's never a straight line to the objective and exit. Explore, and loot everything you can carry away, or you might not get enough resourses for the final missions.\n\n3. The guards behave very predictably, with very few random elements to their actions, and it's the player's job to manipulate them. The player actually controls everything and everyone in game. The only difference is some pieces the player controls directly (hacking interface and Invisible inc agents) amd some\u2014 indirectly (guards and all kinds of hack-able devices).\n\n4.The game might be easy to learn but harder to master. Still, even on expert+ it is always fair, and the player won't lose just because of some dice roll gone wrong.\n\n5. Invisible, Inc. was balanced around Expert difficulty. Unless you've never [b][i]ever[/i][/b] played turn-based tactics games I recommend you start playing on Expert. Otherwise you'll miss some of the more exciting features, like incremental alarm gain that doesn't allow you to sit in a corner for unlimited amount of turns. You have to act. But, unlike in Firaxis' XCom 2 that doesn't mean you have to rush. And even when the level is on full alert, you don't fail anything\u2014sometimes it might be even benefical to raise the alarm higher. Why? I won't spoil it.\n\n6. The game is very well balanced. Every character and most items are consistently useful, more or less so depending on your playstile.\n\n7.While it's a stealth game that constantly cautions you against fighting guards head on, with the right agents and items you can litter levels with dead and knocked out bodies, blaizing through the level like a lightning, or methodically clearing out hostiles one by one. Going for kills might be difficult and costly in early game, but in the later stages it's often the easier and faster option.\n\nTL;DR: One of the best  turn-based tactics games I've ever played.\nWell designed, well balanced, well polished.\nBuy DLC if you like the base game\u2014it's an honest, proper expansion pack.", "timestamp_created": 1608026698, "timestamp_updated": 1608056187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548684656620025635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82402177": {"recommendationid": "82402177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055599338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 9524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7954, "last_played": 1618106954}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep coming back to this game.

Too often, there's little to no use to the things you'll get. And the missions become too repetitive and end up having little to no additional challenge, except the constantly raising security level.  The hacking aspect is also boring, there's absolutely no skill or challenge here, even with daemons around. Another wasted aspect, which once again, Shadowfall does much better and allows for strategies and has additional mechanics. \n\nThe interface is quite bad too. As also the feedback on screen.

The stealth tactics, sneaking about, and hacking are all well done. There is much satisfaction to be had in successfully completing a mission right under the enemy's nose. It's a fairly standard turn based affair in that your team has action points that they use to accomplish things, but unique in that it's a stealth game.\n\nThe roguelike bits come in when you lose-- you unlock new characters, items, and hacking abilities when you finish a run (be it winning or losing). The problem that I had here, and my biggest complaint with the game, is that I'm not really sure how much the different characters / items / whatever are going to change up the feel of the game. Each mission that I played felt pretty much the same, and while that 'same' was good, I was still tired of it by the end of the campaign.\n\nThe art direction is well done, and the game performs and functions great. No issues on a technical front. one thing I did quite like is that you could run it in a window and resize the window to whatever you wanted. I thought that was slick. The game features a multitude of difficulties and allows you to customize many options pertaining to how hard the game is, which is great.\n\nSo in the end, while I think Invisible Inc is a good game, I didn't feel like there was enough variation to really warrant coming back to it over and over, which is something that I think a successful roguelike needs. I still had a good time with it, but I don't see myself going through run after run hoping to unlock the new macguffin and see how it'll change the game.", "timestamp_created": 1599171861, "timestamp_updated": 1600541431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488636374473571777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75332082": {"recommendationid": "75332082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074911267", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 5196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2897, "last_played": 1668714363}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1599061959, "timestamp_updated": 1599061959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75204453": {"recommendationid": "75204453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002434702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1590774635}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1598851228, "timestamp_updated": 1598851228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75088735": {"recommendationid": "75088735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185604391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1696191983}, "language": "english", "review": "Great if you like turn-based tatical shooters.

I think Invisible, Inc. actually has the tightest and most rewarding gameplay than any other tactical game I've played for 3 reasons:\n\n1. The game basically removes the luck factor completely, but retains as much difficulty as you want. \n\n2. The game implements the best original tactical concept I've encountered which is the \"rewind\" system. Basically, you get a limited number of whole turn undos, but once you used them up your screwed. This gives you a margin of error ( the number of rewinds can be changed depending on if you want the game to be easier or harder), but still keeps you on your toes as there is no reload past saves option.\n\n3. The game is incredible tense and engaging. Because you can't just make a quick save file and reload of things go to hell, every decision you make feels heavy and significant. If your down to your last rewind, or have none left, every movement must be perfect or your going to lose your whole game. \n\nThis game has created a beautiful and, in my experience, unprecedented harmony between difficulty a fairness that keeps you on edge at every moment. \n\nAlso, just be aware that the campaign is extremely short, only about 3-5 hours (though it may take you longer to beat it as you stare at your screen second guessing all your thoughts about what to do next). This game is meant to be replayed using different loadouts and options. It is not a narrative experience, rather it is pure gameplay perfection.

With a tiny little bit of [b]Volume[/b] added to the formula. That's pretty much it. Well, aside from the fact that the entire design here was stolen from good ol' [b]Shadow Watch[/b]. But OK, OK, that's a lot of names. Let me start from the beginning. First of all \u2013 what the heck is [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b]? [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b] is a stealth-oriented tactical game, in which you control a group operatives in order to complete missions. Like I said, it looks almost identical to good ol' [b]Shadow Watch[/b] (feel free to check it on [b]GOG[/b] if you missed it back in the days, it's totally worth your time), only unlike [b]Shadow Watch[/b], you should not expect much shooting here.\n\nInstead, the game focuses on stealth. While using [b]XCOM[/b]-like [b]UI[/b] (I'm talking about remake, of course, not the original game by [b]Mythos Games[/b]), you'll try to sneak past guards in a [b]Commandos[/b]-like way. Only, unlike [b]Commandos[/b], this game doesn't really have enough freedom and ends up feeling more like [b]Volume[/b] as the result. In other words, the entire game is just a series of corridors that look and feel exactly the same. You can use special powers, though, but those are very limited. Which leads to a very unpleasant result. See, I already mentioned [b]Deus Ex GO[/b], right? And we all know that it's a mobiles-oriented puzzle game. While this one was supposed to provide you a proper tactical experience. But the thing is \u2013 with very limited arsenal of powers and pretty small maps, the game ends up feeling more like a puzzle. In other words, it feels a lot like [b]Deus Ex GO[/b], where you either guess exactly what to do, or die in agony. And features like \u201crewind\u201d only add to the effect.\n\nIt's not like I can't enjoy something like that, though. I liked [b]Deus Ex GO[/b]. Sure, I don't think I'll ever want to re-play it, but it was fun to beat once. The problem is... this game isn't. That's just it about [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b]. [i]It isn't fun.[/i] Like... at all. And not because story here sucks. Well, it sure does, but that's not the problem. I'm not one of those people who always look for complicated stories in games. I'm with [b]John Carmack[/b] here. It's nice to have an interesting story in game, but seriously, as long as gameplay is good, \u201c[i]our princess is in another castle[/i]\u201d is more than enough. What's the [i]real[/i] problem here is that [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b] does two things wrong. First \u2013 it's one of those games that aim for customizable campaigns and replayability instead of complicated pre-made stuff. Nothing's wrong with that and the formula works perfectly in roguelike titles, but together with the second thing? It just ruins the game. See, [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b]? It just isn't comfortable enough.\n\nIt's one of those games, in which you'll fight with the [b]UI[/b] more than you'll fight with the enemies. Everything here is too small, you'll need to do a lot of needless actions to achieve the most basic things and it'll feel like everything's here was designed to make your life harder with no reason whatsoever. And in this case it reminds me of another tactical indie game - [b]All Walls Must Fall[/b]. There was so much good about that game, but it was so... bloody... uncomfortable that it was really hard to enjoy it. Like... [i]really[/i] hard. Same thing here. And as the result... [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b] just falls apart.\n\nSee, you'll be able to finish the smallest custom campaign here in only an hour. Without even trying hard. That's it. The entire game lasts only one hour. As long as you won't decide to make it longer by choosing the corresponding options and paying for [b]DLC[/b]. But the thing is \u2013 you won't. You won't want this game to be longer. You beat the hour-long campaign (that comes with only a couple of story-related cutscenes) and then that'll be it. The game just doesn't feel good enough to make you want to return to it. Sure, [b]Invisible, Inc.[/b] is far from being awful. Is it playable? Well, yeah. Totally. With nothing else to choose from, you'll be able to kill some time with it. It's not one of those \u201c[i]OMG, it sucks butt![/i]\u201d games. The problem is, it's nothing you'll choose willingly. It's one of those indie games that have nothing special about them and don't feel good enough to make you bother. If this game will cease to exist? Nobody would even notice. It's an [i]invisible[/i] game. For a reason.

Like most of this developer's titles (and believe me when I say any game this dev puts out is worth a close look and a full-price purchase), the concept puzzled me at first (Oxygen Not Included: a 2d side-scrolling dwarf-fortress-like with physics simulation?  No way.  But I've got almost quadruple-digit hours in it.  A deck-building rogue-like with different decks for combat and conversation?  Bizarre.), but it totally works.  \n\nThe gameplay loop involves choosing a pair of starting characters with different skills and abilities, selecting procedurally missions with varying types of rewards and difficulty levels, and then progressing to the endgame after a certain number of missions have been played.  There's no way to grind missions to better prepare for the end-game, making your mission selections and your careful investment of very limited resources and opportunities crucial for success, in the spirit of other very fine procedurally generated games like FTL and Into the Breach that constantly keep you on the razor's edge between having just enough to squeak by and total disaster.  Like any great game of this type, you're constantly faced with difficult decisions.  Go back to rescue a downed teammate or complete your mission objective?  High-tail it out of a risky situation or risk it all to get a powerful hacking routine?  Dilemmas like this make Invisible, Inc a compelling and durable gaming experience, and I've long surpassed the three hours-per-dollar of enjoyment landmark in this game making it an incredible value at full price.\n\nThe visual style is clean and consistent throughout the experience, with a semi-realistic cell-shaded appearance to the art assets, and a distinct character design style that complements the surprisingly high-quality cut-scene animations that act as intro and outro to the game that could easily stand alone as an animated feature if they were longer (like 50x longer, they're pretty short) and more fleshed out.  Despite the short length of these animations they really sucked me into the story, which involves preserving an artificial intelligence after a private espionage contractor gets burned (I'm a sucker for any story that features an AI).  The game doesn't beat you over the head with the story, just gives you enough of a story to set the mood and provide interesting backgrounds and flavor text/VO to peruse later.\n\nThe music and sound design are also top-notch (something I always expect from this dev and am never disappointed), the music adds and subtracts track elements depending on the alarm level of the stage, adding driving drum and bass tracks to the mix when the threat level rises which is greatly effective at producing an absorbing and immersive experience.  The voice-over work is also extremely high quality, although there isn't a ton of it in the game, just enough to keep it interesting to listen to.\n\nThe core gameplay is challenging enough, but there are also higher difficulty levels with more constraints, and multiple things to unlock on subsequent playthroughs, which is why I've got nearly 70 hours logged in a game that only takes a few hours to complete.  Accepting different constraints and starting with hacking programs or characters that you wouldn't usually start with provides interesting and fresh gameplay challenges, since the way you approach your run with different character abilities *and combinations of character abilities* can wildly vary depending on what you start with.\n\nInvisible, Inc. is worth a full-price purchase for anyone who enjoys turn-based tactics games, games based on stealth/espionage, novel gameplay types, cyberpunk, or procedurally generated games.

Bought it because it was on sale and ended up playing it for 6h straight. I suppose comparing it to XCOM is inevitable, so lemme just get this out of the way. XCOM is much more combat-focused (I cannot speak for XCOM 2 onwards, though, haven't played those) and has a more \"serious\" feel to it. Invisible, however, focuses on stealth. You can do a mission without ever alerting a guard, a camera, or a drone, if you manage to do it. Engaging in combat is not required, and in fact it doesn't seem that the game encourages it. With each turn the alarm level increases, and some actions may raise it further and even trigger special defenses. The longer you take to complete a level, the higher the security level will be, and the tougher the measures that will be implemented (more cameras, more guards, more firewalls). \n\nUsing lethal options will cause the security levels to be raised. As in Metal Gear, you can try go Rambo, but the game doesn't seem to encourage you. You will probably want to study your options, use your action points sparingly, and coordinate your agents according to their abilities and inventories. The difficulty of the missions increases as you progress in the game, and so far I haven't had the option to go back and do a lower-level mission to farm for credits, more abilities to our agency's AI etc. This seems to be coherent with the plot. The Corporations become increasingly aware of our operations, so new operations become increasingly harder. \n\nI wasn't too impressed by animation of Invisible, Inc. at first. Combined with the voice acting, and I'm not saying either of these are bad, I felt like I was watching The Incredibles. The clich\u00e9d British accent of the agency's founder is a bit annoying in my opinon, but it does seem to fit.\n\nThe plot isn't a thing to be admired either; it's a generic cyberpunk setting. It does have a Watch Dogs (at times, explicitely) feel to our agency. It's like Gen Z striking against The Corporation, hooraaay! To be fair, this is tempered with some agents with different backgrounds, such as an ex-corporate background.\n\nYou will be able to upgrade your agents' abilities (speed, hacking, anarchy, strength) and your AI's capabilities. You do that with the credits you earn; it doesn't rely on XP. During the operations, you also have the option to access terminals where you can buy/sell items (new agents don't have any items on them, which renders them not as useful as you'd expect), augmentations etc., and other terminals will allow you to buy/sell abilities for your AI.\n\nI can't say I've encountered actual cons so far, and I'm a very critical person. The things I didn't appreciate much so far aren't necessarily bad; I just mentioned a couple of things that weren't particularly pleasing to my personal taste. I view these not-so-great things in a very positive light, though. The thing about this game is that it seems to be perfect in a philosophic, Aristotelian sense (yes, bear with me). It's not overly ambitious; it apparently achieves its full potential in what it seems to have gone for. I'm sure that people who have played Obsidian's Outer Worlds were quite frustrated. The game seems to have gone for so much more than what it was able to accomplish in actuality. Not a bad game, it's just insipid, unintersting, frustrating - this is Obsidian after all, where is the top-notch writing and interesting characters and choices? In that sense, Invisible is much more successful.\n\nI bought this game on sale with little to back my decision other than, \"hm, seems alright, I can get some more trading cards with this and then sell them and upgrade my Pillars of Eternity Badge\", and I think this may be one of the rare cases where I got more than what I paid for. It's definitely worth it at full price. I'm not saying this will be the GOTY, to be sure, and I don't mean to exaggerate the qualities of this game, but it's a very fun and intelligent game, and I'd recommend it with no reservations.", "timestamp_created": 1596889136, "timestamp_updated": 1596889136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60459977388381958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73954478": {"recommendationid": "73954478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004628500", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1697683567}, "language": "english", "review": "For a fiver?

The biggest difference is how many turn resets you get, which allows one to make plenty of mistakes at first. The other difference is how quickly the AI gets aggressive.

Other than the highest level (which removes vision cones), there's no huge jump or wall. \n\nIt took me about 50 hours to get good enough for that final winning run and that was with a specific starting team.

Gameplay is heavily reliant on the equipment and hacking programs you find which, combined with random loot and the fact most items you find are in the useless to heavily situational range, makes it hard to assemble even a half-decent loadout. You could spend 5+ turns stealing a decryption key and decrypting a program only to find out you already have it and you won't be even able to sell the extra one, effectively wasting your time and most likely making it way harder to run away in the process. The procedurally generated levels range from challenging enough to fuck-you frustrating, with guards you can't divert nor KO (because you didn't get any useful drops in the previous missions) blocking your way through or out of the level. One of the most ridiculous mechanics is the way weapons are handled. Weapons have magazines with 1 or 2 bullets and to reload you need to carry 1 bullet magazines with you, which means 1 bullet takes up one out of the 3-4 (starting value, max 7 after purchasing skill upgrades) item slots you have, the same amount of space a sniper rifle does, provided you can even find a shop with ammo. Not to mention that you'll have a hard time even knocking someone out in the late game, unless very lucky with loot, as the lethal weapons either kill or are completely useless, no inbetween, not even a stagger. Non-lethal weapons get the preferential treatment, making them way more useful and a staple early game, but most are also rendered ineffective late game. Instead of making aggressive gameplay more challenging and/or less profitable, the game simply makes it for the most part unviable and highly inefficient. If you don't have the luck of assembling a good cloaking/teleporting/diverting loadout early in the game, your suffering will grow the further you go. I really wanted to love this game, the visual design is beautiful and there are some really great gameplay elements to it.

It's incredibly entertaining, and after I got the hold of the mechanics (it took me a couple restarts, but I got there) I really was loving it. It's basically a non-lethal version of X-Com where most of your combat is done with stun guns and tasers. You're actually punished for causing casualties (which I managed to do by hacking a turret which then killed a guard. That cost me 50 bucks. A little annoying since I didn't know that would happen.) I appreciate that there isn't the X-Com mechanics of critical failures when it comes to attacks, so you'll never try to KO a guard and just miss despite standing right beside them. \n\nThe game makes you make some interesting choices, which I didn't anticipate. I had my main hacker out doing his work, when suddenly the security got beefed up and I didn't have enough power to finish. This forced me to bring out one of my other agents, who was safely waiting on the launch pad, to go back out and find more power sources to hack. The risk and challenge of that was super fun. The guards are pretty hilariously stupid, with some of them spotting you and entering overwatch, but if you just shut the door in between the two of you they give a comical \"Guess they got away.\" The existence of cloaking devices also gives you another way out if you should need it. I can't recommend those enough.\n\nThe voice acting is really well done, and I enjoyed all the characters, as flat as they may be. There's some fun dialogue only stuff that comes up before missions that was pretty funny, and helped flesh out the agents relationships between each other. There's also a reference to I Can Haz memes, though, so that kind of made me want to die. \n\nOverall, extremely fun game!

The gameplay seems simple in concept but enjoyably complicated in execution: agents must remain out of sight and complete their assignment without dying. Players are not given any information about the layout of the map beforehand, and every single level is randomly generated, allowing for a large amount of replay value.\n\nPlayers must focus on remaining unseen by enemies using cover and intelligent movement, with nearly no options to deal with direct combat. Money and items must be stolen during missions, with an occasional offer from the vendor Monst3r, but not very often. This is the more pure form of risk / reward possible in a game, and makes the player consider if they should prioritize the objective or send an agent to loot a safe or nano-fabricator surrounded by enemy patrols. Every safe, nanofab, or server terminal missed could have been an immensely helpful asset to your missions moving forward.\n\n[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Very comprehensive core stealth gameplay.\n\n[*] Challenges the player to overcome obstacles and make critical decisions, creating a rewarding experience to overcome in every mission.\n\n[*] The usefulness of obtaining as much extra loot as possible gives more motivation to take risks, which in turn gives more depth to the gameplay.\n\n[*] Every enemy corporation has their own style of security and enemies, which lets an intelligent player adapt to the enemy at hand before even entering a mission.\n\n[*] The stylized visuals add a good feel to the game, and the music is pleasant to listen to, ramping up in intensity in response to intense situations a player may encounter.\n\n[*] The DLC [u]Contingency Plan[/u] adds additional time and missions onto the campaign, which I very much enjoyed. This was the only part of the DLC I liked.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] All of the loot, map layouts, and security systems are completely random. This means the difficulty of a specific playthrough can be heavily variable, and not always in a good way.\n\n[*] If the \u201cRestarts Allowed\u201d option is not enabled, your entire playthrough can be completely ended by a single mission with bad luck. This is one of the most infuriating mechanics a game can have, and is never a good feature to have. Unless you enjoy the thrill of a sudden game over looming around every corner, always enable restarts.\n\n[*] Most of the content enabled by the DLC, [u]Contingency Plan[/u], is not worth the price. The items and augments added are sub-par, while the enemies and security programs are much more punishing than those of vanilla. Essentially, it just adds more obstacles without giving you the tools to overcome these new challenges.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Short Conclusion: Recommended\n(Not Recommended for those that get frustrated easily)[/h1]\n\n[h1][u]In-Depth Analysis[/u][/h1]\n\n [h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs previously mentioned, [u]Invisible, Inc.[/u] is a turn-based stealth game. The player controls agents on the field and are instructed to complete various objectives of the player\u2019s choosing. While the map of which missions are available is randomly generated, the types of missions are consistent. There are detention centers, which can house allied agents ready to be rescued, or vault jobs that require access codes obtained from chief financial suite missions. The player must make the choice of which missions to enter based on what resources they think they require. Do you need more money? Do a vault job. Do you need tools? Break into a location with an advanced Nanofabricator. The choice is up to you, and each choice maters.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134476653\n\nGameplay revolves around movement on a top-down viewed grid, with a focus on agent placement and avoiding enemy patrols & sightlines. Agents are given a limited amount of Action Points (AP), which determines their possible movement, along with other actions like predicting the movement of security forces. Not properly planning your AP can quickly leave you in hot water you might not be able to get out of. \n\nEnemy sightlines are indicated by the familiar cone of view, with special highlights to indicate areas that are watched, areas that are hidden from view, and areas that are just out of sight which will cause enemies to investigate. Line of sight is affected by objects strewn around the map, walls, and doors. Placement of your agents to avoid being seen during the enemy\u2019s turn is critical to success.\n\nWhile the art style is pleasant to look at, there is also a tactical view available at the tap of a button (Alt by default) that removes all extra distractions and shows just the raw info on the situation, like walls, doors, enemies, and cover.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134475092\n\nAnother crucial aspect of the gameplay is your AI, Incognita, responsible for hacking into enemy security systems. Her programs allow her to take down firewalls on enemy objects, like cameras and nanofabricators. These programs require Power (PWR) and cannot function without the necessary amount. PWR can be found throughout consoles, but there are a limited amount per level. Enemy devices can also contain Daemons, which give negative debuffs to Incognita for a short amount of time if triggered. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is good, but not very present. The premise is a world conquered by powerful, militaristic corporations, and the player works for an agency called Invisible that attempts to fight back. Invisible is caught off-guard during a raid and left with little resources, having to steal and evade the corporations in their attempt to salvage the agency.\n\nThis story is only told through very brief dialogues and limited cutscenes, which leave much to be desired. There is also data available in a few other ways, such as agent descriptions, but not enough to be satisfying. I wish there was more.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe stylized top-down view adds a lot to the gameplay, and the choice to not allow sight in areas that cannot be seen by a camera or agent puts pressure on the player to remember important information they can\u2019t necessarily see at the moment. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720632627\n\nThe art style is also quite good, with sharp angles and emphasis on advanced technology giving the intended feel of a corporate-run dystopia. I find it quite enjoyable.\n\nHowever, the few cutscenes in the game seem to lack something to make them look particularly good. As it stands, they are just a cut below good, but are still decent enough to not detract from the experience.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe voice acting is competent and crisp, with only a few lapses in quality during skippable cutscenes.\n\nThe music is great and ramps up in intensity when the game becomes more intense, starting out calm when the enemies are unaware but becomes incrementally more intense as more enemies become aware of your intrusion letting the player really get into the groove of the situation. \n\n[h1]Technical[/h1]\n[u]Specs:[/u] GeForce 840m 2GB, 8GB Memory, i7 CPU, Windows 8.1\n\nI encountered zero problems playing this game in 1080p with a good framerate.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Invisible, Inc.[/u] is a great turn-based stealth game with a great atmosphere that sadly suffers from fits of terrible bad luck that can ruin the experience. Still, when the game isn\u2019t screwing you with bad RNG, it is very enjoyable, and a satisfying challenge to overcome every time I boot it up.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/23741321]Follow our curator page[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1592607309, "timestamp_updated": 1592613138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839042961597442627", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71038545": {"recommendationid": "71038545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198070030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1659369069}, "language": "english", "review": "Absoluteley KLEI!

The stealth focus is a genius addition to the format, and more turn based strategy games need non-lethal options. You can kill guards in this game, but it's more trouble than it's worth. And stealing everything right under the noses of guards who don't know you're there is infinitely more satisfying, anyway. Playing as a group of outlaws, ripping off giant corporations is also incredibly satisfying.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, tough, and thrilling game of stealth and theft, pick this game up. The characters are great. The world is interesting. The missions are tense and exciting. The difficulty options are extensive, enabling you to play how you want. You can have nail biting tension every second or just a chill time cracking safes. Depends on how you set up the game. And once you've played through it a few times, get the Contingency Plan DLC, it adds a bunch more challenges and lengthens the main campaign.

XCOM: EU was like that. Your best option was to move a little, hide, and end your turn on Overwatch. It dragged the gameplay down and missions took longer than they needed to. XCOM 2 attempted to fix this by adding a mission timer; if you didn't finish the objective in X turns, you lost. This motivated more aggressive, dynamic combat, which is more fun, but it also more frustrating, and it drew many complaints. Losing a mission because it took one turn too many to blow up an objective just sucks. One of the most popular mods for XCOM 2 just outright disables the turn timer.\n\nInstead of making you fail if you're too slow, Invisible Inc. slowly ramps up the difficulty. Every five turns, the alarm increases one level, making the mission slightly more difficult. At first it just inconveniences you (new cameras, better firewalls), but later it starts spawning in new guards with new patrols, all while teasing you with upgrade stations and corporate safes full of credits. It shifts your train of thought from \"How do I complete the objective as fast as possible?\" to \"How far can I push my luck and still complete the objective?\" which is infinitely more satisfying. It's up to you where you draw the line, which makes success more gratifying and failure more personal. Screw the \"missed a 95% chance to hit\" stuff. Your favorite agent died because you got too greedy.\n\nIt's a Klei game, so the graphics, music, and voice acting are all top notch. Story line is extremely basic and doesn't distract from letting you do what you want. Zero time-wasting cutscenes between missions (you'll get some story banter but you can skip right through it in a few seconds). No cringy or annoying NPCs. Runs great on your potato laptop.\n\nMy only complaint is that it's hard to tell where stuff is in rooms sometimes because walls/objects become invisible when you're facing them so you can see the room easier. It's great visually but results in a good bit of camera spinning in smaller areas to figure out where stuff is, buuuuut XCOM does the same thing so it's not a big deal.\n\nAbsolutely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1592164941, "timestamp_updated": 1592164941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796378433704376221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70759934": {"recommendationid": "70759934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034991158", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1532152195}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game from very good developers", "timestamp_created": 1592113609, "timestamp_updated": 1592113609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494125783443450928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70729505": {"recommendationid": "70729505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049218098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1178, "last_played": 1593989042}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good turn-based strategy game with great soundtrack and artwork.

I did win the game on beginner level, but that was because I had found an armor-piercing weapon.

Maps are proceduraly generated as well, which helps make every campaign fresh and challenging in its own way.\nWhile the levels aren't too different from one another visually, the layout of the rooms and security personnel/equipment is where the variety really shines. You may think you've understood how hopping from cover to cover and drawing attention when necessary can define your success in a mission, until you come across a room which has two turrets you can hack to shoot down pursuers until they run dry on ammo.\n\nIn true cyber-punk fashion, the game takes place in two planes, the physical and the digital.\nThroughout your missions, hacking is done via your AI, which can be used just as strategically as your agents. From disabling cameras to unlocking mid-level stores, everything is measured against the current alarm level (which gradually disrupts your plans the higher it gets, by adding guards or defence subsystems). \nThe over-all threat of each mission is based on its difficulty level, which is at the heart of the risk/reward cycle you follow until reaching the final mission (harder missions early could help you gear-up stronger for the final mission, but could also straight-up whipe your team before you even get the chance to use your shiny, new sub-dermal invisibility implant). The game has quite a few settings for defining exactly how hard-core you feel your next run should be (enabling saving, re-tries and amount of different kinds of defences or impacts on alarm levels, etc.).\n\nThe final level took me quite a few tries, each of which devloped quite epically and uniquelly.\nIn fact, that final victory really did bring up a lot of the reasons I find the game so enjoyable.\nI don't tend to write many reviews, but, honestly, this last mission really convinced me to try and let people know about Invisible Inc.\n\nI had teleported into the most heavily guarded location I'd ever been to in that campaign, and my rag-tag group of cyber-punk agents had already broken through innumerable digital defences in order to allow our expert to access a specific comm-link. The guards hadn't exactly seen anyone rummaging about their military base just yet, but most already had a sunken feeling that something was off. When the first signs of fowl-play began pouring into their ear-pieces, my guys knew they had to divert attention from our hacker, and meticulously spotted one another jumping in and out of cover. We led them into parallel wild goose chases, purposefully triggering cameras, chucking smoke granades, and shooting paralizer darts in the most guerilla of fashions. Two of our agents lay dead on the ground, one of which had all of our remaining medical equipment. The others were quickly getting cornered by the guards that kept pouring in through various teleporters scattered around the map. However, hope was not lost, our hacker had carefully dashed his was to the final comm-link, and was typing and panting over its console. Every second counted, agent Dr. Xu had jumped behind a box with a needle to his chest, frigthened and in a cold sweat, but significantly less murdered. Agent Banks had just blown the fuses of her invisible cammo to flee from a group of guards in hot pursuit. She ducked behind one of the few pieces of cover in a cramped room, and had nowhere left to slip to as a dozen guards were closing in. As they basically breathed down her neck, Nika kicked down the door, only to become invisible herself, momentarily stunning and drawing the guards to investigate the ghostly disappearance they'd witnessed. My invisible couple, Banks and Nika, had just played their final hand, this was only a momentary feign, and they were still cornered and helpless. Suddenly, the final key was struck, the door had open, and our mission was finished. As the ending sequence was playing, I could imagine each the relief in each of my agents' faces, knowing all the preparation paid off. I won't go into anything specific, so as not to spoil any bit of story, but it truly felt like my guys beat the odds, and that a single extra turn could have meant certain tragedy.", "timestamp_created": 1586391269, "timestamp_updated": 1586391269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66865831": {"recommendationid": "66865831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090284933", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 14303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5804, "last_played": 1680817320}, "language": "english", "review": "Noice", "timestamp_created": 1586320332, "timestamp_updated": 1586320332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66861705": {"recommendationid": "66861705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002484122", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 101751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1697336783}, "language": "english", "review": "Great stealth game.

This being more of a puzzle game then Xcom does not have that problem. you will lose if you do not act with care. Stealth is the key here, and what sets it apart from the other games it shares parts with. Threats can not really be removed, they can only be subdued or avoided, and only so much so in both cases.\n\nStory. The story is nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done as far as giving you direction. Its real main purpose is to give your run an end point.\n\nOverall, I find myself wanting to come back to this game even after beating it. Even years later it is still installed on my PC as it is a true best in class experience. Even if its class is rather small, I know that other games would come nowhere close to how well put together this game is.\n\nWhile Klei Entertainment is best known for Don't Starve, this is to me their best game.", "timestamp_created": 1585596022, "timestamp_updated": 1585596022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66119674": {"recommendationid": "66119674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813855891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2156, "last_played": 1578741409}, "language": "english", "review": "The perfect combination of Turn-based and Stealth easily makes this one of the best creation of Klei Entertainment to date (Even though this is the first and only game I've played from them so far lol). Seriously though, it has some of the most intense and engaging gameplay I have ever experienced. Every moves need to be heavily considered before executing them, and that feeling after finishing a mission without messing anything up is nothing but amazing. In my opinion, Invisible, Inc. is the best Turn-based Stealth game on the market right now, and I don't think there would be one in the same genre that could top this in the near future either.\n \n[b] The Story: [/b] I don't have much to complain about the story. It is pretty simple, and most of the plot was explained at the beginning of the game. There's one issue though, the ending is not really satisfied because it made me wonder what will happen next, and the fact that there probably won't be a sequel anytime soon annoys me even more. Pretty decent story nonetheless.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b] There are so many things to talk about the gameplay, so I will try to keep it as compact as possible. As a Turn-based game, you will use action points (AP) for your agents in order to finish your main objective. You also gain access to Incognita, an AI system that can hack devices in the facility using power (PWR) to help the agents stay hidden under camera surveillance or interact with other objects. However, AP and PWR are very limited each turns, so you need to calculate where the agents should go, or what devices you should hack. Stealth is a very big factor in this game, so sneaking around guards and drones, or using non lethal actions against them is your best option, rushing through a level without thinking will get things out of control real quick. You also need to pay attention to the Security Level, as each turn passes by, there will be more security measures applied, thus making the mission harder to complete. Try to execute each moves as safely and as efficient as possible, and you wont have much problems in the long run. After each missions, you can upgrade your agents with the credits you stole in the facility to make them faster, stronger, hack better, or steal more. The game has a very high replay value because of the procedural generation system for the map, so every missions will feel different each time you play, which makes the whole stealth aspect of the game more meaningful. In short, the gameplay of Invisible, Inc. is challenging but high rewarding if you know what you're doing, and you will spend countless hours with it if you're experienced enough.\n\n[b] Sound: [/b] Solid voice acting, nothing bad to say at all. The soundtracks on the other hand are very good and fit in with the overall theme. You can feel the tension, the stealthiness, and even a bit of cyberpunk every time you listen to them in the background while doing a mission. Perfect soundtracks for this game I must say.\n\n[b] The DLCs: [/b] I recommend you buy the Contingency Plan DLC to play along with the main game, it adds more agents, weapons, enemy types, and an extended campaign if you want to get more out of the main story. Totally worth it in my book.\n\n[b] The Negatives: [/b] The biggest problem I have with this game weirdly enough is actually its gameplay. As fun and engaging the gameplay is, it has also caused so much stress and anxiety to me. If you see the nearly 36 hours of game time that I spent on this game, you're probably thinking I have played through this 2 or 3 times already, but weirdly enough that was the total time for my first playthrough only. It took me too much time thinking about each moves I was about to make, and I freaked out when I did something wrong or clicked the wrong buttons, which happened quite a lot.

I was always a fan of the idea of stealth games, but never the actual game play. The reason? Because in all of them you could save your game. This may not seem problematic, but then add a lack of self control on my part and getting discovered by a guard 9 times out of 10 would end in me reloading the last save. Suspense never survives a tight load/save loop, and thus my experience of stealth games in general has always been rather dry. You might argue that I should just [b]not[/b] load my game, but then you have another problem. Most of these games have been designed and balanced with the save load cycle in mind, trying to ironman your way through such a game [b]not[/b] fun.\n\nInvisible Inc fixes this by modelling itself on a roguelike. When you fail you have to start from scratch, but variety is maintained through procedural generation. Add this and, suddenly, stealth games make sense again. There is actually suspense! This isn't modelling your perfect save loop engineered heist. You're going to make mistakes, things are going to escalate, your going to think it's all over, but then somehow against all odds bungle your way limping to the exit. And it's going to feel great.\n\nDid I mention that the rest of the game is superbly designed and balanced?

There's a lot of great art, and it seems really well thought through (plus, who doesn't love spies?). My issue t's too long in the wrong way, and the consequences this has. Maybe I'm just too slow, but games take an 1.5 hours and that's about only 6 missions. I don't mind the 1.5 hours part, but 15 minute missions feel too slow. Even when I tried to get out as fast as possible they still take 10 minutes so for the majority of the game it doesn't feel like you're progressing at all. There also aren't enough rewards to missions. I basically can upgrade 1 or two stats max (and maybe buy something if you're lucky). Furthermore, it's too punishing. I'm usually a big fan of punishing (Geometry Dash, FTL, and BABA IS YOU are some of my favorite video games), but not when a run takes 1.5 hours. If I'm 1.5 hours into a game, I do NOT want die because some guard walked in to and found one of my characters in a corner or the alarm got up to 4 and  there's too many guards to move anywhere. The give you some nice features to cope with this (like observing guard movement and such) but I don't think it will ever be enough with the game length. Because of this, it's also too stressful. Even turning off alarm auto-increment didn't help much.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong story short, if the missions took 5 minutes (I think the best way to do this would be to give the player the location of the object and the exit, and make corporate safes a bit more optional but contain more stuff) and the alarm system was reworked, this would be an awesome game.

In xcom, the research tree plays off the tactical missions by allowing you to gain mastery over tactical enemies, a dimension that is missing in this game.  The way you progress here, by randomly finding weaponry off guards or machines, does not feel fun.  Rather than looking forward to future tactical missions because I gained some weapon upgrade like in xcom, I dread fighting the next tactical battle.  \n\nAlso, while I appreciate the attempt at making a game focused on stealth, the end-product just does not feel right.

There have been times I've played other strategy games and was disappointed with the options available other than \u201ckill them all in as few turns as possible because they will only attempt to kill you.\u201d This game scratches that itch, somewhat.\n\nIt's not to say the game is bad. It really isn't. But it's also not amazing. The UI seems a bit cluttered, which is strange because there isn't much going on in the UI. My main gripe is that the game wants you to play claustrophobicly close to the characters. But with large or tall levels scrolling with the keyboard or mouse feels unresponsive. This issue is more apparent with hostile movements being globally represented on the map with subtle sound wave indicators. The game doesn't ever take control of your camera, so if you encountered 5 guards 6 rooms down hunting you, the movement hints will be often off screen. \n\nAnother big issue with the UI is that it also struggles with pacing. I'm either at the end game or firmly in the mid game at the time of writing. And the number of intractable objects in the level is getting quite high. I was quite frustrated when I had a mission that required I split my party to interact with two objects on the same turn. Only to move one before I had clicked the button to interact. This is frustrating because it's very easy for me to overlook. Because the interaction bar pops up only on the prop, inline with other default actions. This again can simply appear off screen based on your camera positioning.\n\nDespite these faults, the game does an excellent job at selling the stealth angle! Doors can be opened and closed to manipulate enemy AI, leading them through empty rooms and buying your team time. You can peak through even locked doors and around corners to plan your approach. The game is also very friendly to easily frustrated players like myself. It offers an arguably game breakingly powerful do-over mechanic. Depending on the difficulty you can have quite a few, and I often go the entire level without even knowing I had it. The game's RNG determinations are made at the level generation, so if left to act without player interference. The enemy AI will always behave as it would have before the do-over, part of why the mechanic is powerful.\n\nMost important to the game's core gameplay loop, is both a short term and long term resource scarcity mechanic. In every level you have two main means of generating power for the AI to hack discovered props, such as doors, sentries, safes, and vendors. In the short term, each levels starts you with some power. The AI character that uses the power has two abilities at the start of the game, and these consume power to effect the level. Usually to take over hostile resources such as cameras, safes, vendors, ect... But in each level there are vendors that once hacked can be used to purchase items, abilities, occasionally high level items, or even more abilities for the AI. After each level you are awarded an invoice of your performance and score. As well as the option to upgrade your characters with long term upgrades. It didn't take long for me to convert a spy into a guard neutralizing, map sprinting, invisible juggernaut with items for any situation.\n\nThis is a very fun game. It's a bit rough around the edges, but the voice acting is of good quality, the level design feels fair, and it really makes you feel like a futuristic spy.

The problem was, perhaps, my expectations.\n\nComing from the Harebrained Shadowrun games I was expecting something somewhat similar, and what you get here may look like that at first sight but it only takes one or two missions to realize that's really not the case.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game is built around replayability. An entire campaign took me about 6 hours, granted that was on the beginner mode difficulty. You are meant to replay it several times and on harder difficulties just so you can challenge yourself but it honestly doesn't interest me in the least.\n\nThere's little to no character development for your agents (I mean this, I wouldn't be surprised if they have less than 5 lines of dialogue each and it's only on mission start to make some witty remark like \"lets do this so I can go drink\"). There are only two cinematics (first and last mission) and the story being told here is bare bones and can't be compared to any other similar title without outright saying it's bad.\n\nGameplay is more like XCOM than Shadowrun. Centered around a handful (maybe two handfuls) of short missions without much influence in the story itself. You just go around invading corporate installations so you can get money and items to upgrade your agents. It puzzles me that they decided to make the leveling up and gear acquisition dependent of the same resource. You are forced to choose between buying better items or upgrading your character's stats. Those mechanics should have been separate. It's also mind boggling why you'd need to spend money on \"fabricators\" or other \"kiosks\"you hack during missions in order for them to build/program your stuff. I mean, what's the point of fighting the Big Bad Corporations if you are still going to pay them for things? It leads to ridiculous situations where you may take a mission specifically meant for you to \"acquire\" gear from a special fabricator kiosk just for you to get there and realize you can't buy without gimping your character progression (if you can afford anything at all).\n\nInventory management is also a complete pain, with most characters only being able to carry 4 or 5 items (depends on your stats, which I remind you require money to upgrade) regardless of their type. The problem here is that all items occupy the same slots, so if you carry a gun or a keycard, both \"weigh\" the same and encumber your character in the same manner if you go over capacity. This is increasingly bothersome when you consider melee weapons have long cooldowns (meaning you can only use them every 3 or so turns at best) and ranged ones come with extremely limited ammo (2 bullets? really? you are going to raid a megacorp installation with 2 bullets?). Sure, you can bring along \"weapon recharge items\", which are consumable and occupy one of your precious and limited slots. There's the problem of limited storage as well, as you can only keep 4 or 5 items saved at your \"base\" between runs. By the way \"your base\" is the mission selection screen, there's no actual hub.\n\nOverall, I felt rushed through the entire game. You go from mission to mission with the only objective of getting credits so you can buy gear or upgrade stats. Sure, you could say that's pretty much any game, but there's really nothing behind that requirement motivating you to \"get gud\". Without a story or characters backing up all that prodding, I think I would have quit without finishing even one campaign if it had lasted much longer. Even on the last mission the main strategy was \"sitting\" on top of downed enemies so they wouldn't get up again while one or two characters did all the heavy lifting.\n\nNow, without spoilers, I'll say that I found the ending disappointing. It's actually quite remarkable that with so little story telling they managed to cramp so much foreshadowing during the last mission alone that it made the outcome extremely predictable. The sad part is that it could have worked out had it been just the first arc of the story. It left me feeling like I had played a demo and not a full game.\n\nSo well, in the end I can't recommend Invisible Inc to the overall public. Specially if you are looking for something Shadowrun-ish or X-COM like. It has none of the story and character of the first and none of the deep tactical gameplay of the latter. It's \"complex\" mechanics are, as I've mentioned, poorly thought out and cumbersome instead of entertaining.\n\nIf, however, every complaint I made sounds totally fine to you (which is completely possible), then you may actually enjoy Invisible Inc for what is and you might want to give it a shot.\n\nIt's not a bad game.

It's part [i]XCOM[/i], part [i]Into the Breach:[/i] there's no randomness in numbers, and you can get all the information you need (like guard routes). However, to spy on them efficiently, you need to take risks and scout ahead... which is dangerous.\n\nThe game is balanced perfectly. The alarm is constantly rising, pressuring you out of overly cautious playstyle, but get too cocky\u2014and you get wiped. Unlike [i]XCOM[/i], you can't really clear the level: you stun enemies instead of killing them, and if you dawdle, they'll come to and set after you from behind. The tension becomes very real, very quickly.\n\nThe visuals are clear and memorable, the characters likeable, and the music pleasant. The only downsides I can think of is that the rules of vision become complicated sometimes (it might be hard to figure out in a crowded room if your hiding place will fall into a guard's field of vision as they move); and also that your success heavily depends on the random level generation: if the two objectives of the last mission are in two different ends of the map, you'll be heavily disadvantaged compared to someone who gets them close.\n\nThen again, the latter is balanced by how short the campaign is. If you fail\u2014which you will\u2014you won't feel like you've lost a ton of progress, and starting over doesn't feel like a chore.\n\nAll in all, a great tactical game for anyone who loves to think on the grid and plan their every step.

It looks beautiful and there are a lot of cool toys. Was fun for a playthrough before Contingency Plan, was fun for a playthrough after Contingency Plan, especially when I figured out how to kite guards. However, the poor communication of audio range, general fiddliness, and lack of content variety got me bored pretty quickly.\n\nThe draw of most roguelikes is that you're mitigating randomness by putting together a strategy on the fly with whatever you find. Although Invisible Inc. does have a lot of random stuff going on, a dominant playstyle emerges: every agent should have a cloak, a neural disrupter, and a stim: all other items are excessively situational. Later on you should have paralyzers and AP as well. Your designated paperweight agent should be dragging a KOed guard above another KOed guard somewhere out-of-sight, so that you can keep two knocked out guards out of the rotation indefinitely. PWR is disabled cameras and unlocked safes, so have some way of generating a lot. You should avoid guards and get as far into the facility as you can before you can't avoid knocking more guards out, at which point you're a few turns away from escaping and cut bait. \n\nWithin this playstyle (which, by the way, doesn't really change when you're playing endless), you're solving the same puzzle over and over again: how do I get across this room without alerting a guard? And figuring out line of sight for guards in motion is, while super deterministic, annoying as heck. \n\nThe game punishes you severely for deviating from The One True Playstyle. Don't kill people -- you'll raise the alarm. Don't bust daemons unless you know what they are or have to -- you'll screw yourself over. Don't hack the robots unless you have to -- it'll alert them. Don't use wacky consumables: they waste space and your inventory slots are precious. Creativity is limited to kiting guards around to let other people deeper into the facility, which was entertaining for about an hour -- and I think that's the main problem. When it comes to risk-reward in this game, there's no incentive to do anything remotely interesting: by doing so, you're taking on unnecessary risk, fighting the game every step of the way.

You start with two characters with preset starting equipment and pick from random missions with randomly generated levels.  I really like how everything is predictable (literally, actually, you can spend an action point to predict a guards movement if you can see him).  No random chance to hit, random damage, or any of that - plus you can tell exactly what an action will do before you do it.  The only thing random is the map generation - (well, that and some passive boosts you can get).  You never know where the objective will be or where the exit will be when you start a level.  What makes the game difficult is that you're outnumbered, outgunned, enemies will start spawning/respawning if you're taking too long or if you're triggering alarms, and knocking out guards can cost you, since they wake back up and start panicking - killing them is often expensive and will trip alarms if you don't hack their heart monitors as well.  You constantly need to strike the right balance between moving quickly and cautiously, which makes the game tense.\n\nThat being said, it's tense but fair, and you can always just play on a lower difficulty if you find it too tense or too difficult.  Playing your first game on the easiest difficulty is strongly advised, since the mechanics are very complex and you often have to take advantage of every possible opportunity that the game's features give you, if you're playing on normal.\n\n(All that being said, it's pretty ridiculous that you can hide behind a standing lamp or a chair in the middle of the room and not get seen by a passing guard)\n\nTL;DR  It's a great tactical, turn-based stealth game that doesn't have the built-in frustration of thing like random chance to hit or random damage.", "timestamp_created": 1562014618, "timestamp_updated": 1562014618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509202480316162109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52920554": {"recommendationid": "52920554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074659757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5234, "last_played": 1563583837}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably one of the only x-com style turn based stealth game worth mentioning out there.

The art direction gives every environment a sleek, beautiful minimalism. The characters are sharp and angular, each expressing a different flavour of neo-noir [i] coolness [/i]. Hell, even the title: Invisible, Inc. - is unique and embodies its own special style. The aesthetic is fantastic.\nBut the aesthetic of a game doesn't matter nearly so much as its gameplay. Invisible's gameplay can best be described as XCOM 2, but with tactical stealth instead of tactical combat.\nIn each run, you move a vehicle around a wireframe map, jumping from mission to mission. Each mission offers a different objective and a different reward, preparing you for the game's final gauntlet. Along the way, your agents gain new gadgets and cyber-augments to add a little flavour to every run.\nBut what about that gameplay? Turn-based stealth? Have you ever played a turn based stealth game? Chances are, no. Does it work?\nSurprisingly, yes. Missions begin almost puzzle-like, with you trying to discover the safest path from point A to B, weaving your agents between the vision cones of unaware security guards. Despite the thinness of said cones, and the player's ability to control security cameras to keep tabs on enemies, There's never the feeling of being in total control, thanks to some clever information control, hiding crucial information from the player that keeps them guessing.\nThe pressure is kept up by the alarm meter, forcing you to always keep your finger on the pulse. As it ticks up, more reinforcements are spawned and the system begins detecting the positions of your agents. There's never a game over when it gets too high, but the enemies never stop, and on a long enough timescale the odds of survival always drop to zero. The clock forces you to play in a more engaging way. As it ticks up and the mission gets longer, you start taking risks - crossing more ground in a single turn, toeing the very edge of enemy vision cones, hacking into equipment even though doing so will spawn virus programs with unknown effects.\nThe game isn't a perfect puzzle anymore, but an exercise of risk-taking and damage control. The game is most tense when you end your turn with an agent in the open, holding your breath and hoping that a guard doesn't walk out from any of those unscouted doors and spot them in the middle of the room. You're never in control, and the clock is always ticking. Things will go wrong, but you should embrace that - narrow escapes are some of the game's best moments.\n\nThe game is damaged by one small mechanic. During each run, one of the game's mission types has you breaking into a holding cell to rescure another agent. If you get them out, they'll join your crew, and you'll have three pairs of hands to work with intead of two. This sounds cool, but in practice hurts the balance of the mechanics quite a lot. An extra agent is an extremely powerful buff. That's 50% more scouting, 50% more looting, and 50% more enemy takedowns every turn. Getting an agent early is extremely helpful for your run - but if you aren't lucky enough to have that mission type spawn early on, your run is going to be significantly more difficult, making an otherwise pretty fair game fairly reliant on RNG. The game's action economy also falls apart completely the more agents you add. With four agents, the maps become far too claustrophobic for them all to have a use: it's rare to be exploring four different rooms at once, and if you need to kill four guards in a single turn, that mission has probably gone so deep to hell that no amount of agents will pull it back out.\nInstead,  while the other agents do the real work, one is usually assigned to 'corpse duty', moving back and forth to transport unconscious bodies to out-of-reach locations, occasionally re-stunning them to prevent them waking up. Micromanaging an agent on corpse duty is one of the most repetitive and least engaging things in the game.\n\nOverall, however, the extra agent problem doesn't destroy the experience unless you're really looking for it to.\nOnto other things: The story, like most cyberpunk plots, is  cut-down and reassembled from Neuromancer - godlike AI, meddling corporations, etc. It's extremely simple, but it's told well, and it accomplishes what it intended, so it's a pass in my books.\nThe game is less encouraging of creative playstyles as it could be, and it does kind of funnel you into a certain pattern, but as that pattern is inherently fun to engage with, I had (and hopefully will continue to have) plenty of fun with it over my playtime.

Not only that but the studio, Klei Entertainment, created possibly the best 2D stealth game I've ever played, \"Mark of the Ninja\" (2012). So I purchased Invisible, Inc. on sale and sunk about 8 hours into it. The game does a fairlly good introduction tutorial of the game's rules and navigation. But as you get deeper into the world, you'll soon see the cracks in the design. This game is too unforgiving and the fun depletes the more you progress.\n\nStarting with the positives, this game looks and feels right. The unique art style is similar to other Klei Entertainment titles. There is the thrill of completing a stage just in the nick of time. Looting the entire stage of all its treasure is particularly satisfying since it is quite difficult to do in later stages. The core concept is simple and well thought out. It's the execution that leaves me wanting.\n\nThe procedurally generated levels don't make much sense. I feel like the developers wanted to implement this in order to have an infinite amount of replayability for the player, but sometimes the stages will drastically differ in fairness. One stage I encountered had the target and the escape elevator side by side, creating a very simple stage to complete. While another stage generated was a labyrinth of doors that lead to rooms the size of tiny closets. Stages like these feel ridiculous and unfair. It doesn't help that doors and walls can sometimes get muddled together, such that enemy line of sight is unclear. I would have preferred a set of levels designed by the developer and perhaps a game level editor that players could share amongst themselves.\n\nThe game difficulty and other variables can be toggled at the beginning of the game. This is somewhat strange at first but after the first play-through you'll understand it. The one major thing I don't like about the difficulty is that every move you make in the game is a penalty. The enemy knows that you've broken into the base and the security levels increase each turn. Why is it designed this way? Isn't this supposed to be a stealth game? The title of game is \"Invisible, Inc.\". I know that the game wants to create some sort of tension, but it is highly unlikely that you can complete a level without physically encountering an enemy.\n\nThere's also a hacking element in the game. But when you hack there is a high chance that you will trigger some kind of alarm or penalty. I'd be okay with this if the game could show the percentage of risk involved, or some kind of mini game; however, it's all up to luck and no skill is involved. A missed opportunity. The loot isn't that good either. You'll constantly have to find energy, credits, and keycards, yet it never feels pleasurable once you find it.

It's the summit of moronic gameplay for the insane.\n\nOther annoyances: The game insists on having you go through every single dialog that they can throw every time you restart a level or a campaign. The game insists on having you restart said level or campaign and you can not just quit it after retiring your agency. The game has a fancy dimwit restart/save mechanic that is just aimed at maiming your experience playing it.

The essential training mission doesn't really help with some of the more complex environmental issues you encounter later on.  For example in later missions your AI hacking computer starts being threatened by Daemons.  What these are, how to handle them - played two levels with them present - still no idea.\n\n   Why don't I like it ?  Far too hard.\n\n   The five primary aggravating features are right from the start: -\n\n   1) No map on entry.  So you must find both your target and your exit route.  One or both will have security that will need to be deactivated elsewhere on the map before proceeding.  Quite often you've got to traverse to both ends of the map with security in the middle.  All this takes time.\n   2) Which you don't have.  Every turn raises the security level - every five turns more bad stuff comes your way - more expensive hacking, more guards.\n   3)  The default on taking out guards is a stun gun that incapacitates them for three turns.  That isn't long and means that the security then start aggressively hunting you.\n   4) Security are deadly.  If they see you and you can't take them out (need to be adjacent), or move to cover in one square you're down.  Both agents down - game/level over.  Also there's no option to restart a level until you fail it.\n   5)  Too fast escalation.  Every two or three missions another day passes, enemy security increases dramatically, whilst your agents differ little from their starting abilities.  I have a feeling if Day 3 does mark the game end it could also be a very short game albeit a very tense one.\n\n  It's an interesting concept and execution is good.  But compared to this the UFO/ X-Com games were relaxing and easy.\n\nS.x.\n\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1560086208, "timestamp_updated": 1560086208, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444649964570999146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51133617": {"recommendationid": "51133617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000016600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1560069904}, "language": "english", "review": "I probably should like this game, but I don't.

Mechanically, Invisible Inc is a turn-based stealth strategy game (often compared to X-COM) that has you using a collection of well-crafted mechanics to solve problems posed by procedurally generated maps.\n\nThese maps have main objectives based on the mission type and additional side objectives. Although only exiting is required to finish the mission, you will want to get the most out of every mission. So you must choose your missions' type based on your team's current strengths and weaknesses to prepare your team before the final mission.\n\nWhere Invisible Inc. struggles is in communicating its mechanics, the game's tutorial only teaches the bare minimum toolset. This is perhaps countered by the beginner difficulty, as it gives you ways to rewind turns and redo missions. Although this more hands-off approach might work in the long-term, it can make the player feel cheated when faced with a setback because of a mechanic the game never directly taught the player, or even worse, if the player never learns these systems, feel defeated.\n\nDespite this, if you have some patience to learn the finer details of the game, you'll be well rewarded. Once you have the full toolset, you'll be able to handle practically anything the game throws at you. Even seemingly impossible situations provided some good thought is put in, can be overcome.

Even simple movement animation will lag and stumble for the first ten minutes or so of the game, and I've never once seen a smooth KD animation.\n\nAll that being said, there really is no other game like it, and it's a welcome addition to my library.", "timestamp_created": 1554772904, "timestamp_updated": 1554772904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50037296": {"recommendationid": "50037296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203367746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1785, "last_played": 1651174285}, "language": "english", "review": "There is really nothing like it out there.

Really didn't see that coming.\n\nEmployee #2: Ha ha; I see what you did there, #1. Since it seems like we just revolutionized platformers by integrating stealth, what's next on our genre-transformation list?\n\nEmployee #1: Great question, #2. I'll chew on that while I'm rocking some \"X-Com.\"\n\nBoth employees stare at each other, then drop their cups and dash madly back to their desks. \n\nSeriously, though. What is it with Klei's ability to make an utterly brilliant game by offering formula of 'mash-up genre x + stealth?' It's like fusion food, but 100% good instead of just '50% different.' As with \"Mark of the Ninja,\" \"Invisible, Inc.\" is light on overall story but heavy on theme and atmosphere. Where \"Mark\" really makes the player feel like a ninja navigating a pseudo-futurisitic corporate world, \"Invisible\" instantly immerses the player in the role of a remote Operator for a group of infiltration experts in it's dystopian cyberpunk world. This engrossing experience isn't limited to the visuals and text, either: sound effects and music again play a critical role. Klei's ability to build compelling worlds, on every level (pun intended), rivals it's ability to make interesting, layered, enjoyable game play.\n\nOn the subject of game play, several reviewers have pointed out the difficulty of \"Invisible, Inc.\" While there is some merit to those observations, they are mostly exaggerated. Yes, the game has a learning curve and the challenge scaling is rather steep between difficulties. Turn-based tactical and stealth games both require the player to plan ahead while leaving room to adjust, but in different ways for each style of game. Contrary to popular belief, however, those skills don't overlap quite as much as you might think. It will take time to figure out how to blend them together effectively. It's not \"Dark Souls\" or \"Dead Cell\" difficult, but it is a rogue-like with all the commensurate challenges and frustrations that genre contains. For example, here's a rough breakdown of my play time through the first ~50 hours (note: all modes were run with the \"Contingency Plan\" DLC active):\n\n-Beginner Campaign completed successfully: ~14 hours. Yes, I'm slow. This included one mission replay during day 4 (where I was beaten quite soundly despite having a full team and 5 rewinds). Success on Day 7 was still messy. Started with Internationale + Decker. \n-Experienced Campaign completed successfully): ~30 hours. I mentioned I'm slow, right? Wasn't kidding. This included half a dozen failed attempts, one of which reached Day 4 (washed out on a different mission than in my Beginner playthrough). Final success on Day 7 was pretty clean. Finally figured out that I should experiment with different starting agents and programs. Who knew? For the record, Banks + Prism running with Fusion and Lockpick v 1.0 made for pretty smooth sailing.\n-Endless: ~4 hours. Two attempts, one of which went to Day 3 before I lost my team. Currently trying again with the 'proven' duo of Banks + Prism.\n\nWhile I'm a something of a novice in the turn-based tactics department, I am no stranger to stealth games. Because of that, I exptected to encounter success in reasonably short order. But before I could bask in victory, I had to fail. Repeatedly. I had to make mistakes. Many mistakes. And learn from them. Sometimes it took a while, but when I finally got the lesson through my thick skull, I was a better player for it. And getting good enough to finally surmount the wall I had been banging my head against was unbelievably gratifying. Exhilarating, really.\n\n8/10, two thumbs up.

It shares the same achievements, it shares the same problems. \nThe situations you are put into in this game are often enjoyable and often diverse.\n\nHowever, it suffers from the snowball effect that other roguelikes experience- A couple missions in and your either hanging tight or you've essentially already won the game. This is a gripe I have with FTL as well. Once you have found one of the 10ish insta-buy items, you can transition from stealth into just walking over the enemy without a single damn in the world. It reaches the point where you have like 3 trump cards sitting on each of your agents.\n\nThis brings into the issue of the game- The one true strategy is to just fucking kill everything, knock out every guard, and keep them pinned. For the latter half the game, 60% of the things your agents are going to be doing is holding a guard over another knocked out guard. Maybe occasionally you have to juggle them a bit, but you can just hold every guard in one room while one guy go does his thing. \n\nI think that the stealth mechanics and such actually play out quite well. Sometimes you have guards staring at walls but at least it compensates for the times that guards are staring at the spawn room. Mission difficulty   actually varies a lot, but I don't think that is a bad thing really. Risk management is definitely one of the strongest parts of this game- sometimes you just *shouldn't* do the objective.\n\nLike FTL and other roguelikes, this issue can definitely be alleviated with mods. These issues aren't really fixable but their impacts can be delayed. All in all, this game is the quintessential flawed roguelike. The visuals and soundtrack are also quite nice and add to the setting really well.

Al final, has perdido todo tu grupo y, aunque ganaste experiencia, toca volver a reiniciar el reloj para enfrentarse nuevamente a las mega-corporaciones que dominan el mundo. Esto es Invisible Inc, juego creado por la mega-corporaci\u00f3n Klei Entertaiment, el cual fue finalista en el Independent Games Festival bajo la categor\u00eda de \u00abExcelencia en dise\u00f1o\u00bb. Es el primer turn-based que desarrolla Klei y se notan los ecos provenientes de Xcom, pero mantiene su originalidad respecto a las mec\u00e1nicas.\n\n[h1] Historia: 8/10 [/h1]\nEn el 2074, las mega-corporaciones han tomado el poder global. Invisible Inc. es una agencia de esp\u00edas que, al principio, brindaba sus servicios a estas corporaciones: sus esp\u00edas se infiltraban y robaban informaci\u00f3n con ayuda de una inteligencia artificial llamada Incognita. Al iniciar la partida vemos que Invisible Inc. es atacada por las fuerzas de la corporaci\u00f3n y tienen que huir. Lastimosamente, huir conlleva sus consecuencias: s\u00f3lo logran escapar dos agentes, Monst3r y la l\u00edder de la agencia, quien se llev\u00f3 consigo a Incognita. Sin embargo, Incognita s\u00f3lo puede sobrevivir en un sistema inform\u00e1tico especialmente potente y, si no est\u00e1 conectada, s\u00f3lo sobrevivir\u00e1 72 horas. [spoiler] El objetivo es prepararse durante 72 horas para lograr el objetivo final: infiltrarse en la sede del enemigo donde podr\u00edan tener un sistema que soporte a Incognita. Al final, cuando logran integrar a inc\u00f3gnita al sistema operativo, ella desobedece a la l\u00edder y decide acabar con todas las megacorporaciones usando un sat\u00e9lite equipado con armamento l\u00e1ser... en el proceso, mueren cientos de personas. \nAunque la historia es emocionante y solo tener cuatro misiones previas a la final es desafiante, el final es muy predecible. \u00bfCu\u00e1ndo no se ha visto que las inteligencias artificiales se salen de las manos de sus creadores? Por esa raz\u00f3n, no la considero muy original. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Mec\u00e1nicas 10/10 [/h1]\nDesde una vista isom\u00e9trica o perspectiva 3/4, tienes que manejar la facci\u00f3n esp\u00eda durante las expediciones preparatorias para la misi\u00f3n final, en las cuales debes ganar experiencia, robar equipamiento, rescatar camaradas, conseguir armas y dinero. Como ya se dijo, este juego implementa la estrategia por turnos al mejor estilo de Xcom, pero tiene mec\u00e1nicas originales que permiten una experiencia de juego altamente satisfactoria: el sistema de alarma, la perspectiva t\u00e1ctica (la cual deber\u00eda ser implementada en Xcom para evitar malas pasadas con las superficies) y, especialmente, el sistema de ayuda que brinda Incognita. Este sistema es especialmente \u00fatil porque permite hackear c\u00e1maras, cajas fuertes, drones, etc\u00e9tera... adem\u00e1s, puedes equiparla para distraer al enemigo. \nUna vez sumas todos estos elementos e incluyes la gran cantidad de enemigos con diferentes niveles de armadura, los molestos malware que intentan detener a Incognita y la perdida permanente de tus miembros (no necesariamente mueren, pero pierdes todo lo que hayas invertido en ellos) en caso de abandono o si los atrapan, entonces obtienes un juego sumamente satisfactorio y con una escala de dificultad elevada porque morir\u00e1s mucho \u2014demasiado en mi caso\u2014. Sin embargo, morir no es del todo malo porque sirve para desbloquear personajes y gadges para Incognita, los cuales ser\u00e1n muy \u00fatiles.\n\n[h1] Apartado audiovisual 8/10 [/h1]\nEl dise\u00f1o de personajes es excelente, los escenarios est\u00e1n muy bien logradas y la perspectiva 3/4 no presenta dificultades. En las horas de juego, me he llegado a encari\u00f1ar con ciertos personajes por sus talentos y su dise\u00f1o, las mujeres de este juego son de lo mejor que hay (tanto a nivel de equipamiento, como de dise\u00f1o). Sin embargo, la banda sonora no es nada del otro mundo. M\u00e1s expl\u00edcitamente creo que la banda sonora acompa\u00f1a bien el juego, pero podr\u00edan hacer algo distinto. Es un clich\u00e9 usar esos temas repetitivos y excesivamente atmosf\u00e9ricos para los turn-based. \n\n[h1] Puntuaci\u00f3n final: 8.5/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1542230341,

This is so blatently based on XCOM that it is verging on embarassing. They even called the woman \"Central\". Putting this aside though I can say this is really a great game. At first I thought perhaps it was too easy but I later discovered that actually I just got really lucky at first. The game is challenging but doesn't feel unfair. The art style is pretty cool. You can just jump straight into gameplay. It is very intuitive and easy to play. All marks of a well designed game.

I would say that: Klei games lack high level complexity, but are entertaining to play. I have got to hand it to Klei for being consistent with their art style and high visual quality of their games. I have played the Shank series and Mark of the Ninja and have not been disappointed in Klei's iterations of beat-em-up  and stealth genres.  \n\nThis turn based strategy rewards, stealth, non-lethal take downs and punctuality. Unlike Shadowrun, an agent of Invisible Inc  can't light the place up, blow the smoke off his pistol, and call it a day. All guards are equipped with heart monitors that alert a central security system of any deceased personnel -- you can't shoot away all your problems but you can taze them to your satisfaction. It is the fine art of sneakery that will allow you to obtain your goal. Remember, you are on the clock. If you spend too much time on a mission, you will be met with nosey well armed reinforcements. \n\nA few features of this game make it extra entertaining for me.  The first is this tone of the game: there is a real sense of urgency and desperation to survive when you play that adds to the excitement of the game play. Second, are the random maps which keep the game from getting too stale.

The levels are randomly generated as you must kill or sneak passed guards, hack through firewalls, and escape as the ever increasing alarm levels bring in more guards.\n\nMechanics\nYour team teleports into a level. You are to achieve and objective (though that's sometimes optional) and then find the exit teleporter and leave. Levels are played out on a grid, and each unit can only make so many actions a turn. After the player completes all of their movements and hacks the AI takes its turn. Agents can move, use an attack action, use an item, peek through doors, or collect power for Incognito. Incognito uses an alternative AI and provides power for herself as well as various programs used to break mainframes or in other ways aid your team. Agents have augments which grant passive powers as well as slots for items they can bring with them into the level. Between missions, players can upgrade agents, sell some items (occasionally buy 1) and then select missions from a handful presented by the game.\n\nIdeally, a player should be able to understand all the tools they game presents, make favorable decisions (which are to be rewarded) and carefully upgrade their team to win the game. However, Invisible Inc isn't that clear cut. Some items descriptions are poor or non-existent. Flash grenade, for example, simply gives the option to be dropped. What you need to do (had to look up in google) is select the grenade then select the tile you want to throw it at. I get not explaining tactics or strategy but not explain simple mechanics? It is frustrating just to figure out how enemy vision works, which is not something you want in a stealth game. It actually periodically turns off during movements which is why you can stand right next to some guards, they turn and look right at you, but don't \"see\" you. In endless mode the game introduces 3 new mechanics, at once, when a player reaches a certain day. That's pretty ridiculous to have players make their way through expert difficulty for time that could be 5+ hours just to spring new concepts on them without warning.\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe real issue is the RNG. Items, missions, rewards, layouts, everything is random (outside of a few set story missions and what the player chooses to start the game with). While this RNG is to enhance replayability, it causes a lot of problems in difficulty spikes/plunges. There were times on expert I could zip through the entire missions with no real challenge or have a run with absurd items but then some missions become so ridiculously hard it feels impossible to navigate through the level at all. Side objectives are simply impossible 95% of the time on higher difficulties. I mean, having an 1 of your 2 available agents sitting idol for 7 turns just isn't viable. Worse, even some of the main missions feel impossible. This can lead to a negative feedback loop of falling too far behind.\n\nThe key aspect of the game is interacting with enemy NPCs guards attempt to stop the player. There is a solid variety of enemies for players to navigate through. They can be killed, which for some reason incurs a clean up cost (no idea how they send the bill to the player), KO them, or slip passed by nothing their movement pattern or by using a distraction. Using a distraction such as running or opening a door is the most rewarding part of the gameplay. However there are problems. Guard movement in not guaranteed. While most guards move from a point A to point B, this can be interrupted by the movement of another NPC thus throwing out a players ability to predict movement. Furthermore, even if you take reasonable precautions, such as entering a room incover with overwatch, it is possible for 2 npcs to walk the same path and put you into a bad position. \n\nMistakes are either ignored (lucked out running in blind) or severely punished. One single tile can make the difference from a clean escape to your entire team being wiped out. Typically the later happens when there are multiple guards which can pour into the area. While the player can escape from some improbable odds, It's still very much sink or swim. It to often feels that the player wins because they didn't get bad rng versus the feeling of playing well. I assume that's why the game has rewinds to reset turns. While a nice way to get a player to learn (because mechanics are poorly explained) but it also is like an ex machina for weak game design. Contingency actually makes the problem worse by extending the campaign for even more days, almost doubling the length of time for a player to get a clear and thus doubling the chances of a playing slipping up that one time that just ends a 4-6+ hour run.\n\nStory\nThere really isn't much of a narrative which is a shame. There are some talking heads between missions and unskippable repeatable banter at the beginning of missions but that's it. You can get back stories for the agents, but that requires doing one of the harder side missions to get a single one. in 85 hours of gameplay I unlocked 1.\n\nMiscellaneous \nI like the visuals. They do provide a lot of ways to work the UI with rotating the camera, lowering the walls, having an alt view to highlight doors and such, but when multiple people are in a room, all the overlaying can make knowing what you are interacting with difficult.\n\nOverall\nThere were times I enjoyed the game and the challenge it presented, but it simply became to frustrating losing hours of progress on a single mistake that felt very reasonable at the time. To often I thought I got out of a situation by pure chance versus good game play and the ebb and flow of the difficulty provides an uneven gaming experience. Perhaps with more experience I would have some of the finer nuances of the game down to increase consistency, but the game just doesn't engage me enough to try.", "timestamp_created": 1538441550, "timestamp_updated": 1541807879, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616954147815704346", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45022125": {"recommendationid": "45022125", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996017536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 551, "last_played": 1538430309}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a big fan of stealth games and TBS, I wecomed the idea of blending the two genres so I bought this game almost immediately after its release.

In the end, my problem with the game turned out to be that it doesn't reward smooth operators, and even worse - it heavily punishes careful and thorough players. However smoothly and stealthily you act, situation shall deteriorate. There is nothing you can do - every turn the alarm level will rise, every several turns new guards will arrive, new cameras will power up, new countermeasures will be introduced. You better run because any turn your use to explore the generated levels instead of getting out as soon as possible will bring you closer to your doom. But you have to explore, because you get no maps or cues of where to go beforehand, and also to aquire resources needed to advance in the game. The ingame tips specifically instruct you to do this - yet the game goes out of its way to punish you for exploration. Add to that a harsh save system and you get the recepy for making people annoyed. Given that, the other problems with the game seem pretty minor.

A missed sniper shot for example in XCOM can cost you the life of a unit and from there everything can go south. In Invisible Inc. this is completely different. Weapons have no miss rate, but everything is based on cooldowns and tight on resources, like limited ammo, to keep the game challenging. But since Invisible Inc. is heavily focused on stealth, you will actually get punished, if you extensively use weapons to progress in the missions. Guards will leave their patrol path once you knocked them down for a few rounds and then they will start looking for your agents. You will also get punished for killing guards at the end of the mission by paying a \"clean up\" fee. Since money is always tight, you actually will think twice, if it's really necessary, to snipe that guard down.\n\nThe game design is absolute brilliant when it comes to the implemented alarm system. The longer you stay in a mission, the higher the alarm goes up, the tougher it gets to escape. High risk = high reward. \"Should i stay a bit longer to loot that juicy safe for money, or should i escape with the elevator, to avoid any further trouble with the guards, that are hunting me down?\"\n\nSince the missions are always randomly generated, the replayability is endless. Coupled with the high amount of available agents, that have individual abilities, you will not get bored for a long time. The only thing that can get frustrating is not getting good items (hello RNG) for future missions. Some items have a huge impact, on how you advance in later missions. An early found ECON chip cuts down the difficulty in half for further missions, since you can gather so much faster money from the missions. Having more money early available, means you can improve the stats of the agents much quicker, buy more items, which leads to more money generating and increases the probability, that you will succeed in future missions.\n\nAll in all this game is a very well crafted gem.

This involves incrementing the security level which increases the pressure on your team.  You begin with two agents, but can grow up to a four member operation.  Each agent has \u201ca particular set of skills\u201d that you must integrate as part of the team\u2019s toolkit.  Every mission involves your team getting into a secure location, completing an objective, and escaping.  The game is very unforgiving, but the mechanics let you see where your enemies are going, where they\u2019re looking, and lots of tools and abilities to distract or disable them.  Along with your agents, you have access to a software system that allows you to hack and disable cameras, take over security systems, and unlock safes.\n\nAs you can see, the game has a cartoonish look, but a serious tone.  The art style has a lot of character and was what originally drew me to this game.  The music does a great job creating the atmosphere while you\u2019re on a mission.  There are also the little things, like hearing the footsteps of a guard on the other side of a door, which gives a nice touch to the game.  The voice acting is also very well done.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to use.  You can rotate your view if you are trying to see things from a different angle.  I really liked how there\u2019s a different overlay for the device hacking.  The view can quickly be swapped back and forth, so to not disrupt your planning.\n\nThe game begins with your team\u2019s HQ getting raided.  A few operatives escape and now they must figure out who is behind this.  Between missions, there\u2019ll be some short banter with the boss of what\u2019s going on and what decision you\u2019ll have to make next.  The story does have an ending, however if you really like playing game, there is an endless mode that lets you keep playing past where the story would stop you.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t beat the game on the first try, you\u2019re efforts are not wasted.  You get scored on how well you did for the playthrough, earning points.  Points eventually hit milestones unlocking new available starting agents and hacking skills.  These unlock might give you the tools you need/want to accommodate your playstyle or allow you to play the game in a different way.  Along with the unlocks letting you change the starting conditions, there are also several configurable options to change the overall game as well.  Settings such as number of guards, alarm triggering conditions, amount of money available to steal, as well as an iron man mode.\n\nOverall, this game exceeded my expectations.  I was very impressed how much fun and addicting this game can be.  I think lots of people would enjoy this game and for its current price, it\u2019s a must play.\n\nAlso, the DLC is very good as well and adds some new interesting features.

Consistency is key when making such a game that requires such precision, and whilst Klei\u2019s latest stealth title, [i]Invisible, Inc.[/i], does a good job at making sure enemy and item interactions are the same every time, it does a poor job at explaining what they\u2019re going to do in the first place.\n\nA mission, for example, might require to hack into a specialised vault to acquire an expensive piece of technology. This makes sense, and you\u2019ll scope out the level [i]X-COM: Enemy Unknown[/i] style, remaining undetected and feeling pretty good about the whole scenario until you peek through a door into the room with the vault. The game gives you a pop-up to let you know that you\u2019ve found the target, and after hacking it using the method the game has instructed you to use in the tutorial, the item will disappear from your objectives list, indicating to any sensible human being that it has been completed. Still undetected, you\u2019re feeling pretty great about this and you successfully get all of your agents to the designated level exit without them having been spotted. At this point, you\u2019ll try to exit the level only for the game to advise you that you haven\u2019t looted the vault correctly, and that whilst it has been opened, you haven\u2019t actually taken anything from it.\n\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate.

The all have a bit of personality as well, which shines through in little quips at the beginning of each mission (sometimes dialogues between two agents) as well as a fun little \"last words\" feature you can use if you know your agent has nowhere to go and is about to die in stead of moving them in to overwatch to get shot.\n\nIt really is a great game that feels familiar enough and different enough from anything else in the genre and my only complaint is that I want more Invisible Inc. and more narrative.

If you're just starting out and feel overwhelmed, just put in 99 retries and remember that Beginner level doesn't really have permadeath depsite the \"Retire Agency\" thing. Haven't explored that functionality much though.\n\nThis game is definitely worth getting, and possibly with DLC too to add more functions into the game.

Yes, thats right, no missing a 95% shot at point blank in this game (no missing any shots period for that matter).  The game is balanced in somewhat 'board-game' fashion by an alarm tracker that advances every turn which introduces new obstacles the longer you take to accomplish your mission: dormant cameras activate, new guards spawn, eventually even your agent positions are broadcast if you don't accomplish your mission fast enough.  Every turn feels like there is pressure to accomplish something, yet you need to temper yourself with enough caution to not be seen.  To add to your decision anxiety, this is a game that saves every move.  Which means you really can loose and have to start all over because you misjudged that guard's sight radius during his patrol and aggro'd him and his friends.  Luckily the game blesses you with a set number of turn rewinds based on your difficulty...you will use them.  \n\nMeanwhile the game tempts you to sack every level for cash which allows you to upgrade your agents.  Augments and items can greatly impact your individual agents playstyle so different playthroughs can feel fairly different based on the hand you're dealt in the early game.  There are also hacking abilities powered by a resource gained from the consoles scattered throughout the levels that allow you to do things like turn off cameras or take over robotic enemies.  All these gameplay variables make it feel like you're really having to grab what you can and adapt: like your agency which is on the run from corporations from the get-go.\n\nThis game delivered much more than I expected based on the premise of turn-based stealth.

(formerly known as Incognitia) is a sci-fi turn based strategy with a short timeframe and generated levels. Set in a corporate espionage dominated dystopian future, players must take control of Invisible Inc., a fallen corp that must regroup and regain its power before its AI Incognitia's backup battery expires.\n\nInvisible, Inc. feels like a child of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Syndicate (the original Syndicate, not that new thing) with some roguelike aspects thrown in and a heavy emphasis on replayability. In-mission gameplay is focused on stealth gameplay, and the kind of patient, deliberate map control that XCOM: EU seems to encourage is eliminated by inherently weak player agents and a steadily ticking alarm counter. As the alarm counter climbs, additional hacking defences, cameras and security guards are brought into the level to keep players on their toes.\n\nAlongside the turn based strategy gameplay, a hacking mechanic allows for doors, safes, cameras and so forth to be unlocked or disabled by Incognitia at the cost of power, which provides some light resource management gameplay as well.\n\nMissions are focused on getting in and getting out as quickly and quietly as possible. Agent losses are massive blows, and with the game's short, 72 hour timeframe, the number of opportunities to gather more resources, equipment and agents always feels like it's barely enough, giving every successful run at a decent difficulty level a sense of being obtained by the skin of your teeth.\n\nInvisible, Inc. manages to maintain a sense of risk and tension at all times, but still provides players with the tools to recover from poor decisions whilst simultaneously raising the stakes and challenging the player to make the best of the resulting situations.\n\nThe plot and pacing of Invisible, Inc. are both really well executed, and it's another great example of storytelling in a roguelike-ish game.\n\nInvisible, Inc. has since had an expansion DLC released called Contingency Plan which extends the base campaign and adds in some more hacking abilities, equipment, agents and objectives.\n\n[i]This was originally written as part of [url=http://cheesetalks.net/gamesRoundup2015.php]a retrospective[/url] on games I finished in 2015.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1519733163, "timestamp_updated": 1519733163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635841667652130127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40432674": {"recommendationid": "40432674", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977957631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1519716144}, "language": "english", "review": "A puzzle game disguised as a turn-based tactical cyberpunk/neo-noir adventure.\n\nAn art-deco art gallery overlaid upon a puzzle game about moving agents around quite dull environments in a manner optimising your economy of action points against an increasingly punishing timer.\n\nWhatever it is, as a fan of turn-based tactics, stealth, and cyberpunk settings, I found this game extremely dull, and have bounced off it within a day every time I've picked it back up.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but you've been warned.", "timestamp_created": 1519717537, "timestamp_updated": 1519717537, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634808003902435303", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40427877": {"recommendationid": "40427877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038645273", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1549052204}, "language": "english", "review": "Most likely the best turn based game that came out in years", "timestamp_created": 1519695256, "timestamp_updated": 1519695256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40417941": {"recommendationid": "40417941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011514532", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 4374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1681, "last_played": 1691502602}, "language": "english", "review": "A little overpriced... great casual turn based game...", "timestamp_created": 1519661210, "timestamp_updated": 1592328463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40415410": {"recommendationid": "40415410", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961159510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 2304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1535723624}, "language": "english", "review": "Stealth Xcom with light roguelike-ish meta structure, with those parts actually coming together to be more than their sum.

There's always something worse awaiting you, and when you get cocky is when you get caught out by the relentless corperations - and losing a run can feel devasting when you had everything you should've needed.\n\nThe only downside to the game is that when your luck's seriously against you, you can lose a lot very quickly - for that reason, I do recommend playing with savegames available and a couple of time resets available per mission - at least to begin with: it can still feel very punishing even with them. \n\nOnce you feel up for the challenge without either though, I offer you congratulations and good luck - you'll need it to beat the Corps!", "timestamp_created": 1519587151, "timestamp_updated": 1519587151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61173635721206665", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40360191": {"recommendationid": "40360191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014302315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3007, "last_played": 1620560886}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of my top 5 games of the past 10 years, probably one of my top ten of all time. I love everything about this game. In this turn-based strategy game, you play the  role of the operator tasked with commanding agents as they infiltrate facilities, as well as programs that you'll use to hack firewalls to remove security or open safes/cells/etc. You'll begin with two chosen agents and programs, but there will be oppurtunities to add to these as you progress.\n\nGameplay involves taking turns to sneak, hack and achieve objectives within a targeted facility. However, your infiltration will begin to be traced and security will begin to ramp up, making objectives increasingly difficult. You'll have to decide what you're willing to risk within each facility; Should you play it safe and get out of dodge before security gets too tight?Or is it worth searching for those extra safes for more credits, the prison cells to free an agent who will join your ranks or augmentation stations to install handy augmentations for your current agents? And if you decide not to risk it, will you have the tools to face harder facilities later on when more advanced security comes into play?\n\nLevels get very tense as you try to most optimally utilise your accumulated agents, augmentations, programs and items to counter increasingly difficult security. Sometimes you might lose an agent.. Is it worth trying to save them or cut your losses? The unique and clever abilities, augmentations and items, coupled with programs that have both their pros and drawbacks, makes for some incredible scenarios that seem straight out of a movie.\n\nBuy this game.

It's pretty much an ideal game for me on the face of things, a tactical X-Com style of play that focused more on stealth than combat sounds right up my street but it's just not for me. \n\nThe campaign has you heading to locations to hack terminals and unlock further locations to infiltrate so it feels like you're heading up a chain that must end in a cool payoff to make it all worth doing and then you realise there's not so it's disappointing and underwhelming. This combined with the campaign being about 6/7 short missions to completion and the story being the most clich\u00e9d Artificial Intelligence gone bad rubbish meant their suggestion to replay it several times to get the most out of it's procedural generation was ignored about halfway through my second game. I enjoyed playing it the first time through because the mechanics are excellent and intuitive, mostly helped by the excellent UI, but you don't get to progress the characters anywhere near enough before you're done. They suggest you play through the difficulty levels in ascending order, but literally nothing changed other than the difficulty. The characters say exactly the same lines at exactly the same point, you head up the same old chain with no meaningful reward at the end. All that changes is the layout of the missions and their procedural generation isn't clever enough to avoid the classic problem of \"fuck this level, this is fucking dumb\" you get when it randomly places 2 guards to walk into your starting room on their opening turn through the only fucking door.\n\nIt looks nice, but it's nothing groundbreaking or new in it's aesthetic. The sound design within the levels builds tension quite well, but I didn't really like the dialogue or voice acting especially. It plays well mechanically but doesn't let you explore these mechanics enough because the campaign is so short and you don't keep many things you've unlocked at all.

It's very convincing and a pleasure to look at.\n\n[h1]... and Feel[/h1]\nThe controls are simple enough. \nUnlike the new XCOM instalments, you don't deal with specific actions (move + attack), but good old Action Points. So you can perform multiple actions as long as remaining APs allow it.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nWhen I was playing the game, I didn't really notice the background music.\nBut when I checked out the soundtrack separately, it's actually pretty good. \nIt has this \"corporate conspiracy\" vibe to it, if that makes sense.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAt first you are presented with a world map and you have to pick your next mission. Each location requires time to get to, which subtracts from your 72 hours.\nThe game encourages multiple playthroughs, so the available missions on the map and the actual mission locations are procedurally generated.\nOnce a mission begins, your operatives are deployed to the selected location and you take control of them in a turn-based tactics game. \nYou can switch between them freely, move them into strategic positions or perform various actions (open doors, peak around the corners, set up ambushes, operate equipment, etc.). In addition, you have Incognita, showing you the tactical view of the map and allowing you to hack different devices, disable cameras, traps or security robots. After you're done with your turn, the enemies make their moves, patrolling the area or investigating your activities.\nEvery five turns you take (or sometimes more often), the security level is increased, raising the guard's awareness, making machines harder to hack or even bringing reinforcements.\nThe game is all about stealth - trying to complete your goals and getting out, while avoiding cameras, traps and patrols. And since it gets more and more difficult over time, it's best to locate your objective and try to exfil as quickly as possible.\nHere's the main problem I have with this game - using lethal force is discouraged. At the beginning it's not even available.\nYou can stun guards, which will take them out for 2 turns, while your stunning weapon is disabled for 3 turns. You have the option to upgrade your tools and buy new weapons, but money is also used to upgrade your agent's skills so you either do that or purchase new toys.\nAnd that's another thing I didn't like - the shop outside of missions (Monst3r) rarely has anything useful for sale (seriously, by the time I completed three missions, he only had one item available). And shops in missions were randomly placed - when I had money, they had nothing interesting to offer, and the cool stuff was there only when I was broke. It's hard for me to believe that it was a design choice, seems more like bad luck on my part.\nWithout the option to get new equipment, this game seemed very limited in terms of gameplay variety. It was just: approach a room, stun the guard, run into the next room before the guard wakes up, repeat 3-4 times, get to the objective, rush to the exit, avoid all the guards that were previously stunned and are now back up and looking for you.\n\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\nThe \"Contingency Plan\" DLC offers new agents, items, weapons, augments and programs for Incognita. The main campaign is also extended with some additional missions and challenges.\nThis was enabled during my playthroughs, so I can't really say which elements were from the main game and which from the DLC.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nMaybe it was just me. Maybe the missions I've played during my 5 hours were generated in a way, that didn't allow me to experience the full potential of this game. I just don't feel like spending any more time to find out.\nI'm an old [b]XCOM[/b] fan and I've also enjoyed previous Klei Entertainment's games (especially [b]Mark of the Ninja[/b]). With that said, I'm disappointed with Invisible Inc. and I can't recommend it.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- cyberpunk setting\n- graphics that match that setting very well\n- good old Action Points\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- use of lethal force is discouraged\n- shops rarely offer useful items\n- wasted potential\n\n\n[quote][i]For more reviews, follow my Curator page[/i] - [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31210849-Sublime-Dent/]Sublime Dent[/url][/b].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1515168880, "timestamp_updated": 1527592625, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526276171207427979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39081405": {"recommendationid": "39081405", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967826787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3593, "last_played": 1621025344}, "language": "english", "review": "It needs a little time to find balance bewteen savety moves and risky ones, but if that is found the game is enormous fun!

If you can grab some other resources along the way for future missions, all the better.\n\nThe game takes place in both the real world and in cyberspace. Agents can move around the level, trying to avoid being captured by guards, while the security gets tighter the longer they're inside. There are firewalls guarding anything worth accessing, but can be disarmed by programs, which take power to use. There are multiple ways to traverse levels, depending on the agents. You can collect credits to buy programs to infiltrate security, or you can spend credits on tools to do that for you. There's enough variety that you can try a few different play styles.\n\nReplayability is very high. Levels are proceduraly generated, and you learn to apply different tactics through trial and error.

It is by far one of the best games I have played.\n\nWithout going into excessive detail, the biggest features that make it what it is:\n\n- Depth: Many characters, game modes, user friendly settings for gameplay that  let you play what you want, how you want without punishing the player for doing so. You are free to approach the game with whatever strategy or \"play style\" you feel, and at no point does any tactic feel \"not as intended\" nor does the game too heavily favor or punish any of them. Any playstyle comes with stronger and weaker points for diffferent mission types or with different characters.\n\nUnlike many titles with a variety of different characters to pick from, none of them are too similar, and none of them are too good, too bad, or not an asset to your team. One of the most fun things about the game, is figuring out how to use different characters together, to best make use of what they bring, and play to their individual strengths. The same (mostly) goes for the gear, upgrades, and other things you have in your arsenal as you play.\n\n- Replayablity: So many \"randomly generated procedural\" games recently seem to be anything but. In efforts to make a game random, many end up being repetitive, bland, or (in the other direction) randomly punishing. Invisible, Inc. hits a very happy middle ground. Levels offer variety that is interesting without being unfairly random. \n\nDifferent game modes give you more to do once you've learned (or mastered) the game's mechanics. Especially endless, time attack, and harder modes. As you increase difficulty or add more challenge, the difficulty is not artificial - simply adding more hazards, or reducing resources. New, dangerous mechanics are actually introduced; guards will start patrolling through multiple rooms instead of remaining inside of one, sight lines can be hidden until you actually see an observer, for example.\nThere are so many possibly combinations both in what you start a campaign with, and what you can find (or the strategy you use to win) that there is always more to do.\n\n- Respect for players' time: With the number of games being created these days, more and more players seem to be buying games based largely on the question of \"will I get my money's worth?\" or \"will my time spent playing this be wasted?\" Invisible, Inc. is neither a grind, nor boring. It has a bit of a steep learning curve, which can make it difficult to start with, but it never wastes the player's time. In this sense, it is somewhat like a rogue-like game, in that trial and failure are part of the game, and failing is practically always a product of the player's choices, not unfair, punishing, or random elements. It always gives you the opportunity to make the most informed choices (or not to) and the consequences of them are what make each turn exciting.\n\n-Style: The setting, story, visuals, and music all come together to make a fantastic and unified game. Surprisingly immersive for an isometric turn-based strategy game, great realisation of the cyberpunk setting.\n\nMy only regret is that I've finished it and moved on to new(er) things!", "timestamp_created": 1511829909, "timestamp_updated": 1511829909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37836354": {"recommendationid": "37836354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009136784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2130, "last_played": 1511827282}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is totally worth it !!\na MUST BUY.", "timestamp_created": 1511827392, "timestamp_updated": 1511827392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37819947": {"recommendationid": "37819947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238051664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1680862737}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game on sale and it has consumed more hours than most single player games in the first week.

I would say I get the umption to play every two to three months. Play for a bit, take a break, then come back to it. Plus, there are a number of solid mods to add which extend the overall value tremendously from extra characters to AI behaviors and even tools which add more variety to the already fantastic procedurally generated tilesets.\n\nThe story isn't very deep, but it has great production value. I mean, there's not much you need from a Rogue-like. It provides just enough to give you an excuse to run around as a super-secret corporate spy.\n\nThe Contingency Plan DLC is worth the price. It brings greater challenge and depth and extends the overall experience--which in the Vanilla version feels a little too short. Not that it is short (maybe a hair) it's just that halfway through, you'll start to enjoy your team and the game so much, you'll just wish it would last longer.\n\nThe game is similar to X-Com but only in the fact that it's turn based. The objective is not to seek and destroy, but to hide and steal. There is no R&D sub-game to be found, however there is an economic system that can be quite challenging to maintain. This is a good thing and a bad thing. Obviously, an R&D system would be excellent, but I would not say you miss it in this game, since it is less the traditional Strategy Campaign and more the Rogue-like. The game is meant to be quick, fast-paced, and challenging.\n\nThe game is literally dripping with style. All of the agents are cool, even the Community-built Mod agents. You'll have your favorites, for sure, but they all provide an interesting playstyle.\n\nThe only major flaw in the game that I can see is that throughout my playtime, I've noticed I end up using the same Augments and Gear and Programs from one playthrough to the other. There is definitely a hierarchy where this is concerned, and I think it's the weakest aspect to the game. It doesn't take away from the challenge or the enjoyment, but I wish there had been more attention paid to the balance in these aspects. In other words, some Gear is just clearly better than other Gear. Not in the capacity that it's simply better, but in the capacity that the lesser gear simply isn't that useful. Same with Augments and Programs.\n\nOne area of Critique that is not necessarily a flaw, but definitely one can see its missed opportunity is the World Map. Most folks who would play this are expecting an XCom experience, and I wouldn't blame them for it. As such, the World Map simply begs for some kind of base-management system. I agree and disagree with this, though I can see that it is a missed opportunity for some depth. Basically, I do not agree that this game needs a Base-Building mechanic. Once you play the game and understand the nature of the story and how the count-down system works, you'll understand, but something like a Base-Building mechanic simply wouldn't make sense in context to the game or the story. However, there could have been opportunity for something like we find in the game Evil Genius where you manage assets and henchment on the World Map. At any rate, the game doesn't feature anything like this, and it is definitely the one thing that I constantly think about which might have made the difference.\n\nOverall, this game is great at full price, and it's a steal on discount. If you like Turn-based Strategy with a lite element of Rogue-like--this is the game for you.

It is an interesting game, but there are some places that can be improved.\n\nIn FTL, you have some stuff to do at the beginning: while you try to go through as many points as possible, use the money you've earned to prioritize the shield, and the game ensures you to have enouth battles to get the money. Only after that can you start to enjoy the randomness of the game, then you can apply different strategies based on what kind of ship you've chose and what weapons or systems you have. While the way the missions are arranged in Invisible, Inc are similar to FTL, they have something that makes a lot of difference: freedom. \n\nYou would find out that if you don't have a rescue agent mission in the first day, it really increases the difficulty so much that you might just want to restart your run. Also, if you happen to go to points that are close to each other, in the second day the points would be super far from you to compensate that, as if the game designer wants the player to only go through 7 or 8 points before 72 hours. In FTL, you feel smart when you find out a path that maximizes the points you traveled and escaped to the next sector just before the rebels caught you. But in Invisible, Inc, you don't have as much strategy involved, the advantage you've got today, you'll loose it tomorrow. And while we know we want to go to get the password first, then go to labs or vaults to maximize the profit, we may not see the password mission while we have a lot of vault, lab missions, or vice versa based on randomness.\n\nThe randomness takes too much portion of the entire game, and hurts the strategy part of it. Different from The Binding of Isaac, where the random items are the whole point of the game, Invisible, Inc is a strategy game which should have more in players control. If you die in The Binding of Isaac, you only loose 10~20 min progress, but if you die in day 2 or day 3 in Invisible, Inc, you are loosing 2~3 hours of progress, which harms the passion for me on keep trying to beat the game in expert difficulty. Not getting good missions is not the only random part that hurts Invisible, Inc, but also the map and the virus in every mission. It might be until alarm level 4 when you  find where your objective is, and that might be in the opposite position on the map where the exit is. Also, it is very common that once a guard comes in, the chain effect starts and you not only have additional 1.5 more alarm levels in just 1 turn, but also the unknown virus might just bring you huge trouble while it's on a vital device that you have to hack. If these bad conditions happen in the late game, you most likely would loose your entire squad and would have to restart your run for better luck. After loosing multiple 2~3 hours progress, I've gave up on this game. It's just depressing hearing the old lady shouts \"Stop playing on people's lifes!\" and blames you on that while you've tried your best but couldn't stop the guards shooting your agents.\n\n\nYou might say that you can abandon the mission if you feel it is too hard for you and you should not try to accomplish every mission, but the fact is, that means you've wasted 9~12 hours in game and just got 400 dollors or so. When this piles up you would definetly fail the final mission, or the middle mission that is after 72 hours, the guards would be stronger nomatter whether you've abbandomed the mission or not, so you kind of have to complete every mission to get the cash to buy the upgrades or weapons.\n\nI don't like the policy of the DLC too. Although I bought it with the DLC, I think this game would be very awkward without it. Imagine The Binding of Isaac with 4 floors in total, FTL with 3 sectors then you fight the flag ship, or Spelunky with only 8 levels. It would give people a feeling that \"This is a good concept, but feels wrong somewhere, and needs to be polished\". I think the game should include the DLC and raise the price to avoid people that only bought the vanilla game feel bad about it.\n\nTo summarize, Invisible, Inc has good ideas but needs to be polished. You may not feel this in easier difficulty, but when you start the expert difficulty, which the game says \"this is the difficulty that is meant to be played\", you would start to see the flaws of the design. I like Invisible, Inc that it tried to combine various ideas together to make a new game, and appreciate it made most of the missions exciting (the rest are \"Ah, there's nothing we can do, lets give up and start a new run  _(:\u0437\u300d\u2220)_  \"), but still can't recommand it to others since I've played better rougelikes.", "timestamp_created": 1511472771, "timestamp_updated": 1516067032, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528310835361480713", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37197615": {"recommendationid": "37197615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167671605", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 281, "last_played": 1557318432}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1511469359, "timestamp_updated": 1511469359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37180226": {"recommendationid": "37180226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029851196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 13731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11171, "last_played": 1514465533}, "language": "english", "review": "With the unlockable characters and randomly generated levels this is a game you can come back to for years and still be surprised.", "timestamp_created": 1511465399, "timestamp_updated": 1511465399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37151290": {"recommendationid": "37151290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085564046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 20544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8952, "last_played": 1698974085}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a true, perpetually-unsatisfied perfectionist gamer, this game is for you.

But what makes this game great is the way it constantly pushes you to the limits of your capabilities. Every level kept me on the edge of my seat. You know how sometimes in games you challenge yourself to be extra conservative. You make sure every bullet counts, you get all the stealth takedowns you can, you hoard items because you don't HAVE to use them now and you might need them later. Then at the end you realize it doesn't matter and you feel like a chump for wasting your own time exploiting mechanics the devs didn't intend and foregoing all the other, more fun mechanics they made. In the end it didn't matter. In this game, everything matters. You can always do something better and the game will always reward it. It's resource management, xcom team coordination, stealth, min/maxing, planning, and so so many judgement calls. All of it is interconnected and all entirely necessary. The mechanics are consistent. The combinations of builds are endless and nuanced in their synergies. The game itself can be endless.

While not bad, I simply cannot recommend this game. On the one hand, the futuristic setting of the game is great. The gameplay helps reinforce the fact you cannot compete with emenies straightout fight. However, the gameplay is highly restrictive of what can and cannot do. For example, range loadout for your agents is nigh impossible as ammo does not replenish after a mission and in order to replenish it you need to purchase ammo in the next level that may or may not spawn. Because of the this, the game very quickly become quite repentive and stale with you repeating the same tasks over and over which is a shame considering the potential I see this game could achieve with TLC.\n\nOverall, my recommendation is that at full price this game is simply not worth buying.

You will see similarities from other classic stealth games like Commando, like being able to read the enemy's viewcone. For Invisible Inc, you can have up to a maximum of 4 agents for each mission. Each agent has similar stats that can be upgraded. However, each agent will have a special augment that differentiates them. Every map is procedurally generated based on difficulty level and objective. The missions come in hostage rescue, CEO vault access card, vault access, Nanofabricator, sitelist and augment missions. The general formula is go to some place, access something, escape. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe most common thing that you will be using is the super AI called Incognita and her Mainframe system. This is where you will see similarities to Transistor. In the Mainframe mode, you will hack the different features in the game. Normally, you will convert power to reducing the security level to 0. Once the feature hits 0, it will be hacked and you will gain access to its ability. E.g. Hacking a camera will give you vision of said camera. To get more power, you have to hack consoles which doesn't make much sense.\n\nConclusion, Invisible Inc is an interesting game but it's definitely not a top-tier stealth game. The graphics kind of reminds me of Transistor but with less fancy effects. The gameplay is a mix of XCOM and Commando. Story is faily simple but at least there is a continuation.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Continuation of Story\nI think the ending with the DLC points to more expansions of the series and hopefully more interesting versions of Invisible Inc. [spoiler]Incognita becomes the main villain at the end[/spoiler]\n\n2. Stealth \nI love stealth games. Even though there are certain lame ideas that are repeated like duck-walking, vents and crouching.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Stupid AI Scenarios\nYou can stand next to the guard.\n\n2. Game Time is Too Short\nLike really short. The beginner campaign with DLC is over in 9 hours. Considering that Klei utilizes procedurally generated maps, it's strange that it's so short. There is an Endless mode so there is proof that map generation is simple to do.\n\n3. DLC doesn't add Much Content\nAccording to the description, without the DLC, the game is just a demo. There's 4 more heroes, more abilities, more types of enemies and an additional stage on Day 4.  However, when you play it, it's like a normal game.\n\n4. Crouching, crouching, crouching\nThere's so much crouching in a high tech environment. I'm expecting more invisible cloaks, disguises, hacking of guard communications and overriding security controls.\n\n5. Teleporters Every Stage\nWow. Every single Secnet building has a teleporter to escape with. How convenient. The escape route just being there every level is odd. Surely, there could be something cooler? E.g. Masquerading as a guard and escaping. \n\n6. Same Agents\nTheoretically, all agents are the same. They have the same stats that can be bought. There should be more differentiation with the augments and less with the stats.\n\n[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Locking Doors with Incognita\nI want to try a scenario where you lock the enemy out by hacking a door.\n\n2. Multi-levels\nEverything is on just 1 level. It's like the architect decided to work on one floor only. How about making multiple floors? Like level 1, 2 and 3. That way agents can be spread over different levels. E.g. Turning off the power generator in the basement to turn off the lights.\n\n3. Multi-levels : Elevators and Stairs\nSo much cooler to ride the elevator or sneak up the stairs. Just use mouse wheel to change the view between the floors. Alternatively, F1 for floor 1, F2 for floor 2 and F3 for floor 3.\n\n4. Light and Darkness\nEverything is lighted. Where's the darkness in a stealth game? How about being able to turn off the lights? Guards can't see that well in the dark and you can sneak past them. This also leads to better equipment like night vision goggles. \n", "timestamp_created": 1510501054, "timestamp_updated": 1510501054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36471833": {"recommendationid": "36471833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022177097", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1626985468}, "language": "english", "review": "Since the game is available on consoles the option to use a controller on pc would be great.\nThe master race has become lazy f***s too.", "timestamp_created": 1510498703, "timestamp_updated": 1510498703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36460954": {"recommendationid": "36460954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086682424", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1510564571}, "language": "english", "review": "i always loved this game\n\ni've actually beaten it one or two times back when i pirated it (because back then i was a kid with barely any money :v )\n\nit's fun, it's challenging, and it's amazingly enjoyable\n\nthe best part about it? it actually runs well on my crappy laptop, so that's a major plus\n\na perfect and simple 10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1510464033, "timestamp_updated": 1510464033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510281503200531006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36459239": {"recommendationid": "36459239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034083175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1419, "last_played": 1523492338}, "language": "english", "review": "Very challenging & fun.

In some games, I had like 10 snoozed gards and 3 agents pinning/snoozing them on a regular basis, which felt a bit repetitive and annoying.\n- There's no base management, just a roster from wich you select and equip your agents.

It beautifully merges the mechanics of a turn-based strategy title like XCOM or Jagged Alliance with something like Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell. Turn based stealth may seem to be a weird concept in theory, but it is executed wonderfully here.\n\nOne playthrough of the campaign will probably take you only a couple of hours, but here's the deal; every playthrough allows you to unlock new means (agents and programs) to tackle the increasingly difficult obstacles you are faced with.\nMaps are randomly generated, so the game offers nigh-endless replayabilty and you are constantly left wanting for more (which is evidenced by the time I've spend playing this title). \nWhat is more, different combinations of agents and programs you start with, force you to alter your strategy (i. e. while it is usually wiser to knock people out, some characters like Draco from the DLC might actually gain benefits if you rack up a lot of kills early on) so you can experiment with different playstyles as well.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are gorgeous; the graphics and artsyle give a wonderful vibe, the music perfectly sets up the mood of the game (it starts slow, but gradually becomes more frantic as the situation grows more dire) and the voice acting is really good (although it is used rather sparingly).\n\nI enjoy a challenge in games like this and I am happy to say I find the difficulty of the game to be great as well. You can choose from many difficulty levels, and it seems it is best to play through them all in order to get acquianted with all the mechanics of the game. You genuinely have to get better at the game to tackle the harder settings.\nIf at any point you'll find a single element of the gameplay is not to your liking, you can choose the 'custom' difficulty which gives you a lot of reedom to tweak the gameplay exactly as you want it (to make the game easier/harder as you see fit).\n\nAs a fan of both the new XCOM titles and stealth games I can confidently say this is the game I've always been waiting for and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. \n\nStill, I understand this is not a title for everyone. Turn based stealth is a rather novel concept and it may not be to everyone's liking.

Why, you ask? Let's get right to it: Invisible Inc. doesn't mess around much with fluff and neither will I!\n\nPerhaps one of the most defining characteristics of this game is that it employs the use of heroes (aka agents) without using traditional RPG leveling. Instead, nearly everything (stat upgrades, skills, items) is purchased with money, and you can divy it up as you so choose. Efficiency and progression, then, is often defined by how well you complete a mission, not how much you utilized a particular hero.\n\nWhy am I bringing this up? By removing the need for confrontation--and by extension the experience it normally brings,--the depth of tactics you can effectively employ becomes massive. Want to be dodgy by using cloaks and hologram projectors? Do that. Want to run a power-hungry setup so you can hack all the computers and drones? Sure. Or maybe you really do want to punch every security guard you find square in the face? Absolutely! Invisible Inc. can be such a surprise at times, as I constantly discover new nuances and ways to navigate my way through sticky situations.\n\nAnd believe me, things can get very sticky. Make no mistake: Invisible Inc. can get bonkers tough. Foes are predictable but lethal. An alarm tracker increases with each passing turn, periodically dropping new countermeasures on your squad. The procedural generation aspect of the game means you'll stay guessing... but that's actually another remarkable aspect of this game. As stealth can have an \"information warfare\" dimension to it, Invisible turns what can be a weakness of procedural generation into one of its greatest strengths. Suspense can run high, but threading the needle on a harrowing infiltration has almost no equal for me in the strategy genre. Watching a strategy you personally concocted \"beat the odds\" can make for some incredible moments.\n\nIf I had one major complaint to throw out there, its the story. Look, story isn't a focus of this game, and you should know that going in. Despite that, I was severely disappointed in how the game ended. The basic narrative that's set up is fairly compelling but the game is content to use a very cliche, punch-in-the-face kind of ending that comes out of nowhere (although the DLC story expansion does a better job of setting things up.) I despised it so much, I felt as if I would have rather not had an ending!\n\nThere are a couple of other thorns that could bother some people more than others. One of the few places the game does use RPG leveling is with starting loadout unlocks; this isn't a huge problem as you really should get one solid playthrough under your belt before you start havey-duty scheming, but I imagine some might find it frustrating. The story's endgame missions can have a sometimes startling difficulty spike, although some actually find that endearing.\n\nEither way, these low points are more like speed bumps than walls. These things are a lot easier to forget when the core gameplay loop is so stupid fantastic. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy games. And... yeah. Its amazing. That's pretty much it.

Stealth is of utmost importance because your spies will almost always lose fights. If you kill enemies, there is a cleanup fee upon completion, and money is not easy to get because your income comes from physically stealing it. There is no time limit during your turn, so there is never a need to rush. The levels are always possible, although sometimes very difficult.\n\nThe campaign requires the player to make good decisions as to which facilities to infiltrate first so that later levels are more manageable, so decisions made during the level select screens are equally important.

More narrative would have helped, as would have more mission variety.

On the other hand, it's really hard to do a meta-campaign that works well and doesn't detract from a tactical game. X-Com did it once (and even that is debatable), and everyone since has been trying to copy the formula. Also, the ending is a problem. From a narrative perspective, it's really good narratively, but it won't inspire you to try the game again at a higher difficulty, which is what the game expects you to do.\n\nIn addition, there's a ton of knobs to mess with to make the game harder as you learn the systems better, and the community has made mods to take the difficulty to the next level. There's one item that seems a little broken to me, in that it makes parts of the game too easy, but I can easily remedy that with mods.\n\nAll in all, this game is superb and highly recommended.

It's your job to help the agency recover by plugging the agency's AI ' incognita\" into a super computer, you have '72 hours' emergency power.\n[i](in other words, you have a select amount of time before the final confrontation/mission, so use this time to prepare.)[/i]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=940650566\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] I highly suggest you play the beginning tutorial to explain the movement and use of cover. I don't think I can articulate how the game works well enough. I would encourage you to watch my video at the bottom of this review to get a better idea how the game works.\n\nThe basic idea is you are moving your agents around in turn-based-combat form. You always want to look around corns, and peer through doors before opening them.\n\nThe game rewards stealth and patience... but you can't be too patient, because each turn a clock will tick and as the security level increases, so too does the complexity. The first few security levels will just increase fire walls and security cameras... but this will quickly escalate to summoning additional guards and ARMORED guards.\n\nYou won't be able to fight your way through armored guards until you have specific gear, and even then you'll better off just trying to sneak your way around or distract them away to create openings.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=941367586\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] There is an overwhelming amount of things to consider when first learning how to play invisible, Inc.\n\nI haven't even touched on incognita's hacking, viruses, upgrades, augments, the types of missions... Honestly invisible, Inc. Will appeal to people who love complexity and difficulty within their games.

It\u2019s similar to Xcom with its own original twist.  I\u2019ve beaten it on all but the last difficulty setting.  The story itself is kind of short but the difficulty makes it work playing.  I highly recommend the expansion as it adds some extra length to the game giving you more time to upgrade your agents and weapon cache.    As you play you can unlock additional characters, programs, and character loadouts.  Each new character\\loadout and difficulty setting makes you adapt to new rules of engagement.  Lethal vs no Lethal takedowns create their own problems.  \n\nI leave you with this advice...\n\n1.  You have Action Points (AP) and Power (PWR).  (Don\u2019t run out of either at the wrong time)\nGet Lvl 2 Anarchy on every agent.  (Stealing is necessary).\n\n2.  Always have a Hacker in your Squad.  (PWR is a resource and hacker can get you\u2019re the most).\n\n3.  Acquire AP weapons sooner rather than later.  (Over time guards have better armor)\n\n4.  The Teleport Beacon is great (in DLC addon)!!!  (You can transport yourself plus whoever you are Dragging which is great for escapes. I usually find the teleport pad and toss it down then when you get into trouble trying to finish that last objective or hack the safe you can teleport back.

Well, with the summer sale and the existence of the Klei bundle, I decided to take their word and see what all the fuss was about (still have to play Mark of the Ninja, let's see if you can impress me a third time, Klei). Immediately, I found myself almost addicted to the playstyle. The maneuvering and overall feel are strangely reminiscent of the Fire Emblem series, right down to the tension you feel after every turn and the optional (but rewarding) completionist options such as sidequests and item vaults. Of course, unlike the Fire Emblem games, Invisible Inc. gives you the option at the start to rewind your turn a number of times (1, 5, 10, or 99). Again, this is optional, and you're rewarded if you take the Ironman (0 rewind) route.  There are three levels of basic difficulty, as well as an advanced difficulty, a time attack mode, and an endless mode. Overall, the game has an excellent play life, giving you lots to do and plenty of hours of enjoyment.\n\nThe setting is very much in the spirit of Shadowrun- Corporate dystopia, cybernetic augments, a world gone mad for technology. Of course, it manages to avoid being 3edgy5me and has its moments of humor. The art style is charming, and if the level design gets a bit hard to navigate, the game provides you the option to hide walls to better see the floor grid, which is a nice touch.\n\nI would also highly recommend the Contingency Plan DLC. Not only does it add four playable characters and a slew of new items and enemies to the game, but it also EXTENDS THE CAMPAIGN MODE OF THE MAIN GAME. Holy cow.\n\nKlei, keep making games so we can keep throwing our money at you.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499229609, "timestamp_updated": 1499229609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny":

"review": "[h1] Short version [/h1]\nInvisible Inc. is one hell of a game,which will make you love hating it and hate loving it-It's kinda like a sadistic girlfriend,as long as you are masochistic enough,it will dominate you,make you beg for mercy,and odd enough,sometimes give it to you.In the end of the day,though,it could also be me playing (mind you,still playing) blindly,thus I have zero clue what to expect.Overall,a must have,especially on sale.\n\n[h1] Long version [/h1]\n\nEven at the very start,after a really cool,stylish introduction,the game warns you that it's going in dry-It's going to be unfair,it will make you tear,but you will suck it up and enjoy it because of how fair it is.For the time I've played,and for the other time I will spend playing,so far I've never said \"This game is BS\" but I said several (hundred) times \"I'm such a idiot\" \"Why did I rush\" \"I should've stayed in cover\" \"Fuu,why didn't I check his movement\"-my point,the game will make you angry,but at yourself for the disappointment you ar~ for not thinking things through.If you've played XCOM you will know one half of it-It requires planning,luck and when it works,it works well,when it doesn't...you get to watch your lovely agents die slow,painful death.So,what's the difference.Mainly,this game is (unlike XCOM) based around stealth,which means no more misses because the dice said no at 95% shot,it means it will hurt because every mistake will be your own fault.The levels (kinda like XCOM) are randomly generated (here comest the \"sadistic girlfriend giving you mercy\" part) which means from time to time you will have to cross 3 giant halls to find one of the objectives,while other times the exit and the objectives will be just a room away.Much like XCOM you have a \"time limit\" which is the time left of your lovely AI that will deal with most cyber threats and also teleport you in missions,giving you \"sometimes not so\" motivating words.Thing to note,the game also has an endless mode,Im just not going to touch it until I beat the campain,so yeah...Another similarity is that the more time you waste in missions,the thougher it's going to get,kinda like an erec~You get my point.It seems,as you progress,that what you considered *as worse as it gets* is a mere nothing,compared to what the game has in store...and ,oh how much I enjoy to be surprised...and survive!It's rewarding,escaping a though situation by mere skill and luck.It's surprising too,since you will often be licking the game's foot,as it kicks you down again and again...For the most part,the art is one of the distinctive differences,and it somehow made me want to play don't starve agai~Oh yeah,this game is by Klei,the lovely bunch that brought us don't starve,mark of the ninja and now the Oxygen not included,or whatever the name was,and that should mean a lot-the game has that klei charm to it,and I love it!\n  I want to say so much,but I won't-The less you know,the better,Operator!Just go ahead and enjoy this (sadistic) trip to revenge!Trust me,if you can,when I say the following: \"It's worth it\"\n\n\n...did I mention....tasers?Oh,the non-lethal brutality...though you will end up screaming \"Just break his fuckin' skull,dammit,he will wake up after 4 turns and alert his buddies,and hell,that taser has some extra energy in it too!Just,..DO IT,no one's watching,just snap the ~ ...too far?too far.Just buy and see...\n\nEDIT: I completed the game,there may be another ending because this one hits like a truck...can't say I didn't saw it coming but still...anyhow,I still believe this game is worth playing", "timestamp_created": 1499176790, "timestamp_updated": 1499246477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

Missions take 1-2 hour, maps are procedurally generated, there's one main objective that gives you something useful (a super loot container, a super shop terminal, an agent to rescue, etc.), loads of other things to loot on the way, threats to avoid, and one teleporter you escape through.  There's a lot of variety to keep each mission interesting.\n\nBig difference 1)  Once you're in a mission there's no randomness. Guards follow fixed patterns; they don't teleport around until you spot them; your shots never miss (neither do theirs...), you can normally spot every surprise before it happens (peeking through doors and around corners, peeking at guard to see where they move next).  It can be challenging but it's always fair and it feels like every mission is doable if you play it right and you don't get greedy (which is really impressive given that it's procedurally generated).\n\nBig Difference 2)  Semi-ironman with the Rewind mechanic.  If you make a mistake (or just missclick, I did that a lot), you can rewind back to the start of your previous turn.  You only have limited uses per mission (3 on normal, 1 on hard, you can set it to 0), so it's not a free ticket (it's a very expensive ticket) and you can't use it to cheat RNG because there is no RNG.  I think it's a great for people like me without the time or patience for real ironman modes but do like have decisions matter.\n\nOh, and the 2D art and animation looks beautiful.\n\nEdit: I recommend the UI Tweaks mod (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=581951281), doesn't break achievements but does fix a few things.", "timestamp_created": 1498690804, "timestamp_updated": 1499014565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696588039398193359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32960362": {"recommendationid": "32960362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003523412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2787, "last_played": 1448797356}, "language": "english", "review": "X-COM disguised as Mission Imposible.", "timestamp_created": 1498686706, "timestamp_updated": 1498686706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463866055011749268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32924541": {"recommendationid": "32924541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268244937", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 974, "last_played": 1498564888}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting gameplay and plots.

As a turn-based strategy game, it requires a high level of planning and strategy to succeed. This is compounded by the \"rouguelike\" aspect of the game, meaning that you are not allowed to reload a previous save if you screw up. Depending on the difficulty level you choose, you may either have the ability to retry the level, use a limited number of \"rewinds\" which bring you back to the beginning of the previous turn, or, on \"ironman mode,\" have no safety net at all, meaning if you lose your team it is time to start a new game.\n\nThis unforgiving style is compounded by the seemingly unfairness of the fight. You are outnumbered and outgunned, infiltrating unknown enemy territory (levels are randomly generated), and you must rely on your stealth and cunning to make it through. Still, there are a number of tools at your disposal: distraction techniques, lethal and non-lethal attacks, a wide variety of powers and gadgets that range from traps to cloaking devices, and a hacking system that targets the various devices found in the level allowing you to access, disable, or remotely command them.\n\nWhile there are some random elements to the game that vary the way each run plays out (such as which types of missions are available, the layouts of each level, and items/powers you find on the way), the rest of the game is very deterministic. If you are very careful and diligent, you can play the enemy like a fiddle, pulling them this way and that so that your other agents can reach the mission objective (and/or rob the corporations blind). However, screw-ups do happen, and when they do, the situation can plunge from \"astounding success\" to \"catastrophic failure\" very quickly. There is no HP meter for your agents. If they are shot, they are permanently downed until another agent either drags them to the exit (leaving them vulnerable in the process) or revives them with Med Gel (which you may have inconveintly left behind to make room for that fantastic new gadget). It is possible to go on without them, but later missions are only going to be harder and it may be next-to-impossible to succeed with an under-manned team.\n\nHacking is a vital part of the game in order to get past cameras and drones - and to access the various \"shops\" that come in the form of firewalled terminals found inside the levels. The hacking system is, in some ways, a game within a game. You can switch between the \"real world\" and the \"virtual world\" of your A.I., Incognita. Everything she does requires power. Power can be generated by programs within Incognita, or through the actions of your agents (such as using their cybernetic augments or ordering them to hack consoles). This adds yet another layer of complexity to the game. If you are being hunted by guards and barely staying afloat, the last thing you want is to run out of power and get spotted on camera because you couldn't hack it. It leads to situations where you are running risky maneuvers in order to get to consoles, just so you can proceed unhindered through the rest of the level. The number of hazards, and their respective firewall levels, is increased each turn, so careful planning and efficient power usage is essential.\n\nIn the end, the beauty of \"Invisible, Inc.\" is its balance and the choices it forces you to make. It is both ruthlessly hard and extremely satisfying when you make it through a level without a hitch. You must choose between dodging past enemies, knocking them out for a couple turns, or killing them, each of which has its own concequences. You have to choose between that awesome gadget or a new hacking program that will help you with the increasingly difficult firewalls. You may have to choose to end your campaign or limp along with an under-manned team because your agent was seperated from the rest of the team and shot. This, and the huge variety of strategies available, make it a wildly satisifying experience.

There is so much to say... where to begin.  So, Invisible Inc. is very much in the vain of XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Within.  It is very tactical and strategic in your decisions. You really have to think everything through in order to proceed through the game.  The game does a really good job at building tension and making your choices matter in as far as which agents live/die/succeed/fail.\n\nYou control a team of agents that are part of a shadow organization that are trying to take down the corporations that have greedily taken over the world.  The game starts off by a break in of the shadow organization by the corporations, and your hacking AI pal is taken mobile.  This sets up the plot where the AI needs to be recharged after 72 hours (3 days).  Through out this in game time you build your team back up to its former glory for a final raid.  This has you breaking into detention facilities, stealing vault keys, and even enhancing your agents with cyborg type of modifications.\n\t\t\t\nThe game plays very well, it is not too hand holdy and lets you make some mistakes.  On the beginner level of difficulty it allows you to rewind, which is great for starting to understand how all the mechanics work without a huge long multilevel tutorial, don't get me wrong there is a very basic tutorial at the start but it doesn't prepare you like a whole first play-through does.  It is also one of those games that unlocks things as you play through it much like a roguelike, think how you unlock different characters in Binding of Issac. I feel as though this is one of those games that I can just sink a ton of hours into it if I am not careful. To add to this the game doesn't take itself too seriously and has a good sense of humor about it.\n\nSo... what are the cons to the game?  Well, I feel as though there a bunch of small little things that end up hurting the gameplay enough to knock it down a bit. The first thing is the controls and UI, most of the time they are fine but on occasion I found them clumsy.  For instance, in the previous image/video I was tabbing through my agents and thought I had Decker selected.  But in reality I had Dr. Xu selected and made a huge mistake of a move that I ended up rewinding.  The other thing\tthat normally doesn't get me is video game logic.  In the following video, you can see Decker taking out a guard right in front of another guard.  The second guard then gets alerted and dumbly follows suit in the next turn. First off the first guard should have seen a guy right next to him and not been taken down that easily, and then the second shouldn't have just followed blindly through the door on the next turn.  There are of ton of other instances of this fuzzy game logic, from doors magically opening to terrible patrol patterns that put a guard literally in a corner.  But this may have been more of the level of difficulty I was playing at but it still bugged me enough to mention it here.\n\nIn conclusion, I absolutely love this game.  It is right up my alley, the stealth is in a way I can digest it and process it.  The game really feels like a spiritual successor of sorts to XCOM.  I know it is exactly what they were going for, however, the bunch of mini issues brings this down to a 4/5 in my opinion.  If I were to change my scale I would even put it up there at a 9/10 or 4.5/5, it is a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes turn based strategy games.

I've won it in a Steamgifts giveaway a while ago - and it just doesn't get old. \n\nI grew up with the classic X-COM games (on DOS, not the remakes) and Invisible, Inc. manages to recreate at least two aspects: \n1) The constant tension of what might lurk behind the next corner, and\n2) The urge to play \"just one more mission\"... :D\n\nIt adds the possibility to hack and control devices and drones (ah well, you DID have mind control in X-COM). You can't develop your own weapons, though, but have to work with what is available in/between the missions. This adds to the complexity of the game. On \"Experienced\" difficulty and onward, you are being punished for exploring and looting: while the game is turn-based, there is a timer in the form of an \"alarm level\". The longer you take, the harder it is for you to go about unnoticed. So it's better to focus on the mission, even if there is a shiny corporate safe just a little detour away... \n\nThere is a bit of luck involved, just like in Roguelikes. The quality of your gear largely depends on what you are able to loot. \n\nIf you like turn-based isometric tactic games with an espionage/cyberpunk setting, definitely give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1493845296, "timestamp_updated": 1493845296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613829076290130615", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31503510": {"recommendationid": "31503510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024975241", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1350, "last_played": 1491413460}, "language": "english", "review": "Invisible, Inc. takes the old school hi-tech international super spy routine that Archer loves to parody and turns it into a riveting and deep turn-based strategy game.\n\nWhat to expect:\n-A world map with a selection of missions that must all be completed within seventy-two hours of in-game time.\n-Mission goals can involve securing loads of money, weapons, system upgrades or new party members\n-Mission maps are facility interiors divided into Fire Emblem-style squares. Your units (minimum of two and maximum of four) have a set number of actions in one turn, consumed by moving, peeking around corners, attacking enemies and more.\n-A cast of super spies with unique abilities and stats. As you progress, money that you steal can be used to upgrade them, buy them weapons, install augmentations into them or buy them tools.\n-Also under your control is a computer system called Incognita. This system can hack into the various consoles during missions to unlock money, weapons, upgrades, as well as disable security cameras, robots and more. Resources for Incognita hacking are limited, so be careful with your points.\n-Several difficulty levels and many options to customize a campaign. One campaign may involve six or seven missions before the finale.\n-Plot and story and characters are paper-thin. Honestly, that's just the window-dressing. Just focus on the really, in-depth strategy elements, alright?\n-Music consists of moody, dark spy themes that blend in with the technology and hacking theme of the game.\n-Art style depicts our characters and world in jagged, pointed shapes illuminated by bright colors just like computer monitors. I don't think anyone smiles once during this game. While the tone isn't unicorns-and-rainbows, it really isn't miserable and drained of life like a Zack Snyder film.\n\nIn conclusion, Invisible, Inc. is a solid purchase for any strategy fan.

It's a game that is so close to being excellent, but falls just short, making it all the more disappointing.\n\nOne of the key issues is that all upgrades throughout your run rely on the same currency. Credits are what you spend on items, upgrades to your hacking system, weapons, and character stats. For this reason, a typical playthrough will leave you short-changed in one area or more, even if you loot every safe in the level. For example: even if you net yourself 1500 credits (which is definitely well above average), that will maybe buy you an extra weapon, OR a hacking ability, OR a character implant, OR 1-2 stat upgrades. And remember, all characters have 4 stat categories to choose from, making it feel like you spent all that time and risked your life for very little. The game has a nasty habit overall of feeling stressful and unrewarding. You're very lucky to scrape by with your characters' lives when you clear an entire area, and you're not rewarded proportionally. There is no such thing as an overpowered run, which you might expect every few runs in a normal procedurally generated game. \n\nThe second biggest issue for me are guard behavior and patrols. You'll learn quickly that the best way to succeed in Invisible Inc. is to not KO every guard you pass, even if its stealthily--rather you're better off circumventing them completely, as that is the only way to keep them in predictable patterns. This is much easier said than done however, as many generated levels will have a single long hallway, 3 tiles wide, as the only way to proceed to the goal or exit. These areas are nearly imposible to sneak through, especially with a squad of 3-5 characters. Even when guards are in their predictable patterns, they can still easily walk right into your characters before you even knew they existed on the level. It is not uncommon for a guard to walk right into your characters' starting room the second you end your first turn, putting you in a tight or even inescapable spot immediately. \"Playing it safe\" doesn't help in this sense; even if you stack up every door and peek it, a guard has enough AP to come from 2 rooms over straight into your room before you knew they were there. \n\nWhere it gets unmanagable is when you alert guard(s) to your presence. If you are spotted (and there are many ways for your enemy to do so), you are put into overwatch where your character can move one tile into safety in order to survive. it's a crapshoot if you're in a position to escape these confrontations; many times all 8 possible tiles are watched by the enemy and will result in your death. Escaping these situations can be thrilling, but the fact is that the guard(s) that spotted you will be searching the map for the rest of the level. They will never go back to patrols. There is no way to predict where they will search next; as usual you cand spend an action point to observe their movement on the next turn but the place that they choose after finishing a search is entirely random and more often than not results in another character getting found or stuck in a corner. Later levels have guards that throw search grenades instead of walking directly to the area of interest, frequently putting a character into a neverending game of cat and mouse as your character can't get far enough away each turn to prevent their location being discovered.\n\nAll of this would be fine if you could spend the time learning the game's mechanics, mastering them, and getting good at the game. This is true only to the slightest extent: you can learn how to play, how to hide, how to avoid confrontation and what skills, characters, and items are useful. But after mastering the game's mechanics, You'll learn that there is no way to master the RNG related to guard behavior and level generation. These problems are only exacerbated by your complete lack of items and currency to buy the things you need to succeed. You will never have enough items, weapons, or skills in a given playthrough. And this isn't a case of \"thinking carefully where you want to spend your credits\", as there are many builds that are completely unviable and many failed runs where you looted every source of credits imaginable. \n\nOverall this lead me to constant frustration with a game that is so nearly great. It has an excellent framework and excellent mechanics that are fun to learn and thrilling when they rarely come together in a sucessful run. Unfortunately it is too rare to rely on as a fun, rewarding, and replayable rogue-like. I could recommend this game only to people as a sort of extremely difficult game to beat once, like those tough as nails platformers or something similar. But if you're expecting a rogue-like that you can replay endlessly, you'll have to look elsewhere, as this game will only leave you frustrated, exhausted, and stressed--even when you win.\n\nHope this helps you make a decision!", "timestamp_created": 1493682282, "timestamp_updated": 1493682282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53098982572555542", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31479715": {"recommendationid": "31479715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023666926", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1756, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1493614133}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

This is why:\n\nTurn-based stealth that actually works, with a number of interesting twists (hacking, character progression, a very interesting item system where each item has a tactical niche and an array of enemies, all of which have their own tactical niche as well). It's apparently very modular in how it's coded, too, meaning easy moddability, and even though there aren't an enormous number of mods (this game does have a fairly small audience compared to other Klei games) the mods that do exist are quite high-qualify, serving to enhance an already-fantastic game rather than being necessary to make the game enjoyable as can sometimes happen with games built around moddability.\n\nIn addition to the impressive campaign, which has you doing missions within a limited timeframe (which you can set in campaign generation, by the way, for a longer or shorter campaign) before a final confrontation, there is an Endless mode where difficulty will ramp up over the days just as in the campaign, except that the difficulty limit is much higher because, well, it's endless.\n\nI also love the way in which randomness is used here. Levels are procedurally generated -- which, by extension, means that guard placements and loot are also procedurally generated. But that's about it. This game is often compared to X-COM, and there are some similarities, but the fact that there is no \"chance-to-hit\" is an extremely important difference. If your agent has been spotted by a guard, you need to either break line of sight (without moving the spotted agent more than 1 tile; if they move from a watched tile to another watched tile they will be shot instantly) or neutralize (stun or kill) the alerted guard. All of this is governed by tightly designed rules, rather than the dice.\n\nAlso, you can customize the difficulty settings.\n\nThis is a very big deal. All of the factors that go into determining how hard the game is, you can change them individually instead of being frustrated that \"Experienced is too easy but Expert is too hard\" or something. Seriously, this is a fantastic way to approach difficulty scaling and more games need to implement it.\n\nIf you like turn-based games, or stealth games, or both, give this one a try. It's an amalgam of game concepts which seems like it shouldn't work, but in fact does so beautifully.

Invisible, Inc. is simply one of the best single-player games I've ever played\n\nThe theme is evoked well and the mechanisms of play are finely tuned. The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistake\n\nInvisible, Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really be\n\nThe perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever be\n\nPoints of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, but I think Invisible, Inc. outclasses them all\n\nMy only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome. It's not so fun when you have a \"super agent\" able to avoid or overcome all opposition\n\nThe relatively short campaign time-frame and random item availability prevents this from becoming a significant problem though\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1489274443, "timestamp_updated": 1489274443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452527105808258057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30453183": {"recommendationid": "30453183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028179042", "num_games_owned": 5856, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1490380757}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Normalmente no se me dan los juegos de sigilo y me frustran mucho, aunque cada vez juego m\u00e1s y les voy cogiendo el truquillo. Soy muy fan de la saga X-COM y me gusta la mec\u00e1nica de misiones por turnos, personajes diferentes y equipo que te permite diferentes t\u00e1cticas. Y Mark of the Ninja me enamor\u00f3 y la est\u00e9tica del juego es muy similar (sobretodo la animaci\u00f3n al dejar a guardias K.O. con el t\u00e1ser).\n\nEl juego es muy fluido y funciona muy bien, por lo que he le\u00eddo y por lo que dicen en los cr\u00e9ditos gracias al tiempo que estuvo en Early Access, que al parecer fue de los pocos juegos que lo hizo bien y le sac\u00f3 rendimiento.\n\nEl producto final es excelente y en oferta (como ahora cuando escribo que est\u00e1 al 70%) es un regalo. No recuerdo si lo compr\u00e9 en un bundle o al final ca\u00ed, porque estaba esperando al (75% de descuento y parec\u00eda que nunca llegaba).\n\nHe acabado la historia en el nivel m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil (beginner) y aunque me ha costado (no perdona los errores) y pens\u00e9 que no lo iba a conseguir porque en el \u00faltimo turno ten\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente a todo el equipo asediado por un soldado con armadura y las \u00fanicas armas que le afectaban estaban recargando y faltaban varios turnos... Pero estoy muy animado a intentarlo a m\u00e1s dificultad con todo lo que he aprendido con mis errores.\n\nMi primer problema fueron los mapas, no son f\u00e1ciles de ver si no te fijas y le coges el truco y mor\u00ed en la segunda misi\u00f3n porque no me di cuenta que me faltaba una puerta y cuando me pregunt\u00f3 que si quer\u00eda irme sin cumplir la misi\u00f3n (un rescate), tras mucho buscar encontr\u00e9 la puerta que faltaba, pero el tiempo no perdona.\n\nEn parte la dificultad es seria incluso en el nivel m\u00e1s bajo porque seg\u00fan va pasando el tiempo aumenta la dificultad y salen m\u00e1s enemigos y m\u00e1s poderosos y se reactivan las c\u00e1maras y aparatos que t\u00fa hab\u00edas desconectado. Y al principio yo lo not\u00e9 mucho, porque al ser un juego de sigilo iba de forma bastante prudente y sin avanzar demasiado y se me echaba el tiempo encima. Tarde en aprender que puedes esprintar arriesgando ser o\u00eddo, muy \u00fatil en zonas que tienes despejadas.\n\nLa selecci\u00f3n de misiones es fundamental, ya que vas contra el tiempo y conseguir dinero, armas y mejoras es el alma del juego, y no te gu\u00eda apenas ni en el orden ni en la prioridad, as\u00ed que es f\u00e1cil cometer errores.\n\nEl avance de los personajes es sencillo, pero con tantas opciones que es dif\u00edcil explorarlas todas en una partida y cuando empiezas a cogerles el truco se acaban.\n\nLa trama me ha encantado del principio, al final y los personajes est\u00e1n muy bien presentados y definidos. Me he perdido un par de conversaciones de las que tiene el grupo al principio de misiones, porque me concentraba en ver lo que hab\u00eda a la vista en ese nivel y los objetivos o porque me distra\u00eda algo de fuera del juego. Es una pena que no haya forma de volver a reproducirlo (o no la encontr\u00e9) porque me parece que depende de los personajes que lleves y el tiempo que lleven juntos.\n\nLa parte de hackeo tambi\u00e9n es tremenda, con muchas opciones y al principio te supera mucho. Cuando ya le has pillado el truco te suben la dificultad y todo se complica. Es como un juego paralelo y bastante indispensable para progresar en el juego, as\u00ed que es otra cosa m\u00e1s a tener en cuenta.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n ci-fi me encant\u00f3, las guerras corporativas y todos los cachivaches y mejoras tan a lo James Bond o Cyberpunk, que encima te dejan la opci\u00f3n de elegir como quieres jugar y que no son f\u00e1ciles de conseguir y son suficientemente caras para que te tengas que centrar.\n\nLa conclusi\u00f3n es que como Mark of the Ninja me parece un juego redondo, muy simple y f\u00e1cil de jugar pero muy dif\u00edcil de dominar y que puede dar para muchas horas de juego, sobretodo si te gusta el g\u00e9nero.", "timestamp_created": 1489256491, "timestamp_updated": 1489256623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539365708827972412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30448625": {"recommendationid": "30448625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049790976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 911, "last_played": 1600980405}, "language": "english", "review": "Invisible , Inc. is a turn based stealth rpg and a really good one at that.

To illustrate, here are some highlights from my playthrough history (I wrote them all down because I was so excited to try new combinations of agents and programs after my first few runs) (warning: SPOILERS for unlockable agents and programs):\n\n1. Beginner, Decker + Internationale, Power Drip + Lockpick 1.0: Victory!\n2. Experienced, Shalem 11 + Banks, Fusion + Parasite: Defeat!\n4. Experienced, Internationale + Central, Faust + Brimstone: Victory!\n6. Expert, Archive Dr. Xu + Prism, Dynamo + Rapier: Victory!\n11. Expert Ironman, Decker + Archive Shalem 11, Fusion + Lockpick 1.0: Victory!\n12: Expert Plus with DLC, Archive Decker + Draco, Seed + Golem: Victory!\n13. Time Attack, Archive Banks + Dr. Xu, Power Drip + Parasite: Victory!\n15. Endless Plus with DLC, Archive Prism + Derek, Fusion + Parasite: survived over 20 days\n\nThe main reason I could play the game so many times is that the main campaign is relatively short (maybe 6-8 hours? x1.5 with the DLC enabled). This to me was actually part of the game's charm: because there are many ways your playthrough can go (which missions are offered, which agents you can rescue, which items you can buy; all of which are limited in a single playthrough), each playthrough really feels like you are making the most of what's presented to you to build up your team. And it is NOT the case that you will reach a point where you are definitively \"ready for the final mission.\" The final mission will happen when it happens, and sometimes you will go into thinking you're not prepared because you botched a couple earlier missions, but you will actually manage to succeed. This happened to me more than once, and along with other aspects of the game leads me to believe the game is very well balanced. I like as a design choice that you can mess up along the way but still recover.\n\nNot to mention the mods that the community has created. I just finished my 16th playthrough overall, but the first with a mod enabled (Shogal's Rescuable Archive Agents mod), and about to start my 17th, ready now to enable several mods at once, allowing for new agents, programs, items and enemies. The game's mechanics are easy to understand but hard to master. I'm excited to take what I've learned and apply them to a new challenge.\n\nTL;DR: One of my all-time favourite (turn-based strategy/tactics) games; think XCOM: Enemy Unknown but shorter/with a greater focus on replayability, and less RNG/more procedurally-generated challenges. No manual saving allowed, but 1-5 \"undos\" per mission depending on difficulty keeps tension high without being overly punishing. DLC adds flavour but the base game is definitely already complete without it.", "timestamp_created": 1489037085, "timestamp_updated": 1489037663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30383195": {"recommendationid": "30383195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126238881", "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4145, "last_played": 1609186516}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game very much, although it started to be a bit boring and monotonnous after 60ish hours of play, having almost beaten Endless Mode.

Was it worth $7 including DLC? Absolutely. Is it worth $24 with said DLC? Debateable, depending on how much you're sold on this game before buyinig it. Invisible Inc. is an amalgamation of many different things that I love in video games. It's a procedurally-generated, turn-based stealth game with a cyberpunk aesthetic. \n\nYou start each campaign with two agents, and it's up to you to direct them through the sprawling, massive levels to accomplish the objectives, whatever they may be. There are four different corporations for you to infiltrate, with locations all around the world. They each have their own strengths and unique units to make life harder for your agents. But the agents are unique too. While you initially only start out being able to choose 2 at the beginning of the  campaign, you unlock many more by gaining XP at the end of each playthrough, whether you succeed or not. Each agent has unique starting skills and abilities, but you can re-spec them throughout a campaign to suit your own, unique playstle. You also gradually unlock new starting programs, which are used for the hacking mechanic. All of Invisible Inc's missions contain hackable items. You can hack a camera and make their eyes into your own, or you can hack into a safe and uncover credits or items. Hacking costs PWR, which is very limited, so it isn't the solution to everything.\n\nConcerning the campaigns, every playthrough is unique. While they begin and end with the same mission types, the level layout and location are always different. Now, the campaign itself is quite short, taking place over the course of just 72 hours, or 120 if you get the DLC. This can be a problem for some people, as you may simply not get the right missions in order to be prepared for the brutal final assault at the end. I personally, don't get mad when I have to start over, because it just means I get to play more Invisible Inc.\n\nThe missions (you'll have time for about 5-7 of them in a 72 hour campaign), are thrilling high-risk, high-reward endeavors that provide a lot of memorable moments. There are many different mission types, such as robbing corporate vaults or accessing a server farm. They each present their own unique challenges; crack that vault open, and enforcer units will arrive to investigate the location. Universally, though, all missions have a turn limit of sorts. Even if your agents remain completely undetected, without disturbing any sentries, the alarm level gradually ramps up each turn. When the alarm stage increases, the mission becomes more difficult. Additional cameras activate, more guards arrive, and they eventually pinpoint your location. You spend the entire time stalked by this turn counter, so every move counts. In addition to main objectives, you may stumble across a side-mission that unlocks additional awards if completed. They're rather limited in the base game, but the DLC adds many more.\n\nThe story is rather minimal, which I found disappointing just because of the interesting universe that is implied by the parts we do see. The dev team was pretty small, and only three characters receive voice acting. For a team this small, I'm glad they focused on the gameplay, but your mileage may vary.\n\nOverall, Invisible Inc is an absolutely thrilling experience that I recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based tactics, stealth, or just cyberpunk in general. If you're interested but not fully convinced, then just wait for it to go on sale. I, for one, am happy to give Klei my money so they can hopefully make games like this, and perhaps, one day, a sequel.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488397860, "timestamp_updated": 1488397860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760828077793121338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30248576": {"recommendationid": "30248576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281701367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 30943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2669, "last_played": 1683779185}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely!

The real genius though, lies in how the game handles mistakes. In many games failure just costs time, or you are forced to reload whenever you make a mistake. Invisibles Inc. also allows this, but it really shines when you set up a game without rewinds or reloads. Then you get to experience how good a game can really be. The perfectly executed stealthy infiltration can quickly become a deadly game of cat and mouse, and successfully pulling unconscious agents out of a botched operation is way more satisfying than a reload could ever be.\n\nPoints of reference could be XCOM or the best roguelikes, like Brogue, but I think Invisibles Inc. outclasses them all.\n\nMy only criticism lies with how certain equipment can make core elements of the game trivial to overcome.

One of the best stealth game ever played. This game is also extremely stressing for a turn based strategy game. Normally, I only get stressed in real time games.  It's the kind of game where forgetting to close a door can put you into serious trouble.\n\nThere is a couple of design decisions that I don't like, for example shopping during mission. Seriously, even shopping is stressful. I also don't like the fact that the alarm level advance each turn, first because it's stressing, second because when you have few characters it's hard to explore the whole level.\n\nBut good news, many of these games quicks can be house ruled. So you can configure the game to your taste. On your first game, I recommend using the 72 hours length with no expansion elements. I did the error of doing the 120 hour + 48 hours from the expansion which made the game way too long.\n\nAnother interesting things is that the game campaign of 72 hours is not that long. You'll play at most a dozen of missions, which makes the game fun to play again and again instead of one huge campaign. \n\nThe story is minimal, but very interesting, like all their other games. I would have not asked for more story. There are a lot of details in the game, and sometimes you wonder if doing X in Y situation would actually work but you are not sure. To get arround this ambuguity, you can undo your turn a limited number of time.\n\nOverall very good game, I recommend it to everybody.

In comparison to most stealth-oriented games, where exploring the environment, and figuring out how to use it to your advantage or make progress, is half of the game, this game doesn't work like that; you are effectively timed in each mission, the escalating alarms serving as a disincentive to open up the entire map of the level (think Spelunky), merely complete your objectives and gtfo, if you're an explorer or a completionist you're going to have to come to terms with this. The exception to this rule is endless mode, where eventually you will have to unlock pretty much every safe in a level to find an exit key, which I found aggravating as all hell but that's kind of the point.\n\nOnce I got past that though I really enjoyed it, the RNG can be unfair sometimes but that's generally when you break out the lethal weapons in a run, rather than knock-outs (at which point, it really does start to feel like Xcom). And really, once you're done achievement-whoring you can set up the campaign options however you like, even moreso if you download and install a couple mods, to the point of allowing you to control the frequency of random difficulty occuring mid-mission.\n\nI have everything Klei's made besides Shank and the stuff precluding it in my Steam library...I still haven't played Don't Starve or its DLC but between this and Mark of the Ninja (the best Batman game ever made, by the by), and their upcoming Sims in Space game that I want so goddamn bad called \"Oxygen Not Included\", I'll have to at least look at whatever they release, even if it looks stupid; these guys do solid work, and their games are often either outside the box (and good), or its something that's already been done before, but now done like you always kinda wanted it to be.\n\nDid I mention mods?

This is what all stealth games should be.\n\nA bold move by Klei, the king of bold moves in videogames, this is an isometric turn-based PvE cyberspy simulator, and it goes much better than you'd think. It's 2074 and government has been replaced by evil supercorporations, so your targets are one of four of them who own all the credits and shiny plasma guns. \n\nGameplay consists of ninja-ing around buildings, predicting guard patrols, stealing items, hacking mainframe devices to use to your advantage, and trying not to get annihilated by the constant barrage of unforseen threats. A lot of this game's fun lies in getting fucked over halfway through a mission and having to dig yourself out, i.e., getting spotted by an unnoticed guard and alerting the whole building, security daemons that give you negative status effects, or just being an idiot and having no way to undo your mistake (You get 1-5 rewinds depending on difficulty). Invisible Inc. does not forgive, and I'm glad it doesn't, because then the missions wouldn't be mind-shatteringly tense to play, and incredibly rewarding to beat.\n\nAs per Klei, the art direction is beautiful. The bloom from glowing hallways, the stylised futuristic theme, and the subtle screen effects, like distortion when activating Incognita (Hacker mode) make for an incredibly nice game to look at, admire, admire too hard, die, and admire the game over screen. The game over screen is also beautiful, because it along with the mission report gives you a plethora of information on how you were the most unprofessional spy agency on the planet. Another lovely thing about the levels is the tantalising prospect of the perfect run: nobody sees you, you loot every safe, hack every camera, complete the objective, and leave before anyone even realises you were there. This is a rare occurrence, but when it happens, it's like thunderous applause from every human being on Earth.\n\nThe soundtrack... the soundtrack. It's exquisite. It's everything I could've ever asked for from this theme. The music ramps up gradually as security tightens, going from foreboding background strings to \"Everything is insanity and red flashing alarms and on fire\". It adds SO much to the game.

Most of your agents are KIA and MIA, as you progress through the campaign whether you fail or not you gain experience to unlock a numerous amount of agents who have unique augments and starting items.\n\nThe Progession of the game is inherently the unlocking of hacking programs and agents that you can choose at the beginning of the campaign. This is why the campaign has replayability, lots of replayability. Though there is one ending and the story is linear between your progression the agents and programs you unlock give you a tad bit more insight into the lore, and different ways to play the game as well. There is various amounts of modes you can play whether you up the difficulty, go into a time based mode where you can't pause or whether you've become an expert at the game you can still ramp up the difficulty to ludicrous amounts.\n\nThere's an Endless Mode which is truly the bread and butter of the game, as the campaign after playing it can be repetitive, endless mode had a different story and truly a endless one, as you get further in the mode it becomes difficult to the point of near impossible, it's endless potential of difficulty is what kept me playing this game. \n\nThe soundtrack is astounding by my standards, I often listen to it on my own accord, the gameplay and mechanics are simple but combined with it's strategic basis it still provided moments of difficulty. The DLC is worth it and you should also download rescuable archivable agents mod to enhance the game.\n\nThe game isn't without some flaws however. Some archivable agents you unlock cannot be rescued in some rescuable missions within the campaign ( Detention center missions) which means more often than not you'll only run into the traditional combination of agents that you've most likely tried before in a previous playthrough. You can solve this problem downloading the mod choose which agents spawn in the detention centers. The campaign is will only last approximately 10 hours for each playthrough so the story is short.\n\nThe story is very well written and great but very scarce in it's presentation, only giving you glimpses of the story and history of it's universe through very rare dialogue between agents, or between the missions(which always happen), and through the profiles of the agents you unlock ( also their archivable versions ), but still lacks in quantity. It can leave you asking more questions than when you left with.\n\nr8ing = 8.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1483910546, "timestamp_updated": 1483910546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29127173": {"recommendationid": "29127173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115564275", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1061, "last_played": 1656693411}, "language": "english", "review": "it's a fun game with infinite posibilities", "timestamp_created": 1483910541, "timestamp_updated": 1483910541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29124872": {"recommendationid": "29124872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037511927", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1483903570}, "language": "english", "review": "Rouge-like based on sneaking... \n\nYes please", "timestamp_created": 1483904167, "timestamp_updated": 1483904167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29124754": {"recommendationid": "29124754", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998465825", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1018, "last_played": 1570310185}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best designed turn-based games.

Set in a future where Corperations spend an insane amount of money on security and on infiltrating eachother, your organization is on the run after a raid on your HQ as you learn that your group spent the least on security.  And now your group is on the run and it begins the game with only 2 agents against all the mega corps of the world.  \n\nThe flow of the game itself is even xcom like with a world/planning screen where you choose missions and equipment and a tactical screen  where you execute the missions.  The design of both layers are very tight and usually when you've got a tough choice, it's usually between 2 or 3 choices rather than a complex web of things to consider and every choice feels very powerful when it works out.  Nothing feels too marginal and everything has it's use which is nessecary for a good procedurally generated game.  And building a good team adds another bit of suspense when you start to put your agents in more and more danger with the risk of any of them getting captured.  It only takes 1 shot to take out any of your characters and every 5 turns the difficulty increases in some way as the corp security close in as you run out of places to hide.  The one major gripe I can find is that the game can get pretty visually cluttered at times and can be hard to descifer whats happening and what to do if there are a lot of entities and walls/corners in a small space.\n\nEven though the RNG can get pretty brutal especially with some with mission rewards, never had any procedurally genn-ed game give such E M O T I O N S.

Whatever it is that frustrates you; you can get rid of it with one click.\n10/10 would absolutely recommend if you like strategy games.\n\nedit: No longer failing Experienced difficulty, I beat the game in Experienced, Expert, and Time Attack mode now, all of which once seemed impossible to even survive one level in.

If you like strategy and intersting micro-management, this game is for you.\n\nI really like Invisible Ink, which is for me the elegent version of X-com two. There is less content, less graphics, less super-powers, but the ones that exists have intersting interaction, and therefore the gameplay is funnier than the one in the X-com series.\n- first randomness is correctly managed. No unlucky shots, or bad luck when performing and action. Everything you do will work, but the enemy reaction and the level layout are randoms. This is definitively a good decision as it create the illusion that the enemy has a plan, and it makes exploration crucial.\n- then, exploration is fun, as it's a poker game : the more you explore, the better decision you'll take and the more loot you will gain, but the more time you will loose. And time (in fact turns) are a precious ressource : as time passes, the enemy gets stronger and you'll have more gards, more enemy programs and harder hacking to handle.\n- then the game is more readable : this is simple 2D, with simple cover, and simple actions. You don't have to try everything 10 times to understand how it works. Things just do what's written in the description, that's intuitive and cool. Difficulties comes from poker and interaction, not from hard to understand interface.\nSo if you like strategy, you'll like this game.\n\nHere comes the usual paragraph about music and graphics. In fe words, they do the job. Graphics are cool, with a style that fits perfectly well in a High-tech spy game and easy to read. There is no anoying stuff (like bad rotating camera, useless details, anoying particles, fog or whatever graphics cards sellers likes, but gamers hate), and no creative or awsome things. And the music is the same way : minimal ambiant.\n\nAnd now, here is the paragraph about the invisible pink unicorn. She's in the game, but you cannot see her, as she's as invisible as the ink.
