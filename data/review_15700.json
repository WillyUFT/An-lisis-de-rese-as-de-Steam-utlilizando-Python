La historia sigue a Abe, un esclavo Mudokon que se embarca en una misi\u00f3n para liberar a su gente de la explotaci\u00f3n de una corporaci\u00f3n mal\u00e9vola. La trama se desarrolla en el mundo oscuro y surrealista de Oddworld, y ha sido apreciada por su originalidad y profundidad. Los temas de la esclavitud y la liberaci\u00f3n proporcionan una base emocionalmente resonante para la historia.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, los gr\u00e1ficos y el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico han sido puntos destacados en las cr\u00edticas. El juego presenta un estilo visual distintivo y detallado que ha envejecido sorprendentemente bien. Los entornos y personajes est\u00e1n ricamente dise\u00f1ados, lo que crea una atm\u00f3sfera inmersiva en el mundo de Oddworld.\n\nEl juego tambi\u00e9n ha sido elogiado por su jugabilidad desafiante. Los jugadores deben resolver rompecabezas, evitar trampas y enfrentar enemigos mientras gu\u00edan a Abe a trav\u00e9s de varios niveles. La necesidad de estrategia y habilidad ha sido considerada como uno de los aspectos m\u00e1s gratificantes del juego.\n\nSin embargo, algunas cr\u00edticas han se\u00f1alado que la curva de dificultad puede ser empinada en ciertos puntos del juego, lo que puede resultar frustrante para algunos jugadores.

Here's my honest assessment, highlighting the game's outdated graphics and cumbersome controls.\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee was released quite a while ago, and unfortunately, time has not been kind to its graphics. The visual quality is noticeably dated, with pixelated character models and environments lacking the detail we have come to expect in modern games. While it's important to appreciate the game's historical significance, it may be a significant hurdle for newcomers looking for a visually immersive experience.\n\nOne of the major downsides of playing Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee today is the wonky controls. Compared to contemporary games, the control scheme feels clunky and unrefined. Maneuvering Abe can be a frustrating experience, as the character's movements feel imprecise and often unresponsive. This lack of fluidity can lead to unnecessary deaths and repetitive trial-and-error gameplay that may quickly sour the overall experience.\n\nIn the end, unless you are a die-hard fan seeking a nostalgic trip down memory lane, I would caution against picking up Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Its outdated graphics and cumbersome controls make it a tough sell for those accustomed to modern gaming conveniences. However, if you can overlook these shortcomings and appreciate the game for its historical significance, you might find some enjoyment in its unique world and gameplay mechanics.\n",

This and that actually have pretty distinct art styles, mostly because each game has a wide array of locales.\n\nThis game I think they had a smaller team and probably didn't have the art process down perfect yet, so some of the backgrounds and screens in Oddysee feel at times a bit lacking in detail. It's not really a huge problem though, since I still find the game pretty visually stimulating and pleasant to look at. RuptureFarms in particular really stands out I think as like a steel mill meat processing nightmare with highly OSHA non-compliant hardware and machinery.\n\nBut anyway, aside from the graphics which I maintain are pretty stunning still to this day, I think the running and jumping gameplay in this one is very very good. Abe has his momentum in canned animation form, and part of getting good at the game is just adapting to the delay in pretty much everything he does. \n\nIn some games, this I think would be a detriment, it doesn't really bother me in Abe's Oddysee however because half the battle is figuring out what you're meant to do, and executing it tends to not be all that difficult once you are comfortable enough with the controls.\n\nAnyway, running and jumping aside, most of the stuff you do basically changes from zone to zone, the opening in RuptureFarms you're aiming simply to escape, and if you can liberate some friends along the way, all the better. You touch bombs to turn them on or more frequently off, you pick up bombs and throw them at people, you possess sligs and make them shoot each other up, and you avoid all of the numerous hazards to the best of your ability along the way (especially pits which will probably be like half your total deaths).\n\nThe game is challenging, even without the controls being a little difficult. Sligs for instance will pause sometimes for almost exactly the amount of time you need to cross a gap, moving from shadow to shadow. When you walk on screen, and enemies start moving, sometimes you only have a second or two to figure out what you're looking at and how to react, so dying is not an infrequent thing. \n\nFortunately, this game and the sequel both give you infinite lives and continues, so you never really need to worry about not being able to progress, and dying can reset a situation if it develops out of your control (i.e. too many sligs are awake in the next room or something) or if on a rare occasion you find yourself softlocked (which is rare but can happen).\n\nUnfortunately, Abe's Oddysee has full control over the checkpoint system, and you can only checkpoint yourself a couple of times per level! The save system also only returns you to the last checkpoint you reached, so unlike Exoddus, clearing an extremely difficult part can mean sometimes, you might have to do another immediately after, without a checkpoint, and that can be rough.\n\nSo really, I'd say this one is even harder than the sequel, since in that one you have 'quiksaves' and so on.\n\nOverall though, it's just a blast from start to finish, even though the checkpoint thing can get a bit frustrating or tedious at times.

I'll forgive them not being smart enough to jump or roll, but they always require a \"hello! -> follow me!\", which by itself is fine, but there are sections where time (and timing) is REALLY of the essence. And in the middle of it a modokon is likely to stop following you because he had to stand still for three seconds and he'd rather literally die than wait more than that. Thanks friend.\n\nThe difficulty is all over the place, too. Halfway point felt like a tempting moment to drop the game. I figured that if it's been this rage-inducing up to this point, I can only imagine what awaits onwards.\nBut as it turned out, the second half of the game was overall [i]easier[/i], less rich in artificial difficulty, felt more consistent, gave more feedback on your progress, and was oddly swimming in grenades which often could provide alternative solutions to problems. It also had no secret areas, which are generally the hardest part of the game, because 1) you have to find them in the first place, 2) they tend to be the most unfair sections and 3) there often isn't a savepoint after them, so even on success you end up replaying them a lot.\nAnd for some reason, all of them were shoved into the first half of the game? Bizarre.\n\nHardest section of the game is arguably the second quarter, after you [spoiler]escape Rupture Farms and before you return to it. Particularly the wildlife trials you're being put through by your tribe to prepare for rescuing modokans from the evil meat plant. Makes me think that you know guys, this could have been much easier and less prone to failure if instead of putting me trough the tests you'd just let me handle the rescuing uninterrupted.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b]\n[b]+[/b] good and unique visuals\n[b]+[/b] quality music and sound effects\n[b]+[/b] atmospheric\n[b]-[/b] jank savepoint system from hell\n[b]-[/b] questionable responsiveness of controls and movement\n[b]-[/b] difficulty that more often than not feels artificial and not \"fair\"\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b]\nTo elaborate on my gripe with the save system, and what makes me call it jank,\n\nwhen you get past a savepoint, there's a visual indication that it was in fact savepoint, and you usually notice it, but it's subtle enough that sometimes in the heat of things you might miss it and be unsure if the last save was a moment ago, or a long time ago. There is manual saving, but the way it works it reloads you to the last successful savepoint.\n\nThe best way to describe how it's jank is to imagine savepoints are one-time use. After that, a savepoint spot is inactive, and only becomes active again if you traverse to a later/earlier savepoint - then that previously inactive savepoint spot becomes active again if you go back to it. Consequentially, it causes a lot of annoying backtracking back-and-forth between savepoints just to be sure progress is saved.\nIt didn't work like that 100% of the time for whatever reason, but the best way to make it work consistently for you is to assume that's the case.\n\nProblem is, some sections do not [i]have[/i] more than 1 savepoint, so it basically forces you to complete a few sequences perfectly with no way to save progress in between because if you die, you have to redo the whole series of sequences again. Some of the hardest hidden areas liked to be placed in the middle of those.\n\nIt wasn't consistent though, in the sense that those multiple-sequences-per-savepoint weren't reserved for the later areas, and if anything most (if not all) of them were present in the first half of the game.

I've encountered a glitch while dying where my screen just went completely black and I couldn't do anything except restarting the game, so save the game regularly while playing just in case.\n\nThe game is tough as nails and not easy, whether you're trying to save all the Mudokons or not.

Too bad, git gud. \n\nOverall depending on how powerful you computer or laptop is, your experience of this game will play differently but I've had a blast revisiting this classic title and can't wait to play the steam port for Abe's Exxodus. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1667469759, "timestamp_updated": 1667469759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48469388484954834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124869025": {"recommendationid": "124869025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120404708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1678583577}, "language": "english", "review": "glukka", "timestamp_created": 1667460983, "timestamp_updated": 1667460983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124814626": {"recommendationid": "124814626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067371366", "num_games_owned": 2030, "num_reviews": 558, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 212, "last_played": 1451911149}, "language": "english", "review": "No time for a review so I give this game a rank S.\nA masterpiece - you need to do this game once in your life!!!\n(EDIT: careful, old game, reportedly bad port, check for newer versions)\nSee my profile for more details about my reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1667369237, "timestamp_updated": 1667369237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124687992": {"recommendationid": "124687992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972502096", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1667169425}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1667169481, "timestamp_updated": 1667169481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124441849": {"recommendationid": "124441849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138616914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1666839401}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun but challenging.", "timestamp_created": 1666826553, "timestamp_updated": 1666826553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123866442": {"recommendationid": "123866442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996117206", "num_games_owned": 995, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1665837684}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unplayable and unforgiving.

I heavily recommend this title, but you should either play using the R.E.L.I.V.E engine, with which you will have native gamepad support and don't have to deal with most of these bugs, or the Playstation version which has slightly lower quality backgrounds and sprites but better effects. Currently with R.E.L.I.V.E you will still encounter some minor problems (I will list these later), however the R.E.L.I.V.E project plans on fixing these remaining issues eventually. It can't be overstated how much R.E.L.I.V.E improves this port, I consider it a crucial install if you plan on playing the PC version.\n\nAbe's Oddysee is an cinematic action adventure puzzle platformer. Trial and error, experimentation, and precision are primary aspects of the gameplay loop. Death is part of the process here; accept this and you have a great time on your hands. If this does not sound fun to you then you probably won't like this game. \n\nSoaked in atmosphere, and dense with content and challenge, it is an unforgettable journey that everyone deserves to experience at least once in their lives. As an escaped slave turned savior, the future of your species and others rest on your shoulders. Industrialists control and consume the continent of Mudos, escape your fate as a popsicle and enact revenge.\n\nWhen working properly, Abe's Oddysee has very responsive and accurate controls. Coming from traditional platformers, you may feel the controls to be stiff or clunky, I believe this is mainly due to character movements taking place on a grid. Once you get used to this concept gameplay will feel much smoother and you will have complete control of your character. There is little to no input buffer here, you input the action exactly when you want it to happen. The result of this is a dependable sandbox of environments and characters that encourages player expression and creative thinking.\n\nI heavily recommend you find the time to experience this masterwork. Even now, but especially for its time, Abe's Oddysee explores new territory showing just what a video game can be, pushing the limits of game design to be something truly unique. While New N' Tasty is not a bad remake, in my opinion it does not live up to the originals, especially when it comes to the gameplay and art direction.\n\nIf you choose to play using R.E.L.I.V.E these are the bugs from the port you currently may encounter and how to deal with them:\n\n-Droning sound effect. Sometimes something like a portal sound will get \"stuck\" and continuously loop rather annoying, this is fixed by simply pausing and unpausing\n\n-Broken Toggle Mine. Sometimes the button on the UXB mines will stop working, restart the game to fix this issue.\n\n-Crashes. Though crashes are much less common, they still happen, and while rare it can happen right at the end of a difficult level, so be aware of that possibility. This may sound like a super bad thing, but really is is not that bad, by the time you get to harder parts of the game you will be so skilled that redoing one section will mean nothing to you. If this is a deal breaker for you, play the Playstation version.", "timestamp_created": 1663580210, "timestamp_updated": 1664006831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481075048446655273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122177612": {"recommendationid": "122177612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042582659", "num_games_owned": 470, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 606, "last_played": 1663054432}, "language": "english", "review": "Shoddy PC port controls / glitches and it's frustratingly sparse checkpoint system has had me playing the same section over and over and over and over for about four hours now.", "timestamp_created": 1663062751, "timestamp_updated": 1663062751, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122130065": {"recommendationid": "122130065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006456306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1663392497}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game.

Sure you'll often play sections with chases and self destruct sequences but most of the time you're sneaking around, hiding in shadows and moving carefully, inching towards guards and wild beasts, breathing right under their neck all the while guiding your racially motivated minions to salvation.\nIt sure is a fair bit more stressful than most other kids games, yet at the same time it offers moments of relief, where the farther away from civilization you find yourself in the more breathing room you're given to work around with. Its really around the middle part of the game where oddworld comes into its own, with visuals and music that simply can't be replicated, not even by any of its, admitedly more fun sequels...\n\nIts really a unique and imaginative game about starving smurf shamans that ride on camels who hex middle class workers for their horrid dietary habits and i've always thought its pretty cool. Its a criminally cheap and great introduction to the fairly abandoned subgenre of cinematic platformers so give it a try and feel free to neglect the existence of oddworld soulstorm in the process.", "timestamp_created": 1645507767, "timestamp_updated": 1645507767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569144666194915771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110400222": {"recommendationid": "110400222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998598944", "num_games_owned": 2046, "num_reviews": 1063, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1645072702}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets 5 seconds in before it begins stuttering uncontrollably.

The original artists added touches to the pre-rendered environments post processing, giving everything this gritty, industrial look. It's lacking in the remake (everything looks too clean), and detracts from the message of environmental degredation. If you can get past the hard-coded low resolution, the original game still has a charm to it that the remake lacks.\n\n\tThe game itself is a puzzle platformer. The puzzles are fantastic, making use of environmental hazards and enemy types. Everything is slowly introduced and made full use of. There are quirky features, such as being able to jump between the fore and background. Abe can't do anything beyond a regular human in terms of physicality, making this a slower, but more methodical platformer. There's a lot of trial and error, which actually leads to my next point. \n\n\tAbe's Oddysee's chief sin are the trash controls. Abe will always run through his animation cycles before responding to player input. This means that if you stop pressing left or right, he will stop only after his walking animation does. If you press jump or duck, there is always a delay between the input and the actual action on-screen. There's even an ever so slight \"recovery from walking down a ledge\" animation, which is disastrous when there is an enemy at the bottom of the ledge that WILL immediately chase you. \n\n\tThis wouldn't even be an issue if the game didn't feel the need to become Mario the Hedgehog every once in a while, with speed and precision platforming minus the tight controls. It becomes a game of pressing buttons not when you want to, but when you can visually see (or estimate) based on the animation cycles. Which creates its own issue as you either stopped running too early or too late when something is chasing you. Often, the game just fails to register me pressing 'jump' after falling down a ledge and running for some bizarre reason.\n\n\tYou can't even excuse this due to age, since platformers over a decade older than this didn't have these issues. If the game had a quick-save feature (typical of PC games at the time), it would go a long way towards alleviating these grievances. The controls would still be an issue, but I could at least retry straight away. Thankfully, the remake (and sequel) implemented quick-saves.\n\n\tFrustratingly hard games aren't new to me, but having to simultaneously fight with the controls is. I eventually became proficient enough to look past the control scheme, but I was ocassionally reminded of how stupid it is that Abe controls like he's in a point and click. This is still a fantastic puzzle platformer, but the remake fixes so much. Unless you really value grittier environments, just play the remake. If it didn't exist, I'd [i]probably[/i] give this a thumbs up, cause you [b]WILL[/b] get used to the controls (if you stick with it). But why deal with the frustration?", "timestamp_created": 1637307438, "timestamp_updated": 1637307438, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427262604236602783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103001177": {"recommendationid": "103001177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046695924", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5145, "last_played": 1637258475}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games of all time!!!", "timestamp_created": 1637258379, "timestamp_updated": 1637258379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607548892498016357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102599772": {"recommendationid": "102599772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305087763", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1675677808}, "language": "english", "review": "I have loved this game for 2 decades and would recommend anyone to play this", "timestamp_created": 1636650778, "timestamp_updated": 1636650778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102243528": {"recommendationid": "102243528", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071737700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1696993479}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego super adictivo, de los primeros que jugu\u00e9 en el PS1 y por los cuales amo los videojuegos.

It is known for its distinctive blend of dark humor, inventive gameplay mechanics, and thought-provoking social commentary. Here's a review of the Oddworld series as a whole, focusing on its most prominent titles:\n\n**Title: Oddworld - A Darkly Humorous and Thought-Provoking Video Game Series**\n\n**Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Unique and Engaging World:** The Oddworld series takes place in a bizarre and darkly comedic universe filled with strange creatures, twisted corporations, and dystopian themes. This unique setting sets the games apart from traditional video game worlds and creates a memorable atmosphere.\n\n2. **Social Commentary:** One of the standout features of Oddworld is its willingness to tackle serious social and environmental issues within its narrative. Themes such as corporate greed, exploitation, and environmental destruction are woven into the storylines, offering players food for thought beyond the gameplay itself.\n\n3. **Inventive Gameplay Mechanics:** The series is known for introducing innovative gameplay mechanics in each installment. Games like \"Abe's Oddysee\" and \"Abe's Exoddus\" focus on puzzle-solving and platforming, while \"Stranger's Wrath\" incorporates a unique combination of first-person shooting and bounty hunting. These diverse mechanics keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.\n\n4. **Dark Humor:** Oddworld games are known for their dark and satirical humor. The witty writing and amusing character interactions provide moments of levity within the otherwise grim and challenging environments. The humor is an integral part of the series' identity.\n\n5. **Character Design:** The character design in Oddworld is both visually striking and memorable. Characters like Abe, Munch, and Stranger have unique appearances and personalities that contribute to the series' charm.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. **Difficulty:** Some of the Oddworld games are known for their high level of difficulty, especially when it comes to puzzles and platforming sections. While this can be rewarding for players seeking a challenge, it may frustrate those looking for a more casual gaming experience.\n\n2. **Irregular Release Schedule:** The Oddworld series has seen a somewhat irregular release schedule, with long gaps between major titles. This has left fans waiting for new entries in the series.\n\n3. **Limited Appeal:** The dark and quirky nature of Oddworld may not be to everyone's taste. Some players might find the games' themes and humor off-putting or too unconventional.\n\nIn summary, the Oddworld series is a unique and thought-provoking franchise that has carved out its own niche in the world of video games. Its distinctive blend of dark humor, inventive gameplay mechanics, and social commentary sets it apart from other titles in the industry. While some games in the series can be challenging, they offer a rewarding and memorable experience for players who appreciate its unconventional approach. If you're looking for something different in the world of gaming, the Oddworld series is worth exploring for its creativity and willingness to tackle complex themes.", "timestamp_created": 1632944014, "timestamp_updated": 1696599795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100079333": {"recommendationid": "100079333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315313298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1505941237}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Clasicazo que mola rejugar nuevamente", "timestamp_created": 1632820090, "timestamp_updated": 1632820090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99759843": {"recommendationid": "99759843", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171315089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1687535726}, "language": "english", "review": "My all time favourite childhood game by far, excellent storytelling of your average slave worker up against impossible odds to save his race from being made into food products, the art and unique way how the background and foreground of the games are both interactive, such as taking one door from the foreground and ending up in the background.\n\nGame is best played on a controller for sure, keyboard is fine if you're used to the controls of similar titles, but not impossible to get good with.

Let's say you do a difficult secret room to save mudokans(or whatever they are) and you die 2 rooms later, it still resets ALL of the progress even if you save and even if you reached a checkpoint, but didn't complete the objective of the room.

I recommend the game for those who don't care about getting 100% completion, but not for anyone who tries to save everyone and get 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1630846755, "timestamp_updated": 1630846755, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.424590885639190674", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98633744": {"recommendationid": "98633744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452510586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1631134614}, "language": "english", "review": "OLD SCHOOL BUT FUN", "timestamp_created": 1630530795, "timestamp_updated": 1630530795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98589770": {"recommendationid": "98589770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833097898", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1630454700}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegardo", "timestamp_created": 1630456046, "timestamp_updated": 1630456046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98338251": {"recommendationid": "98338251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072162886", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1630089709}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es como que te de en los huevos pero en plan todo el rato, y la vecina mirando.", "timestamp_created": 1630089747, "timestamp_updated": 1630089747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98114375": {"recommendationid": "98114375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082838796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1658493943}, "language": "english", "review": "BUY THIS FUCKING GAME", "timestamp_created": 1629753024, "timestamp_updated": 1644766087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97682674": {"recommendationid": "97682674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027005470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1420681022}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a cult classic of the puzzle-platform games.

Puzzles never repeat, often with multiple solutions, allowing for some creativity in the approach. Most secret areas are signaled by a clever use of sound that i didn't notice when i played on the psx. Some areas can be tough to solve, because of the saving system, that allows to save only at \"checkpoints\", but i think this also adds beauty to the game.\n\nPC considerations:\nThe game can be played on PC even without additional software. I got good results by tweaking settings in the graphic card's control panel. Similar results to r.e.l.i.v.e, but without crashes (i gave up on r.e.l.i.v.e. because of this, the game is already challenging enough without adding crashes in random places).

If you remember it and want to play it again, there are mods to make it work, otherwise just avoid it.\n\nAs a side note, there is another version of this game. Its a complete rebuild called \"Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty.\" I've never played it but it is pretty highly reviewed. It maybe worth checking out. \n", "timestamp_created": 1624773478, "timestamp_updated": 1624773478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490255773067474365", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94279091": {"recommendationid": "94279091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018955051", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 334, "last_played": 1625613637}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that became History.

I couldn't find any solution to my problem, so I tried reloading the game to my save at the start of Zulag 3, but this port has a bug where saves don't record your progress correctly, so it booted me back to when Abe first returns to Rupture Farms instead.

In addition to what I wrote above, this port has a lot of other issues to it as well, and you'd be much better off buying the original PS1 release somewhere. The controls can be a bit unresponsive sometimes, which can get you killed when you're in a bind, and even worse is that your button inputs can get confused for other keys. I can't count how many times I've pressed 1 to say \"hello\" only for Abe to crouch down as if I pressed X. There's also no real gamepad support, which didn't bother me a whole lot since I was able to adjust to the keyboard controls, but I know that can be a real detriment to some players' experiences.

The remake is good, but like many others have already mentioned, I mourn the atmosphere it no longer has. Seems to be the same problem with many retro remakes I've seen. They seem to be making everything as colourful, comical and cartoony as they possibly can, which is a shame.\n\nFinal note: this game is hard. I've beaten it countless times, found all secrets and saved all mudokons. I used to be a goddamn guru when it comes to Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus. And yet it was a complete massacre when I found this on Steam sale and decided to grab it, and tried to play it on PC. Jesus Christ. The PSX controls have been so ingrained into my muscle memory that it's just hopeless to try and proceed with keyboard. Have to try again with a controller, lol.\n\n// Edit after a couple of hours of playing: Ok there seems to be some bugs? Returned with a controller, everything seemed to work fine at first. Played for an hour or so, saved the game at checkpoint and quit. Next time I started playing, it didn't continue from the last checkpoint, but the one before that. One enemy had died, the others were still alive. Controls weren't working. The most crucial ones (hello, follow me and wait) of course. Instead, all buttons made Abe either whistle or fart. Rebooting the game didn't work. I can't proceed.\n\nThis game is golden but devs plz fix them bugs. And peeps, if you have a chance, play this on another platform.

Seriously, buy this one instead. If you can go through its compatibility issues and remap the controls via big pic mode, you will find out that is game is superior in every way. The game's artstyle, which was criminally butchered in the Remake, is a testamet to the talent of the developers. Set in a dark and opressive alien world, Abe is a slave worker that has to escape the meat factory, survive against deadly aliens and save his fellow slave Mudokons along the way.\n\nControlling Abe feels realistic. He needs momentum to jump, and almost every failed stunt will result in his death. The only problem I had is some times the controls can be unresponsive. It rarely happens though, so its not a big issue. Other than his athleticism, Abe can possess certain kind of enemies, or distract others with his chant. Abe has voice commands that allow him to give orders to other Mudokons and solve voice puzzles. You must to be careful when giving commands though or the Mudokons you control might die. You need at least 50 Mudokons saved in order to unlock the good ending.

On the one hand, it absolutely oozes charm and character, and has an genuine atmosphere that most triple-A games these days would kill to have. On the other hand, this is a 20+ year-old game, and it definitely feels like it. However, all that isn't necessarily a good or bad thing, but a mix of both. Here's the good and the bad as I felt it:\n\nThe Good:\n\n-The game has a great story. Simple, but you instantly feel a connection with the hapless and helpless Abe. Multiple endings also add a layer of challenge and re-playblility.\n\n-The game is challenging, well-built, and requires a lot of experimentation to solve the puzzles. It's not a puzzle game per se, but it's more puzzle game than a side-scroller. There are parts of the game completed just by your cunning and wit, while other sections will require quick reflexes and laser-sharp button presses.\n\n-The artwork and visuals are just fantastic. Sure, this game came out in '97, and it sure looks like it, yet it holds a certain charm for anyone who grew up playing games in this era. It evens looks cool to new-comers unfamiliar with such a style.\n\nNow, The Bad:\n\n-This game is HARD. That alone wouldn't be enough to warrant a mark, but there aren't an ample amount of modern guides for this game, and trust me, you aren't getting through this 100% without a guide, at least not in a reasonable amount of time. If you do look for a guide, get used to using a website built in 1998 that's just green text on a black background. There are also secrets you will probably miss, and that can be frustrating if you're trying to beat it without a guide holding your hand. Just know that subsequent play-throughs will be significantly less frustrating, if not really any easier.\n\n-The game suffers from being built in the 90s, without the modern things like quicksave or snappier controls. The game may crash on you, causing hours of loss of progress. Audio glitches are also common, though they're only mostly distracting rather than \"game-breaking.\" The game will feel a certain way because it was limited by the technology that existed at the time.\n\n-Lastly, the game is not the easiest to learn. Pay close attention to the tutorials or look up a guide, or start the game completely over mid-way through. Most of the games core mechanics are explained in the first couple of hours, so restarting after that could make the whole experience replayed so much better.\n\nIn conclusion, I definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging, nostalgia-inducing puzzle/side-scroller hybrid that contains a lot of personality and charm, which also has several sequels and an PS5/PC sequel on the way.

I can now say that this is a fantastic game that is rich in atmosphere and charm.\n\n The gameplay relies on precision, and it is a joy to obtain the skills necessary to beat this game. The whole goal of the game is to save as many of your fellow mudokkens (that's the name for Abe's race, who are being kept in Rupture Farms as slave workers) as you can, and ultimately take out the head honcho who runs Rupture Farms. The mechanic that allows you to communicate with other characters (which you will be using a lot) is fun to use and varies depending on whether you're talking as a Mudokken or as a Slig. What's a Slig, you ask? They are one of the main enemies that you will be facing, and this game features a really cool mechanic where you can possess them and control them. It's always a great moment when you get to take control of a Slig and mow down their own kind using a machine gun. That was kind of a fucked up sentence but I'm leaving it in.\n\n If you're into the whole cinematic platformer, prince of persia-esque, kind of thing, this is the game for you. There are some very difficult parts, and at times the save locations can be annoying as failure means you might be sent back a good amount. Regardless, the game is really cool and really fun, and I think it holds up great today.

Nostalgia can play a big part in the decision to purchase a game.  Twenty year old memories of simpler days may offer comfort, and familiarity is welcome in irritable and uncertain times.  Memories of sitting in front of my Sony PlayStation, over twenty years ago, and experiencing this game for the first time are half of the reason that I purchased Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on Steam.  The other half of that reason, is the high regard in which others still hold this game.  Technological advancements aside, as a game standing on its own merits... this one does not hold up.  Playing Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was an annoying chore.  The controls / character's responsiveness are unbelievably bad.  This is my main gripe with this game.  Joining that problem, is the bad design choices that are littered throughout the experience.  In the days of yore, games were intentionally made more difficult to ensure that people who rented the game wouldn't beat it the first time that they rented it.  Undoubtedly this decision has tainted many games and damned them to being less than they otherwise would be.  It is almost certainly the case here.\n\nMore:\n\nI cannot recall being as frustrated as I was playing Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, during any other play-through of any other game.  There is almost no comparison.  The suppressed rage is far beyond what I could have imagined when I made this purchase.  This is not a difficult game, it is a stupid one.  If I had a nickel for every-time that Abe ran off of the edge of a cliff, after I heard my keyboard's space key 'click' while his feet were still on the ground... I might have a lot of nickels.  I cannot confirm that I always pressed it while the character was still grounded, but I am almost certain that I did the vast majority of the time.  If I did not... then I would need some sort of explanation for my performance in every-other modern platformer that I have played in contrast to this one... and I'm not even that good at platformers.  The difference in performance is that bad.  Fluid animation seems to have been prioritized over Abe's responsiveness to button presses.  I've noticed that several actions in the game do not register unless an animation that is in progress has finished.  It is much more likely (at least to me) that this is the cause of the lack of control... rather than my sudden and suspiciously specific late button-presses.\n\nAnother gripe of mine is in the level / puzzle design.  How irritating is it?  Very irritating.  No... it's just stupid.  Think about Mario Bros.  Why does Mario Bros. not have a pit at the end of the level?  Why is there no death pit that Mario can fall into if he jumps over the flag?  It's not there because that would be a choice only a fool would make.  Even a child would have  enough intuition to know better.  Sadly, I cannot say the same for the designers of this game.  Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee should be the focal point of study in a class on how not to design a game.  I hate this game and everything that it stands for.  Oh, and by the way, if you don't save enough of your ugly blue mud-donkey brethren by the end of the game, then you get the bad ending and are expected to try again.  I say 'nay-nay'.  And I don't care about not spoiling the game in this review.\n\nThey say where there's smoke, there's fire.  If Oddworld Inhabitant's (the developers of this trash's) resume of games is anything to go by, then there's a roaring blaze at their headquarters (if it still exists).  It looks like this one IP has been carrying that studio since it's inception, and I think I know why.  It would appear they got lucky with the success of the Sony PlayStation, and managed to craft an inexplicably loved protagonist that they have ironically enslaved to their mediocre development team.  But... who knows really.  It does appear that way, though.  I would have to play more of their games to know the truth.  That will not happen.  I bought this game, and Oddworld: Abe's Exodus at the same time.  I have uninstalled them both, and deleted the associated videos from my YouTube channel.  I have willingly flushed a few bucks, and roughly 24 hours of my time playing the game and editing the videos down the drain.  I refuse to further acknowledge, or promote this game in any way.

For instance, when the enemy see you, you have to immediately hide, run toward another zone, or climb the higher platform. One second late and the enemy will shoot you to death. After that, you have to start over from the latest checkpoint.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game is not bad, especially for a classic game. The main problem of this game is its loading time. The loading time took forever and very clunky.  As the result, dying in this game becomes very punishing, not because you have to repeat, but because the wait time until revival took so long. \n\nAnother problem of this game is its control that is not smooth. It takes time to decelerate so if you're one second late to stop your running, you might crash into a shocker or a grinder then die. Of course you can always start over, but one slow motion revival process awaits you before that.\n\nIf the revival process is instant, i would have give positive review.

It is a marvelously difficult yet rewarding platformer, showcasing the explorations of several different worlds. The soundtrack is great and ambient, and the ability to speak to other Mudokons is quite cool too. Your objective is to save as many of your hapless friends as possible, but most of the time that is easier said than done. \n\nConsidering how cheap this game is (and that at one point it was given out free in a giveaway) this game from my childhood is still definitely worth a play today, if you want to play a difficult old platformer, or see the same problems from this 1997 video game still alive and unfortunately well in our own world today.

If you think the controls aren't to your liking, you can try to buy the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/314660/Oddworld_New_n_Tasty/]remake[/url] instead.[/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt might be obvious for a game that was released in 1997, but the graphic looks pixelated for a 3D game, possibly because of its low resolution. It might take some time to get used to it and I don't see any problem after that.\n\nThe main menu is simple and unique; you can see the main character popping out from the middle and respond to whatever option that you choose. I especially like it when he said \"Hello\" after the menu loaded.\n\nThe environment, on the other hand, looks spooky and mysterious. It works well with the fact that the main character is an alien and you're running away from the place you were in.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is being told by Abe, the character that you control, by voice. The voice is crystal clear although my poor listening skills can't seem to comprehend some of the words that he said. It might also because of the horrible cutscenes though.\n\nBy all means, the cutscenes aren't that bad. I watched some videos and I find it to be okay. However, the cutscenes don't run smoothly in my screen somehow; they are missing a lot of frames that each frame looks way different from the last and I had to imagine the missing frames in my head, not to mention that the transition between frames are triggered by some static-like thing that you can see in old TVs. All in all, it wasn't a pleasant experience to watch.\n\n[h1]The game[/h1]\n[b]Exploration[/b]\nThe game has 7 main areas that you can explore in order. You have to go past the enemies and dodge any obstacles to make sure you don't die. Since you're pretty weak in the first part of the game, stealth becomes the main part of the game. The obstacles will also become harder as you progress that you may need to try several times, often by trial and error, just to get through it.\n\nThere are also some checkpoints after you solve several areas. These are indicated by a green square-like thing above your head. \n\nI enjoyed the game more after the mid-game because it's starting to divide the area into smaller parts. There will be a map placed in the \"hub\" area that will show the map layout in a Metroidvania style and you can enter each smaller area in any order that you want. These smaller areas are usually connected; you have to formulate your strategy based on all of the available rooms to reach the goal.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nOne thing that I know from a good puzzle design is to make a puzzle that isn't too easy and not too hard that the player will give up after one try. This game does this perfectly. There are a lot of diverse actions that you can take to reach the goal and you can always try the other \"routes\" if one doesn't work.\n\n[b]Ability[/b]\nAlthough you can control a particular enemy when you meet the right condition from the early game, it won't be introduced until you reach the third area. It will make it harder to 100% the game on your first try if you don't know about this ability because of this.\n\nAnother ability will also be introduced later in the game. You also can pick up bombs and meats and throw them to the enemies to kill or lure them.\n\n[b]Controls[/b]\nI didn't enjoy the game at first because of the controls. Although the game is in 3D, strangely, it uses a tile-based system like what an RPG Maker game does, except that you can't tell whether the very edge of a platform is walkable or not. I can't count how many times I fell to my death because I thought I can stand on the edge platform.\n\nThe character also walks too slow that I tend to press the buttons too fast. There was a time where I need to dash, jump, and grab a platform where I suddenly decide to cancel all that and go to the other way instead of jumping. The thing is, the game remembers most of the control that you pressed - you won't move right if you press right when you're still on \"dashing to the left\" animation; you'll have to wait until you finish jumping and grabbing a platform to do that.\n\nThere is also a control that the game explains wrong in the tutorial. The tutorial said that you need to press shift and alt to chant although you need to press 0 to do that.\n\nThe game also requires you to do a technique that wasn't taught in the tutorial; you can change from dashing to rolling quickly by pressing x while dashing. There is no way to know that the technique exists if you don't know it beforehand and it's mandatory to do that in some part of the game. I even thought that the game was impossible to beat at some point because I didn't know that combination.\n\n[b]Mudokons[/b]\nThere are 99 mudokons, your alien race, in the game. You can choose to either kill them or save them. Saving them all will net you a bonus after you finish the game and you need to save at least 50 to get a good ending. I only saved ~40 of them and I got a bad ending instead.\n\n[b]Secret areas[/b]\nThere are a lot of secret areas in the game. These secret areas usually lead to more enemies and mudokons that you can save. They are hard to find though and I only encountered a few of them throughout the game.\n\n[b]Saving[/b]\nYou can only save on certain checkpoints and you can only do it once per \"save point\". Sure, you can save multiple times, but it will only record the first time you reached that area. I even thought that the game autosaved because of that and had to redo some areas because I didn't save at some point.\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nActually, the game isn't that difficult. However, the controls and save mechanics increase the difficulty. If you're up for more challenges, you also can increase the difficulty by trying to save all mudokons.\n\n[b]Replayability[/b]\nYou actually can 100% the game in your first playthrough. However, you might have to learn some controls that are taught later in the game somewhere else to do that.\n\nYou can replay the game to try to save all mudokons in the game and obtain a bonus ending. If you got a bad ending in your first playthrough like me, the game will automatically spawn you to the last area of the game so you can try to aim for a good ending. I'm not in the mood to get that though so I finished playing after that.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's a great puzzle game with a bit of stealth element.

Game itself is both puzzle and action platformer. First you solve how to overcome the obstacle you facing (puzzle part) which is moderately difficult, but executing it is much harder. While moving, each step you  take can be critical to your success, and one little extra or less step might ruin it, that also includes jumping and crouching. It takes quite a lot of precision to execute your actions. \n\nThat being said, something really annoyed me with the game. At a certain part of the game, you come across a broken well, and in order to magically repair it, you have to kill three enemies, which makes absolutely no sense even in context of extremely odd nature of the game and overall gameplay. I don't mind looking at walkthroughs, and when reading them, I have always felt like - I could solve this if I wanted to. But this one didn't make sense at all. Along with all the different pathways and stuff I thought the game is perhaps best for those who like old school hardcore mystery puzzle games that doesn't hold your hand at all.

I had a part of the first level on a demo disk that came with my PS1 back in 1998, and even though the game did catch my attention with its setting, visual style and, above everything, its giggling and farting protagonist, I found the gameplay a bit too cumbersome and didn't get the full version (and I was too busy playing NFS3, Silent Hill and Resident Evil anyway).\nA decade later I remembered it, started playing it on the PC and realized that what I had once found a bit too cumbersome of a gameplay was exactly what made the game so unique, immersive and captivating. However much I enjoyed it, I obviously lacked the dexterity required to cope with its notorious checkpoint system, so little by little my patience was wearing thin, and the Paramonian Temple became the final straw.\nYet another decade later, I started it all over again, this time on a PS1 emulator and with two buttons on the gamepad dedicated to saving and loading states. Finally, I was able to enjoy it thoroughly. Looking back, I would never have been able to complete the game any other way \u2014 some segments, like the final chase in the Scrabanian Temple, would've been just way too much for me; rescuing all the Mudokons would've been just as impossible. Also, the controls seem more accurate and responsive in the PS1 version. So, take my advice: if you're clumsy like me and the checkpoint system is starting to get on your nerves, just forget it and go the emulator way \u2014 being able to enjoy a great game at your own pace is worth much more than the higher resolution of the PC version.", "timestamp_created": 1584571353, "timestamp_updated": 1584571434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65279084": {"recommendationid": "65279084", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971215436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 261, "last_played": 1622745097}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1584551044, "timestamp_updated": 1584551044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65227775": {"recommendationid": "65227775", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994109369", "num_games_owned": 847, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1603813439}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1584475867, "timestamp_updated": 1584475867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547920405864715576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64925364": {"recommendationid": "64925364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095203339", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1678226656}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Oddworld.

The visuals are intriguing and even really good for the time, the puzzles are well built and require a lot of thought, the soundtrack is great, and the game has a lot of replay value in rescuing all 99 Mudokons and finding where they are at. And though many people love this game it is definitely not for me and I see a lot of problems with it in fact. First of all, neither platformers nor puzzle games are really my thing. I love strategy games and some puzzle games, and there are plenty of other games done in a 2D style I enjoy, but this game has some really annoying flaws (mostly due to it's age). \n\nThe biggest issue I have is the controls. I noticed this in the main menu, first off the controls are just a little wacky, but when I tried to rebind the crouch key to make it more comfortable for me it would not let me. No big deal though I would make it work. When I got into game though I ran into a far bigger issue the controls felt both unresponsive at times and slick at others. This causes several problems, first being that this game causes you to think on your toes a lot and when things respond poorly you die... a lot... The next issue is that even when you can respond properly at times (specifically with the run) you will slide slightly, which got me killed more that a couple times. Now this alone does not ruin a game, but the bigger problem is that this leads to A LOT of deaths and this game is not kind to those who die. Now I don't mind punishment I am a huge fan of the Dark Souls series and I am used to taking a beating especially when I have made a mistake, but this game has a horrible respawn mechanic. It does give you unlimited lives, but whenever you respawn it tends to put you fairly far back and will not remember and people you have saved making this game extremely repetitive at times. The game is even more repetitive because most of the puzzles and platforming have a singular correct way to solve them, which makes the game far too linear for me to enjoy. Also this is common among old games and is not a huge deal, but I had to modify the game to make it work as well, which is annoying, but was an easy fix. I really don't enjoy Abe's voice either.\n\nHonestly I would like to give this a mixed review. It is fairly dated, controls really poorly at times,  is overly repetitive, and was just not my kind of game.

I never played any Oddworld game before despite all evidence pointing I was missing out on something. There are so many games! and they are all praised! then I saw a sale of the whole collection and bought all of them. Without knowing how I would like any of them. You know, like an idiot would.\n\nSo I played for less than 2 hours and my opinion is likely not going to change: it's someone's magnum opus, for sure. The amount of detail and love is obvious at every corner. Probably the most deep and complex grid platformer (cinematic platformer) out there. You need to rescue others, and you do so by giving commands to follow and wait, you need to avoid enemies by creeping or setting up traps. There are grenades you can throw. You can possess enemies and have them kill each other or pull switches for you. There really is a lot going on here. \n\nWhere the game falls flat is repetition. In the 90s we didn't have as many games to choose from as now, so games could afford to be... how can I put this? disrespectful with your time? Like [i]\"aww are you losing your patience? Maybe you want to play something else instead? what's that? you get 3 games to play a year? oh jeez whiz what a shame! Better respawn now then\"[/i] At one point I spent 20 minutes playing the same section until I did all I wanted to do there. Rescued all dudes. Only to find out there was no checkpoint afterwards and I lost that progress, and the save function doesn't work like you would think it does. The puzzle part was fun to solve, the rest was just trial and error. A ludicrous amount of trial and error mixed with the worst possible gameplay element: puzzles. Puzzle and trial and error are not a harmonious match.\n\nI can't say this is a bad game. But I don't want to put more time into it either so, for practical purposes, it's the same as a bad game. Unless you played this back in the day and want to relive your memories, I recommend passing on Oddworld. \n\nA lot of people also complaint about bugs and crashes.

While Abe may be totally lacking in combat ability or any substantial physical prowess whatsoever, he does possess a great capacity to instruct his freed brethren to work together cohesively, with an extensive array of commands able to be issued to friendly characters at any time during gameplay.\n\nAbe\u2019s Oddysee pulls no punches in delivering a gameplay experience that while not obtuse, is still mercilessly challenging - especially if one aims to achieve the \u2018good\u2019 ending where a majority of Abe\u2019s followers live to see freedom, or heaven forbid, a perfect ending with no casualties whatsoever. Nevertheless, such difficulty only means you will be able to drink in all of Oddworld\u2019s delicious charm and fantastically detailed art design and credible megacorp-run world design.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a great classic platformer that runs on the world slow and contemplative side of things, this is it. If you\u2019re seeking a bit of late-Nineties nostalgia ported over to Steam with the usual bells and whistles of Trading Cards, Badges, and a great deal of community support, you\u2019ve found it.

What is not understandable is it doesn't have Steam overlay, which limits the access of Steam's social and browsing features, and disables taking screenshots. Not that there is anything good-looking to be captured, considering how bad this game looks, but despite its ancient graphics I have noticed how realistic the movement of the main character alien is. In the past developers didn't have 3D graphics, nor nearly as good program development tools and hardware as some developers have them nowadays, but they found ways to mimic realism by recording motion of the real actors. Unfortunately, not many do that nowadays, as most developers settle with making good-looking graphics, but that does not necessarily increase the immersion, if the physics are not mimicking reality.\n\nOddworld - Abe's Oddysee is dated, 2D Adventure game, with weird, outlandish art style, where the character moves in two directions, must jump over obstacles and traps, climb the obstacles, sneak, hide and avoid the detection of the enemies, while moving through the factory, which used to be the working place of the main character, before he found out what was going on with his management.\n\nThe game is too old for anyone to care, let alone to recommend it to someone, but people who played it back in the days know all they need to know about it, as they go on their nostalgia trip. Some things should stay in the past. It sends crash message every time I exit the game.

He's views of he's employer and company change one night as he was waxing the floor with a floor cleaning machine he eventually stumbles across a meeting that was probably not meant for he's eyes to see. You see profits had been drying up for Rupterfarms and they weren't bringing in as much wildlife to turn into food as they were once able to do.  Abe discovers during the same meeting that he's company of employment plans to turn their factory slaves into food. Abe panics and makes a run for it and attempts to save as many Mudokons as he can along the way. \n\nIt's the players choice whether he / she wants to save Mudokons or not. Failure to save a majority of them will result in of course a bad ending, saving most / all of them will result in a good ending. \n\nThis game has ran perfectly fine on my modern day gaming computer.

It starts off well. I like the characters and world. It looks good, if a little dated. It started of with a nice slow paced puzzle platformer where you can take your time to think about how to progress and feel satisfied when you succeed.\n\nAs I got a little further it started to annoy me. The game gives you tutorial messages in the background but doesn\u2019t tell you everything you need when you need it. For example it tells you about rescuing other Mudokons after you have already missed a bunch of them. I then got stuck at a particular section so I saved and took a break only to find it did not load at the checkpoint where I was when I saved it. I ended up having to replay an extra chunk of the game. Not only that but it did not save my custom key bindings and had even left one of the actions unbound.\n\nA bit further into the game I got stuck again and turned to a walkthrough where I found I had missed numerous hidden sections of the game which looked devilishly hard. The walkthrough also revealed I was not not missing anything with the bit I was stuck on it was just my timing was off. I spent a good chunk of time trying and failing to get this section right and I gave up at this point as I was no longer having any fun. Contributing to this was also the thought that even if I got past that section there was no guarantee that if I saved it would not restart me before this horrible section again.\n\nI know this review is going to get down voted into oblivion because these masochistically difficult games are unfathomably popular and also this game is sufficiently old that nostalgic people will see this as a personal attack on their childhood.

Animations, visuals and sound are really all working together to create a unique experience. The first time you walk out of the Rupture Farms into the free fire zone is one of the most memorable moments in games that I've played, and that wasn't even that long of a section. The rest comes together beatifully, even if it might not stand out as much for me.\nSimilar feeling was evoked in Necrum part of Abe's Exoddus for me, I love listening to both tracks of these locations, even though it's just very minimal ambient.\n\nThe gameplay aspect is pretty good, if not for controls that sometimes feel wonky, sometimes sporadic checkpoints (mostly missing in any hidden areas), and weird level design decisions at points that cause a lot of pointless down time (countless slogs coming out of the vaults that get less exciting each time you have to shoot through all of them again upon death) - the platforming, throwing, shooting and sneaking feels very satisfying when it's done consistently. The animation and sound also compliment those gameplay elements, you can easily react on distinctive sound cues, and grounded animations with believable movement make handling the character more intuitive.\n\nThe sidescrolling of levels also is well done, while the parts are interconnected, what can interact between them is limited. The limits are pretty easy to figure out (most chasing enemies, thrown items, but not bullets and detectable sounds), and don't feel like an unfair playing field.\n\nThe dark humor in the game was enjoyable, though the slapstick elements weren't really in my taste (even back in elementary school).\nThere is also social commentary on corporatism and consumerism, which while heavy handed - works quite well with the dystopian setting it wanted to achieve.\n\nI'm happy that they tried to remake the game with some improvements in New n Tasty, though certain elements that I praised here were altered for a bit worse - animations feel oddly sped up, there is bloom everywhere, which detracts from the original's gloomy and grounded visuals, and the sidescrolling is now altered to constant camera movement, rather than transitions.\n\nI can recommend the original definitely, when it comes to the unique experience, it still offers the most, despite the technical flaws. One last point is that it crashes when you exit (not alt-tab) it on W7, which affects nothing really, but is something that will not be patched anytime soon.", "timestamp_created": 1548472908, "timestamp_updated": 1548473720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505116760730743408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48526893": {"recommendationid": "48526893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339707517", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1549828389}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Todo un clasico, me acuerdo con la ps1 que me venia la demo y flip\u00e9 jajaja", "timestamp_created": 1548352510, "timestamp_updated": 1548352510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48391072": {"recommendationid": "48391072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006417806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1512131772}, "language": "english", "review": "yeah", "timestamp_created": 1547763913, "timestamp_updated": 1547763913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48337684": {"recommendationid": "48337684", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989236581", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1547509220}, "language": "english", "review": "If you played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee as a kid, then chances are that its a game that is so engraved in your mind that years in the future you still find yourself vividly remembering the weird foreign sounds made by the enemies, the alien oppresive industrial setting and beautiful dark pre-rendered backgrounds, the way Abe moves around and talks, or how relentlessly punishing and distressing it can be.\nI never managed to beat the game as a kid. In fact, i dont think I ever even got around to getting out of the first area, Rupture Farms. But Oddworld: Abe's Odysee was always one of those games I always held in high esteem and put alongside my favourites of all time. I think some of you have that sort of game as well, a game you never managed to finish but you still consider a favourite. \nBut the memories always stuck with me, it left a mark that Im certain influenced my taste in videogames to come. So after all these years, I decided to finally get some closure and fullfill this love by actually finishing the game.\nStarting the game, its easy to see why this game manages to leave such an impression on the people who play it. After all these years, it still retains some of the best worldbuilding, art design, background art and characterization I have ever seen in a videogame. In a few short minutes, everything you need to know bout this world, story and characters is introduced and soon enough you are thrown into the thick of it without handholding.\nAs a slave fugitive, your quest is to escape the dystopian farm that has enslaved you before they turn you into one of their own products for consumption. You control an unlikely hero, Abe, who doesnt possess any offensive actions whatsoever, besides the ability to possess certain enemies.\nThis being a cinematic platformer (in the vein of games like Another World and Flashback), most of the challenge of the game is in assessing the situations that present themselves on each screen and maneuvering Abe's realistic animations in an attempt to reach the next alive. It's not so much a game about knowing how to jump on platforms, but about solving puzzles by jumping on platforms. There are definitely some cases of trial and error, but for the trained eye and observant player, there are always signs on the screen of how things will play out and if you are smart enough to catch them you can always get a small chance to escape death.\n And make no mistake, you will die. Alot. One of the greatest aspects of the game is in how it makes you feel each death. The goofy Abe face that greets you on the title screen might trick you into thinking this a kiddy game, but the violence is as realistic as it gets. The game is riddled with beasts that will hunt you down, patrolling guards that will pulverize you with rifles, mines that will blow you up on contact, bombs that will explode if you pass by the security laser, etc. Every single death in this game drives the thematic oppression home, and it really turns the game into a very unique and uncomfortable experience.\nWhich makes the small victories all that more rewarding. Figuring out a solution to a challenging section and managing to surpass it while a ravaging beast chases you down and you escape in the nick of time is frankly an experience that not many games are able to achieve, not even the ones who have to rely on scripted events. And Abe's Odysee is filled with these experiences.\nBesides the obvious dystopian subject matter, Abe's Odyssee also deals with themes of nature preservation and ecosystem  balance. Playing this now, I got the chance to leave Rupture Farms and explore the alien wildlife of Oddworld, and here the game really manages to contrast the beauty of nature versus the depravity of the factory, all without much exposition or beating you over the head. Even outside the factory, the world is still dangerous and vicious, but the presentation of the backgrounds and ambient soundtrack bring out this sense of peace and equilibrium that is sorely missing in Rupture Farms, the place you know you will have to go back to again to save your fellow Mundokon friends.\nI can safely say that Oddworld: Abe's Odysee definitely stands the test of time. Its a beautiful game that offers a fair and memorable challenge with the perfect duration. I am now reassured of my adoration for this game and it gets my Certified Classic seal of approval.

Simply pasting the 2 files into the game's folder gets it to work.\n\nOverview\nAbe is a slave who finds out that he, and the others are to be processed into food. The player is to rescue Abe and as many slaves along the way.\n\nGameplay\nThe controls are simple. Players can walk, run, stealth, and jump as well as interact with slaves using voice prompts. Almost all the interactions are very clunky, which would be okay, if the game did not require a good amount of precision particularly in getting other slaves to move where you want so you can save them. Sometimes you have to ask them to follow you 3 times in a row so they line up close enough to make it through an obstacle then repeat this process 2-3 times.  And then rescue another slave and repeat the process. unless they die and you have to start over again, and I mean the entire area. I spent an hour replaying one region over and over again, already knowing how to solve it, but needing to go through all the motions to get the the point that was tricky. Once i cleared that I finally progressed to a new area and promptly died. So it resets all 6-7 areas i've cleared a dozen times. That gets frustrating pretty quickly. Also 0 is used as the chant command (you can see it in the dialogue menu in the options) though the ingame prompts alt+shift don't work.\n\nThe game definitely doesn't hold your hand as there are 2 very important aspects that are given no mention. I only cleared 2 sectors before I simply lost any sense of enjoyment, so maybe the game eventually tells you about them, but I can only imagine the frustration of giving up on saving a slave only to find out later you could have easily saved them. And thus have to clear all those past regions again. In fact, one of them makes several areas incredibly easy. What a weird design option to create puzzles requiring repetition and tight timings to complete but then just have a way to negate large parts of them.\n\nPresentation\nThe game is from 1997, so it's dated, but interesting. The factory and character designs are creepy, perhaps more so with the older graphics. There are also some subtle visual cues to provide information and I didn't have any issues with the sound outside of one area that was just a mash of processing noises that were much louder then the other audio throughout the parts i played.\n\nOverall\nShort review because i didn't progress far into the game before simply finding it annoying.

Off he goes onto various platform levels to save his buddies and escape. I never got further than this because I haven't finished the game so I don't know if Abe was actually successful or not in this endeavour at the end....\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nBasically 90's graphics, so it does feel a bit dated after being spoiled with 20th century gaming graphics.....\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPuzzle platformer that requires near perfect timing. The concept would have been nice if it didn't require to time your moves....would have liked the game better too and maybe continue and finish it....\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nStereo\n\n[h1]Other notes (issues, complaints or otherwise)[/h1]\nRuns on anything XP or older......maybe VISTA and newer if you're one of those lucky bastards....but my lappy would freeze up if I ran it requiring a hard reset.....but since steam is removing XP support, I thought I may as well play through all the games I have installed on my XP machine before they stop working because the client is too new for it.... I will most likely have to deal with this again if I do come back to this and since by the time I would come back, if I do that is, steam client would only run on windows 7 or even 8 or 10 (if it takes that long to come back) and deal with it then....\n\n640x480 fullscreen really? That shit looks ugly as ferk on a 27\" display, even alt + enter doesn't switch modes.......which brings me to the next option; using [url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/]DxWnd[/url] to force the game into windowed mode or borderless window mode and various other settings too.\n\n[quote]\nRiitaoja - 2017-12-23\n\nI think I got it! The game is using an internal scaler. With the start up command \"-interline\" the game disables this scaler producing an interlaced image. This can then be corrected with the Dxwnd deinterlace filter.\n\nSo to set up the game in Dxwnd try the following:\n\nIn the Main tab configure the Path and Launch fields:\nPath: C:\\Abe's Oddysee\\AbeWin.exe\nLaunch: C:\\Abe's Oddysee\\AbeWin.exe -interline\n\nIn the DirectX tab configure the filter:\nFilter->deinterlace.[/quote]\nis if you want to fix the interlacing issue when you run the game with DxWnd hooked to it, unfortunately it doesn't work if you launch the game with steam client but that shouldn't matter as you don't have achievements to unlock anyways, unless you just wanna show off your clocked hrs played/raged on the game? Heh...\n\nI give thumbs down coz I currently dislike it....:steammocking:\n\n*sigh of relief that it's finally been dusted off my backlog*\n=====================================\nPlayed on \"The

Coming back to the game as an adult, it's clear that Oddysee was way ahead of it's time, not only in the gameplay department, but also graphically as well.  The game barely looks dated by today's standards - it is pixelated, but the hand-painted backgrounds and sprites and the consistent art style help alleviate that a lot.\n\nAs it's name suggests, Abe's Oddysee definitely stands out from your typical 2D platformer.  For one, Abe is a very slow, clumsy guy, and so his jumping and mobility is very limited compared to the likes of Mario or Sonic.  For this reason, most situations require a combination of lite platforming and solving a puzzle.  Second, Abe is defenseless (except for a very limited supply of grenades), and so must use stealth, traps, evasion, or possession to get past enemies.  Possession is an amazing mechanic that reminds me of a much newer platformer (Mario Odyssey; weird coincidence with the names there), and the game does an excellent job of limiting your use of possession and forming puzzles around it.  For some of the creatures you encounter, you also need to understand how they interact with you, each other, and the environment, which is an awesome bit of emergent gameplay that makes them feel like real animals instead of programmed enemies.  I'm pretty sure most of these ideas were completely new and unheard of in 1997.\n\nBottom line, Abe's Oddysee is one of the best and most innovative platformers from the 90s, and it still holds up beautifully today.  If you like platformers that are less about precise jumping and more about exploration and puzzle solving, you will find much to love in Oddysee and it's spin-off, Abe's Exoddus.", "timestamp_created": 1533560782, "timestamp_updated": 1533560782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43925765": {"recommendationid": "43925765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063462184", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1525518333}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es acceptable el joc.\nLa flu\u00efdesa no se si est\u00e0 be o no, perqu\u00e8 aquest joc, no mostra en cap lloc de la pantalla els fps o la flu\u00efdesa que te.\nSi alguns diuen , que els gr\u00e0fics son incre\u00efbles, pues per mi no, ja que es un joc hasta el punt de vista cl\u00e0ssic, ja que tampoc et deixa: modificar el so i ni la qualitat de imatge o els gr\u00e0fics.\nHa sigut entretingut.\n\nI no es addictiu aquest per mi joc.\n\nMe quedat bloquejat en un nivell, ja que no he pogut o no se en quin nivell me quedat.\nNo el tornar\u00e9 a jugar.\n\nValoraci\u00f3 en general: 2/10\nNo Recomenat", "timestamp_created": 1533379995, "timestamp_updated": 1533380033, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482191771268844604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43910506": {"recommendationid": "43910506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387775273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1599430251}, "language": "english", "review": "classic exsample of what games should be like", "timestamp_created": 1533306417, "timestamp_updated": 1533306417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43896178": {"recommendationid": "43896178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083949042", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 136, "last_played": 1514228417}, "language": "english", "review": "G59 till the grave", "timestamp_created": 1533233226, "timestamp_updated": 1533233226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511456072330474854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43854175": {"recommendationid": "43854175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056696501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1533287192}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know what I expected.

Juegos que definieron y casi podr\u00eda decirse que crearon g\u00e9neros , pautas que aun a d\u00eda de hoy se respetan a rajatabla .  \n \nAbbes Oddissey y su secuela , Abes Exodous fueron 2 de estos juegos. Tapados por sus hermanos mayores, la propuesta de ambos juegos propon\u00eda una historia m\u00e1s \u00edntima, m\u00e1s sesuda , cerebral y emocional que cualquiera de los juegos lanzados en aquellos a\u00f1os.  \n \nUna historia que toca palos adelantad\u00edsimos a su \u00e9poca, temas como la explotaci\u00f3n laboral, la tiran\u00eda, el medio ambienta o el racismo. En ella se nos ense\u00f1a la primera pieza de un apasionante universo que lamentablemente ha sido muy maltratado en posteriores secuelas, el mundo de Oddworld. Una dimensi\u00f3n donde una raza esclavista, los Glukons, utiliza como ganado al resto de especies que pueblan ese mundo ,una historia en la que Abe, un miembro de estas razas, los Mudokons, se rebela no solo para salvar su pueblo, sino incluso a todo el mundo del yugo opresor de estos depredadores empresariales .  \n \nPara ello deb\u00edamos movernos con un control tremendamente exigente al mas puro estilo de los cl\u00e1sicos Prince of Persia por unos escenarios 2D a la antigua usanza, repletos de enemigos y trampas, escenarios sin scroll alguno, donde deb\u00edamos guiar hacia la libertad utilizando ordenes verbales a unos compatriotas esclavizados, que dicho de paso, no es que fuesen muy avispados, terminando en la mayor\u00eda de ocasiones transformados en poco menos que pur\u00e9 de mudokon.  \n\nNuestro personaje , Abe era alguien completamente indefenso y las \u00fanicas herramientas para defendernos consist\u00edan en nuestra capacidad de sigilo y la posibilidad de poseer mentalmente a enemigos y otros seres ( con catastr\u00f3ficos resultados). \n\nLa historia, apasionante de principio a fin no se cortaba a la hora de mostrarnos las tremendas perrerias a las que los Glukons somet\u00edan al resto de seres vivimos del mundo de Oddworld: bocas cosidas, descargas el\u00e9ctricas para orde\u00f1ar l\u00e1grimas, plantas procesadoras de carne, canibalismo. Una historia que nos hac\u00eda empatizar con nuestro verde protagonista, y terminar su historia de principio a fin.  \n \nLo mejor:  \n-Un juego de 1997 que supone toda una leccion de dise\u00f1o.  \n-Historia apasionante.  \n-Jugabilidad dura y exigente, pero asequible.  \n-M\u00fasica, escenas de video, dise\u00f1o de escenarios...el mundo de Oddworld es una dimensi\u00f3n que desearemos visitar en m\u00e1s ocasiones.  \n \nLo peor:  \n-A\u00f1os a la venta en steam y a\u00f1os sin el doblaje en castellano. Has de hacerlo tu con un parche no oficial.  \n-Problemas de compatibilidad con sistemas operativos actuales.  \n-Compatibilidad con mando catastr\u00f3fica.  \n-El juego de 1997 sin m\u00e1s. \n", "timestamp_created": 1529144439, "timestamp_updated": 1529144439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577387452125549316", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42754398": {"recommendationid": "42754398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399508776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1528502186}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Le pusieron mucho esfuerzo a este juego.

It's clunky at best.\n\nI don't have any nostalgia for this title, and part of me wonders if that is the sole reason this game has positive reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1516243177, "timestamp_updated": 1516243177, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425810724496841431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39427306": {"recommendationid": "39427306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139688241", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 181, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1511051649}, "language": "english", "review": "classic.", "timestamp_created": 1516243118, "timestamp_updated": 1602767789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39402284": {"recommendationid": "39402284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000255526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1584921057}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, so I went back and decided to give this one another go for a bit, and I have to say that it shows its age. New and Tasty (something I have played but don't own on steam) definitely looks better, but that's expected. This is actually the less buggy between them (New and Tasty felt kind of messy to be honest, and I found bugs quicker in it).\nThe reason I'm coming back to review this old game is because it has pissed me off again and again and again. I literally tried to look up the history of the quicksave function, because without it, this game just sort of takes a steamy dump on your head and expects you to thank it for the pleasure of licking its smelly hole clean. It wouldn't be so bad if it remembered when you save Muds, so when you go through that bird portal for the fifth time, finally get the AI to do the thing you want it to do, and then end up messing up your timing because of the control delay (I figure this has more to do with the animation style of the game than anything else; it was a different time, after all), only to finally succeed on your sixth attempt, the game won't let you save your progress. Nope: If you die before a checkpoint, you will go back to the last checkpoint, no matter if you save manually (it saves to your last checkpoint) after finally managing to accomplish that difficult puzzle that takes perfect timing to accomplish. \nIt just... doesn't feel very satisfying. I don't get a real sense of accomplishment out of this game, just an ease to my frustration before the next difficulty spike. Mostly it's the secrets that are a pain; many sections are just there to fool you, kill you, and force you to redo something because isn't that hard? Now you have to memorize this section, and look how hard it is! Gotta be perfect on that timing, bro.\nI'm not recommending this game anymore. If you want to go back and experience Oddworld, maybe try Exoddus (the sequel) instead, because it has a quicksave function, which makes the game infinitely more enjoyable. Okay yeah, it's $3, so what? Would you pay someone to show you nice pictures while they repeatedly kick you in the groin? If your answer was a question about the kinds of pictures, you might like this game. \nIf you enjoy difficult platformers, and don't mind being told you're an asshole when you didn't drag your face across the barbwire fence repeatedly for the \"completionist\" feeling of actually saving all the Muds, Oddworld is certainly one of the better old school games to get around here on a budget.

Gameplay was fun when I started but more you play more difficult it is, so you'll need some time or just watch YouTube tutorials how to do one thing or other, but there always is text upper and It says which your keyboard buttons to use.\n\nI reccomend getting it for free and try or buy when it's really cheap.\nRECOMMENDED", "timestamp_created": 1511971234, "timestamp_updated": 1511971234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50127875804901123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37916084": {"recommendationid": "37916084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449717355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 956, "last_played": 1511981125}, "language": "english", "review": "Isomorphic with capitalism.", "timestamp_created": 1511917674, "timestamp_updated": 1511917674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37903398": {"recommendationid": "37903398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022792059", "num_games_owned": 738, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1568839032}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello!", "timestamp_created": 1511890204, "timestamp_updated": 1511890204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37895152": {"recommendationid": "37895152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331668624", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1511885280}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a real classics, puzzle platformer of all times!

I can't count the amount of times I was killed because Abe stopped one step too short to grab a ledge or needed to jump a little too soon after a screen transition. The game's controls suggest it was intended to be more of a point-and-click, where unrefined control isn't an issue. Then the level designer got a hold of it. Now its platforming requires so much precision (precision these loose controls just cannot support) that this game shows more of its age than it really should. \n\nThe visuals aren't exactly to today's standards either. More than once I missed a pathway or an obstacle due to how difficult it can be to make out your surroundings. But the superb art direction more than makes up for it. Everything's so grotesquely interesting to look at that it's worth the eye strain.\n\nSimilarly, the challenges Abe faces are worth putting in the effort to solve. Their difficulty is made up of how many moving parts each puzzle has, so by the time you understand it, you feel like you've built your own Rube Goldberg machine. It can take several deaths to even figure out a part of what you should be doing and several more to actually do it. This can lead to a lot of repetition as you perform the same sequence you've already memorized over and over again to only catch a glimpse of the next challenge. \n\nFor this reason, the most frustrating part of Abe's Oddysee \u2013 second only to the controls which certainly exacerbate the issue \u2013 is the placement of checkpoints. Sure, their spread out nature does ensure you've truly mastered the full sequence before you move on, but the road to that mastery can become so very dull, and the game drags because of it.\n\nThe lack of proper pacing surprisingly doesn't do much damage to the story being told here. On the contrary, the level of challenge only helps to emphasize how small Abe is and how enormous what he's up against is. It also provides a little narrative complexity when it comes to rescuing your fellow captive Mudokons. It's one thing to undertake an extra challenge in order to do what's right, it's another thing entirely to make that decision when you're already exhausted by the overwhelming trials behind and still in front of you. I found myself asking if these innocent Mudokons \u2013 no different than Abe/me \u2013 were worth saving, and that's not a question I ask myself often.\n\nMy experience with this game may have been mostly frustrating and unpleasant, but I'm still left wondering if I should try the 'New and Tasty' remake. I have no nostalgia for Oddworld as this was my first time through this game or any other in this series. But the world set up in Abe's Oddysee really gripped me. With tighter controls and a few more checkpoints, this might be a game I would come back to fairly regularly. But as it is, unless you're looking to relive an old experience, I can't recommend this version. It's not that it's a poor game at all, it's just that parts of it have aged so poorly that it's hard to see that sometimes.", "timestamp_created": 1508981237, "timestamp_updated": 1508981237, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516146183013916016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35996545": {"recommendationid": "35996545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286017559", "num_games_owned": 2653, "num_reviews": 416, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1507469512}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is amazing, the voice acting was top notch for it's time, and the creatures are genius.\nIt's the best platform game I've ever played and it's difficulty is may put off a more casual audience but there will never be a time when it is unfair on you, when you make a mistake and die you always think to your self \"Ok, that didn't work but now i know where I went wrong\".

Levels of endless puzzles, levers, dodging, sneaking, using your Elum/mount, using grenades/rocks, pipe shoots, jumping and CHANTING your way through. It's not easy. Chanting is the main thing in this game ( next to Game speak) because of it's many uses, and is like the Mudokon ''thing''. You play as Abe a once Mudokon slave at the Rapture Farms meat processing plant. He ''happened'' to find out that the boss Molluck the Glukkon of the Magog Cartel are going to use the Mudokon slaves as their next meat source!!!!! Oh, no, So he escapes out of the farms, the stockyard and out into the forest after having a vision from ''Big Head'' that his destiny is to rescue his people. So you have to platform crazy make your way through 2 temples, to gain the Shrykull ultimate CHANT to go back and defeat Molluck the Glukkon and free your peoples!  GREAT FICTION STORY LINE!!!! just a hard- hard game.  Other than the normal plat from ''stuff'' there is Game speak. Yes, you sometimes do have to talk to other Mudokon to gain abilities, have them follow or do things. It's an interesting gimmick. I know they revamped the game, but the original is still good and the story the same. Sometimes the game does crash or freeze though...

Menudo error.\nEl port a PC es \u00bfPesimo?, no se ni como describirlo. No recordaba que en consola la jugabilidad fuera tan sumamente HORRIBLE, que los controles fueran tan bruscos y duros.... Quizas es cosa de recordarlo mejor en consola en su tiempo pero la version de PC para mi ha sido decepcionante cuanto menos. Sin ir mas lejos actualmente desinstalo el juego en la segunda zona (Una nocturna nada mas salir de las granjas) por que simplemente una mina que debia usar a mi favor para matar a un enemigo no esta, literalmente un mal calculo de movimientos me hizo morir en la mina y acto seguido al respawnear la mina ya no estaba, cambio de zona y la mina sigue sin aparecer y no se no puede cruzar la siguiente fase sin minimo matar a uno de los enemigos guiandolo a la mina. Mina que no esta ni reaparece. \u00bfSolucion? reiniciar toda la partida de 0 y rezar por terminar la fase de la mina de primeras por que si no toca reiniciar nuevamente.\n\nComentando otros aspectos..... No he podido cambiar la resolucion y en consecuencia tengo una peque\u00f1a pantallita en el centro de mi monitor rodeada de enormes bordes negros, las animaciones se entrecortan a veces y van como a tirones (ES UN JUEGO DE PSX POR EL AMOR DE DIOS) y por alguna razon que desconozco cualquier configuracion que haga de botones se reinicia completamente al reabrir el juego.

This game also happens to be one where enemies respawn if you leave a screen then come back to it later. Be warned.\n- No windowed mode, in fact not a whole lot of game options besides sounds and controls. \n- No verticle jump or change in trajectory after you hit the jump key. The jump key which is by default bound to SPACE does a leap in the direction you are facing before initiating the jump. So at times, you want to scale a ledge and instinctively go for space but to jump up on a ledge you have to press the up arrow key. Really annoying at times because I prefer jumping up with SPACE, jumping left to SPACE + <- and right with SPACE + -> like it is with modern platformers. Also there is a slight delay in the jump and you will be confronted with a room with open pits and falling boulders very early on in the game and might need to retry it multiple times.\n- Colorblind unfriendly, one mechanic in the game are mines you can disarm but only when they blink green. Sorry, as a colorblind person, I can't tell which is which although I was right to assume green was the brighter of the two colors.\n- No lifebar, ONE HIT KILLS, you touch a dangerous item like a live mine or electric beam, you die, you touch an enemy's fired projectile, you die.

Don't mind the time here, I actually played a lot on Playstation back in the day.\n\ntl:dr This game is amazing! However it quite aged badly compared to the sequel and the remake.\n\nYou are Abe, a mudokon that is a \"worker\" (for not saying \"slave\") for the \"lovely\" place Rapture Farm. One day, while cleaning the main hallway, he overheards a meeting taked by the Glukkon, the owners of the slaughter house, in which, due to low income, they decide to make another slurpy snack made of... you! And your friend too! YUMMY!\nYou must help Abe to escape from Rapture Farm and free your friends from the Glukkon's tyranny and embark to an epic quest to discover his true destiny.\nOr you can kill all your friends and still discover your destiny. You might not enjoy the ending though...\nUsually I try to explain the gameplay in a somewhat professional way but, come on, it's Abe! One of the pillars of the Playstation era!\nBack in the day it added one of the most innovative element mechanics for the \"cinematic platform\". This is the gamespeak, a system in which Abe can speak with his mudokon fellows to convince them to follow him to the closest escape point.\nNow, I know this game is a classic and I recommend it because, come on, it's Abe! but I think that this game kind of aged badly compared to its sequels and the remake.\nI am not talking about the graphic which is still amazing but I am talking about some of the most frustrating elements from the game, case in point the checkpoints and the high difficulty.\nFirst of all, Abe's Oddysee it's hard and it is meant to be a \"trial and error\" kind of game. However the checkpoints are placed badly and you might redo a long session over and over again only for doing even the tiniest error, bringing more frustration rather that the \"ah-AH!\" moment tipical of the genre. That's why in later games they introduced the possibility to quicksave which even if some may say it lowered down the difficulty bar, it was undeniably more convenient than have to rerun a lot of screens only to do a jump better.\nHowever it should be illegal to not reccomend this game because, come on, it's Abe! and even with the fact that it is very frustrating, it's still a classic that more people need to play.\nI can't give a score this time since I know that my love of the game is mostly out of nostalgia.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505992277, "timestamp_updated": 1505992277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35100063": {"recommendationid": "35100063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410845935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1508671477}, "language": "english", "review": "why would you pay for this...

With that said, I played this beauty as a bab back on the good ol' Playstation One and, to this day, find it a difficult game, particularly if you want to get the \"good ending\" for this game. The game can be played with a keyboard, but I've always been more comfortable playing with a controller. The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that it doesn't have a quick-save system, leading to some frustration following deaths. Otherwise, here's what I love about Abe's Oddysee:\n\n+ Great atmosphere, which has been tied together with an amazing, ambient soundtrack with beautiful background pieces that were hand-drawn.\n+ Enjoyable, interesting characters and enemies, paired with some great sprite work and sprite animations.\n+ Tiled-based movement system that controls perfectly.\n+ Challenging platforming segments coupled with difficult puzzles in order to save your fellow Mudoken brethren.\n+ Great looking cutcenes with equally amusing voice acting.\n+ Command system (\"game speak\") is an interestingly quirky mechanic, as well as the possession system.\n+ Odd", "timestamp_created": 1505872900, "timestamp_updated": 1505872900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646792352199554443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35075278": {"recommendationid": "35075278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077768464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1505870442}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted to love this.

An immersive and unique atmosphere is mixed with challenging yet rewarding gameplay, based around escaping from the homicidal Glukkon capitalists running Rupture Farms and then building up your powers to get revenge on them and free your Mudokon brethren.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't disappoint: as would be expected with the game that pretty much launched the Oddworld franchise up there with the other big players at the time. Whilst there's some action elements, like when you're running away from the Slig guards and their hounds or using your psychic powers to make your enemies brutally massacre each other, it's really a puzzle game at heart. The protagonist Abe is not a fighter and must rely on his wits and indirect abilities to outsmart a small army as well as the various beasts lurking in the wilderness. You can breeze through the introductory section fairly easy using the basic interaction and stealth skills, but later on when you're doing things like navigating ancient temples you can be ages stuck in small chambers just trying to work out how to get past an obstacle without getting ripped to shreds. \n\nThe visuals hold up as well- it's insane to think that this game is coming up for twenty years old in September. The art style remains gorgeous with a lot of soul and the sprites have nice animations and character. The controls are also relatively decent- it takes a while to get the hang of aspects like sprint-jumping with precision and utilising the throwing mechanic, but once you've tried it a few hundred times you get fairly accurate with it. Something also worth noting is the soundtrack and voice acting, both of which add a lot of the atmosphere and make for fine listening.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game. The sequel, Abe's Exoddus, is essentially more of the same with a few added mechanics like being able to control Glukkons or issue more commands to your Mudokon followers- so I'd also recommend that title if you're into this one. There's also a remake of this game floating around, New N' Tasty: it has some good things going for it like HD 3D environments and more Mudokons to save, but honestly I prefer the original because it retains a certain something that the remake just doesn't seem to have.

It's a shaky port though, so new players would probably be better off checking out Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty instead (the modern remake), as It likely won't be the same without the nostalgia.\n\nGreat game. Naff port.\n\nFor the masochistic among us who spent our childhood watching Abe repeatedly get shot/eaten/crushed/fall hilariously down a massive ravine; and yet somehow still save all 99 Mudokons and want to relive that brutality again... 3 things to beware of that haven't translated well from the PlayStation version to PC:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Overall game speed is faster (maybe 20%?)... And, as any veteran will tell you, the last thing meat saws need is more oomph...\n\n    [*]Controller mapping is shaky - We've lost the L2/R2 buttons where it doesn't recognise the triggers on most controllers. It's also a sod to configure as well, unless you know which is button 1, 2, 3, 4... Not unworkable, but fiddly and takes some getting used to.\n\n    [*]The game stretches to full screen... which [i]really[/i] doesn't flatter it. I'd personally prefer the option to let it retain its native resolution and run with the black sidebars (akin to the screenshots on the store page).\n[/list]\n\nIt's a shame the port doesn't do it justice, as the game is an utterly stellar stealth-and-rescue platformer. You're stuck as a slave at the bottom of the food chain and have to escape the clutches of the Magog Cartel before you become their latest ready-meal. Outgunned, you purely have to use your wits to escape. But it gets better... You also have to save your friends too. And so ensues a frustrating Lemmings-like rescue where you have to ensure that [i]they[/i] don't get shot too... or aimlessly walk into a landmine.\n\nYou think Dark Souls is brutal? Kid... you ain't seen nothing yet...\n\nBut you get the beautiful taste of retaliation too. Play with grenades, use your enemy's own traps against them... or better still, possess them and have them wreak the carnage for you. Play it well and you might even be able to gain enough powers to blast them to ashes...\n\nIt's a wonderfully challenging platformer: Requiring as much precision and fast reflexes as it does puzzle solving. It's all about looking at the level you are in and how best to use it to your advantage. It does have a few flaws though (thankfully fixed in its successor, Abe's Exoddus): Whilst you (graciously) have infinite lives and frequent checkpoints, the lack of quick save can make some fiddly areas an absolute ball ache. You also tend to need a strategy guide to find all of the hidden areas, as there aren't any sneaky tell-tale markers you can look out for.\n\nIt's just a shame the port is so scrappy.

Extremely fun game but realise that :\n\nTHERE IS NO QUICK SAVE IN THIS GAME (the sequel, \"Abe's exodus\" does have it though). It makes areas extremely difficult as most require precise movements. Checkpoints are common, but the severe difficulty of  each area may make a 30 second segment into a 10-20 minute segment. Also, there are secret areas between checkpoints, which take you to a different level.

However, you need to hold the button as opposed to pressing the button. If you press (tap the button as you usually do), it starts and prematurely ends the animation before completion.

En otro tiempo el Oddworld era un para\u00edso donde conviv\u00edan diferentes especies en paz con la naturaleza, pero todo eso cambi\u00f3 cuando llegaron los despiadados Glukkons con su tecnolog\u00eda y su insaciable avaricia. Los Glukkons instalaron f\u00e1bricas y factor\u00edas por todas partes, contaminaron el aire y los bosques, y esclavizaron a las criaturas medianamente inteligentes para que trabajasen en sus oscuros negocios. Y estos fueron los afortunados, pues los menos inteligentes eran directamente tratados como ganado, cri\u00e1ndolos en granjas para despu\u00e9s descuartizarlos y venderlos por un precio supuestamente razonable. Los esclavos favoritos de los Glukkons eran los Mudokon, unos despreocupados zoquetes que viv\u00edan en lo profundo de la selva y eran terriblemente f\u00e1ciles de enga\u00f1ar y someter. Todo les va de perlas a los malvados Glukkons hasta que se encuentran con un inesperado problema, las especies que llevan d\u00e9cadas masacrando han empezado a extinguirse. Sin carne con la que comerciar, los beneficios bajan, y eso no les gusta nada a los Glukkons. Este giro de los acontecimientos atrapa al pobre Abe por pura casualidad, pues un d\u00eda este adorable bobalic\u00f3n se encuentra fregando los suelos pr\u00f3ximos a la oficina de su jefe, Molluck el Glukkon, cuando al pasar junto a la puerta escucha como este explica a sus socios el problema de la falta de materias primas y la bajada de beneficios. Pero Molluck no parece preocupado, pues ha encontrado una nueva materia prima con la que trabajar... \u00a1Los Mudokon! Ahora Abe y toda su especie aparecen en el men\u00fa, y si nadie lo impide, toda su raza ser\u00e1 diezmada y envasada lista para su inmediato consumo. Las alarmas saltan y Abe es descubierto, los Glukkon no pueden permitirse que sus planes se sepan, pues podr\u00eda desencadenar una rebeli\u00f3n entre los Mudokon. Abe es ahora su principal objetivo, as\u00ed que nos tocar\u00e1 a nosotros ayudar a este pobre desgraciado en taparrabos a escapar de las Granjas Hostiles de los Glukkon y a salvar a toda su gente.\n\nTodo este mundo fant\u00e1stico y especial gira entorno a un negr\u00edsimo sentido del humor donde no pararemos de re\u00edrnos de situaciones tan dram\u00e1ticas como que varios de nuestros compa\u00f1eros acaben hechos pur\u00e9 en una picadora de carne. O ver como Abe se estampa contra el suelo tras caer desde varios pisos de altura. Si hubiese que representar el sentido del humor negro con una imagen, podr\u00eda hacerse perfectamente con una captura de este juego. De hecho el que no importe que nos maten al contar con vidas infinitas, en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n provocar\u00e1 que nosotros mismos hagamos alguna trastada o nos suicidemos de forma c\u00f3mica solo para estallar en carcajadas. Todo este estilo gamberro y desenfadado le da al juego un toque muy especial que os acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 de principio a fin.\n\nComo en todo buen juego de plataformas debemos avanzar por el nivel esquivando trampas, agujeros, y dem\u00e1s peligros, pero aqu\u00ed estamos casi indefensos ante los enemigos, siendo nuestra principal arma nuestra sesera. Pr\u00e1cticamente todo el juego est\u00e1 formado por puzzles, ya que cada escenario presenta un reto en s\u00ed mismo. Llegar del punto A, al punto B, en ocasiones requerir\u00e1 que observemos detenidamente el escenario para evitar caer en una trampa mortal. No deb\u00e9is preocuparos por el numero de vidas, ya que como dec\u00edamos son infinitas, pero no vay\u00e1is a pensar ni mucho menos que eso hace el juego f\u00e1cil. Ya simplemente avanzar supondr\u00e1 un reto importante, en el que habr\u00e1 que demostrar tanto nuestra pericia y reflejos con el mando, como nuestra inteligencia para resolver de la mejor manera posible cada situaci\u00f3n.\n\nPero no olvid\u00e9is que vuestra principal misi\u00f3n aqu\u00ed (adem\u00e1s de sobrevivir) es la de salvar a los otros Mudokon, y es aqu\u00ed donde entra en juego un componente que diferencia a este juego de otros similares. Los propios Mudokon y su disposici\u00f3n en los escenarios, forman parte del puzzle que presenta cada pantalla del juego, no solo deberemos evitar nosotros las trampas y los enemigos, si no que los otros Mudokon tambi\u00e9n deber\u00e1n hacerlo. Para ello disponemos de un sistema verbal que nos permite comunicarnos con estas y otras criaturas mediante \u00f3rdenes sencillas del tipo \"s\u00edgueme\", o \"espera\". Pero antes de nada hay que ser educado y saludar, as\u00ed que si vemos otro Mudokon lo primero ser\u00e1 saludarle dici\u00e9ndole \"hola\", y despu\u00e9s podemos pedirle que nos siga. Para salvarlos, deberemos llevarlos hasta un portal que se activa cuando Abe realiza su canto ceremonial, pero no ser\u00e1 tarea sencilla, pues por el camino deberemos evitar guardias y peligros.\nSi nos matan a un Mudokon, o sentimos que de alg\u00fan modo la hemos pifiado, podemos \"suicidar\" a Abe y volver as\u00ed al \u00faltimo punto de control para repetir esta zona. Al contar con vidas infinitas podemos permitirnos este m\u00e9todo de ensayo y error, sistema que por cierto vicia bastante. En este punto quiz\u00e1 toque lamentar algo negativo, y es el sistema de guardado, sistema que fue mejorado en entregas posteriores pero que aqu\u00ed se hace algo farragoso, principalmente por lo lento del proceso mientras la consola lee la tarjeta de memoria y elegimos donde guardar. Adem\u00e1s no se guardar\u00e1 el progreso en el \u00faltimo checkpoint que hayamos pasado, si no que el sistema de guardado utiliza otros checkpoints m\u00e1s ocasionales, lo que puede provocar que nos toque repetir una zona anterior que ya hab\u00edamos superado cuando carguemos nuestra partida.\n\nPor suerte no estamos totalmente indefensos, pues el canto de Abe tambi\u00e9n tienen la capacidad de poseer algunas criaturas para que las manejemos a distancia. Si uno de los guardias, llamados Slig, nos estorba en el camino, podremos poseerlo y manejarlo para aprovecharnos de sus habilidades, por ejemplo disparando su ametralladora para despachar otros guardias, o haciendo que se estrelle contra una mina explosiva que nos molesta el paso. Pero no siempre podremos hacer esto, ya que en algunos escenarios habr\u00e1 dispuestos orbes de seguridad que nos lanzaran un rayo si nos ven cantar, de modo que tendremos que buscar otras soluciones. La forma de resolver cada puzzle no es siempre definida, y se nos da libertad para que busquemos nuestras propias formas de resolver cada problema.\n\n\u00a1Salva a los Mudokon! O no...\nNo todo el juego ser\u00e1 salvar Mudokons, tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 zonas en las que simplemente habr\u00e1 que superar retos de habilidad y plataformeo, por ejemplo mientras huimos de un enemigo. Todo el juego est\u00e1 compuesto de momentos tranquilos de pensar entremezclados con otros de tensi\u00f3n donde ser\u00e1n importantes los reflejos, esto le da al juego una mezcla especial que lo hace m\u00e1s ameno y variado. Tambi\u00e9n encontraremos zonas ocultas dentro de los niveles que suelen esconder Mudokons en su interior, en total hay 99 Mudokon esparcidos por el juego, y muchos de ellos est\u00e1n escondidos en estas zonas secretas, de modo que si queremos superar el reto de salvarlos a todos habr\u00e1 que dedicarle muchas horas al juego y explorar cada rinc\u00f3n. No obstante tampoco ser\u00e1 necesario salvarlos a todos para completar la aventura, pero cuantos m\u00e1s salvemos pues mejor claro.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente el juego es una delicia, lo era en 1997 y lo sigue siendo hoy en d\u00eda.\n\nRecomendad\u00edsimo este cl\u00e1sico: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1493809239, "timestamp_updated": 1493809239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821285486221313477", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31472496": {"recommendationid": "31472496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010736842", "num_games_owned": 3471, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 1093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1093, "last_played": 1493584871}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un clasico, el estandar de los juegos de plataforma y puzzle en 2D.

Judging from what I've read, I think our situation here is a terrible port of an excellent game.\n\nThe positives:\n-Interesting and thought-provoking puzzles\n-While meager, a fun world, sense of humor and plot\n-Cool art design, yo\n\nThe negatives:\n-Abysmal controls. Controlling Abe as he runs, jumps, walks slowly, rolls, mounts creatures and communicates with other characters is so blocky and obtuse to the point of aggravation. I know exactly what I want Abe to do. Translating that to the mechanics of the controls was excrutiating.\n-Frame rate in the cut scenes (excellent for the 90's!) is bested by old Gumby claymation. I can hardly tell what's going on in cutscenes with all the tearing.\n-Saving system is unclear. I can save at any point, but there's no telling where I will end up when I load a file. I may end up seven zones back from where I left off. I can lose up to half an hour of progress thanks to inaccurate saving.\n-Several times I loaded save files without Abe. I was stuck on a screen with no playable character. Rebooting the game fixed this but geez.\n-For the love of God why isn't there any controller support for Oddworld? This is killer on my hands trying to play this on my laptop keyboard! Why would a game designed for a controller not receive controller functionality during its port?\n-This game caused one of my laptops to crash whenever I tried loading it.\n\nI don't recommend this particular port. That is, assuming that your experience on your machine will be anything like mine. I wish I could play this game as it was originally designed.

Oddworld is a world where corporations run by a race of aliens known as Glukkons, seek to gain huge profits through the exploitation of the environment, native wildlife and most importantly, the subjugation of other species as slaves.\n\nWhat I liked in the game:\n\t- Story: The reason why I like the story behind this game so much is because its engaging. As a player you immediately see that what the corporations are doing is immoral and has to be stopped. The other side to the game is its crude humour aspect, where if the player decides they have no interest in the problems of Oddworld, they can still enjoy the game either through the simple challenge of the puzzles or mindless violence, usually involving meat grinders.\n\t- Challenging: This game is hard, not impossible, but hard. The game has received many criticisms because of this aspect but in this review I see the difficulty as a good thing. It challenges the player to try different strategies. Sometimes patience is the best way to complete a puzzle, others its easier just to run through and hope for the best. Either way, the game rewards the player for completing challenging areas with\u2026 another, harder area. This pushes the player to get better and better or else they won't be able to complete the game, this gives the player incredible satisfaction when the complete an area and gives them a boost of confidence in the face of the next.\n\t- Excellent Art Style: Yes, this is an old game and the graphics are not by any means HD but, still the game remains an inspiration for me. One of the most notable features is how the game plays with both the foreground and background adding another level of depth to the game.\n\t- Soundtrack: The soundtrack is simple and engaging. Alarms sound, intense music plays and enemies chase you through halls and jungles and when you make a mistake and lose the chase, there's the music again to remind you of your failure.\nWhat I didn't like in the game:\n\t- Save points: This is a big problem with this game. You can only save your game at certain save points and these can be fairly far apart from each other. There is no quicksave feature and no autosave leading to the occasion repetitive experience of failing to complete an area over and over again.\n\t- PC Version: This is a review of the PC version and not for either the original PSX/PS1 game or New and Tasty (The HD remaster). I want to start by saying I do not enjoy this game as much on the PC. The controller took a little while to map to the original controls and after that I was still having problems with using the analog sticks of my xbox 360 controller instead of the dpad. This lead to me moving one too many tiles forward or back resulting in a fast death either from falling or from electric fence. The keyboard controls aren't as bad as I thought however, as you progress through the levels they get faster and faster. I found myself fumbling around the keyboard pressing the wrong buttons. This is probably not a huge problem for gamers who use their keyboards frequently.\nOverall, I love this game. It has its problems yes but you learn to adapt to those making the game even more unique. I give Oddworld: Abe's Odysee a clear 9/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1488578649, "timestamp_updated": 1488578649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525139689445495605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30231509": {"recommendationid": "30231509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992902568", "num_games_owned": 1029, "num_reviews": 610, "playtime_forever": 62, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1590791212}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is a gem!", "timestamp_created": 1488244993, "timestamp_updated": 1488244993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442105263471603394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30221026": {"recommendationid": "30221026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071421887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1494507672}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't play this game as a kid, so there's no nostalgia factor in my view.\nThis was a big surprise for me, since I always thought this was kind of a simple old game, but recently I decided to give it a try, and I was really amazed.

This game is not giving you constant and obvious hints, if you don't pay attention to the environment and don't read thoroughly the promped texts you will find yourself clueless and you get frustrated. Also, the control of the character is going to punish you if you make a single additional step in certain situations, so you have to be very coordinated and disciplined in order to pass certain sections of the game.\n\nGame mechanics are smart and unique, considering when this game was released, generating puzzles that do not feel repetitive and putting your brain to use. I didn't play more than 1 hour constantly because I got frustrated and felt the need to take a break, that's how challenging I found this game to be.\n\nThis game is also aiming to test your personality and how much you are willing to sacrifice for the greater good, but I'm not going to talk about this.

The game has some really good puzzles to get through but it is at the same time it is so infuriating to get through.\n\nWhen the game sets itself into small micro levels (such as the trails or zulag rooms) then the game is fun to get through where it gives you a decent checkpoint and a set of objectvies to complete to get through the area. Where you can easily try and complete the puzzles put before you. The limitations of the area which you need to transcend lets the game to florish.\n\nUnfortnately the game falls apart in the more larger levels. This mainly down to the extremly poor checkpoint system. The checkpointing system is too sparse and any bonus you do will not create a new checkpoint after completion so you end having to re do any bonus area if you die and this can make sections last alot longer then needed and it becomes infurtiating that you have to constantly have to recomplete large sections of the game to proceed.\n\nAnother problem is the hit detection and platforming sections of the game. When sections of the game demand precise platform is where the worst parts of the game shows up. You can be hurt by jumping obstacles by just standing on the edge of the platform which is extremly annoying considering the one hit kills in this game.

Naturally, this comes with the platform but somehow this PC port manages to worsen the issue. You're left having to press 2 five or six times to tell your friends to follow you, as much of the time nothing whatsoever happens when you attempt to do so. You will often kill yourself not due to your own personal error but because you have simply kept going when you've stopped pressing your movement keys. This is particularly frustrating when you're [spoiler] disarming bombs [/spoiler], due to the precision needed. \n\nNext, cutscenes. For whatever reason, every single cutscene and animation in the game, including the [b] startup animations [/b], are limited to a literal frame per second. Again, originally being a PS1 game obviously would place limits on framerate but you'd expect for a PC port to increase framerates, not the exact opposite. What were memorable and important moments in the game on PS1 are now frustrating and unwelcome breaks in the already blocky play of this port. Only actual gameplay runs semi-respectably.\n\nMy only quall with the original PS1 version was the saving system and, you guessed it, this port makes absolutely no effort to rectify the problems. You can save anywhere, anytime, however you are almost guaranteed to pick up the game again in an entirely different spot to where you saved. We aren't talking ages back, more a couple of rooms or puzzles back from where you were, but this is frustrating nonetheless- I've personally lost up to ten minutes of progress from an awful save system.\n\nFinally, we reach the biggest problem. The one aspect that makes this port absolutely unforgiveable.\nThe ending. It isn't the same.\nI spent hours working out how to successfully save all 99 of your mudokon friends, as I was never able to complete this when I was younger. The last one jumps into the portal, and I'm expecting to get some sort of special cutscene or something, a reward for full completion.\n\nI get a message, telling me that I cannot actually see the content that I would have seen, due to recommendations from their lawyers. Instead, I get a list of the cutscenes that I've already seen, and of course, they don't load.\n\n\nAbe's Oddysee is an incredible game, a real classic of the PS1 era.\nThis port destroys it, and it does downplay the great memories I had trying to complete it when I was younger.\nPlay the PS1 version.", "timestamp_created": 1480299960, "timestamp_updated": 1490924207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536423861980438232", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27908405": {"recommendationid": "27908405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138618897", "num_games_owned": 1073, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1480305034}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute Classic.\n\nIt's aged noticably but the mechanics are stilll fun and challenging.

The message is found within it and not the other way around. \n\nIt's a great message with meaningful characters that could easily have felt generic and certainly could have been more two dimensional like many games at the time. \n\nKeep in mind - this is before we even touch the surface of the gameplay. \nThis game is a work of art in that respect as well. \n\nThe game design is very tightly knit. \nIt's so obvious that the developer loved this game and poured hundreds of hours into ensuring it had a fine layer of polish in every aspect of its design. Your motive is clear from a story standpoint and from a gameplay standpoint. You can almost always immediately see what needs to be done and any thought process required for figuring something out always ends with an intutive solution and never leaves you shaking your head in frustration or disbelief. \n\nThis game is incredible and at its price point, it's a crime not to already own it; don't get me started on what I think if you're still wondering if you should buy it. \n\nI would recommend this to almost everyone but it's certainly not a casual game. \nIf you do NOT like difficulty BUT possess patience then I STILL recommend this game to you.\nIf you don't mind getting stuck and find joy in figuring things out and in continued success in a slightly uphill battle then this game is absolutely for you!\n\nIf you think you're a boss at games and that difficulty is something you've no intentions of experiencing then prepare to meet it for the first time. \n\nThis game can be tough but it's a good kind of tough.\nYou know how a good medium rare steak is utterly delicious but requires you to be paitent and chew it a bit?\n\nAbe's Oddysee puts that steak to shame because it's got even more seasoning, flavor, and doesn't cost $12 dollars for just a few bites of gameplay.\n\nAdd this to your library today - unless you're going to play New 'n' Tasty, which DOES include this original as well!\n\nIf you need help getting this running correctly then check in the community section or do some googling. \nYou just need to a download a config file, open in notepad, make some changes to it and you're on your way! \n\nIt took me about three minutes. \n\n10/10 from me and I RARELY hand one of those out!\n\nAlso - I personally recommend a controller for most platformers and I'm the king of platformers.", "timestamp_created": 1478474904, "timestamp_updated": 1478474904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26239039": {"recommendationid": "26239039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160983046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1522983822}, "language": "english", "review": "Ignore the bullshit about shite controls,works just fine,Great memories and a great port i highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1477529913, "timestamp_updated": 1477529913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536014258861541748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26199828": {"recommendationid": "26199828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142240214", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 619, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 733, "last_played": 1668700392}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is classic!

The real reason to play this game though, is the atmosphere. Much like Silent Hill 2, this game is one of the greatest pieces of art due to the amazing atmosphere and feelings it conveys to the player. The Stockyard escape with the planets and stars in the background and that eerie but also peaceful music. The Paramonian temple, dark, creepy and a nightmare to us arachnaphobes everywhere. And Scrabania, the only desert/mountain based level in any game I genuinely like. You feel like you are high af (and I do mean vertically) and you can imagine the immense heat from the landscape.

Who would've thought it possible?\n\nNow, allow me to tell you all what I know of Abe's Oddysee. If you remember games like Flashback: The Quest For Identity, this game plays something similar to it, only you're playing as a Mudokon named Abe, but you have no weapons, one special skill through possession by way of chanting and only your wits, conversational skills, farting and you must know how to carry a good tune when you hear it. You're working at Rupture Farms, what you thought to be the best place to work in the world. Well, you were really enslaved. But you had to go and cross the meanest boss in the world, Mullok the Glukkon all because you found out that they were looking to make increased profits by killing your buddies and make Mudokon Pops out of them! Now, it's up to you to save yourself and 99 other Mudokons from a terrible fate. But, be warned. One mistake will get you killed either embarrassingly or hilariously, depending on who or what killed you, so you'll have to move carefully as well as quickly.\n\nThis is not a task you should take lightly, as there is a consequence if you don't save enough of your buddies. I won't spoil the ending for you, but let's just say that it doesn't end well.\n\nWhen it comes to controls, it may be a bit wonky if you're using the keyboard, so a controller is a definite must-have. The graphics are indeed old, but for the time this game was released, they're nothing short of remarkable. When it comes to music, this game has some of the best soundtracks that you'll ever hear, whether you're sneaking around a factory, getting chased by Paramites or even exploring a temple.\n\nNow, would I recommend this game? Of course, I would. Given the fact that it's dated as all hell, the simple fact remains the same. I grew up with this game many moons ago when the dinosaurs roamed the earth and it still stands the test of time even now, especially after the release of Oddworld: New 'n Tasty. It may not look as good now as it did long ago plus the AMV's are a bit of a trainwreck to look at, but that can be easily remedied.\n\nBut all in all, give this a shot if you want something different from your usual standard fare puzzle-platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1468497561, "timestamp_updated": 1474361633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24301977": {"recommendationid": "24301977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096889974", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1628447346}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego de plataformas con muchos niveles y retos que completar.

As far as I remember, it was a popular release and it received many positive reviews by the major publications of the time. I was excited to buy it but as soon as I began playing it, I remember being disappointed. I can't remember whether or not I beat it back then but chances are high that I got bored and quit playing just as I did now.\n\nDespite what the multitude of nostalgic, rabid and headstrong fans say, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee  didn't age well at all from what was already a mediocre effort to begin with. While the character design is interesting and charming, everything else is quite flawed. The background graphics and animations are average to below average, the music is nearly non-existent, the sound effects can get borderline annoying at times, and worst of all, the controls are extremely unresponsive, sluggish and awkward. Getting Abe to perform the most basic of platforming moves such as seamlessly running, stopping, climbing on a ledge and then sneaking is painful and inadequate. Controlling Abe feels very much delayed and as if the movements were restricted in some way. The puzzles and rooms are designed competently for the most part but when you have to deal with the game's awful controls, solving each screen is too aggravating and devoid of any fun whatsoever. The gameplay revolves around traversing the game world one screen at a time. Even though not every screen presents the player with a puzzle or a situation that needs his or her attention, there is still the need to advance through each screen individually and with a slight pause between each transition. Deaths come often and the player will be forced to repeatedly wait through a lengthy death and restart animation that takes about five seconds to complete. The save system is based on checkpoints, so if the player dies several screens beyond the last checkpoint, every screen from the checkpoint to the point of death will need to be redone as many times as it takes until you reach the next checkpoint. Without mentioning any spoilers, it is encouraged that there is at least one additional playthrough after you beat the game once. In relation to this, one of the worst design choices in the game presents itself. The goal is to rescue slaves. Unfortunately for the player, many of the slaves are hidden away in secret areas that are absolutely not easy to find. Thanks to this design decision, this means the player will fail at the goal the game has set to be accomplished.\n\nIt's surprising to me how much love Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee has garnered through the years. It has far too many flaws to be enjoyed and it's way too annoying to be played to completion. This game could easily have been so much better than it actually is.\n\nOddworld: Abe's Oddysee is mediocre.", "timestamp_created": 1462923518, "timestamp_updated": 1462923518, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435612261295318604", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22900214": {"recommendationid": "22900214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098546245", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1462907377}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to buy this and you have a Xboxone controller, don't bother, impossible to get any ofn the fucking controls right", "timestamp_created": 1462907434, "timestamp_updated": 1462907434, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419981271028518677", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22876644": {"recommendationid": "22876644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965813702", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1459250519}, "language": "english", "review": "Intense platforming with a charming funny world and inhabitents.\n\nFun is ruined by an inconsistent saving system.

This was what started the Oddworld franchise that since that year has seen several sequels.\n\nThese games are all about Abe, the titular character, who is a Mudokon slave being captive in a factory. Initially just a worker, but later labelled as \"meat to be processed\", Abe sets out to escape from his captors and also to free his fellow Mudokons in the process. The game's first cutscene (which is pretty long considering it is an old game) summarises the story very well and we can quickly understand what's ahead of us.\n\nThis is a 2D platformer, so we go from screen to screen and every new \"room\" represents a new challenge. We have patrolling enemies as well as traps and of course members of the Mudokon race who we need to rescue. We can issue some basic commands to them to make sure they follow us - this part where you communicate with the others can be hilarious. \n\nDo note that this is one of those games where one mistake can lead to certain death. Checkpoints are regularly placed, though, so at least the game is not punishing you for being a little careless from time to time. One particularly interesting thing is how you can make other Mudokons die if you are not careful - the game does not take you back to the last checkpoint so you may think this is not a problem. Truth is, the number of saved Mudokons determines the ending of the game - you can either get the Good or the Bad ending.\n\nThe gameplay is really good - Abe can do a lot of things in terms of movement and activating various mechanisms throughout the factory. Sections tend to get more and more difficult but Oddworld offers an acceptable learning curve here.

This is one of those games of my childhood, it comes with a major problem, sadly.\n\n1: Checkpoints. Often I will find a secret area, spend 1-15 minutes figuring out how to do it, leave the secret area, die to something and have that 1-15 minutes of progress lost and having to be repeated EACH time you make a mistake until the next checkpoint. You get better and can execute the puzzles faster, but the \"secret area\" puzzles are generally very difficult. There's one as early on as the first few screens of the game and damn is it frustrating to be forced to redo it each time you die to something entirely unrelated later on. This isn't the kind of game you can just pick up and not make any mistakes, and sticking to the main path the game handles it's saves very well, but you will die, you will come across trial and error moments, and you will lose some progress.\n\n2:Controls: Once you get familiar, or played this game for your entire childhood (oh and use good gamepad) the controls aren't AS big of an issue. They are still an issue, it's just not as awful. There's also very little in the way of explaining some of the more advanced things you can do. You can run into a jump, you can run into a roll, you can throw objects while crouching and in 4 directions, if you tap forward you will take one step no matter what. These aren't really problems for the guy who spent countless hours (no steam time counter on ps1 lol) on the game in his childhood but to new comers I can imagine the controls are a bit frustrating to learn on your own.\n\nThe game is great if you don't try to be a completionist and stay on the main storyline and is challenging without being frustrating, but when you start to try to solve the longer/more difficult secret areas later in the game, losing that 1-15 minutes of progress EACH time you have a death to something that would've been hard to predict, it's easy to lose motivation when there is a really out of date save system. I mean cheap deaths or \"oh shit, didn't see that coming\" moments can be entertaining and I don't even think there's anything wrong with them, but replaying big portions of complex/difficult levels gets tedious for those of us who seek out the extra/secret areas and want to finish them.\n\nThat being said, I believe Abe's exodus introduced a quicksave and a ton of other great features. This game's story and world will captivate you, it's gameplay is great, but the checkpoint system and learning curve that come with a completionist mindset are harsh and likely not worth it without the massive nostalgia goggles I have on.", "timestamp_created": 1457702275, "timestamp_updated": 1457702631, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21741413": {"recommendationid": "21741413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171935462", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1457491521}, "language": "english", "review": "This is another one of those games that define my childhood and brings back a lot of memories.

is a masterpiece of satire, dark humour and social commentary. One of the few video games to tackle serious real-world issues, Oddysee shines a darkly comedic yet sickly light on the cruelties of factory farming, as well as the exploitation of native cultures and wildlife by corporate greed. The game deals with the dichotomy of industrial and spiritual world views, and places us into a violent, weird and odd world. Just like our own.\n\nWhile these meanings and intentions are confirmed and stem from Oddworld's brainchild Lorne Lanning, all of this is likely lost on most of Oddworld's audience. It certainly was lost on me when I played it as a small child. However, Oddworld Inhabitants provided an exciting, intruiging and challenging experience in Oddysee whether or not the meanings were decoded. And later on, when the messages become more prevalent, it simply gives us more to talk about, and furthers the cause of games as effective, communicative art.\n\nOverall, Abe's Oddysee is a great game with a compelling setting and story. Exoddus is a brilliant follow-up, with more of the same.

From the simple but challenging puzzle based gameplay, to the heady artstyle, to the rich world, to the deep and compelling storyline, Every facet of this game comes together perfectly in a way that stands the test of time in a way few games do.\n\n\nThe premise is simple, you play as Abe, A Mudoken slave worker working for the meat processing facility, Rupture Farms. After farming other species to near extinction in service of profit, The tyrannical Glukkon overlords decide to turn their slave workers into their next New 'n Tasty delight. After learning this, Abe decides to escape and try and save some of his fellow workers along the way. The dark thematic elements of the story juxtaposed with the cutesey artstyle and adorable haiku's narrated by Abe goes hand in hand and works on so many levels. The game gives you a glimpse of this diverse, incongruous world and makes you want to know more about what lays beyond.\n\nThe gameplay involves you traversing through 2-D environments, avoiding traps and enemies while also leading your fellow mudoken's to safety. Everything you see in the game is tile based. You press forward once, you move forward one tile. When you jump, you jump three tiles ahead and more when you get a running start, It becomes very easy to look at a room and plot out a safe course through it. The challenge becomes executing these long chain of commands without messing up, it can be quite tense at time, especially in the later stages where you'll be required to complete screen after screen after screen of challenging platforming levels. The controls are so tight that when you do eventually overcome an obstacle, the feeling of satisfaction is immense. It's something that's kept me coming back to this game for over a decade.\n\nEach screen also has a handrawn background. Visually speaking, it hasn't aged well. The story these images tell about the world though stand out just as much. It just takes a little imagination.\n\nWhile the remake doesn't quite capture the nuance of the platforming the way I'd like, It manages to recapture a lot of the narrative hooks that, well, hooked me and is absolutley worth a shot but nothing can compare to the purity of the original.", "timestamp_created": 1452357755, "timestamp_updated": 1520177977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20394108": {"recommendationid": "20394108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129954996", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1452249742}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is hard.

No sir e bob this platform game is on a grid and as much as I want to complain about how easy it is to muck up a jump because I wasn't on the right tile or I held the arrow key down for too long it was always my fault. I needed to be better not the game. This game is very intimidating, it doesn't beat around the bush when it says 23 Mudokins are gonna die if you didn't save them 23 Mudokins die. This is the type of game that demands multiple play throughs and or complete mastery of the controls within the first one minute. By the time you would normally complete the tutorial you have passed 10% of the games secrets.

Oddworld games are always filled with dark comedy, the Oddworld games always manage to keep a sense of adventure coupled with a macabre feel that I just love. \n\nIn Abe's Oddysee you play a character named Abe, a Mudokon slave worker who uncovers a nefarious plot that could lead to the death of his people. He sets out on a quest to free them, slowly uncovering more of his Mudokon culture along the way.  Gameplay wise Abe's Oddysee is a 2D platformer filled with puzzles and obstacles to complete or circumvent, but remember the ending is dependent on how well you do.\n\nOverall I would recommend Oddworld games to anyone who is a fan of adventure or puzzle games.

I'm sure it is now. But lemme tell you why I hate it soo much now.\n\n  The Devs man, the Devs.  \n\n  Windowed Mode:\n  The version that has been released does not work in windowed mode. If you are looking to broadcast, piss off cuz it won't work.(WITHOUT THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Even if you do get third party software, it will make the game so unplayable it will just disgust you.\n\n  Game Controllers:\n   Do not work. (THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE REQ) Again, the third party software sort of works. Ie A button works but directionals do not. Not only that but you can not set your key bindings to your controller let alone your own keyboard. WHAT THE FUCK DEVS!!!???\n\n  WinCompat:\n  Sure it \"works\" on windows xp and newer versions but the direct x needs a super fucking upgrade to play nicely with windows 7 or 8. It is super fucking laggy. Like 8fps laggy. It literally skips frames through video. Game play is fine at moments.\n\n  Broadcasting:\n  Forget about it. The simple fact that windowed mode is not a option nor something that can be edited via steam gamelaunch settings. Just give up. You cannot broadcast it because the normal steam hot keys Shift+Tab doesn't work. Also it is not a game that can be auto-detected. On top of that, most broadcasters use extended displays. Well this game fucks that up too. Have windows open on your other display and game on main? Well guess what, now you only have your game on your main screen because for whatever fucked up reasons the game does not allow it.\n\n  End Points:\n  Do I like the game. I liked it on its' console counter part. This \"works on pc\" release is shit. PURE SHIT. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere until or unless the DEVS come out with a update to fix that crap. Which I doubt will ever happen because they just do not give any shits. If they did they would sell this half completed pc compatible game to us via steam. Which brings me to my last point. STEAM please pull your co-workers head out of their ass. We could use games that work the way the rest do. WINDOWED MODES, AND GAME SETUP ISSUES ON PURCHASE PAGES. DON\"T WAIT FOR US TO FIND THIS CRAP. IT WASTES OUR TIME LOOKING FOR FIXES AND JUST FURTHER UPSETS US.\n\nThank you for understanding.\n\nA very frustrated and disgruntled me at the moment. Sorry.

I remember never finishing this many moons ago. Thought I would try again. I still very much enjoy the novelty of the game and the nice graphics.\n\nTrouble is, it's still very unforgiving and very frustrating in parts. Though those things are ok as that's just part of a good platformer. The thing I really don't like about the game is all the cheap deaths you incur. Some are there I'm sure, just so you can't do a level in one go. Pull a lever to bring down a lift and a slig pops up and creams you. Or you just go from one screen to the next and suddenly a slog  jumps in from behind you and kills you. Hard, fair games I enjoy and will battle on with. Games that make you do repeat screens because of cheap tricks turns me off.\n\nThankfully, Abe's Oddysee has much to like about it but it doesn't fully compensate for the cheap tricks. Then comes the ending. This is the cheapest trick of all. ++++ spoiler alert +++ but read it anyway if you want to keep your sanity! So you battle all through the game. 26hrs of it (for me at least). You get to the end, only to be fed into the grinding machine because you didn't happen to save enough Mudokons!!! Up pops a smarta@@ sign saying blah, blah do it again you need to save at least 50 Mudokons. With that, I quit the game and will never go back to it. Just another example of a good game ruined. Why not give us that detail to begin with? Would simply have added another dimension to the game. But no, the old cheap tricks prevail. \n\nI have marked this as recommended, but it is with reservation that I do. I just wish I knew about the 50 limit when I started. Either that, or I wish I had blown up and splatted every Mudokon I saw. The worst part, was that I did actually try to save every Mudokon I came across and didn't give any a cheap death.

It is a flawless classic with a compelling story and immersive gameplay. The first time you watch the opening cutscene, you know what you've put yourself into. In this game you play as a Mudokon named Abe, who works at the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld called RuptureFarms. The goal is to help Abe save all 99, if not at least 50 Mudokons throughout your journey after he finds out that Molluck the Glukkon, the CEO of RuptureFarms 1029, wants to chop up you and your pals into tasty treats after beginning to lose profit due to the endangerment of wildlife they're capturing.\n\nWhile travelling through the eerie and atmospheric domains of Oddworld, you'll encounter various \"odd\" looking creatures that will make you scratch your head and affect your progression. Each enemy type requires specfic strategizing and tactics to avoid them and reach certain areas in order to get to another. It really keeps you on your toes throughout the whole game. However it's not just the creatures that arouse your curiosity or interest, but also the terrain and landscapes they inhabit. From the dirty, bloody steampunk factory of RuptureFarms, to the native, green forests of Paramonia and the scorching desert of Scrabania, you really feel these environments as you continue your quest to save your fellow Mudokons and free yourself from the hands of the upper class management.  \n\nOddworld is basically a reflection of our societies problems and the day-to-day issues we regularly face. The reflections of our problems present in the game would be the bad side of consumerism, economics, capitalism, racism, prejudice, pollution etc. Many of these things you will instantly notice in the opening cutscene.\n\nTo conclude, this game is an oldschool gem that will remain a huge inspiration for me personally and a fantastic game that has aged well over the past 20 years, in my opinion. Please do yourself a favour and buy this game. It has plenty of originality and a fable that will keep you involved for hours.\n\nMy verdict - 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1421618843, "timestamp_updated": 1621528238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14020193": {"recommendationid": "14020193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011118487", "num_games_owned": 1759, "num_reviews": 635, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1450523033}, "language": "english", "review": "\n", "timestamp_created": 1421449178, "timestamp_updated": 1421449178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435546934604644775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14010705": {"recommendationid": "14010705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171800747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1340, "last_played": 1421419305}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Abe's Oddysee es uno de los mejores juegos de plataformas que he jugado, por no decir el mejor.

Otro contra que he encontrado es que cada vez que guardas se te van acumulando m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s archivos y llega un momento en el que no sabes cu\u00e1l es exactamente la zona en la que dejaste el juego xD\n\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, un 10 por todo lo alto :D", "timestamp_created": 1421413699, "timestamp_updated": 1421414078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13994607": {"recommendationid": "13994607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095694142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2, "last_played": 1422051232}, "language": "english", "review": "Always crashes after starting up. 10/10 Best game on Xbox One.", "timestamp_created": 1421328674, "timestamp_updated": 1421328674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498930871486663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13992259": {"recommendationid": "13992259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173106991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1472912987}, "language": "english", "review": "Couldn't ever complete this as a kid so I thought I'd come back to it recently.

This game is incredibly unforgiving. one wrong move and \"BOOM\" ... you're blue paste gets splattered all over the screen, and you're left to think about what would happen to your green comrades if you could not re-spawn ... a banjo kazooie 'quit game ending if you will.\n\nit doesn't do that, i'm just saying thinking about it is weird ... what if they all get eaten and they sell your organs for dog food, humanity goes into a downward spiral as events you couldn't stop, happen. The sequels always end with the sad ending, and you're no where to be seen because you died 2 games ago, nobody even knows your name anymore. As a slag (animal) begins to munch on your tinned mudoken fingers and eyeballs, the last sentient part of you is converted into fecal matter and your race DIES ... all because you took one step to the right and got crushed by a barrel of meat ... but i digress\n\nSTORY-\nthe story to this game is essentially one giant Eco friendly metaphor for our own industrial prowess ... but it is so subtle/just plain ignorable that it will not rest on your conscience at all. basically you're an actual \"skrub\" worker in the biggest meat factory on odd-world, your bosses want to kill and sell your race to (possibly) unwary, cannibalistic consumers (it's never specified who actually buys all this food). you get found out, chase scene happens, voodoo hoodoo guy with funny mask gives you powers, and you basically take off from there. the story is a lot more in-depth than that but, meh. it would spoil a lot of the lot to go into full detail (I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, THE PURCHASER OF THIS FINE PRODUCT! DON'T HATE ME!)\n\nGRAPHICS-\nIt's a ps1 game, so you can expect some ... aging, to take place. it's a side scroller from the 90's so its 32 bit graphic style will always hold up pretty well (if you're a forgiving sort of person who enjoys game play over graphics). it's not the worst game you will ever see in your life ... it definitely gives some 3D games i know of a run for there money.\n\nOVERALL-\ni would definitely recommend that you buy this game, as a matter of fact, just buy the entire Oddbox bundle. you get all the Odd-world games for \u00a36.99 (when not on sale). that is a steal for anyone's library as they are all definitely worth purchasing. strangers wrath although not as popular as other Odd-world title is definitely commendable for a referral as well.", "timestamp_created": 1420165367, "timestamp_updated": 1420165367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515247583389282227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13769568": {"recommendationid": "13769568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163675927", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 152, "last_played": 1420259161}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game <3", "timestamp_created": 1420150112, "timestamp_updated": 1420150112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 2089, "total_negative": 351, "total_reviews": 2440}, "cursors": {"AoJw8N/i08oCcLbDNA==": "Thu Nov 23 22:50:09 2023"}}
