I don't know how much time I sunk into doing this stupid game, so the fact that I've got pulled back in once again is insane.\n\nThis is an easy buy. You're a little frog in the middle who spits marbles and trails of marbles going around you. You try to match 3, which clears those marbles. You try to do \"bonus\" things like shooting marbles in between gaps or clearing out large numbers of marbles at the same time. It's really not that complicated... it's just about as simple as it looks.\n\nBut I'm telling you, it's addicting. It really is. Before you realize what's going on, you'll be sucked in and won't want to stop.\n\nThis game is SUPER old, so you could probably run it on your microwave. No need to worry about laptop specs. \n\nYou will find yourself furiously trying to survive as the levels get more and more difficult.

The power system is more manageable ; Luxor have system third color shoot gives the power up but Zuma you have to find power up and destroy it to get and with time . So you have good way to get power up just by hitting 3 combo and you choose the power by hitting specific color part3 but Zuma power is randomized maybe in place you cant get or maybe its above you but you dont have right color to destroy the power and its type is randomized for example you want to save yourself with power knock Marbles back because its very close to the gap but you see worst power possible in this occation SLOW and lose the round .\n2. Luxor have more freedom to shoot because you have full line to move but Zuma you stick with one place and circle around , with half levels you go you see they are blocked a lot and sometimes completely blocked like last level .\n3. Zuma have a random chosen color to shoot even when its close to the gap which is very frustrating and here Luxor saves the day with special role : when a marble get close to the gap the shooter colors turns from random to closest two colors to the gap so you could fight a little bit the line , and here when I play Zuma in this situation I say that its over but in Luxor my popular playtime in hard levels is fighting the marble until I win because these things and one above .\n4. I noticed that when Marble is close to the gap : Zuma has only slightly change of speed , Luxor speed get slower but a lot and very noticeable between it and Zuma .\n5. In Luxor you have specific bugs to counter which make your win just surviving the waves and give breath everytime you finish a level , Zuma is a noticeable pressure pattern with looots of stress with time ; the level has limitless quantity until you fill the green line by getting specific score , its kinda ok in beginning but believe me that it will turn into ball of stress after the third temple in adventure mode so you have to cambo or hit as much coins as you can to finish the line before it is over , and here what do I hate this game cause the negative thing I told up there will turn this race into lucky eagle eye and quick reaction master level .\n6. Last is that you gain lives in Zuma by hitting specific point , Luxor have more advance way : when you hit five marbles or more you get life coin or when you finish the game and there is a big space between marbles and the gap (later they will calculate the space and drop life coins) , and collecting 30 of them get a life , its for me more sufficient to get life .\nBut even this negative parts (you know its the first Marble Shooter) but it makes its own play style and difficulty because you have to concentrate with points you get because its your own key to victory and use your power efficiently because you wont get then frequently and pause from time to time and have some breathing moments cause you wont get a lot in this game and of course use your lives in your darkest times.\nIf you like Zuma I recommend you to check Luxor (Ive played 1 and play 3 right now) its cool Marble shooter game and have fun with this one because it doesnt get its fame from nothing .", "timestamp_created": 1679522427, "timestamp_updated": 1679522427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135063628": {"recommendationid": "135063628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285391452", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1693254068}, "language": "english", "review": "Kino", "timestamp_created": 1679351515, "timestamp_updated": 1679351515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135016192": {"recommendationid": "135016192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819511475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 723, "last_played": 1699238198}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so nostalgic for me.

"language": "english", "review": "[quote]Follow my Curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41363546-Fruit-N-Doggie-Reviews/]Fruit N Doggie Reviews,[/url] so you can be updated whenever I post a new review.[/quote]\n[h1]First Impressions[/h1] \nIt's time to finish my coverage of the games I bought from the PopCap Party Pack, and Zuma Deluxe (ZD) was the one I really didn't want. I've played this style of marble-shooter before, and it's never jived with me. There's just something I dislike about the gameplay, so it really has little to do with any specific version of the game, it's applicable to all of them. One disliked game out of five didn't make it a better deal to buy the others separately though, so I got the entire pack regardless. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \nEach stage places the stone frog in a central location, with a pathway in place for the line of marbles to advance. Since it's sort of like a passage for water to traverse, it can take on any sort of shape, with a tendency to curve and bend quite a lot. Starting out, there are only four colors of marble to deal with, so shooting your marble at a set of at least three to clear them is rather easy. Plus, with such little variety, destroying any section will more likely lead to the two sections on either side to be the same color. When that's the case, the line of marbles comes together, and the matching colors will combine and be destroyed. If the other parts next to those sections match, it'll keep a chain reaction going, until the colors are different. It doesn't take long for more colors to be added, which makes this harder to pull off. \n\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1] \nDue to how old the game is, it's not surprising that it doesn't work with a controller. However, I didn't notice any problems when I was using my mouse to aim my shots. Sometimes I'd miss, but those were my mistakes at play, not the controls screwing up. \n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1] \nThe store page indicates this is all supposed to take place in the realm of Zuma, but since that's a made-up location, I interpret the scenery as more of an Aztec civilization. It wouldn't surprise me, as the developers exaggerated matters by using the opposite letter of the alphabet for their society. Either way, your stone frog shooting at a conga line of malicious marbles doesn't contain any story elements. You do progress through ancient temples, but there's no plot or explanation for what's going on. Then again, it really should be self-explanatory. \n\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1] \nOne issue with ZD is that its visuals look dated, as it was originally released in 2006. Stages often have the look of stone, and the textures look drab and faded, as if this was never something ZD ever handled well. Even though the statues and stone frog are depicted with big smiles, I think they actually look a tad bit creepy instead of endearing. Maybe it's because they're so stationary, having some appearance of life, while moving so little. Unless I really enjoyed the gameplay, the game's visuals would be a bit of a turn-off and prohibit me from wanting to play it very much. \n\n\n[h1]Sound Design[/h1] \nWhatever society this may or may not represent, they're all dead anyways, so who really cares? If the music is too groovy and would have made them shudder because they just weren't hip enough for it, we're not really missing out on them not being around. On that note, I've no idea if the music would be offensive to anybody because it doesn't take its inspiration seriously enough or whatever. Regardless, I and many other people really enjoy listening to the songs in ZD, as they have a contagious nature to them. Instead of playing the game, I might just download some of the songs I enjoy.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f As far as puzzle games go, it's a lot more action-based. Ironic, as these quicker games tend to be my preferred style. \n\ud83c\udf1f The occasional power-up helps deal with the increasing difficulty. \n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1] \n\u274c Being a bit of a broken record, but for being a deluxe version, there's not many features in the game. There are no trading cards, achievements, and I wasn't able to take any screenshots either. \n\u274c It doesn't take long before you start having to contend with quite a few colors at the same time. It inhibits your ability to make chains and greatly increases the difficulty. \n\n\n[h1]Tips[/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d At any time, you'll have two colors that you can shoot. The one in your mouth is what you'll shoot, while the one on your back is what you could exchange for and fire instead.  \n\ud83d\udd0d Time your shots carefully. You have to account for the forward movement of the marbles while aiming. \n\ud83d\udd0d If you're not fully surrounded, you can shoot useless marbles off the screen. \n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] \nSeeing as how this game was one I actively didn't want, especially because I innately dislike the kind of game it is, it's not really possible for me to say whether its a good version or not. From the thousands of good reviews, which I assume aren't solely based on nostalgia, it's likely on the same level of quality as the other games from the same pack. Looking at it another way, for those who are fond of puzzle games, you're likely to agree with the majority and enjoy ZD, but you could be an oddball like me and dislike shooting marbles. Because I don't believe there's anything truly wrong with the game, even if I don't enjoy it, I'll recommend it. Personally, it's the least interesting game from the PopCap Party Pack, but at least it works on my PC.

edit my review since the game has been plagued for years with hundreds of bugs and problems the game its self is not bad its decent fun puzzle game with a lot rng tho but this game can litearly black screen for no fucking reason the game litearly deletes itself and black screen i feel like thats what fucking happened. And i have not found a fix NOT sure if this is related to the fatal error bug but still it happeneds every time i open my copy of the game i verified the games cache NOTHING i deleted files to reset the game in hopes it restores it NOPE it all is fucked and pop cap will not fix this shit cus its in a dead engine pretty much.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME JUST GET THE CD REALEASE OR DOWNLOAD THE CD DOWNLOAD VERSION OF THE GAME\n\nEDIT i found out you could play the game in window mode problem is you can't use full screen or it shits itself\n\nFinal edit\nFound out if you don't have Steam.dll on any popcap game IT LITEARLY KILLS ITSELF IF YOU HAVE FULLSCREEN ON.\nSo if you import Steam.dll from D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam, to D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Zuma Deluxe, It now decides to fix itself cause the popcap games from the 2000's relie on that file to function but i believe steam removed that file sometime not too long ago and has been happening to random people (like me) to have the blackscreen which is a bug off all popcap games..\n\nI will not be changing my review cause there might be some poor soul that bought this game for them selves and find it just as a black screen for no reason, and might find this review and try it and it might work.", "timestamp_created": 1669827285, "timestamp_updated":

"language": "english", "review": "This game saved my life.\n\nI am 35.\n\nMy ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.", "timestamp_created": 1653140966, "timestamp_updated": 1671451267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

I played it a lot in my childhood, so it was nice to finally buy it and play it.\n\nFirst of all, the game has a gigantic difficulty spike around stage 10-11. Other reviews mention stage 8 or 9 as breaking points, for me personally that was still fine. \n\nDuring the game I collected I think 20 extra lives. In stage 10, I lost 9 in 3 levels. \nI finished the game (after earning another 2) with 3. Three.\n\nRNG rules the last stages - the line curves back onto itself, blocking shots. There's been examples of not getting a colour to hit a slow-combo for about 20 shots. The colour variety, and speed of the balls make sure to add up the difficulty and make your mistakes pile up extremely fast.   Fail the same level 4-5 times, then do it finally well under half of the ace time.\n\nI write a negative review to point out this issue. Other reviews mention a high framerate problem, which makes the game run too fast, hence the difficulty - maybe one could limit the framerate through GPU's program.  But as the game is out of the box, it needs cautionary reviews because the difficulty spike. If you're okay with that, just buy it. \n\n(Though seems like it doesn't run on Mac, despite the requirements.

Technical problems? Nope. Runs fine on Win10, no issues there whatsoever.\n\nThe problem with this game, is that the spike in difficulty makes you want to throw it in the trash. Ever played Cuphead? Now, that's a game that has one of the most unique artstyles around and jaw-droppingly gorgeous animation to boot and a cute story. It'll grab you - but you quickly find out that you have to spend hours on getting through single bosses. \n\n\"Oh, but that's just YOU, git gud m8!\" - wrong. According to HowLongToBeat.com - average completion of the Main Story is 10.5hrs. Meanwhile, look up a longplay of Cuphead on YouTube (not to be confused with speedruns) - and you'll see it takes 1.5hrs to beat. \n\nAll the charm of it will die off in a hurry. And worse still - because there's no ability to complete the game on \"Simple\" (aka Easy) - you're stuck with what you got. No way around it.\n\nZuma Deluxe features no difficulty slider - so in the same vein, you're stuck with what you've got. It all depends on the algorithm/programming/math of the stage/level you're playing. \n\nThere are SO many threads from over the years, not just on Steam - of people pointing out how insane the difficulty curve is in this game. The breaking point for people seem to be around Stage 8 or 9. There are people saying they've spent WEEKS trying to solve individual levels in these stages, along with those who've decided to turn their backs on the game entirely because it was so difficult at this juncture.\n\nI'm not about to spend potentially weeks to get through the remaining parts of the game (I made it to stage 8, level 4) - so I've requested Steam issue me a refund, which they probably won't due to my playtime. If I can't get a refund - I'll request the game be removed permanently from my account.

Despite the appearance of it just being a standard PopCap puzzle game, the frenetic and stressful gameplay gives Zuma Deluxe a hook that'll make you want to come back for more, even years later. Compared to their other work, it shocks me how little this game is discussed online. I used to play it all the time as a kid from a CD before I eventually purchased it on Steam, and coming back to it reveals that despite some compatibility and scaling issues (more on those later), the core gameplay hasn't aged a day.\n\nIt feels like a Japanese arcade-puzzle game at it's core, and that's because, well, it is one. Zuma Deluxe is infamously derivative of Puzz Loop, an arcade game from the 90s that has the same basic concept and gameplay. The developers even admitted in interviews that they got the idea for Zuma by playing Puzz Loop in MAME. The emphasis on chaining, scoring, and the lives system, things that weren't given immediate gameplay relevance in other games by PopCap (you NEED to hit a certain score threshold in a level to be able to end it, more on this later) can all be traced back to the game's arcade roots, as well as the very high difficulty of later stages. It's almost an unfair comparison to make, but it absolutely puts Puzz Loop to shame. Zuma Deluxe feels like it hit the sweet spot of gameplay improvements that turned Puzz Loop into the intense, fast-paced, challenging game that it needed to be, without going into gimmick territory and turning into Zuma's Revenge. Whether it's ethical to essentially remake someone else's game and comparatively make a killing from it, even if it is vastly improved, is up to you.\n\nThe real depth of Zuma Deluxe comes from the fact that just trying to power through and go for easy clears isn't enough to survive later on when the game starts throwing in new colors to deal with. You need to get familiar with and take advantage of the opportunities for bonus points and powerups the game gives you in order to make it out alive, which gives a much greater feeling of accomplishment when completing the stage than other PC puzzle games where developing that kind of intentionality isn't so important. Setting up chains, gap bonuses, and gaps in specific areas to be able to snag coins when they show up is absolutely critical to hitting that score threshold where the chorus yells \"ZUMA!\" and stops spawning new spheres to clear. Unlike other games by PopCap, you don't have the luxury of playing at your own pace, and it can be very nerve-wracking the last few seconds where you realize that you've found yourself in an impossible position, where nothing you do can save you from losing a life.\n\nThe fact that this is almost pulled right from a game center can be a turn-off for some people, though. There's basically no story or characters to speak of here, and the fact that you need to play through almost every level four times during the arcade mode means that you'll get real familiar with every level in this game whether you like every one of those levels or not. Each time it loops, you either get a new color (for visits 2 and 3) or the speed at which the balls move increases (visit 4). You also get a new bonus level for each stage, but having to play through 5 or 6 levels of repeating content to see the next one makes the arcade mode of this game feel way longer than it needs to be. Having to play Codex of Mixtec for the 4th time in a single sitting might have been last push someone needed before they finally snapped. It seems like it would have been wise to make these different runs individual difficulty modes instead, but hindsight is 20/20. What also might have benefited from hindsight is the game's general aesthetic. I'm very nostalgic for it, but going into the future I doubt people will find it very tasteful. When I think about it too hard, it almost reminds me of the racist video slots that old people waste thousands on in casinos.\n\nGoing back to the topic of compatibility, this game came out in 2003, and released on Steam in 2006. It's not really designed to adapt to more modern computers, and while you could get lucky and not have to look up any issue or guide to have a good time, you might need to dig around the support forum or the guides on Steam, or do some Googling to get everything working 100% properly. It shouldn't be a huge challenge, but you should be aware of this before purchasing the game. Fortunately, this also means that the system requirements are some of the lowest on the platform.\n\nDespite its flaws, this game for $5 is a really good deal. If they patched it up a bit and made it a better experience to play on modern computers, it might even be worth $15. It's a diamond in the rough, and for the price, it'll be worth it even if it doesn't hook you, and you just play it for a few hours before putting it down.", "timestamp_created": 1635834760, "timestamp_updated": 1635834760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102051436": {"recommendationid": "102051436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328621834", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1697934439}, "language": "english", "review": "hardest of frog shooting balls games. double is the worst level. great game\n(P.S. thanks O Dee for unlocking my play)", "timestamp_created": 1635798221, "timestamp_updated": 1670779030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102019666": {"recommendationid": "102019666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069165778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 45532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 340, "playtime_at_review": 35580, "last_played": 1700749363}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Llevo a\u00f1os jugando a este juego y no me canso de hacerlo.\nNo solo es divertido si no que, adem\u00e1s, mantiene los reflejos y la agilidad mental", "timestamp_created": 1635760852, "timestamp_updated": 1635760852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101669840": {"recommendationid": "101669840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133136698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1667734248}, "language": "english", "review": "nostalgic", "timestamp_created": 1635265311, "timestamp_updated": 1635265311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544884383678436279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101647407": {"recommendationid": "101647407", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040076236", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1660828361}, "language": "english", "review": "can i have refund sht", "timestamp_created": 1635223041, "timestamp_updated": 1635223041, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101484346": {"recommendationid": "101484346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830215388", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "playtime_at_review": 2630, "last_played": 1699607529}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is very beautiful i will play it again and again", "timestamp_created": 1634981600, "timestamp_updated": 1634981600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101389233": {"recommendationid": "101389233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393082190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 335, "last_played": 1695783382}, "language": "english", "review": "It turns out that you can absolutely modify the entire game's appearance at your own will.", "timestamp_created": 1634823107, "timestamp_updated": 1634823107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101304001": {"recommendationid": "101304001", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078653262", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1645214889}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad, es que es una de esas joyitas que uno jugaba de peque\u00f1o, entretenido, una dificultad aceptable y niveles bastantes buenos la verdad.

So, this configuration change doesn't quit Steam interface or taking screenshots. \n- When I am going to start a new game and the screen keeps in black and \"loading\", I click on the bellow right corner, when the mouse changes its icon.

"review": "I played this game so long ago. This was one of the first games i played as a kid. Its a really simple and fun game. You have colored balls and these balls move on a set path towards a hole. You have to destroy these balls before they reach the hole or you lose. Destroying them is easy. Just match the colors. 2 blue colors are moving towards the hole and you are about to fire a blue ball ? Well fire it at those 2 same colored balls and when you hit them they will explode. They have to be the same color tho if you fire a blue ball at 2 red balls nothing will happen cuz the colors are different. You match 3 balls that are the same color. The more you match, the more points you'll get and the more balls you destroy the easier the level will be. After all balls are destroyed you'll win. Its simple.\n\n+Its a really fun, short game. Something you can play when you're bored and there is nothing else you wanna do.\n+It starts of really easy but it does get complicated as time goes on.\n\n+/- No fullscreen support. When you do open fullscreen the resolution might be wrong. Its not really needed i think playing the game in fullscreen isn't good playing it in a windowed screen is more fun and easier to use. For me this isn't a huge problem but for others this could be a problem.\n\n-The full price 10 Turkish Lira isn't really worth it.

The balls will slowly revolve until they reach the center, at which point you will lose. However, to stop the advance of the line of balls, you can fire a ball into the queue. Three balls of the same colour in a row will destroy the balls and create a gap in the line, stopping the flow of all the balls ahead until the gradual pushing of the line reaches the point at which you broke the queue. There are power-up balls which will activate upon destruction, but they don't make a massive difference until the late game where you're pressed for time. The game is not difficult.\n\nZuma Deluxe is the original Zuma. It shows its age, running at what I presume is 1024 x 768, with very basic graphics acceleration (you won't need a discrete GPU in 2021 for this), which can be turned off if you prefer the look. I think seeing the pixels at such a low resolution adds to the charm. You get one other option, which is to use a custom golden cursor.\n\nSo is it worth it? It's so cheap on sale (under a euro), that it's basically free. Is it worth playing? I mean, there's nothing amazing going on here, but it'll kill 10 minutes. Basically, it's a decent game for next-to-nothing. I wouldn't pay full price, but if you're a die-hard PopCap fan, a collector, or just really itch to play some Zuma, go for it.\n\nIn short, it's decent.

It might look easy and relaxing at first, but it is one of the most intense game you can find. On the last levels, there is no room for error, but because how RNG works in this game, most of your runs are destined to fail. Power ups do not spawn. Wrong power ups. Power ups spawn, but ball does not. Ball has an autistic tendency to be spawn the same, especially when you have nowhere to put it. You will often find yourself in situation where you are close to losing and game decides to spawn balls which you do not need or even can't place them. One green ball at the end of the chain which you can't reach? 4 GREEN BALLS IN THE ROW! In a similar matter lines are being spawned. Sometimes they come in long mono coloured lines, in other times they are mixed with only few balls to pop. \n\nGame at the highest level is all about RNG. There is something fundamentally wrong mechanically in game when you can almost double Ace time in this game and still have not a slightest idea why you lost. Sometimes you make mistakes and win, other times it is hopeless from the very start. Game does not leave you time to think, to play with smash mechanic to reverse flow of the balls. It is all about speed at which you can perform and hope for the best that game does not decide to screw you.\n\n\nAnother issue is that there is no way to come back in this game. If balls roll almost into the mouth, any other ball is likely to push them into it and you lose. This means that you can't fix your situation after a certain point.\n\n\nThis video explains the fundamental issue with Zuma and that is its RNG:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Alw5hs0chj0\n\n\n[b]In conclusion[/b] \n\nIn might be good for nostalgia trip, but there is a reason why nobody had copied this formula and it is because game is frustrating when you play it a lot. Half of my playtime is in two last levels. I played for 4 hours in 12 1-4 levels. It is very frustrating experience when you ramp up difficulty, you should just quit when game gets hard, because otherwise it will just ruin any good impression this game had.", "timestamp_created":

Stage 6 felt like it had a little more challenge added to it but still didn't please me much; I then played Stage 7 seeing that the difficulty had increased also adding another color to match (Grey), stage 7 felt like quite the challenge and luckily I got through it! Although I tried stage 8 and I was getting quite a few game over's. . .ok more than a few but I tried and tried to get passed stage 8 but the best I could manage was completing up to Level 8-3, Level 8-4 just couldn't seemed to get passed.\n\nIf talking about the story it didn't feel like if there was any story even when completing stage 3 or 6 as it was just a little bit of text and that was that.\n\nThe artwork I'd say was good, but the frog felt a tad colorless.\n\nSo In the end I would say that I don't recommend this game.\n\nMy rating on art,gameplay and story:\n\nGameplay: 7.75 /

is simple, match three balls of the same color together and get combos, chains or collect randomly appearing coins to increase the yielded score.\nThere's also a couple of power-ups which appear occasionally which can help you, such as reversing the balls movement, stopping their movement entirely, causing a big explosion which destroys its surrounding balls and an aim help which lets you shoot your balls quicker.\n\nThis game is brought down in two modes, the Adventure and a Gauntlet mode (which is pretty much a survival mode).\n-The Adventure Mode is a stage-to-stage Level Rush where you have to score a specific amount of points to stop more balls from spawning and then clear the screen to get to the next stage.\nAll this is split into multiple different worlds with more colors to appear the deeper you get.\n-The Gauntlet Mode allows you to play any stage you beat in the Adventure Mode and attempt to survive as long as you can, while attempting to score as much points as possible.\n\nOne thing I'd like to mention is the games modability, yes I'm serious!\nIf you look into the local files, you notice that most image and audio files (except of the background-music unfortunately) use default file extensions and formatting.\nThis means you can easily replace game files and inplement your own files if you want an entirely new Zuma experience!\nI cannot tell you if any format works, but as long as you covert your files into the same extension as they were in Zuma (most of them are .jpg, .gif and .ogg), it should work just fine. (atleast it did for me and a friend of mine)\nYou might want to backup your save file though prior to the modding, just in case something goes majorly wrong which forces you to re-install the game, thus as always mod at your own risk!\n\nThe only problems I have are:\n -Maximum resolution of 640x480, which you can get used to in fullscreen, but can cause trouble when playing in windowed mode. (see next point)\n-The game does not force the cursor inside the games window when you don't use fullscreen, hence you can click outside the window accidentaly and not shoot while playing. Trust me, this happens more than you'd wish!\n-I honestly believe it's not worth the full price of \u20ac5 any more. This game came out 14 years ago and its successor is avaiable for the same price, offering way more.\n\nBUT:\nIf this game IS on sale, I can only recommend this to anyone as it's a very addictive experience which first up seems very simple, but gets more complex when you get to later stages, both in Adventure and in Gauntlet.\nThe graphics are ok for its time while the music fits the atmosphere perfectly.\nEven if my playtime on Steam isn't that high yet, I can promise you my (and also my parents) time spent into this game would exceed your expectations.", "timestamp_created": 1511626687, "timestamp_updated": 1511626687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37519572": {"recommendationid": "37519572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180871375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 879, "last_played": 1604697484}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game for inbetween.

Excellent game that brings the childhood back. This game is so f***ing awesome. I remember when I used to play it in school, my computing teacher let us to play it when we had finished, this and other games, but this was special because besides I played it with my friends I also competed with them to see who was the fastest. The game didn't save up so we had to start from the beginning, but so easy the first levels. In my house I downloaded it and started to play, I was almost a whole Saturday, and reached the third temple in a very little time, obviusly I died but I never gave up. When I realized it was in Steam I put in mind to save and buy it in a near future. And now I am here playing it and remebering my childhood. This game was the inspiration that gave me to become a gamer, this was the exact game that made me to realize how much I like games and play them. Is this type of games that looks so easy to play but when you keep moving and moving forward and trough the game, the difficulty increases and so your experience and cognitive coordination of hand-eye and viceversa. I highly recommend this game to those new gamers, this turns into an addiction believe me. Until you don't finish it ou won't leave it and that happened to me, Unfortunately a virus ruined my computer and I couldn't keep playing but I still remember perfectly well this game, all the stages and the final level (which I passed only once and at the first try) and the tricks to beat it. You will never get bored of it! I assure you. I thank my teacher to show me this game and to PopCap to bring it to life, excellent work.

There is a track on the screen that has multicolored balls moving through the track.  The objective is to shoot colored balls from the mouth of the rotating frog onto balls along the track.  Once three or more colors are formed together from a ball from the frog's mouth, the balls disappear.  But watch out!  There is an end to the track!  So as your balls move along this track, if you don't lessen the line of the track, then you could easily find yourself in the losers pit.\n\nMy big deal is that I have played this game countless times before.  I didn't want to play through every single level ever all over again.  No big deal!  I played the first and second level, and the AI recognized my skill level and asked me if I would like to go to a level more fitting for my skill level.  Nothing makes me happier when a game recognizes my ability to play at a higher difficulty, and tailors itself to that difficulty.\n\nMake no mistake.  This game isn't a serious buy.
