If you're like me and have met many people but have been avoiding interction it tells you that it's okay. And there's always people like you out there who fight the good fight while being oddballs at heart.\n\nSo thank you for finidhing this game against all odds and making this one of my favourite games besides some big titles, because it moved my kokoro. So while I enjoy my virual curry and my new 3 little sisters I now take care of: \n\nI really hope you'll continue to make games. \nThis felt really well written and real. \nBeautiful art. Nice music that didn't get on my nerves.\n\nAnime was a mistake. (Armitage III and Ghost in the shell were cool tho.)\n*hugs go out to y'all* (And I usually don't hug people casually.)\nThx for this little gem. You really feel the heart and thinking that went into it. Not something you see nowadays.\n\n(Sappy text end. Go make/finish that new cool game I already put on my wishlist. You will rock this!

It's a simple game, more like a visual novel, the only way you can mess up is incorrectly mixing the drinks. Often it's very clear what to do, sometimes you need to refer back to a hint you find in the game or a character may have mentioned their favorite drink in a previous visit. The story is interesting and the atmosphere is great, but I'm not sure I like the style. I love the character developments, but I felt like there wasn't much going on. A few heavy subjects are handled, and well, but it reminded me of reading a novel versus a short story. The endings are relatively ambiguous as to the MC's future and you don't get a full picture of everyone's story, mainly hints and it's best to play the game all in one. I came back a year after just playing 2-3 days in-game and was lost, but managed to finish easily enough without restarting  although some jokes/drink requests went over my head. I was a bit frustrated with the endings, I tend to prefer a longer ending in games - even if the journey is great, I prefer endings to go out with a bang. I only played once, and actually got the bad ending but felt like just finishing the game (there are two huge bills near the end, so save up or you won't make it). The bad ending wasn't so rough, and honestly I just watched the others online and am glad I didn't replay for hours to see the others. All in all, it's a good story, possibly a replay if you really love it as it's not too long, but I probably won't replay it again - at least not for a very long time. While looking up a question I had in the game I found out there is supposed to be a sequel coming out - but that was about 3 years ago so I'm not sure what happened. I'd recommend this for someone looking for something that is cyberpunk, visual novel with frequent sexual/vulgar discussions, and simple gaming, on sale. I would not buy it full price or if you have other games that interest you first. It's not a bad game, but I did have some issues - as the spoiler below notes.\n\n\n***SPOILER/LOLITA SITUATION***\nOne reason I wouldn't buy this game if I knew what I do now. Now, I don't remember if I knew this in the beginning of the game before I took a long break and maybe it's why I stopped playing, but when I started playing again I thought a character in the game called Dorothy was a youthful looking sexbot, maybe 20ish or so who dressed in a maid costume. It is spelled out eventually that her character is \"built\" like a 10-13 year old, but has the mind of a 24 year old. I imagine her backstory is meant to make people uncomfortable and think about the subject. I almost stopped playing there because I didn't know if it was meant to be social commentary or more. It was really disturbing to read that.", "timestamp_created": 1694569419, "timestamp_updated": 1694569419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146156034": {"recommendationid": "146156034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154594516", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3543, "last_played": 1694948306}, "language": "english", "review": "one of my favorite indie games of all time.

Time and time again its warm story telling meshed with a coldly realistic taste for the setting surprised me. Its the only game Ive ever played to accurately create the feeling you get when you become kinda fond of people you see at work all the time who you kinda on paper hate even characters like Donevan who is an absolute scummy bastard managed to foster some realistic fondness just from associations.  \n\nCharacters like the sex worker Dorothy made me so emotional, her dropping work just to be with you during the worst night of the game. Or the simple power of the little bonds you can make. The realism of what being a bartender a small small ant to the bigger world and how all you meaningfully do is connect to others. Sure powerful movers and shakers are doing stuff around you, but you cant really handle that. Best you can do is show empathy, and build friendships.\n\nit also often just surprised me with what it wasn't doing. You never \"get the girl\" characters like the Idol I initially thought would sweep me off my feet and fall in love whatever like a vn simply became a friend. She has her own life, a producer boyfriend, but you listened and you cared and made a friend out of it. No more complicated than that.\n\nIt is a slight bruise on this game that with how strong and realistic a lot of the writing is, some of the writing when the game decides its time for comedy just doesn't work. The dogs are... never funny. And most tone shattering is the jokes about Sexual Assault. Which isn't inherently bad but like the setting makes it clear that the threat of sexual violence is a genuine, and real threat that every woman in the game has to be cautious off, which is a bold thing to take i love little things like that Dorothy is armed for that reason and despite being a robot refuses to be \"disassembled\" with any of her clients for safety, but often, more often than the threat is talked about in genuine ways its used as a silly like joke issue? \n\nIt just strikes as tone shatteringly unrealistic from how well the characters concerns and internality are considered in conversations. \n\nHowever this issue is never an overplayed hand and while some jokes fail to land, like I don't really get anything out of one of the dogs being a big boss reference, most of the value here, is in the empathy the story shows. Both in Jill the lead who gets to be expressive and full of character, and in the people you meet especially regulars like Alma and Dorothy.

The gameplay of mixing drinks with funky and funny names, like the gut punch or Blue fairy and many many others will forever be stuck in my head, the wonderful art style of the characters briming with life and just, perfectly representing them like Alma's design or Jill's own design, the writing that is done with such care and attention that i will remember for long long time, characters like Dorothym Alma, Jill, Virigillo, Sei, Jill, Dana and Gil, just carry a very important message about life and how it sometimes plays out, and what sometimes can be the best teacher is learning on your own mistakes and moving foward with your own life and improving yourself even if the odds you sometimes bring against yourself are against you, and the friends that you help and keep close to yourself, and trying your best to make sure they are safe and sound. Mixing drinks, decorating your room, discovering little funny refrences and secrets the game has to offer blew me away, for an indie game to juggle all these things at once and do everything at such a professional level is something i am very grateful off and amazed by, its like this game has a heart of its own, all the characters and the stories in the game brim with life and personaly experiences for us to hear out and take a giggle or consideration on. The lore of the game and the history of what happend for things to turn this way is also very great. And one of my most beloved aspects of the game is the music, few songs like \"Unemoto\" or \"will you remember me?\" made me feel a lot of emotions, the whole feature of the musicbox in the game really was a great idea. The soundtrack is amazing, every piece of the music is very well done and i find myself listening to it from time to time on spotify. The game at first may seem like a very silly goofy game but the more you look you see more and more of the games heart and the emotions it makes you feel, i personally related to characters like Jill or Dana.

Of course when it come to the cast of characters, it's really fun watching Jill interact with all of them, I especially loved her interactions with Alma.

The story is a pretty generic breakup romance story. However, the characters are the main reason as to explore the world of Va11halla further despite the boring gameplay mechanics. This is due to the fact that each of the characters have unique perspectives, eccentric personalities and they provide interesting insights to attempt and convey a different side and aspect of life in Glitch City. Unfortunately, the world building is only limited to the setting of the bar. The inaccessibility to explore the outside world bogs down the overall immersion and experience of Glitch City, where only glimpses of the exciting nightlife are shown. It is further hindered by the story-telling and gameplay mechanics where it's visual-novel esque style enclose makes the entire setting claustrophobic at times.

She is such a amazing character and her background story is a bit of mix of emotions. \nnow it not just only serving drinks to clients once you done for the day you head back to your room and you will get notifications that you need to pay rent on time otherwise you will get evicted or you can spend your hard earn money with random stuff for your apartment. you also have web applications of your phone which each day will have a different story that has happen in the city. \nnow mixing drinks in this game is a bit tricky and little confusing but once you get good understanding of the key words then you know how to make a good drink. good drink or not will lead to different end paths of the game. once you finish a certain path you can replay the game with everything you have unlocked and whatever money you had left on your previous run. \nthe game design, looks and sounds is so chill and calm. I am a Sucker for pixel graphics games as i grew up playing games that were made that way for this it looks so beautiful. \nThe music in this game is so chill i had to look it up and add it to lo-fi chill beats playlist \nNow the type of customers you get is bit mix of everything and their story backgrounds is well written. also keep in mind this game is not for children as it contains conversations involving  Swearing,  drugs , sex and violent conversation. \nyou get a person name Gillian who works with Jill also know as $#%$boy lol. there Dorothy Haze a android Sex worker, Alma

She lives in Glitch City, a place overrun with a horrible economy, terrible political management, fake and shock news, which keeps on repeating the same stories, a corrupt police body called \u201cThe White Knights\u201d (evoking either the image of something pristine, or something pretentious, as well as putting in mind the word \u201ccleansing\u201d) and other horrors, which hide unfortunate murmurs of our real world within. Her bar, VA-11 Hall-A, is like a second home. Truthfully, it may be the last one she has, as she fills her dreary nights with the company of her strange, colorful coworkers and an even more eccentric and blooming cast of patrons.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[h1]PRO[/h1]\n+ An incredible soundtrack, which you unlock more and more of overtime, and which can be freely configured (playlist-style) to your liking, in the bars jukebox\n+ An immense cast of characters, each with incredible designs, backstories and personalities\n+ Some of the greatest video game writing to have ever been put on display\n+ Impeccable displays of humor and lightheartedness, amidst the bleakness of the presented world\n+ Really fun, and simple bartending gameplay\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Multiple endings\n+ Extra content, crossovers and easter eggs\n+ QoL: dialogue skipping (ctrl), looking back on previous dialogue you accidentally skipped (tab)\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n> Pretty long, took me about 16.5 hours to complete, according to Steam (some of that was extra content and leaving the game running by accident though)\n\n[h1]CON[/h1]\n- Some minor language mistakes from time to time\n- I would\u2019ve loved to have gotten to learn a little bit more about some of the characters, though their unresolved enigma might be on purpose\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nThe door opens\u2026 the little bell at the head of the entrance chimes to signal another patron's approach. Soon a face appears in front of you. It\u2019s always a surprise, you\u2019re never quite sure whether you\u2019ll meet a new face, a longtime regular, a friend even? The possibilities are endless, and Jill seems to agree. The job provides her some freedom; the patrons provide entertainment or enthralling stories to pass the time. They also provide mirrors and catalysts for Julianne Stingray to open herself up to both her patrons, her coworkers, and the player by proxy.\nSome of these patrons will come once. Sometimes it will leave you sad, waiting for your favorite one-off patron to return, before the inevitable deflation of the credits slow, somber and yet beautifully sobering crawl. Sometimes you\u2019ll dread a patron showing up, for fear of ruining your flawless service bonus and/or pushing your buttons, after just trying to relax on a rough day. Some of the characters hide beautiful rich worlds, that you\u2019ll never fully know, because of their limited appearances. Some of them hide nothing, but vacuity and you\u2019ll see them plenty more than you\u2019d like. And yet all of them will surprise you. Thus is the power of VA-11 Hall-A.\nThe sparse gameplay elements: The bartending, the buying of items for Jill to not get distracted the next day, the clicking through forums and newspapers in your room before work, as well as a minigame, all serve to breakup some of the reading and get you back into focus, as well as to remind you of your presence in this world, of your agency as the player having consequences, on your voyeurism into these turbulent lives being real, the game\u2019s inherent virtual nature aside. The future it presents, like most of the shining examples of science fiction, is plausible, and it\u2019s that plausibility, which lends even more of a sting to the game\u2019s visceral themes and presentation, like just enough seasoning to an already remarkable dish.\nIt, admittedly, took me long, for various reasons, to get through this whole game. I took it at my own pace, much like everyone takes life at their own pace, insofar as they\u2019re given the chance to. And yet, every time the title screen flashed on, I was excited to crawl back into this rundown city, into that cozy little microcosm, hidden in one of its somewhat subterranean recesses. I worried for the characters. I laughed with them. I cried with them. And I sure as hell felt their victories.\nVA-11 Hall-A isn\u2019t a melancholic story. It\u2019s not a happy story either. It\u2019s not a comedy or a drama. It\u2019s all of them. In fact, VA-11 Hall-A might be one of the most human stories to be put to screen and keyboard, despite its Anime stylings, and many of its characters being not human at all\u2026 at least not in the biological sense.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nSometimes a gem drops into your lap. Sometimes you miss an indie release with a pretty substantial following such as this, for a long time. As I had done for years. It is, however, my sincerest pleasure to have been privy to the incredible, bespoke art of VA-11 Hall-A\u2019s skilled creators. This is an unforgettable experience, and one I\u2019m sure to come back to somewhere in my life. It turns out Julianne\u2019s mirrors, the windows into her patron\u2019s souls, staring back at her like the Nietzschean abyss, also reflected right back at me through her eyes, and may prove a catalyst for me, all the same.\n\n[h3]Thank You To Sukeban Games, Ysbryd Games And AGM Playism For Blessing Us With This Work Of Art For The Ages.[/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1688809051,

Just warning you know just in case you care. [/u] [/b]\n\nWell, well, well...been a bit since I've wrote a review, but I'm back and now full of VA-11 Hall-A (like, literally everything I could get my hands on.) So, without further, let's mix drinks and start this review.\n\n[h1] VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action [/h1]\n\n\n[h1] [u] The Story [/u] [/h1]\n\nWhile everyone in this game in a way has their own stories that get touched upon as you progress through the game. The main story with our protagonist Jill is overall a pretty nicely-paced, emotionally investing, and really solid story that covers relationships, death and how people deal with it, and what it means to be human and learning how to express one's feelings. While I'm simply outlining the themes, once you play it, you'll definitely see these themes (among a lot more) come into play. The multiple narratives with every character and how Jill's own story ties into theirs and hers is really neat and definitely is a highlight of the game.\n\n[h1] [u] The Gameplay [/u] [/h1]\n\nVA-11 Hall-A's gameplay is so iconic in my opinion and yet it's soooo...simple. I guess that's what it so iconic, it's fun, simple, yet still offers up a nice challenge for things to not get boring. It's simple enough, a customer ask for a drink, you get the right number of ingredients for the respective drink and you either mix or blend it. What's interesting is things like where you need to [i] double [/i] the ingredients for drinks sometimes and while quite a few drinks that simply need to be mixed, there are a few that need to be blended, thus you have to mix them longer for them to come out properly. It's little spices in the combinations of mixed or blending and the number of ingredients that make it so fun to mix drinks, really makes you feel like a professional drink mixer. There's also things to factor in like which drink does a customer wants and the fact that you can sometimes give customers different drinks that still satisfy them, the secret drinks that net you bonus dialogue and other potential endings (cause yeah, this game has a few of them) that also add to the game, giving replay value and even [i] more [/i] complexity to the gameplay. Definitely one of the many reasons why I love this game so much.\n\n[h1] [u] The Characters [/u] [/h1]\n\nAaaand here's one of my [i] absolute favorite [/i] parts about this game. All varied, quirky, nicely-designed, lovable (and therefore marketable, google VA-11 Hall-A Plushes for more info), and well-written. I won't go into how they all work, but all of them have charm and a lot more depth than you'd think upon first glance. While some characters have their own endings and others don't, it doesn't make the ones who don't have one any less interesting because the game does a good job over its run time fleshing out and developing a lot of the characters to where we get to see them at their highs and lows. For a game so simple and with admittedly obvious limitations, it goes above and beyond giving its characters the time of day to make a lot of them memorable and likable. I won't pick any favorites, but I have a select few who I personally love more than others, but again, I like the entire cast. Another game that's so good with its characters that I love them all is always a good thing.\n\n[h1] [u] The Sound Design [/u] [/h1]\n\nThis section will sadly be brief, as there's not much to say in terms of sound design outside of the music. In fact, there aren't really any sounds effects outside the dialogue boxes and their scrolling text sounds and some bar noises (which granted are perfectly fine), so let's get to that music!\n\nThe music, in short, for being composed all by one person (you're the goat, Garoad!) is [i] outstanding! [/i]  It's a surprisingly large soundtrack (if we account for the different releases of albums as well) and it's all really well-composed and has a lot of variety to it. Rock, Ambient, Breakcore, Chill, Noir, it's all really good stuff, so good that it's yet another game soundtrack I've listened to songs from outside of the game! Aaahh...being a nut for music is a blessing and a curse, I suppose. A++ stuff, truly. Getting to pick what songs you like from the jukebox gets extra brownie points cause I liked spicing up each day with more and more songs I hadn't listened to yet.\n\n[h1] [u] The Verdict [/u] [/h1]\n\nVA-11 Hall-A, in short is an absolutely amazing game, especially for being an indie game. It's got a great story with a lovable cast of characters, good music, absolutely great writing with both its emotional moments and its casual banter and comedy alike and it totally had won me over within the first couple hours of playing...I think my hours and the fact I've 100%'ed it should be an indication with how much I loved it and with that preface I said before all of this. I wholeheartedly recommend this game and it'd be a 10/10 for me given how much it hits all of the right places for me...also one of the people who worked on is a SUDA51 fan, so that uhh...yeah, that might be influencing me a little bit, heh.\n\nGo mix some drinks and change those lives! I'm off to play some Like a Dragon: Ishin! and Tsukihime...and probably a lot of Street Fighter 6 cause [i] good GOD [/i] is that game so good.

The mechanics aren't a big focus, the story is front and center. You play as Jill the bartender in a 2070's dystopian hole in the wall bar, with tons of anime and scifi references and call-outs. \n\nThe game is an homage to early japanese PC games, complete with a scanlines option. To me, VA-11 Hall-A felt a lot like a nintendo DS game, with bright colors, a simple but mechanically weird game system, and the chiptune-y OST.\n\nThe game is good, and quite well written. Characters gain depth as they visit the bar and slowly become regulars, and if you do well you slowly learn more about them. A big theme in VA-11 Hall-A is the expectations put on to us by others and ones we hold over ourselves, and by the end of my playthrough I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. It's well worth finishing, though completionists should be aware the game features a short, but brutal bullet-hell mini-game to 100% all the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1688520712,

Also, a reminder that life is short and to live without regrets.

Each of the numerous sideplots of the minor characters never had much of a defined arch and felt about as dull as reading about someone's shitty situation on /r/advice with no clear conclusion. Overall, story felt half-baked, with little sense of interconnection between all the characters, and it felt as though the game relied on the skin of its art to appeal to the player.

I\u2019m a fan of visual novels, and I have a few friends that like it, so at some point I considered playing. However, due to it being a iyashikei, I can\u2019t say I would\u2019ve ever played considering my taste has fluctuated a lot towards action heavy stories, and there are many other visual novels I\u2019d rather read. TSince someone gave me the game though, I was able to have one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had with the visual novel medium.\n\nThis game is soothing. Very soothing. The past few weeks have been an absolute mess in my life, a lot of stuff piled up for college and work and I had little to no free time, and the free time I did have, I invested in VA-11 Hall-A, and that might as well be the very reason I didn\u2019t get very stressed despite my environment. The atmospherization of this game is amazing, everything is so calm but at the same time fun and interesting. Every single session that I had playing this game took away any irritation or stress I had built up previous to it. I love how simple the game and its story is, but at the same time how captivating it manages to be.\n\nThe idea of a bartender, who listens to other people\u2019s stories, never knowing how they unfolded or how they ended unless the customer themselves says it, is an absolutely amazing concept. Everyone carries a different story within themselves, different experiences, emotions, etc. And we can\u2019t possibly know everything about everyone, so instead we are left to know what they want us to know: this creates relationship dynamics that start very superficial, but as characters open up, they become deeper and deeper, and you start liking each character more and more. I love how this concept works, because it always kept me intrigued wondering where things would go, how was everyone doing and when would they come back to tell me the conclusion of their personal stories. Each person that comes to the bar is a genuine and unique person, each with their own quirks and set of problems, and following along their journey on the sidelines, knowing only tidbits of what they went through, that connects you to characters a lot. \n\nVA-11 Hall-A characters are amazingly human characters in a cyberpunk dystopia. Each person feels very refreshing and has something relatable about them, something you can empathize and even see yourself into. Even if the character is a world renowned big titty hacker, I can empathize a lot with her feelings for her family. Even if the character is a privileged aristocrat that grew up with barely any hardships in life, I appreciate a lot how open minded they can be. Alma and Stella are just some of the characters that have very absurd backgrounds, but at the same time show very human emotions, thoughts and actions. And this is something recurrent in the story, everyone you come across has some crazy ass background, but at the same time very human traits, which makes the whole story feel genuine and natural. You find yourself relating to these characters or empathizing with them, and as you hear their problems, you start rooting for them and wishing they show up again as soon as possible to know if their story went well or not. I really love the genuineness of the story.\n\nBut while I can talk about the characters that come to the bar and their own stories, at the same time the MC, Jill, has her own problems, quirks and feelings too, and that\u2019s where I think VA-11 Hall-A shines the best. The story wouldn\u2019t hold itself together if all that happened was you hearing snippets of stories from strangers, but having the story being told through the eyes of a genuine human who you can connect to both in flesh and feelings, makes the whole thing more engrossing. Jill is just a plain woman, with normal human-link thoughts, emotions and actions. Seeing everything unfold through her eyes, and seeing her react to everyone around her makes you feel like you\u2019re a friend of hers, and the both of you are managing the bar. And this is even before I get started on her own personal problems, which are honestly some of the most heart touching things I\u2019ve read recently. In comparison to some characters, Jill\u2019s problems are really mundane. But through our eyes, seeing the gentle, compassionate and quirky bartender run away from the reality of her problems, regret past decisions and try little by little to move on makes for one of the most captivating stories in the game. Jill\u2019s problems are not exactly something everyone has experienced, but they\u2019re certainly something everyone is scared of experiencing and hits very close to home. Everyone is scared of fighting and breaking apart with a loved one (be it a lover or someone else) and only hearing news after said loved one dies. Jill\u2019s problems represent an universal fear of every human, and seeing how those problems drag her down after seeing her cheerful persona tugs the strings of any reader\u2019s heart. I wanted Jill to be happy so badly, I didn\u2019t want to see her suffer the death of Lenore, I wanted to be there by her side comforting her, telling everything would be okay. At the same time, seeing her go through all of that reinforced in the back of my mind the idea that I wouldn\u2019t want that to happen to me, and that created a connection so strong between us that I suffered with her, and in the end, I smiled with her reconciliation with Lenore\u2019s sister. Jill is a bonafide human confined by the chains of a virtual game, and I appreciate her a LOT. \n\nOf course, I also need to mention the amazing soundtrack. The way it lets you set the atmosphere for the day is awesome, and I really appreciate it. There is a very good mixture between calm and faster songs, and trying them all was part of the experience until I settled on a playlist I could say I enjoyed. If I have one complaint about this game, it\u2019s just that it doesn\u2019t let me randomize playlists automatically picking songs for me, but I didn\u2019t really mind trying them all manually either.\n\nA quick mention to the artstyle: it\u2019s amazing and brimming with soul, it expresses characters and their quirknesses perfectly.\n\nVA-11 Hall-A is not something I would\u2019ve played by myself. I knew the game, I had shown interest in it another time, but as I am now I would\u2019ve never given it a chance. So I\u2019m very, very glad my friend gave me this game, and after playing through it I can say I\u2019ll stop being so prejudiced against the iyashikei genre, I can see how good for the soul it can be now, and I\u2019ll definitely be more open to trying similar stuff.\n\nVA-11 Hall-A gave me a fictional world, with fictional but very human characters, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it.

This also applies to the main character - she clearly has had a lot happen to her but to me it felt like we only get to experience a couple weeks of their life.

If you're a fan of slice-of-life anime series then you'd probably like this visual novel as well. The game depicts life-twists of a young and nerdy girl named Jill (an INTP) , who acts more like a listener throughout the game rather than a game-changer. (Her only goal is to survive in lower classes of a hierarchial system with a corrupted government and law enforcement department) Therefore, expect a completely passive presence of the main character who serves drinks and tries to be as flawless as she can by soothing the chaotic situations of clients. The cool part of the story is in fact represented by the clients themselves and their various personalities. (Which some of'em won't get to a conclusion at the end and as I've read in other comments the continuation is sadly on hiatus.)\n\nMy favorite character is the lovely Dorothy Haze (ENFP) and I love how energetic, cheerful and insightful she was. So her presence kinda compensated the lack of great cliffhangers through the story for me and the boredom the main character caused me to experience ! No offense to Jill lovers out there tho!\n\nMy view on soundtracks is neutral. There is nothing cool 'bout it to mention, unfortunately. I had to skip some of'em from jukebox cause they clashed paradoxically with supposedly chill and easy atmosphere of the game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 7 outta 10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes a boring character's dramatic background!

I like it a lot.\n\nIs it perfect? Naw. I could do with a solid 10% less horniness to the whole thing, and there are certainly characters who I enjoy a lot less than others, and\u2014as is endemic to visual novels without any actual dialogue choices\u2014the player interactivity is quite low. But, let's meet the game where it is.\n\nVA-11 Hall-A is a story about a harsh world, filled to the brim with people\u2014generally working class\u2014living out their lives in a cyberpunk setting where a corporation basically owns the entire city, and rent keeps going up. They are, however, ultimately still living their lives. They have their own problems, their own lives, their own solutions, and ultimately, they feel real in an almost intangible way. It's hard for a world to make its cast feel real, but this accomplishes that (at least imo).\n\nIt's also a nerdy story which throws in jokes in every corner of the game, literally the first news story you can read\u2014one of the first things that players will see\u2014is a not-at-all subtle reference to Metal Gear Rising. There's a protracted sequence in the game where Y11K cosplayers show up and make reference to \"The Greatest Game Of All Time\" (their words not mine).\n\nIt is both of the above games, and I like them both. The game feels like it is often bouncing back and forth between lighthearted discussions of nothing inparticular with the occasional nerdy reference thrown in, and a serious, sincere story about the kinds of problems people are having now just as much as they're having 50 years in the future. It's an odd kind of comforting to see modern problems reflected 50 years into the future, because it naturally implies that we won't be so fucked 50 years in the future that stuff like family troubles, relationship drama, rent going up, and the general worry of trash bosses will still be normal, still be real.\n\nIt's a very *me* game, is what I'm trying to say. It's nerdy in the way I'm nerdy. It's serious and sincere in the ways I like reading about. If you like those kinds of stories, then I'd highly recommend this visual novel.\n\nalso, girls!!!!!! girls cute. thank for coming to ted tak", "timestamp_created": 1684250903, "timestamp_updated": 1684760774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138378923": {"recommendationid": "138378923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368073758", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 603, "last_played": 1684242430}, "language": "english", "review": "buh", "timestamp_created": 1684242043, "timestamp_updated": 1684242043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138371816": {"recommendationid": "138371816", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176128361", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1646694598}, "language": "english", "review": "Not my thing", "timestamp_created": 1684225166, "timestamp_updated": 1684225166, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345911920070648193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138365376": {"recommendationid": "138365376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396208773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1419, "last_played": 1699086793}, "language": "english", "review": "the best part of this game was being a schizophrenic bisexual bartender", "timestamp_created": 1684206690, "timestamp_updated": 1684206690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413159489631652832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138357341": {"recommendationid": "138357341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385253866", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1696062694}, "language": "english", "review": "first game that got me into visual novels\ninsanely well-written\nhas almost no gameplay, you just mix drinks, a very chill game\nbut the story is SO worth it\n[spoiler] multiple endings [/spoiler]\n\ntl;dr : buy", "timestamp_created": 1684188647, "timestamp_updated": 1684188647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138330353": {"recommendationid": "138330353", "author": {"steamid": "76561199139159323", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 919, "last_played": 1685275048}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice visuals, superb OST, and amazing characters.", "timestamp_created": 1684143186, "timestamp_updated": 1684143186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138320391": {"recommendationid": "138320391", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172206595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1146, "last_played": 1649305484}, "language": "english", "review": "fun immersive setting and vibrant characters. the gameplay is simple but feels incredibly natural. i love the ability to pick your work playlist for every section -- the soundtrack is full of bangers with immaculate synth retrofuture vibes. there's no direct overarching story;

Warhammer Fantasy Battle est\u00e1 ambientado en un mundo de fantas\u00eda medieval lleno de magia, dragones y \u00e9picas batallas entre ej\u00e9rcitos de humanos, elfos, enanos y otras razas. Warhammer 40,000 est\u00e1 ambientado en el futuro lejano y presenta tecnolog\u00eda avanzada, poderosos marines espaciales y hordas de razas alien\u00edgenas que luchan por el control de la galaxia.\n\nEn ambas configuraciones, los jugadores construyen y pintan ej\u00e9rcitos en miniatura, y luego los usan para luchar entre s\u00ed en un campo de batalla de mesa. El juego se juega usando dados para determinar los resultados de las acciones y estrategias.\n\nCon el tiempo, Warhammer se ha convertido en una franquicia masiva con una amplia gama de productos, incluidos videojuegos, novelas e incluso una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n en vivo en desarrollo.

Almost wasn't going to play it, but I gave it a shot and I loved every moment of it. From the atmosphere, the characters and their stories, the music of course, every single part of this game made me feel nostalgic as if I had already played it 20 years ago as a kid and came back to relive a fond memory. Jill and her friends are so well and realistically written (for the vast majority of the game, mind you. There's some weebyness to it too) that it wasn't hard at all for all of them to grow on me and feel as if they were my friends too. \n\nTo conclude my review, I'll semi-quote Jill on a sentiment that closely resembles my own in how I approach strangers and friends in life. Everyone has a story to tell, and I just really like listening to people tell them. This is a game about strangers, friends, and family telling their stories who live in a world that in many ways resembles our own. It's heartfelt, silly, and at times suspenseful and a little sad. But it's a story worth being told, worth listening to, and worth thinking on long after you're done in the hopes that it may affect your own personal growth as it does for the cast of VA-11 Hall-A.", "timestamp_created": 1680913972, "timestamp_updated": 1680913972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627986609935760498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136294253": {"recommendationid": "136294253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374671256", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1680886398}, "language": "english", "review": "i wish this game didn't feel so short i want to be a cyberpunk bartender forever", "timestamp_created": 1680897427, "timestamp_updated": 1680897427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517045438289642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136256981": {"recommendationid": "136256981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245823214", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 938, "last_played": 1565342720}, "language": "english", "review": "\nOverall Score:\n85/100\n\nGame Pros\n\u2022 Highly Addicting\n\u2022 Report button works\n\u2022 Frequent updates\n\u2022 Split Screen Multiplayer\n\u2022 Uncapped FPS\n\u2022 Supports In-game voice/text chat\n\u2022 Low ping (Make sure to select your region in the server filters)\n\u2022 Clean Interface\n\u2022 Cross platform (Optional)\n\u2022 Smooth Gameplay\n\u2022 Customizable cars (You can even give them hats!)\n\u2022 In-game replay recorder (Just hit \"save replay\" after any match)\n\u2022 Incredible visuals\n\u2022 Crates (Unlock valuable items using microtransactions)\n\u2022 Diversity in game modes\n\u2022 Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller, but honestly, the keyboard works perfectly.

lines and investigating every character, excited to see the next patron who enters through those hallowed doors. You've always got company or something new to jump into, even when your shift is over you'll catch yourself reading the news or random shitposts on the internet that all connect so vividly together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              There will be times when the dialogue hits close to home, and the world may not be real but it'll have you fooled as it carries itself so well-written through the voices of every equally well-developed and unique character who dares to catch themselves sitting across from you, Jill, asking for a drink at the end of their very possibly miserable day. Your job is to get them drunk, and the incentive to do it well is there. You have bills to pay, subscriptions to save up for, and your own worries to subside with the same consumerism everybody in Glitch City is mesmerized in by purchasing little doodads and thingamajigs at the end of the day, just to make life a little bit better. If you don't perform or manage your money well, you'll find yourself kicked outta your apartment and... Game over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                While the gameplay is simple, there are many ways it changes to keep your bar-tending expertise sharp. Some folks don't always know what they want, some are straight-forward and give the exact drink they want, and one guy even always asks for the same ol' big beer. The drinks are categorized by flavor, class, and name, so you can always find what you're looking for in the recipe book. It's pretty common to be able to choose from a wider variety of drinks, so you can often choose how much karmotrine your customers get. Karmotrine is the magic ingredient that results in how drunk they're gonna get, more equals drunker. Sometimes you'll see \"optional karmotrine\", so you can fix a drink with as much as it can possibly hold or as much as your willing to pour, even if that's none. Naturally, the more or less drunk the person your serving is, the ever so different the dialogue exchange becomes between Jill and whomever it is on the other side of the counter. Of course, you can even serve them a totally different drink from what they request, and they'll drink it though disappointed. The only issue is that you won't get paid for that drink, or receive your flawless service bonus. Wanna get somebody who can handle their liquor hammered? Be prepared to put the drinks on YOUR tab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Va-11 Hall-A is an absolute gem of a game that I personally adore, everything you can think of already thought of and your answers to the deeper questions around Glitch City will usually be decipherable in due time if you're memory is solid and your curiosity peaks. The regulars around town will charm you and keep you reading, never sure what strange news they'll bring to your shoddy slice of Eden next. A strange but very believable and wonderfully developed world, down to every detail. Playing Valhalla is like reading the same page of a book over and over again, but there's always something new at the end of each page, just waiting for the paper to flip itself over.

It shows such amazing promise and teases you with these interesting and unique ideas... and then does... nothing. Which is worse than just being plain bad, because now I'm disappointed. \n\n[spoilers] There's a lot of issues, like the world building losing all depth as the game goes on, or Jill's boring and distracting plot about her ex-girlfriend. But the biggest issues with the game can be summed up with the most interesting, and most terribly executed character, Dorothy. Dorothy is a sex worker robot who is designed to look like a child. This is an incredibly taboo and messed up concept, so I was really curious and fascinated to see how the game would handle Dorothy. How does she grapple with her morals, by looking like a kid for the purpose of sex work? How do other characters feel about this, or how do they feel about the society they live in, that lets robots like Dorothy thrive? How does Dorothy deal with criminally perverse clientele? Does she ever have doubts about her clientele and the morals of catering to them? When she flirts with other characters, how to they deal with a child-shaped robot flirting? \n\nThe answer the game gives us is... there is no answer. Dorothy doesn't exist for world building, she exists to make sexual innuendos, and every single other character simply doesn't address the elephant in the room that she has sex with paedophiles. You can hear the writer skirting around the topic of paedophilia in every bit of dialogue there is about Dorothy's profession. In a blog post I read from the devs, they talked about writing challenging characters from a messed up cyberpunk dystopia. But in execution, they're too scared to say anything beyond the most surface level anime poisoned fluff dialogue and jokes about dick. Dorothy eventually starts to make me uncomfortable, as I realise that she isn't there for anything other than to have a funny \"loli\" (eugh) character say sex jokes-- 'but guys, its okay, shes a robot and shes mentally in her 20s! we emphasise that so you know its okay for her to be making constant passes at you the player, and every character in the bar! this is challenging writing!' \n\nThis encapsulates what's wrong with everything in the game. Surface level, shallow, anime-poisoned writing, hinting at dark and/ or interesting ideas but too terrified of the weight of its own ideas to commit to anything TOO unsavoury or controversial, despite having a literal child-shaped robot sex worker as a prominent main character. \n\nListen to the OST but do not buy or play.", "timestamp_created": 1676594936, "timestamp_updated": 1676594936, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628211677074432373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132999197": {"recommendationid": "132999197", "author": {"steamid": "76561199438224299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1693097034}, "language": "english", "review": "THEY ARE QUEER GUYS I REPEAT THERE ARE QUEERS LETS GOOOOO", "timestamp_created": 1676591682, "timestamp_updated": 1676591682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132993476": {"recommendationid": "132993476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113176590", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1676581498}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1676583678, "timestamp_updated": 1676583678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132942170": {"recommendationid": "132942170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198453127651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1945, "last_played": 1672644932}, "language": "english", "review": "jill is literally me except i dont drink or smoke or have had a girlfriend or work as a bartender or", "timestamp_created": 1676512056, "timestamp_updated": 1676512056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132877467": {"recommendationid": "132877467", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975743849", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 875, "last_played": 1690087335}, "language": "english", "review": "So I came into this game thinking it was similar to the frenzied job simulator that is Papers Please, and that it is definitely not.

Made by a group of Venezuelans from /u/, Va-11 Hall-A is not only a tribute to their love for cyberpunk, retro Japanese PC-98 games, and yuri, but also a reflection of their life in Venezuela. You can spot many 3rd world and authoritarian regime struggle that many Venezuelans suffered in its stories that is served via its cyberpunk theme like about some guy/gal getting harassed and attacked by the military when buying groceries, extremely high prices or even shortages of everyday needs, waiting in line for hours just to get flour, or how going out at night is not safe. In Glitch City, brutality in all its forms is an everyday reality and the quality of life for the non-powerful decreases at an alarming rate and marginalization are getting wider. In Caracas, the wealth gap separates the society and, even though many marginalized communities took to the street and was benefitted from the Bolivarian Revolution during the early Chavez's regime, the whole quality of life for Venezuelans decreases at an alarming rate during the later Chavez\u2019s regime and hits the worst low in Maduro\u2019s. It's really sad how things turned out for Sukeban Games so much that N1RV Ann-A is even now indefinitely delayed due to their situations back home. Even moving to a greener pasture (some have moved to Japan, the US, and other) can't guarantee a success since they are still tied to Venezuela. Va-11 Hall-A was made frantically and the sweat and tears that were shed during its making definitely shows and filled Va-11 Hall-A with soul and shows how Sukeban Games gave zero fucks to their limitations.\n\nThe paragraph above only serves to show how lucky we are to have Va-11 Hall-A under the deteriorating quality of life in Venezuela and the struggle to make it, but they made it alright. Va-11 Hall-A is now widely known as that chill cyberpunk bartender visual novel, redeeming Venezuela's reputation from \"that country that made Crazy Bus.\" It oozes Cyberpunk style, the usual trope of Cyberpunk such as neon city, police state, artificial humans, techno dystopia, and many more can be found in Va-11 Hall-A but the devs chose to focus on a more mundane setting, not a detective or runaway android but a bartender. That decision opens up a more down-to-earth themed cyberpunk story where the focus is not the world but the people. The writings and visuals of Va-11 Hall-A is amazing and was the creation of two friends, Ferfer [?] or Ironiclark (Fernando Damas) and kiririn51 (Christopher Ortiz). Both of them managed to create one of the comfiest yet engaging cyberpunk experiences and every part of the game correlates with each other, from its user interface to the dialogues, all of them really screams cyberpunk. The theme is cyberpunk, a genre that can demonize many kind of people, a genre where people always suffer, a genre that is known to be a story about dystopias, a genre that inspired from the worries of rapid industrialization, technological development, and capitalist insanity, and yet Sukeban Games manage to portray how the people stay positive from its characters and their interactions that never conform to the cyberpunk stereotypes even though they seem to follow the stereotypes on the surface.\n\nFor me the strongest part of Va-11 Hall-A\u2019s narrative is not its story, but its characters and their interaction with the world. Ferfer [I\u2019m not really sure what nickname to use, should it be Fernando?] managed to make a really intriguing cyberpunk experience by balancing plot and gameplay while also giving depth to the characters. I don\u2019t know if the characters were written first by Ferfer or were designed first by kiririn51 but all of them are perfect. I won\u2019t go into detail about the characters but the main protagonist, Jill Stingray, and her friends, colleagues, and clients are an interesting bunch with different perspectives of life and slowly we\u2019ll see their problems and secrets. Some characters seems to be your typical cyberpunk character and some are an interesting reflection of Venezuelans or the writer\u2019s personal experience but they don\u2019t shove their character themes to your face since Ferfer always put somekind of depth into the character or balances things out to move away from stereotypes. The dialogue and the interactions between characters are great although it can be annoying at times but it is nice and engaging to read. Now, the gameplay experience can be underwhelming since it\u2019s really simple. Hell, I even have a more engaging and fun experience of mixing drinks in Space Station 13 than in Va-11 Hall-A. But the bartending mechanic had to be there to enhance the experience and even though it is simple, Ferfer successfully incorporates it to the world and story, you\u2019ll appreciate if you see the ingredients and its explanation. You\u2019ll mix drinks and change lives, including Jill\u2019s. The story isn\u2019t something groundbreaking, and some might even don\u2019t find the idea of reading it entertaining, but I was definitely invested into the story.\n\nAgain, the characters are the best part of Va-11 Hall-A and that is also because of kiririn51 character designs that are really beautiful with many defining features. Humans and their artificial limbs, the artificial humans, brain in a jar, all screams cyberpunk though with a moe twist. You could also see the retro/PC-98 VN inspired artstyle, not only in the characters but in the overall artwork and the user interface. They managed to align the art and the narrative and which shows how the final product is a labor of love, not surprising since the game design and original concept was the work of Ferfer and kiririn51. CALICOMP, Jill\u2019s Room, DANGER/U/, and all other part of the game evokes futuristic yet cozy vibe. You\u2019ll be in the dark for most part of the game so I\u2019ll recommend playing it in the dark.\n\nAnd then who can forget the official soundtrack which for many are the best part of the game. Garoad (Michael Kelly) crafted a very nice compilation of chill retro-synthwave inspired soundtrack and I believe he was inspired by other video game composers like Ryu Umemoto and Shoji Meguro. You are in control of choosing the songs before bartending and they will accompany you throughout Jill\u2019s shift. I still listen to the OST from time to time after years of playing, my personal favourite is Nighttime Maneuvers and I think track 1-4 should always be combined together when listening to the soundtrack.\n\nI really enjoyed Va-11 Hall-A and my 2nd playthrough of it was still really comfy, playing it drunk even immerses you more into Va-11 Hall-A. Grab a drink, position yourself as comfortable as possible, and turn up the volume because you are definitely in for a ride. Sukeban Games is a really small game studio comprised of a group of friends with similar interests trying to share their passion to the world and they deserve the success. If you read the credits of Va-11 Hall-A you can see how small the number of people that is involved in the making of Va-11 Hall-A. I believe they are currently in a unfavorable situation but they are still posting updates and their works.

I remember this one time where there was this shareware version of a flash game called \"Last Call\", where you'd play the role of a bartender. The patrons were really unique, and not only you'd have to worry about mixing and serving them the right drinks, but you'd also have to be careful to check their IDs to see if they were legal or not\n\nThat said, when I looked this game available for sale, I was instantly transported back to that time. Well, at least before I actually installed and tried it, because it wasn't so hard to realize that there were many different aspects available\n\nFirst of all, rather than just being a plain simulator experience, this is a cyberpunk themed visual novel, which also has a bartender mechanic, therefore adding some variety to the work. In other words, besides the standard system of simply selecting what phrases you're going to say, every now and then you also get to mix drinks for your customers. Most of the time they're straightforward about their orders, but of course, there's always an exception to that rule\n\nThe protagonist that you control also has a personality of her own, and she constantly interacts with the customers, boss and coworker listening to their ramblings and learning about their stories. In the beginning I didn't really get some things about her, but as the story moves forward things get a bit clearer. Instead of having to deal with a set number of missions to complete, the \"adventure\" provides a certain amount of days before the game is over. You can use the money that you receive by the end of your shifts to buy stuff to decorate your bedroom\n\nThe graphics, soundtrack and sound effects are pretty neat, as they really help to create immersion, which is definitely the mood that one could go for while playing this kind of genre. Some achievements can be missed and they can be a big annoying to get, especially if you need to start all over from scratch; my point being that despite having the option to skip the texts that you've already been through before, you still need to deal with the customer's orders.

You hear people constantly talking about the city going to crap and you get the hints of a big incident involving the local megacorporation, but you don't see anything of it, nor it has any direct impact on the protagonist's life. They might as well have this set during the Prohibition era and nothing would've really changed. Some of the characters aren't even all bad, but they all share the same level of shallowness in their writing. They're cardboard cutouts with a bare hint of backstory - and not all of them even got it. Throughout all the game you have the feeling that something is yet to happen, but it never does, and the ending is open in the sense that things will go on more or less like before, with just some little personal realization on the protagonist's part. You know, the classical \"I have to change my life somehow\" stuff, albeit we don't really know how. Both anticlimatic and disappointing, to say the least.\n\nOh, and the protagonist sees some kind of cybernetic ghost every now and then, but it's never explained why or who she actually is.

I love pixel graphics like this and the color palette of dark purples and blues contrasted with neon pinks is perfect. The effects are neat and I love the little touches like the changing TV screen and the Metal Gear codec call-style screen that comes up when you're talking to someone outside the bar. Even the drink mixing interface that you spend most of your time staring at is visually appealing. I really like the look of this one, and I cannot overstate it, because it's a huge reason as to why I got this game.\n\nAnd then there's the writing.\n\nThe setting of the game is pretty clear: Glitch City is unambiguously a horrible place to live if you're not rich. This is reinforced over and over in every aspect of the game, from the corporate chokehold on the city's government, down to in-universe forum posts about standing in line for hours for milk and bread. This isn't implied, it is outright stated that Glitch City is awful to its poorest citizens.\n\nAnd yet, there's a lot of wishy-washy dialogue about how corporations and class divides and the ultra wealthy aren't so bad, actually. When one character refuses to discuss classism with a rich person, they're framed as being a sore loser who just can't handle having their views challenged. When far-reaching corruption is found within a company-run police force because [i]of course it is[/i], our only interaction is through a sympathetic good cop character, who admits to having ignored the corruption because she loved her job so darn much.\n\nIt's bizarre and so jarring how this comes up again and again. And it's not a matter of clashing opinions between bar patrons, it's the way the narrative itself treats these instances, and how neutrally our financially destitute POV character interacts with the world. I can't speak to the real experiences of the devs but it feels like when someone who has never been impoverished tries to write about poverty. It just rings hollow.\n\nThat's not enough to get a negative review from me, however. Sometimes you just don't click with a game's worldbuilding. That doesn't make it a bad game, no matter how confused and at times exasperated I am with its writing.\n\nBut then came the bullet hell shmup mini-game. The one that you have to win to complete the game. Nothing, and I mean [i]nothing[/i], about modern game design makes me angrier than this. I detest this trend of sticking a mini-game into your game that's entirely different from the main game and requires an entirely different skill set and you have to beat it to 100% the game.

I would have wanted the game to be a bit longer but the ending stops at a good point. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game if you like an immersive look into bartending in a cyberpunk city.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672505671, "timestamp_updated": 1672505671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129779842": {"recommendationid": "129779842", "author": {"steamid": "76561199151283481", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1672646033}, "language": "english", "review": "If there is one game that absolutely every person on this depraved rock needs to play, it's this one.", "timestamp_created": 1672496599, "timestamp_updated": 1672496599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542546391487121582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129772721": {"recommendationid": "129772721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193826307", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 937, "last_played": 1672489836}, "language": "english", "review": "ended and reviewed the game in the 31st december,best experience ive ever had\n\nthis visual novel is rly creative,rather than doing choices,you get choices with drinks you serve", "timestamp_created": 1672489965, "timestamp_updated": 1672489965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129765682": {"recommendationid": "129765682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139254531", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1589427711}, "language": "english", "review": "i wish gay people were real", "timestamp_created": 1672482314, "timestamp_updated": 1672482314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129754621": {"recommendationid": "129754621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056555410", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1568774652}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommend playing this around Christmas/New Year's Eve.

But as I was playing the game longer and longer, the immersion starts to kick into me. Characters are more alive and have in-depth characteristics than I expected them to. I expected the whole game is telling a story, but the characters themselves are the stories of the game. And I like that a lot, most of the characters have problems that people in real life will have. About families, friends, work, society, and relationships.\n\nWhen I play to the part where Jill met [spoiler]Gabby, her ex's sister. And telling Jill that her ex-girlfriend passed away due to a heart disease that worsened right after they argued. And Jill felt great guilt and was depressed about that until about the end of the game.[/spoiler] This hit me hard because I was in a similar situation as Jill, and I couldn't say anything more than I can really, really feel relatable to the character of the game. \n\nThus I wish I could play this game early to know about my complexity of myself, but wish to not play it too soon or finish the game so early because I think I'm not as brave as Jill, and I still not yet have overcome this problem. But, anyway, if you want to play a chill game and maybe have some problem in your life that you are struggling with, check this game out.

"playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1675946698}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is awesome\n\nI wish Bartenders are real\n\nEdit: So I finally completed the game to 100%, got ALL achievements including the infamously hard Model Warrior Julianne, and I figured, f\u00fcck it, time to actually make a proper review.\n\n[h1]So... what is VA-11 Hall-A?[/h1]\n\nWell, to put it simply, it's a Cyberpunk themed game where you play as Jill Stingray, a bartender in the BTC Certified bar coded VA-11 in the Alpha hall. Or simply, VA-11 Hall-A. You serve drinks to newcomers and regulars alike and chat with them, trade stories and perhaps discover some secrets spreading throughout the corrupt place named Glitch City.\n\nYou have 5 ingredients to make drinks out of, and you can make it aged or \"on the rocks\" (aka iced). Optionally, some drinks may say \"Optional Kamotrine\" (AKA the ingredient for alcohol) and you may choose to either keep it alcohol free or to spike it up REAL HARD to the point where certain customers may get drunk. There are also bottled booze that you can serve if you feel like it fits the order of some customers, and even a certain secret drink that could summon secret clients if you serve them to the right people. \n\nSo, this game being a visual novel, where is the \"visual novel\" part of this? Well, apart from obviously listening to customers tell their stories, serving drinks that either isn't their order or one that fits into someone's \"get me a whatever drink\" could lead to different conversations happening. And believe me, replaying this game and finding different convos is a treat. Why? Because you LOVE to hear from these characters.\n\nWhich brings me to the next part of the review. The characters. The bar may not be a massively popular place for people to be in, but the ones who do come in will be one of the most unique, fun and exciting people to see. People of varying age and personality will come and make sure that you remember them. Hell, some of them will regularly come back to the bar to the point where they'll have their own \"the usual\" type of drink.\n\nDon't worry; there is an actual story to the game and it's not just a couple hours of serving people drinks and listening to them. While I won't discuss what happens in the story, I'll say one thing for sure: You'll get sad. But in the end, you'll smile.\n\nAnother thing to note: the soundtrack is a BANGER. Garoad, the composer of the music made one hell of an OST that WILL stay iconic for decades. Synthwave, City Pop, and house/trap combined into one ass kicking album. Garoad, if you're seeing this - I LOVE YOUR SONGS!!!\n\nThe aesthetics are great as well. It feels like you're playing an old 80s/90s PC game, with how sometimes the game goes on slideshow mode and purposefully slows down some animations for a bit of nostalgia feeling. Oh and pixel graphics. I love em as well and it adds to the experience.\n\nThe only downsides in the game? Probably only two major things and one minor nitpick; \n\n[b]Major problems:[/b]\n\n1. In my experience, it took me around 12 hours to finish the game once. Sure, it might seem quite a while for a story, but believe me, once you interacted with the characters, you NEVER want it to end. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that wishes we got more time with the patrons in the bar. But then again, there is a story to be told, and in the end, a story's gotta end in the right pace.\n\n2. Model Warrior Julianne. Don't worry; this is not a spoiler by any means, but G\u00d2DDAMN. It's a minigame that Jill can buy for her apartment, it's a bullet hell shoot-em-up with the simple objective of surviving waves of enemies and destroying the final boss, and you have 3 lives. What's the problem?\n\nTHE DEVS DEFINITELY DID NOT PLAYTEST THE MINIGAME.\n\nBullet Hell? MORE LIKE COMPLETIONIST HELL. Anyone who's going for a full 100% run WILL tell you that this minigame is the last achievement anyone goes for and is the hardest. I don't even know how to describe it. It's the Dark Souls of Bullet Hells, there's no I-frames and if you die there's no checkpoint. Goodbye b\u00ectches, go back to the starting point!\n\nIs it impossible? Nope. Is it gonna make you want to blow your brains out? Yep.\n\n[b]Minor nitpicks:[/b]\n\nYou can't play this game in full windowed mode. Sure, technically NO ONE does that, but I do it so I can stream the game to my friends with audio, and you could only stream a small window if you wanna do that. Oh well, whatever.\n\n[b]TLDR:[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n- Simple yet fun gameplay\n- Great story and characters\n- Awesome UI/aesthetic \n- Banger soundtrack\n- Best Boss (aka Dana) :D\n\n[h1]Cons: (not including the nitpick):[/h1]\n\n- You'd wish the story is longer\n- Model Warrior Julianne could go suck a d\u00ecck\n\nWhat rating do I give this game?\n\n[h1]9/10.[/h1]\n\nAs the game itself says in the beginning, get some food or drinks before playing. It's a hella chill experience.\n\nSukeban Games and Garoad - Love yall, and hope that your future projects goes hella well - including N1RV Ann-A!

It's a visual novel with a bar-tending backdrop. The bar-tending mechanics are extremely simple. The hardest it will get is when a patron will give you a vague description of what they want, leaving it to the player to interpret what the correct drink is. There's no timer for making the drinks. You can fail as many times as it takes to get the right drink out. There is a money mechanic where Jill has to pay rent along with purchasing items stay happy, but I haven't run into [i]any[/i] issues making money and staying above the poverty line.\n\nThe laurels of this game rest [u][b]HEAVILY[/b][/u] on the quality of the writing and characters, which thusfar, have been good. It's of particular note to me that unlike a lot of games where you experience the story first hand, in Valhalla the 'story' happens to other characters, who then bring the world and story to you. Jill (thusfar) doesn't interact with the world where things happen, she interacts with customers who show up to Valhalla and present their stories to her.\n\nI'll update this review as I progress farther into the story, because the quality of this game rides so heavily on the story and characters it presents. All the characters I've met thusfar have been unique and well-written enough that you could show me a picture of them, and I could give you their name and bullet points on who they are and how they behaved.\n\nThey music is varied and pretty good as well.

Maybe this helps some people with the same problem which would be great because:\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing. I love the writing. I love the look. I love the references. I love the music.\nThis game is just a perfect example of not needing very complicated mechanics to be fun while also bringing some element of freshness with the drink mixing system. It's so chill, just what I needed to calm down after a day of writing a paper for university.\nExcept the minigame.

The music is fantastic too.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively simple. Before work you can read stories about the world and the setting you live in. When you go to work, you will do what bartenders do: talk to people and take orders and mix drinks. There is a lot of adult humour and general sarcastic humour. There are a lot of references to old movies and literature.\n\nAfter reading all the dialogue/monologue of the characters I started to relate to a lot of them and felt touched by their stories.\n\nThe topic of sexual relationships and common problems involved in them are discussed a lot. The majority of the characters seem to be either bisexual or homosexual (or simply not mentioned). The problems of these relationships are exclusively portrayed to be arguments and such.\nHeterosexual relationships are also explored though much less so, and more often than not the hetero relationships are portrayed in a very negative light, lots of cheating, lying, abuse, and even borderline paedophilia (a bar regular, a sex-worker robot, is apparently designed to appear 10-13 years old) is mentioned.\nSo this is my warning to anyone reading this: the topics in the game can be quite dark and if that offends you or makes you feel uneasy you might not like it.\n\nAlso there's lots of cute dogs.", "timestamp_created": 1669903316, "timestamp_updated": 1669903316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127658514": {"recommendationid": "127658514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421670481", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1670024428}, "language": "spanish", "review": ":)", "timestamp_created": 1669848802, "timestamp_updated": 1669848802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127654519": {"recommendationid": "127654519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188943458", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 474, "last_played": 1690985086}, "language": "english", "review": "great game to play", "timestamp_created": 1669843425, "timestamp_updated": 1669843425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127648409": {"recommendationid": "127648409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118236467", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1669934758}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Nunca pens\u00e9 que escuchar a los clientes darte la chapa mientras trabajas fuera divertido.\n", "timestamp_created": 1669836159, "timestamp_updated": 1669836159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127601912": {"recommendationid": "127601912", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066085137", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 473, "last_played": 1670603134}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cYo, boobtender\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1669773197, "timestamp_updated": 1669773197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127554489": {"recommendationid": "127554489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863740443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1863, "last_played": 1659569901}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved it!

There is something major going on in the background, but your character is just an observer, like many others. It is actually more of just witnessing how different characters, which happen to be your clients, with different backgrounds, interact with each other, and go through their own lives\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, there is no time limit or anything, so game is pretty easy and not challenging. You don't get to pick lines for your character, you only influence story through choice of drinks you serve. Not controlling what your character say might seem off-putting, but honestly it is not bad thing in this case, dialogues for main character are as much written as any other character, so it's more watching multiple stories from perspective of one character, which has their own issues too.\n\nArtstyle, atmosphere, setting, music, gameplay, whatever you find in this game attractive, is just a nice bonus, a pretty wrapping. What actually makes this game unique and stand out from others and worth appreciating it for is well written dialogues. You will get to see characters talk about their personal issues, going through different problems, and some advices they say, or words of comfort, are genuinely decent things, or good thoughts worth thinking about. It is not something very deep, but perhaps there is something you will find yourself relate to, maybe some of those words is what you need to hear\n\nIf that sounds appealing to you, then it's time to mix drinks and change lives.", "timestamp_created": 1669499815, "timestamp_updated": 1671323160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127106295": {"recommendationid": "127106295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168090531", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1669499350}, "language": "english", "review": " I LOVE alcohol and Dorothy...", "timestamp_created": 1669499447, "timestamp_updated": 1669499447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127074128": {"recommendationid": "127074128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799301949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1669478801}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a phenomenal experience.

I found it to have a very deep and entertaining story that I could not take my eyes of the screen. It also features an awesome soundtrack that fits well with enviroment.

Jill Stingray is simply the best bartender you could ask for, she's charismatic, beautiful, skinny and gothic and knows how to deal with any kind of people who enters through VA-11 Hall-A doors. Then there's the badass, white-haired, wrestling champion, owner of VA-11 Hall-A, Dana Zane. I could tell from the begining that she was going to be my comfy character. Next is the cat boomer, best girl and owner of my heart Stella Hoshi. When Stella first came into picture I was like \"yeah, that's her, she's definitely my waifu and no one will take her place\", she's kind, cute, stunning  and care a lot about the people in her life. I also need to mention our big tits blonde hacker Alma Armas, which I fell in love since she appeared on the screen, she may be the best friend one can ask for. \n   There are a lot of other awesome characters in the game but this ones are special to me. Oh and I was almost forgetting about Gil, well what can I tell you guys about him? He's a....hmm...well he's.... I guess no one knows who he is, but one thing I can say for sure, he's definitely a bartender in VA-11 Hall-A.[/i]\n\n[h1][i] Conclusion [/i][/h1]\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[i]    From now on this is going to be my comfy game.

It took me about 16 hours to beat the game which I found it to be a nice amount of time for a VN.

maybe it's just because i don't play many visual novels, but the conversations always felt very real (or at least as real as a cyberpunk game can get). i also really adore the mini social media experience we get in between shifts; reading the articles and especially the forum posts is so entertaining and helps establish the world even more. \n\nthere is also the drink making aspect, but it feels like such a small part of Va-11 Hall-A as a whole that it's barely even worth mentioning. there's nothing really astounding or unique about it, though it does help break up any monotony the player might be feeling from reading so much text. it can get a bit tiresome at some points to go through the motions, but it never gets annoying by any means. there's also a few general \"choices\" you can make based on the drinks you serve, which can unlock certain endings with characters.\n\ncouple of little shout outs: the music is SO awesome. garoad is a mf genius. every track is a banger and fits the atmosphere so well. genuinely one of the best game osts i've ever heard. \n\nthe main character, Jill, is a fuckin' legend and i adore her. she's super grounded, almost to the point of being a sort of \"straight man\" to the other character's eccentricities, but it works really great and makes her super relatable to see through the eyes of. they've written her so well; there's never a reaction or dialogue she has that feels weird or nonsensical. she's funny and charming and goes through some really wonderful character growth. \n\nactually, for that matter, all the characters are written really great, especially the women. there are some less-likable folk that populate the bar from time to time, but there's never really any character that i hate seeing. each of their unique experiences come together to create a wonderfully cohesive view of a futuristic city rife with corruption and an odd charm. \n\n\n\nok, end of review: i really can't recommend this game enough. it has this certain vibe that is totally unmatched and unique to anything else i've played. there are moments in this game that have genuinely moved me, and i am completely fascinated by the universe that has been so lovingly created. i'm so excited for the sequel. please get this game!!!", "timestamp_created": 1668252696, "timestamp_updated": 1668252696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125316308": {"recommendationid": "125316308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198265520114", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3278, "last_played": 1692818858}, "language": "english", "review": "waifu bartending 4ever", "timestamp_created": 1668202296, "timestamp_updated": 1668202296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125308668": {"recommendationid": "125308668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198928525606", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1699720900}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE this game, charming characters, fun and unique game play with the neat bartender action, and the art and music is great too, I haven't finished it yet but I look forward to it.", "timestamp_created": 1668191831, "timestamp_updated": 1668191831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125228968": {"recommendationid": "125228968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119706891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1659900724}, "language": "english", "review": "The music and the story telling of this game will make you enjoy the lack of game play that it doesn't have.\nI recommend not looking for any online guide to get the most out of each character.", "timestamp_created": 1668047338, "timestamp_updated": 1668047338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125192041": {"recommendationid": "125192041", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998468467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 620, "last_played": 1670122923}, "language": "english", "review": "There's something here with the cool and stylish music and visuals, a great launching point for fan artists.

Is Jill Stingray, who experiences the future through the grapevine while seeing and experiencing almost nothing beyond the drudgery of her day job and who is behind the curtains given a voice by a man with a chiseled jawline, evidence of the moral imperative to hire 15 writers and 10 consultants on all creative projects and price indies out of the market by badgering them to do the same?

I have only good things to say about this game.  \n\nGraphics - Reminiscent of the PC-98.  If that doesn't tell you anything, then look at the screenshots in the store.  That's what you're getting.  While everything is smooth and spiffy for current day computer enjoyment, you can still apply oldschool scanlines in the settings if you want.  \n\nStory - For 18ish in-game days, a bunch of robots, lgbtq+ people, and talking corgis hang out at a back-alley bar and talk about life in the equivalence of Neo Detroit.  Jumbled together in pieces over the game are a few different character stories, main character story, and through it all you need to raise enough cash to pay rent.  \n\nEndings - There's more than one ending.  I originally got the bad ending and I was not disappointed.\n\nAchievements - There are a bunch of achievements.  You get an achievement for starting up the game a second time.  Do Eet.  \n\nHidden Stuff and Keyboard shortcuts - VA-11 Hall-A goes the extra oldschool mile by having a few hidden things.  Hidden drinks, hidden characters, and stuff you just want to find to round out the experience with extraness.  There are also keyboard shortcuts that aren't explained out in game (as far as I know).  I found them when I went to the guides.  The most important one is qwerty +/- shift can manually add or remove ingredients from a drink for when you mess up and don't want to waste.  Now you know.\n\nOptional Bonus Stuff - The game has an optional prequel of what happened for three days before the game, as well as an optional prequel for one of Jill's weirder customers.  \n\nMusic - Best music.  Ever.   They aren't selling it on steam so I went to the developer's store and ordered it on CD.  This happened sometime in the first 4 hours of playing.  Was unprepared for how much I love the soundtrack.  I listen to it while I drive, work, and chill out.  \n\nBooze - The atmosphere in the game reminds me of bars I've gone to, but with extra future bits.  It made me want to drink.  This could be good or bad depending on how you interpret.  Being the bartender, I got characters drunk instead.  \n\n\n\nVa-11 Hall-A is worth it.  If you like VNs, bars, corgis, androids, cyborgs, cat people, booze, good music, and 90's scifi anime, you have no reason not to buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1666626252, "timestamp_updated": 1666658948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633693873882293701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124324349": {"recommendationid": "124324349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286299411", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 754, "last_played": 1667849744}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bar in a dystopian cyberpunk universe.

While I was making him soup, I got a call from my twin\u2019s high school, telling me that they wanted to speak with me, and that my daughter had received 3 days of ISS for a bullying incident. Because of my son\u2019s sickness, I spoke through them via phone and they told me everything that had happened, my daughter and a group of her friends was picking on a boy for wearing a crop top, the boy told the teacher, she asked them to stop, when they didn\u2019t stop, she sent them to the office. After talking to the boy, he admitted the bullying was going on for a few days, and that they kept bothering him when he asked them to stop.\n\nMy daughter and son came home and my son\u2019s face was bright red. I told my daughter to go to her room and then sat down with my son to see if he was okay. Apparently the boy she bullied was a close friend of his, one of his football teammates. The boy was talking to my son and their other friends and said something about how he thought it was cool that some men used to wear sports crop tops. The boys told him if he thought it was cool, he should try it. The boys went out and bought some jerseys from the thrift store and made them into crop tops.\n\nI then spoke to my daughter, she didn\u2019t show much remorse and was dismissive of me, last year she also got in trouble for bullying someone bc of clothing, she\u2019s also gotten in trouble for racism at school (very white area, we are white, her and her friends were saying racist stuff in class). When my wife got home, we discussed a punishment and agreed on not buying her new clothes for a while, she has plenty of good clothes already.\n\nThis weekend, we went to visit my brother. My brother lives around 3 hours away in a small town and we don\u2019t see him often. This week was the town\u2019s annual fair. At the fair, they had booths from local businesses.\n\nOur oldest son went to the booth with antique sports stuff and then the book booth to get books on sports history (son loves reading those), our 12 y/o got some plushies and toys and our youngest was looking at video games.\n\nOur oldest daughter went to the clothes, I stopped her and told her the rule was still in place. I said she could buy books, a video game, candy, ect, but clothes were the one thing she could not get. She was bugging my wife and my wife eventually told her she would reconsider it, she then talked to me and I told her that I wasn\u2019t changing my stance because I am letting her buy other stuff and I thought she was being entitled, my daughter didn\u2019t buy anything and my wife thinks I was too tough on her.

I mean I enjoy anime and manga but never started walking the path of VNs. \n\nAnyway ! I'm enjoying this game. Very casual, very light and easy to follow. You will encounter customers from all walks of cyberpunk life, along with topics that cover a broad spectrum of things - and there is a lot covered ! The drinks making element is super simple. I think this game is all about the world building and painting that grim (or not) vision of the future which is largely contributed by a sprinkling of varied and interesting characters that all have something to offer the story.\n\nGraphics are right up my street as I love the nostalgia of pixel art and scanlines. Music is above average and also quite nostalgic of 90's anime tv series imo.  Speaking of which I did spot the Bubblegum Crisis reference via a character name - this really made me smile as I adored that series.

I've been carrying on because a friend of mine told me that it is worthy to finish it as a whole, but still... It left me a distasteful mouth\n\nThe story also lacks excitement or something that grabs your full attention.

It's in the title! Jokes aside, the bartending is basically just following a recipe and doing specific things to make drinks. It's not in depth or anything but a nice thing to break up the reading since this game is entirely a VN. \n\n[h2]Story:[/h2]\nCharacters are great, setting is interesting, lots of extra stuff to read in the section before the day starts as well as tons of dialogue variations that make each playthrough slightly more unique than the last since there are some orders that you have to interpret yourself that changes dialogue. There's also multiple endings. [b]Do keep in mind that this is NOT a game where your choices matter.[/b] What you do does affect what dialogue you get but it has no real consequences aside from not seeing extra character scenes or losing money.\n\n[h2]Presentation:[/h2]\nGood art style, good music (you can set up your favorites at the start of the day, skip forward etc thanks to the jukebox). Overall very good presentation. \n\n[h2]Playtime:[/h2] \nNot very long depending on how fast you read. Looking for round 10 hours for a casual playthrough trying to finish the game and see every ending, longer if you want to see every single dialogue variation (there's a ton)\n\n[h2]Postgame/Extras:[/h2]\nAside from getting the extra endings and achievements, there's a 3 day? prequel alongside a slight prologue after you finish the main story that are basically extra content to read and explore.

It was a wonderful and very memorable time.\n\nThis is NOT your average visual novel type game. I'm not usually into the genre, but something about the aesthetics and the unique drink mixing mechanic really make this game special. There is even a fair amount of replay value due to the different possible interactions and endings. Currently I am working on finding all the secrets (alone) but I'm still enjoying my time.\n\nNeedless to say, I am very excited for the sequel. Whenever it does come out.

You see, on my journey to the center of the earth [located 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (undressing)] I came across a man with a scraggly beard and a penchant for the wicked. He reached into his loins and handed me a dirty 10 quid, which I begrudgingly accepted. Now just between you and me, 10 quid is a lot of moolah. So much moolah that all the cows went \"moo lah lah\" in unison like a choir of twinks. The winning lottery numbers are 24, 14, 58, 2, 38, and 5. I spent the 10 quid on a fresh ride. I'm talking 5gum levels of fresh. Even the people from Pimp my Ride were baffled at how dripped out my whip was. It was so dripped out that they couldn't even pimp it. Anyways back to what I was originally talking about, do Rice Krispies Treats even have a slogan? They definitely don't, right? Which is weird considering they're so popular. And the 3 twinks that are always on the boxes? Don't even get me started on them. If I have 10 cans of Axe body spray and I give 4 of them to my friend Bartholomew, what do I now have? That's right, bad taste. Or is it bad smell? These are the kinds of questions that philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, and Eric Carle have been thinking about for centuries, because they have all lived that long. That begs the question, is Eric Carle still alive? It feels like he published one book and then disappeared off to Narnia, no doubt to find the answer to the moral quandary. Long story short, I was able to bypass the first layer of the quadlock, but I was stumped at the second and the third. The fourth was slight work, since I had acquired the peanut of truth and prosperity. In the middle of the pocket laid a hand made of flesh and bone, but it was not human. No, it was the flesh and bone of an animal. How could it have a hand in this?\n\nSometimes when I look into the mirror I see myself, but sometimes when I look into the mirror I see myself.", "timestamp_created": 1660270609, "timestamp_updated":

This game is defenitely cyberpunk, but I am not really sure about the visual novel thing. It is not a regular VN. From what I know, you cannot do anything else than serve drinks. That's how the game decides what ending you get and what conversations you take part in. You don't get to choose the things your character says. All the characters you encounter are pretty interesting and the story is quite deep once you know the context. It's a pity that reading the news does practically nothing. It would be great if it could unlock a new customer or something like that. The act of serving drinks is fun and I like that you sometimes may choose the drink you serve on your own or decide whether you want to get your customer drunk. The plot is amazing overall and the graphics are beautiful (it's pixels, duh..). And the music! Every time you get to work, you choose some songs in the jukebox that play throughout the conversations. There are many achievements you can try to get. There are also multiple endings, and so there's some replay value too! That's it.

Some, I like more than others, but that's more for you to judge, I personally didn't like Donovan that much, tho it's just made for that regard, I guess.  \n\nBottom line is: Buy it, it won't ever go

I got a lot of internalized misogyny from Alma's plot arc, and the existence of Dorothy as a character herself was very strange and uncomfortable for me. That may have been the point of that, though. \n\nThose things aside, a lot of the characters were very interesting and had a lot of dimension to them, so much so that I played the game fully and am considering an NG+ run to get the full picture of things and try to get all of the achievements. After my first play-through and as of writing this review, there are some things I'm curious about that I would like to know more about that weren't fully revealed to me by the end of it. Hopefully that's a thing that I can do.\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is incredible, and I love the art, although, as an artist myself, I felt some designs for specific characters could have been better.\n\nAll-in-all, I appreciate the game for what it is.

I did not like this game whatsoever. It has almost no game-play, as expected of a visual novel. But it has this annoying bar mini-game where you make drinks for the patrons by mixing different ingredients together in set recipes. It did not work for me, and mostly just took me out of the dialogue that the characters were having.\n\nSpeaking of characters, this game has quite a few. Most of them were at least somewhat interesting and fun, but none of them really made me care for anything that was happening. Dorothy was kind of interesting I guess, Dana was there. The guy that kept ordering large beers was pretty boring. I'm not sure if they got more interesting later in the game. But if it didn't catch my attention in 2 hours worth of game-play then I am not interested.\n\nThe game is competently made and has nice character sprites. No bugs or technical issues whatsoever and the UI is fine. No complaints here.\n\nOverall, I dislike this game as I find it boring.

Follow instructions, make cocktails, and listen as patrons line up text on the bottom of the screen. You're going to get little more than that. Only a little. And did the writers make full use of that routine.\n\nBehind the counter, or screen, in your case, the player is treated to a narrative that discusses much and more about the little dilemmas, joys and sorrows of the human experience, and all that comes from a catgirl. In this genre, it is all too common to have a silent protagonist. The 'You, Player, are the Protagonist' approach that either can lend so much more to the experience, or - in far too many cases - lead to the protagonist ending up as a wet soggy cut-out with the smudged scrawl of 'Self-Insert LOL' written on their forehead. Not here.\n\nEvery single character is well defined, and part of the story. There is no character reduced to being a vehicle for a narrative, presented 'dialogue options' for the sole purpose of eliciting a canned reaction from another.\n\nThat's the beauty of this game, really. With such established characters, and strong personalities even on the protagonist's part, you, the player, also has a say in this story. Your decisions matter. Not in the sense that it will irreparably alter the course of the gameplay, but it's the little things.\n\nWill you take the extra few seconds out of your time to make a drink bigger for a patron who's celebrating Friday? You don't have to do it, but will you? Will you willingly get an order wrong for a patron, simply because you know that they like sweeter things than sour things? It will mess up your perfect bonus.\n\nWill you be kind in the little things, for the sake of being kind?\n\nSo there's all that, and there's also the larger picture. The world building is subtle and polished. The humor is on point with its simplicity. Though, really, children shouldn't be playing this. The soundtrack is crafted immaculately to the setting. The art is what you'd expect - good pixel art, but the character designs are memorable without being gaudy.\n\nBest birthday present I ever received, but it is worth the full price, or at the very least, a top pick for a sale impulse buy.\n\nI'll replay this just to feel like I'm catching up with old friends again. \n\nTime to mix drinks, and change lives.

I've got a lot to say! This'll be long, so review summary up front. I waited to 100% this game for a review, so I've played it thoroughly!\n\nThis is an insta-buy at full price if you like: visual novels, cyberpunk, anime aesthetic, waifu memery, or any game with really good atmosphere. If you don't fall into those categories, I still recommend you give this a try. I'm not a visual novel person, but I the writing and atmosphere really won me over, not to mention it has an incredible soundtrack. But if you're hesitant, wait for a sale and pick it up anyway. This game has a lot of heart and surprising depth.\n\nOn to the full review! \n\nFor starters, I'm a bartender, hence part of my interest in this game. I love what I do so I'm drawn to seeing the subject portrayed, particularly in video games. The integration of bartending mechanics into the game itself is brilliant. I will say the sound effects are very very realistic, and the fictional portrayal of mixology in a cyberpunk dystopia is intriguing and surprisingly plausible. \n\nWith that out of the way, let me start with the positives and I'll conclude with the negatives. \n\nThis game hooked me out of the gate with the gorgeous visuals. The art is obviously very lovingly done, and it really helps carry the game. All the characters are colorful and interesting. The bar itself is lovely. They absolutely nailed the neon soaked cyberpunk dystopia. It's not the most original world they've created, but it's one of my favorite depictions of it. With that said, what really pulled me in was the music. I have to give it a 9/10. It's such a perfect fit for the setting and it's utterly entrancing. Seriously, load your juke box up every shift with a variety, you'll fall in love with at least a couple.\n\nWell, this is a visual novel, so the really important question is, how's the writing? \n\nIt's incredibly solid. Especially since this isn't a romantic VN, the conversations are so much more organic, love isn't getting shoe horned into every topic. People just- talk like people. As a bartender myself, it's all very familiar. I'd bet money some of the writers have done their time behind the stick, it shows. The characters are all very distinct, and the ones who feel trite at first reveal some depth by the end. The game has a perfect length to allow everyone to get a chance in the spot light and come through. The writing is also fairly self aware, for example the character who is a sex worker who looks like a stereotypical anime girl actually talks about that in length over the course of the story, going through her thoughts, experiences and showing it's not just an excuse for the writers to have a hot anime school girl involved. The characters around her simultaneously take her seriously and act appropriately to her behavior, as well. It's a breath of fresh air.\n\nThis actually brings me to something I wanted to say, it's not exactly a critique but the up-front marketing of this game is not particular accurate or helpful? When I purchased the game on a whim I expected a game about hitting on anime girls from behind the bar, but that is absolutely not what you get. One ending involves romance. The rest of the game involves making drinks and getting to know people and hearing about their lives, finding out what makes them who they are. Almost none of the characters show a romantic or sexual interest in the protagonist. This is, again, quite refreshing. This game is surprisingly grounded and subtle.\n\nWell... Mostly. Let's say a solid 3/4 or 7/8 of it is amazing and it really pulls you in. You start to care about the characters and their endings are very satisfying if you put in the work. However...\n\nThere is some sloppy writing in the mix, and a strange obsession with /b/ is obviously on the peripherals of the game. It's strange seeing 4chan references- even if this game did come out in 2016- but it's there, and it doesn't do much to add to this game. In fact, it cheapens it. There's a character who's built to spam the screen with /b/ like dialogue and it's honestly obnoxious and does little to help the story. I'm not a fan of references that are used like bludgeons. \n\nThis isn't the only example, too. Despite being well written and enjoyable characters in their own right, there's almost always one conversation per female character about their chest size. Once or twice is believable- especially in the case of one particular character who talks about back pain and the like, but man, I swear, we couldn't get through this game without a female character saying something about their or another woman's chest. It was a little cringy, honestly, and a stain on an otherwise spectacular game. \n\nSo yeah, the writing has its moments of weakness, but seriously, most of it's pretty fantastic.

Generally, each day goes like this. You go to work, bar owner and/or Gil (coworker) come in and talk to you for a little bit. Customer 1 comes in, talks to you, and orders 3 drinks that you make for them in a simple minigame. They leave, customer 2 comes in and repeat. After the 2nd customer, you go on break where you get to save the game. Come back from break and repeat the same exact process as the 1st half of the day. At the end of the day, you talk to Boss/Gil again, get your paycheck, and go home. At home, you can read some in-game web blogs, customize your apartment, and go out and purchase some random items that dress up your apartment and make Jill able to concentrate at work (which just means that she'll remind you what customers ordered rather than forcing you to memorize it). Occasionally, you'll need to have saved up enough money to pay some bill.\n\nWhile I think the game is mostly fine, it has some issues that bog it down.\n\nTo begin, there's no real plot that goes anywhere. You start by learning that the bar is possibly going to get shutdown. This is mostly placed on the backburner and the plot becomes listen to people talk. The 2nd half of the game then abruptly shifts the plot to a personal issue that comes up for Jill... which then boils down to having people come in, talk to Jill, and try to cheer her up. This is very easily solved and then end of game.\n\nThe mixing drink mini-game is extremely easy and quickly becomes monotonous. Customer says what drink/type of drink they want, then you look up the drink on an in-game menu and add the ingredients. You can actually lose the game if you repeatedly make mistakes or make the same incorrect drink over and over again, but you pretty much have to intentionally do this. This offers the only real choices you'll make throughout the game as some drinks let you choose how much alcohol to add. This can get the customers drunk, which will change up the dialogue a bit. Somewhat notable and baffling is that the game completely fails during the tutorial to explain the difference between mixing and blending. This will be confusing for a few minutes until you figure it out or look it up.\n\nThe stories, characters, and writing are all a mixed bag. There's nothing notably horrible here but nothing notably good either. Sometimes the humor hits, other times it doesn't. Expect plenty of memes/sex/body related jokes/discussions. Sometimes the writing drags, other times it doesn't. Probably the biggest strength of this is that the characters all feel different from one another. Some characters you'll like and be happy to see pop in the bar, others you won't really care for one way or another. If a character you don't really care about comes in, you're going to be reading at length about them. Gil is mostly used as a punching bag throughout this.\n\nThe worst character throughout this might be the character you play as, Jill. She's struggling to make ends meet living in an apartment with a cat that she talks with. She smokes and is in love with her boss. The main issue with Jill is that she's kind of a coont. Despite her coontishness, everyone seems to like her an unreasonable amount. Beyond that, none of Jill's problems stem from anything other than the fact that she had the option of making smart choices or stupid choices, and intentionally chose to make stupid choices. Unless you're stupid as well, it's hard to sympathize with a character whose problems all stem from being dumb.\n\nA minor but somewhat aggravating issue is that at the start of each day and each break, you select up to 12 songs on the jukebox to play while you're bartending.

I enjoy playing it the most at night when I'm stressed and want to relax into the evening, and listen and talk to clients who have these amazing personalities, and grow friendships amongst them.\n\nI would seriously recommend anyone this game, I'm only 10 hours in as I write this review, but I'll happily give it another hundred more. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1656002984, "timestamp_updated": 1656002984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117453994": {"recommendationid": "117453994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011322908", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1671353716}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game that is better then the pictures let on .\nI bought this game on a whim cause it runs natively on linux so i thought why the heck not and it is totally worth the experience , the more you play the game the more you get invested in the character (and they are all special in their own way ) and want to learn more about them .\nthere is a money system in this game but aslong you do your job as a bartender right it should not be a issue . \nAlso at first the system to serve drinks might be confusing but in the description of the drinks it will say mixed or blended , the diffrence is with mixed it means you can press mix and stop imidiantly and voila you have a mixed drink but with blended you need to let the drink go untill is rapidly moves and then you got a blended drink . also all the drinks are colour coded and named so no confusion on that can arrise .\njust be carefull to read what the client says cause it is important .", "timestamp_created": 1655984481, "timestamp_updated": 1655984481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117452204": {"recommendationid": "117452204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210486475", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1655988291}, "language": "english", "review": "So fun just buy now", "timestamp_created": 1655981457, "timestamp_updated": 1655981457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117434877": {"recommendationid": "117434877", "author": {"steamid": "76561199011945160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1664248276}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is digital estrogen", "timestamp_created": 1655945166, "timestamp_updated": 1655945166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797863245010375977", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117405094": {"recommendationid": "117405094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055065380", "num_games_owned": 1206, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1653016389}, "language": "english", "review": "Good visual novel, absolutely amazing and adorable art too!

Fantastic characters, a lot of heart to the story. The cyberpunk world is familiar, but the very limited scope does wonders to give it a freshness. It's meandering in that slice-of-life kind of way; it has a lot of loose ends that suggest a bigger world rather than feeling unresolved. The grimdark brutality of hyper-capitalism, dehumanization, totalitarianism are all there, but instead of being the focus, they are the accents and accessories to the game's focus on people: jobs & careers, love & sex, regrets, ideas, friendships, and -- most refreshing of all -- small kindnesses. To be reductive, the Neuromancer cyberpunk is juxtaposed with bishojo sweetness to hit something touching and relatable, something greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nMost of the dialogue is strong. Even at its weakest it rarely takes you out of the game, aside from a few egregious typos. Definitely horny, but not gratuitous. The social commentary and humor range from insightful to forgettable: Streamer-chan for example was an adequate send up of streamer culture on her first appearance. On her second, she was a worn-out bit. But the core cast -- Jill, Gillian, Boss, Alma, Dorothy, Sei and Stella -- are either deeply interesting or emotionally important to the others.\n\nThe art is pretty great, nostalgic but not bland; only gripe is a few of the characters (Gillian and Boss to be sure) could've stood to have more poses. Music is good, the meeting ground of chiptune and synthwave, though a few of the songs are a bit too punchy for such a slow-moving game.\n\nThe bartending mechanic was engaging for a single playthrough, though they didn't do much to progress or flesh out the repetitive task the way a game like Papers Please does. For the most part, I really enjoyed testing different drinks, remembering patron's favorites to build up friendship, finding secrets... all the hallmarks of a low-stakes vibe game. And some of the drinks have some dramatic weight behind them, like [spoiler]the drink to calm down Sei after the Bank Attack[/spoiler]. By the end, though, the drink making does feel like a tax to continue the scene. One or two drinks near the end still feel important, just wish there had been that last little bit of fine tuning to maintain momentum throughout.\n\nOverall definitely worth the pickup if you're interested in lovely, relatable characters and a shifted perspective on worn-out cyberpunk tropes.", "timestamp_created": 1655446381, "timestamp_updated": 1655446381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

I played this game because i heard one of the sound tracks in a video essay i was watching. once i found the name and where i came from it lead me to this game. Now i have bought many graphic novel games and or other games like this one but let me tell you something this game is something else. \n\nPart 1: the protagonist\nJill is surprisingly someone i can truely relate to so much that her job is not that much different then mine. Jill is someone who wants freedom and even thought the game doesnt show it alot she does and wow Jill feels real like someone i would see where i work. she is easy to follow due to her way of thinking and her inner monologs on who she is talking too and how she doesnt like the dog in the hawiian shirt. \n\nPart 2 the rest of the cast\"\nas im nearing the end of the game i will say the cast that ive meet and how they interact and how they are is amazing due to their way of thinking and how they change or help Jill as she works making wanting to make the drinks perfect to see how they respond or act heck the few people i accidently got drunk gave more info about themselves then i would have imagine. Each character hold some kind of secret and as i got to play more and see what they do i learn who truely is the white rabbit and it surpised me alot and brought more questions that i can get the answers to yet. i just love talking to each character even if Jill didnt like them or thought highly of. \n\nPart 3 Music: \nOH MY GOODNESS GRACES I LOVE THE MUSIC. \nthere is alot of music already unlocked and i already have a few picked out on how to start the playlist and im more amazed how they help set the mood when talking to some of the customers and how they are feeling. \n\nNow why i recommend this game...\nwell I'm a college student and a full time employee so playing games is hard when your free time is paying bills and studying but that's why i play this its calming and a good escape even thought like i said earlier Jill and i almost have the same job but its about the story i don't meet hackers or cool heros or just some strange dude of the street who acts all theatrical believe me i wish and maybe my job would be a little more interesting. but i recommend this game because you will not have the same experience or adventure like ever before. for this game truely will be one i will personally play over and over to see the characters and see what new outcomes i can find. this game will make you want to be a bartender just in hopes to meet people like you do in the game. so anyone who doesnt have alot of free time and just wants a fun story game where making liquor and chatting up with strangers to pass the time is the goal then i say this is the game for you and if you dont believe me then do what Jill says every time she starts her shift \n\"Time to mix drinks and change lives\" \nso do just that and you will love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1653373499, "timestamp_updated": 1653373499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115929525": {"recommendationid": "115929525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057562173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1654400824}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a beautiful written game.

However, don't start the game with expectations for a AAA title that is filled to the brim with action, horror and heroism but rather with expectations for some 15 hours off chill time and thought-provoking topics of discussion.  \n\nHaving gone into the game with no previous experience with visual novels, I was not sure what to expect from the game.  \nEspecially the introduction was in some parts hard to follow. However, after being introduced to the core mechanic of mixing drinks and to the first few characters all of the setting became clear.  \nEspecially the beginning of the game can feel somewhat slow. However, after some time and the introduction of some more characters the game picks up on pace. \n\nThere are some interesting anecdotes an situations in the game which give the game more depth which is great. Moreover, the game manages to balance between heartfelt moments of anger or despair and warm-hearted and funny scenes. Especially the second half of the game stirs your interest in the story and gets you more involved with the game. In addition to that, the last 3-5 hours of the game also manages to address serious topics such as grieve and feelings of guilt in a way that they seem relatable and realistic. \n\nIn my opinion the game is great just how it is and I think it is a shame that we will likely not see a continuation of the story. \n\nThank you for the great game Sukeban Games!\n", "timestamp_created": 1653231376,

A lot of visual novel games I\u2019ve played kind of reward pressing dialogue buttons with pieces of personal character information. \u201cThis is X\u2019s favorite color\u201d, and eventually you fill out a checklist about a character, without really knowing anything about them. In Valhalla you organically get these personally pieces about characters that you just know because of the drink mechanic, you know that Donovan\u2019s always going to want a beer when he comes in, that a Piano Women will cheer Dorothy up if she\u2019s sad, or that Alma\u2019s favorite drink is a Brandtini. There\u2019s no checklists in this game.\n\nThe only real shortcoming is that the capstone story moments needed just a bit more. A cutscene, a personal piece of dialogue, some kind of closure. I found myself a little unsatisfied with a lot of the important story moments because it felt as if they had ended abruptly, without properly closing out. Christmas in particular felt like the worst one, where before the party even really starts you take a smoke break with Alma and then it just ends. I think that for a game that has such a captivating cast of characters, and manages to circumvent a lot of the more egregious problems that VNs can run into where you don\u2019t really get to know the characters you are interacting with, the pay-off for those in game relationships wasn\u2019t substantial enough.", "timestamp_created": 1652222076, "timestamp_updated": 1652222076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115243041": {"recommendationid": "115243041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199222849125", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1689697004}, "language": "english", "review": "marverlous", "timestamp_created": 1652172083, "timestamp_updated": 1652172083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115233397": {"recommendationid": "115233397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155781148", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1652148742}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2606\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1652149843, "timestamp_updated": 1652149843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115226635": {"recommendationid": "115226635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174264399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2018, "last_played": 1652324846}, "language": "english", "review": "It's time to mix drinks and change lives..\n\nThis game to me is perfect for me, and I am very happy with this game, 11/10 from me, and I would highly recommend this game to anyone really.

This isn't some overly dramatic story of blah blah. This is a peek into a very complete world, with characters that have motivations and flaws. The main character, Jill, is one of, if not the, best main character of a visual novel I\u2019ve ever encountered. She\u2019s relatable, yet very much an actor in her own life. You\u2019ve just been given the opportunity to follow along. All other characters are fantastically written, whether it\u2019s a recurring patron or a one-time-customer, they all are their own and are all charming in their own way. In addition, the game knows what it is and uses it to its advantage on multiple occasions. Let me phrase it like this: My favorite part of the game is simply having a beer with your boss.\n\nMechanically, you\u2019re presented with a simple system for making a given drink by mixing ingredients. You\u2019re generally told what to make, but given a lot of freedom to figure out which kind of drink and how much alcohol you\u2019re giving out \u2013 which does have an effect on the following conversations. You\u2019re also met with orders that act as riddles and others as questioning how well you know your customers. Additionally, when you return home, you\u2019re tasked with balancing Jill\u2019 whims and her duties. Along with the ability to read news, blogs and other gossip \u2013 which are all perfectly in sync with what\u2019s happening in the bar.\n\nThen there\u2019s the soundtrack. I don\u2019t know how to phrase this without sounding like a broken record, but it\u2019s very, very good. You\u2019re tasked with choosing the music for a given day, and therefore have a good time finding your favorite tracks and making your own personal playlist. They\u2019re all \u201cthematically similar\u201d in fitting in within the game\u2019 setting. But they\u2019re far from similar in the typical sense.\n\nFinally, I didn\u2019t think much of the style to begin with \u2013 but being in it for hours made me really appreciate it. There\u2019s a huge amount of time spent on the smallest details, and it shows in both subtle character emotions and the outright beautiful art.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever enjoyed any kind of visual novel, play this. You\u2019ll regret it if you don\u2019t.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, this is an excellent beginning.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like reading, transhumanism/cyberpunk [b]and[/b] lbgt material \u2013 then this isn\u2019t the game for you.

Like I said, visual novels usually bore me, just because I don't like the idea of the only action being to select different dialogue and stuff. This game balances the dialogue to match the gameplay, no matter how simple it is. I did accidentally spoil myself halfway through my first playthrough of the game, but I was able to find out about a secret drink, and how it brought new people to the bar. The small details in selecting different drinks (as well as spiking people's drinks with Karmotrine) kept me entertained. Top that off with a cyberpunk setting and retro-pixel graphics, and you've got an amazing game.\n\nI do recommend buying it on sale though. Even if it is an amazing game, I probably wouldn't buy it at full price for around 12-15 hours of gameplay, unless you really like replaying visual novels. \n\nOnce again, amazing game, and remember; optional Karmotrine = spike the drink.", "timestamp_created": 1650692027, "timestamp_updated": 1650692027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65443342924118042", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114305957": {"recommendationid": "114305957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192793630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1002, "last_played": 1650511265}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a lot to find relatable in this game, both for me personally and no doubt for many others.
