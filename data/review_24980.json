very alarming enemy as opposed to the first game, and you find yourself having to make morally questionable choices and align yourself with morally questionable people to get the job done. \nreturning

Here is my honest opinion:\n\nThe game itself stand-alone is great but to get the true experience you need to import a ME1 character and play the full Paragon or Renegade route. The amount of nods to the actions from the first game always gives me a smile. The crew is much larger and diverse, and my husbando Garrus is as good as ever.\n\nExploring every planet and quest is easily a 20+ hour experience, and DLC from the remastered version adds more you want. \n\nCombat-wise, I have mixed feelings. The number of health bars and ways to counter each makes combat more than just \"shoot the bad guy\", however, on the higher difficulty it is a slog sometimes, especially since some powers don't work on certain bars (So team composition is important). The thermal clip mechanic is annoying, and the vent version form ME1 is better. As for the powers, the amount is strongly reduced and ALL abilities go on cooldown once you use one (the time depending on the ability). It forces you to use your guns more often.\n\nThe best thing they added was the amount of in-depth characterization they put into the teammates.  Each has a story to tell, their own history and you can explore them together. The loyalty missions is the icing on the cake.\n\nAre there bugs like Audio missing, weird camera angles in cutscenes, stuck camera while charging, glitchy UI in the combat mode......? Yes, but it is rare and minor enough that it rarely disrupts combat. Most I blame on \"modern computers running old games\". \n\nTL;DR, ME2 is a great game full of character and a decent combat loop worth the investment.", "timestamp_created": 1694363091, "timestamp_updated": 1694363091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505864500999450684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145817032": {"recommendationid": "145817032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005942589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1930, "last_played": 1456607662}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed 2 better than 1.\n\nIt is a really good game", "timestamp_created": 1694038469, "timestamp_updated": 1694038469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145658277": {"recommendationid": "145658277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096129470", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1646769457}, "language": "english", "review": "Every couple of years I come back to play this again.

The first and foremost detail I'd note about this game is that the combat is a huge improvement over the original Mass Effect. Character build decisions have been refined down to only the impactful decisions; no more balancing of hundreds of skill points. The levels are much denser and better designed, and the enemies are, largely, much more interesting to fight. The shooting and cover systems are much more fluid. The original game feels janky in comparison.\n\nStory-wise, there are more companion characters and they are much more fleshed out than the original's companions. Given that strong companion systems are what separate Bioware RPGs from other RPGs, this is an enormous plus. I'd also say that the quest stories have much more lively characters involved, and there are generally more twists and intrigue. However, the main story is about on par with the original. \n\nSo, the game is good! Worth playing, and the entire trilogy is also worth playing. It's probably worth picking up Mass Effect Legendary Edition rather than this version so as to enjoy the entire series in its most up-to-date form.\n\nNote: I played and beat this game on console several years ago.

This was no ordinary game - it was a mission across the vastness of the universe, a thrilling journey that could bring hope to the gaming world. He knew that this challenge was going to be greater than anything He had ever faced before. However, Kiba was ready for what awaited him in Mass Effect 2, even if He still felt a chill of fear in his heart as He launched the PC version on Steam \ud83d\udc3a\u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udfae\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, I'm no amateur - having been a longtime aficionado of indie gems and an avid follower of anime, manga, and movies since the 80s. My mind raced with excitement as I flipped through the glowing review of Mass Effect 2's brilliance. Yet despite the promise of something truly extraordinary, my heart revolted against the idea of leaving behind my treasured classics. A tug of war between two vastly different worlds was raging in my soul.\n\nAs I stepped into the mesmerizing world of Mass Effect 2, I felt a shiver go down my spine. I was completely captivated by the stunning visuals, enthralled by the captivating soundtracks and spellbound by the complex gameplay mechanics which put me on constant edge. It was unlike anything I had encountered before; an alternate universe where every decision had consequences, and every mission was ripe with adventure that filled me with exhilaration. The storyline was unravelling in front of me like a stunning tapestry, and the personalities of the characters seemed to deepen as I progressed forward. As the game made its way onto PC shortly afterwards, conflicting emotions erupted within me - elation at discovering this universe belonged more than just one platform, fear at having to explore it all over again.\n\nThe biting cold of the Arctic wind stung at the Ice Wolf's fur as he pressed forward on his journey, yet at the same time, a glimmer of hope shone in his eyes. Mass Effect 2 was calling to him, an oasis amidst the desolate tundra that promised captivating drama, thrilling action, and side-splitting comedy. Despite his excitement, he felt an overwhelming sense of dread as he pondered dark secrets that lay hidden within the plot. The characters were so full of life and emotion that they made his frozen heart ache, but their bonds also provided warmth and comfort that not even the Fire Wolf could match. \ud83d\udd25\u2744\ufe0f\n\nMass Effect 2 ornaments the gaming landscape like a dazzling snow globe. It envelops you in its unique and spectacular combination of third-person shooter mechanics, RPG elements, and captivating storytelling, while leaving other games in its wake. The RPG elements may be simplified and occasionally limiting, but this isn't an RPG; it's a universe teeming with meaningful decisions and stories that penetrate even the coldest of hearts.\n\nBut even the harshest winter has its spring, and Mass Effect 2 is no exception. The Deluxe Edition on Steam does not include the significant expansions such as \"Lair of the Shadow Broker,\" \"The Arrival,\" and \"Stolen Dreams.\" This left a frosty taste in my mouth, as I felt deceived by EA's icy business practices. There's a special place in the Arctic for companies that mislead their players, and EA is inching ever closer to it.\n\nGameplay in Mass Effect 2 is like a snowstorm; it's fast, relentless, and unpredictable. It blends RPG elements with a cover shooter, creating a unique gaming experience that sends chills down your spine. And let's not forget about the class-specific abilities and weapons, which add a touch of frosty freshness to every playthrough. It's like an avalanche of action and strategy that keeps you on your toes.\n\nEvaluating Mass Effect 2 is like trying to hold onto an icicle: it's tricky, and you'll probably get a cold shock, but the result is a beautiful and fragile work of art. The main strength of the game lies in its narrative and characters, which are as cold and unforgiving as they are warm and comforting. The story is a blizzard of emotions that chills you to the bone, and the choices you make feel as if they hold the weight of the entire galaxy.\n\nBut the game's shortcomings are also as clear as ice. The lack of DLCs in the Deluxe Edition and the hoops you have to jump through to access the extras is like stepping on a patch of black ice: unexpected, unpleasant, and unnecessary.\n\nDespite these minor cracks, Mass Effect 2 remains a beautiful ice sculpture in the winter of gaming. It's a must-play, a testament to the narrative power of video games, and a shining gem in the frosty wilderness.\n\nRemember, even the coldest tundra has its warmth, and even the darkest night has its dawn. Stay frosty, my friends. \ud83c\udf19\u2744\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zKZoLpAGJAM", "timestamp_created": 1689532414, "timestamp_updated": 1689747161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473372787237167358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142192989": {"recommendationid": "142192989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043388988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 2977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2977, "last_played": 1674336682}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fantastic sequel and builds on the story presented in the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1689506452, "timestamp_updated": 1689506452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142017729": {"recommendationid": "142017729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326254097", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2438, "last_played": 1612456227}, "language": "english", "review": "What an awsome adventure with many different and meaningfull choices i sure hope the grand finale [spoiler]doesn't end with pathetic A B C or D answers.[/spoiler]\nThey should add sex though.", "timestamp_created": 1689285335, "timestamp_updated": 1689285335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141854334": {"recommendationid": "141854334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101699273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 3407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3407, "last_played": 1629149070}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1689103724, "timestamp_updated": 1689103724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141754489": {"recommendationid": "141754489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991045962", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2601, "last_played": 1341298800}, "language": "english", "review": "I am utterly captivated by Mass Effect 2 (2010 Edition), a game that has truly withstood the test of time and remains an absolute gem within the gaming industry.

More like Mass Effect Too Good To Be True! This game is a space opera of epic proportions that will have you blasting aliens, romancing your crew, and making choices that could literally save the galaxy. But let's be real, we all know the real draw of Mass Effect 2: the facial animations.\n\nWho needs realistic dialogue and nuanced storytelling when you can have Shepard's deadpan stare as they deliver lines like \"I should go\" with all the emotion of a rock? And don't even get me started on the awkward lip syncing. I mean, it's like watching a bad Japanese dub of a B-movie. But hey, at least it's hilarious, right?\n\nBut in all seriousness, Mass Effect 2 is a fantastic game.

First off, Im not really an expert on the lore side when It comes to Mass Effect.\n\nNow about the story/gameplay. Its really awesome to build your team and ship both In terms of loyalty and overall size. Second. There Is actual mining In this game where you can collect rare minerals that you need for some Important upgrades. There are loyalty missions that can be failed. Which totaly caught me off guard first time playing. Third. The story from the first one really dosent mater becaus: you get to know the new and remaining old crew Instantly; and Ashley gets mad at you becaus Shepard joined Cerberus (for some reason). \n\nIt feels awesome to work with Cerberus becaus they have money and resources. Also Its nice to report major operations to the Illusive Man. In Mass Effect 3 they totaly ruined the concept of working side by side with Cerberus, Instead they were made Into generic human villains. In Mass Effect 2 they were definetly neutral. \n\nShepards character can be good and bad. This Is Ingame known as \"Renegade\" and \"Paragon\". Renegade Is basicly scumbag Shepard and Paragon Is savior Shepard. This means you are given a choice during gameplay to perform certain dialouge options that can Impact the story of the game. Slightly. You can also romance with squadmates. That depends If Shepard Is male or female. \n\nWell the gameplay Is nothing new. Third person shooter with squad based and cover based mechanics. \n\nMost of the characters are well writen and acted. My personal favorites are Miranda, Garus and the Illusive Man. Ashley from Mass Effect 1 Is a bitch. \n\nNow the graphics are quite good for Its time and the soundtrack Is still awesome.

The planet scanning mini-task made me want to pull my hair out. Accidentally taking cover when I wanted to spring was irritating. And yes, I became annoyed at not being able to fill my renegade bar high enough to secure a certain character for my group. \n\nBut through it all I could sense just enough soul in the DNA of ME2. Vibrant life in the fascinating worlds I visited. Interest in the story lines and diverse cast of characters that each were given time to develop. I grew to appreciate the renegade choices a lot more this time around. I understood the politics behind the Illusive Man now that I have more context as an adult. And I even appreciated that the game was made in a time when women were allowed to look hot in games. \n\nSpeaking of hot, I surprisingly found myself rather attracted to Jack more so for her personality, which was strange because I remembered really disliking her in my first playthrough as a teen. I think her story was quite interesting and had the potential to be its own game all on its own if someone wanted to make that. I only wish that after growing so close to her when she unfortunately met her demise, my Sheppard didn't seem terribly saddened or disturbed. I would've appreciated at least a sentence or two on losing his lover. \n\nAnd now I can finally play ME3 for the first time once they finally give us a discount on the damn game. \n\nSo yes.

The main story is full of frustrating plot holes, and the loyalty mechanic (the only bit that links the interesting stuff to the main plot) feels super arbitrary and disconnected. Preparing for the suicide mission feels less like a rallying of troops and more like solving an equation. Additionally, as soon as you complete a companion's loyalty mission, they stop doing or reacting to anything interesting and basically become a part of the Normandy's set dressing.\n\nThe dialogue is well-written, but is terrible from a role-playing perspective. You basically have five options: progress the conversation; progress the conversion while being a dick about it; ask about more information; and occasionally a special paragon or renegade option. The split between paragon and renegade is consistently frustrating and unpredictable. I wish they ditched the system and used an influence system instead (like in Fallout: New Vegas). Making the system worse is that you often need to meet a high threshold of paragon and renegade points to unlock certain options in dialogue, meaning you have to go all in on one to unlock those options, which reduces your ability to role-play and mix options. It also seems really artificial: why do need a certain number of dickhead points to be a dickhead in a different situation?\n\nFinally, there are far too many annoying mini-games unbefitting for a space opera protagonist. Obviously, there is the planet scanning game, which you have to complete if you want to research upgrades. But there are also tedious vehicle sections and long hacking mini-games. The hacking mini-games are the worst, as they interrupt combat sections.\n\nPS: the port sucks and requires you to sign up for EA nonsense to play the DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1672768832, "timestamp_updated": 1672769062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439982295036315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129902534": {"recommendationid": "129902534", "author": {"steamid": "76561199213918631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1673809141}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty, of course there are some things that are dated but overall i haven't found anything awful! def worth a try!!!!!!! <3", "timestamp_created": 1672623516, "timestamp_updated": 1672623516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129752405": {"recommendationid": "129752405", "author": {"steamid": "76561199439217460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1941, "last_played": 1675911440}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una chulada de experiencia,me gustaron mas que nada los personajes te encari\u00f1as mucho con ellos", "timestamp_created": 1672466747, "timestamp_updated": 1672466747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129728367": {"recommendationid": "129728367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025325503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2665, "last_played": 1599834735}, "language": "english", "review": "You will find this game in the list for Best Game of all Time for a reason.

The story takes on where the first game ends with a certain twist. You are once again dressed up as Commander Shepard in this narrative RPG adventure with some gunplay and resource management shoehorned in for the sake of it. The talent tree is greatly reduced and even though you still find the classes from the first game the rudimentary skills makes the leveling much more convinient and the gameplay as a whole a bit more streamlined. Gone is the constant micromanaging of your squad in favor of a more action oriented shooting gallery style gameplay. The enemies are still stupid beyond belief but the sheer amount of health and ablative armor they have on the higher difficulty can still make you weep blood. \n\nTaking off from the rather grounded story in the first game that ended in a rather climactic revelation ME2 ups the ante a lot by having a far bigger scope. Most of the choices you made during the first installment will come back to haunt you and even impact your looks to a certain degree. The game starts with a twist and shortly after an encounter with a mysterious shadow cabal that pushes your squad of badass space mercenaries into action yet again. On your romp through the galaxy you encounter old friends and enemies as well as a whole bunch of new intriguing characters and locales. Without further spoiling anything the storytelling is tight as ever and the choices from the first game truly feel meaningful. Mass Effect 2 is a superior game to its predecessor and much like The Witcher series the gameplay between the first game and its sequel are so different that they could easily have been different games. In the end this is an epic experience of great storytelling coupled with satisfying gameplay and a great list of intriguing and likable characters. \n\nThere is an argument that you could start up with ME2 right away, and I get it. But half of the thing that makes this game click for me is the legacy. What I did in the first game actually meant something down the line and I truly love that way of tying the storylines together. ME2 is a masterpiece and a definite cinematic gameplay experience. If you have any love whatsoever for Sci-fi this game is a must play, and even if you hate sci-fi, the story is compelling enough to lure the most blackhearted visual novel romantic into its grasp.. \n", "timestamp_created": 1672341076, "timestamp_updated": 1672341076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035129547119141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129626366": {"recommendationid": "129626366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255281826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1290, "last_played": 1672340296}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game", "timestamp_created": 1672340536, "timestamp_updated": 1672340536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759384155273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129577246": {"recommendationid": "129577246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164576853", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 2420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1564, "last_played": 1673021975}, "language": "english", "review": "EA is a terrible company.

You can play the games without a problem initially, but to access the DLC you're going to have to jump through quite a few hoops and out of the three games Mass Effect 2 gave me the most issues. Unsurprisingly if you got the game on Origin all the DLC is included with the base game so you won't have any of these issues. so it just feels like EA and/or BioWare is punishing players for buying this on Steam instead of Origin.\n\nThe DLC is free which is nice but it's not on Steam. You can get it to work but you have to google on how to access it as when I tried to download the DLC on Origin once the game showed up in that library, the game no longer launched so I had to uninstall and re-install a couple times. Eventually I found out you have to go to an external EA website and download the DLC's manually and as far as I can tell it works so you technically don't need Origin, but you will still need an EA account. It's just a lot bigger of a hassle than it needs to be.\n\nI'm currently moving from console to PC so I tried to save a couple of bucks getting the trilogy on sale, as well as with the Legendary Edition as great as it is there is just something about it that I just like the atmosphere and lighting of the originals but that's just a personal preference. \n\nOverall for how much of a hassle it has been to get these games to work for me, the few nitpicks I have Legendary Edition I would highly recommend getting that instead unless you're just looking to complete your collection, as there are a lot more improvements and quality of life changes that make the game a lot better to play.\n\nMass Effect 2 9/10\nMass Effect 2 on Steam 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1670360571, "timestamp_updated": 1670360571, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620307385921478271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127954491": {"recommendationid": "127954491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029557326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1670206049}, "language": "english", "review": "got EA pass... \nstory rich game...\ncant continue because there is an invisible enemy that cant be killed, so cant pass the lvl, \nand as of 2022 i don't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1670206374, "timestamp_updated": 1670206374, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561372697353363037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127907118": {"recommendationid": "127907118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986964830", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2682, "last_played": 1471539536}, "language": "spanish", "review": "NOTA: 9.25 de 10\n\nAunque el primer Mass Effect fue un tesoro, esta segunda parte es para m\u00ed la mejor de la saga. Ciertos aspectos est\u00e1n m\u00e1s pulidos, como los gr\u00e1ficos, animaciones, efectos especiales, m\u00fasica, detalle en los mapas, siendo lo m\u00e1s destacable la gran cantidad de personajes que han introducido, con sus respectivos trasfondos, generando una gran variedad de alternativas y diferentes caminos por donde llegar a distintos finales. En este sentido es bastante rejugable.\n\nTambi\u00e9n hay cosas que empeoran o se mantienen igual:\n\n- Se echa en falta de Mass Effect 1 las granadas y su variedad de estrategias en los enemigos.\n\n- La historia principal del personaje protagonista es demasiado rocambolesca y dif\u00edcil de tragar. Las misiones y minijuegos son en algunos casos bastante cansinos. \n\n- El sistema de curaci\u00f3n pasa il\u00f3gicamente de los botiquines en Mass Effect 1, a la regeneraci\u00f3n tras cobertura en Mass Effect 2. Por lo general me dan bastante asco los juegos con regeneraci\u00f3n troll, porque se hacen demasiado f\u00e1ciles y aburridos. En juegos futuristas puedo hacer algunas excepciones porque es m\u00e1s coherente con la ambientaci\u00f3n, pero en el caso de Mass Effect, aunque no lo considero negativo, tampoco me acaba de convencer. Los enemigos son m\u00e1s h\u00e1biles y peligrosos, equilibrando la dificultad, pero yo igualmente lo hubiera dejado como en el anterior juego.\n\n- A parte de eso, lo que menos me gust\u00f3 y que ya me chirriaba del primer Mass Effect, fue lo parco y simple que son las respuestas en las conversaciones. En juegos como Baldur's Gate y similares, puedes elegir con precisi\u00f3n lo que van a responder los personajes, pero en Mass Effect solo sale una palabra o frase corta. Al elegir la opci\u00f3n, el personaje responde con una frase m\u00e1s elaborada que no siempre coincide con lo que uno cre\u00eda haber elegido.\n\n- Tuve un problema con el movimiento del rat\u00f3n que me oblig\u00f3 a buscar soluci\u00f3n externa y finalmente pude resolver gracias a webs como \"pcgamingwiki\"", "timestamp_created": 1670152401, "timestamp_updated": 1673774678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127811244": {"recommendationid": "127811244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060403620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1561, "last_played": 1673198015}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Mass Effect What Else do i need to Say.", "timestamp_created": 1670041796, "timestamp_updated": 1670041796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551092088222503662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127729512": {"recommendationid": "127729512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080046041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 2698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2698, "last_played": 1531949107}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best choice-based action RPG I've ever played.

I don't think it's quite as breathtaking as everyone says it is, but I enjoyed my time with it very much.\n\nMass Effect 2 picks up with Commander Shepard et al. aboard their ship the Normandy, pretty soon after the end of the first game. In short order, they're lasered by a highly advanced flying piece of shit and everyone who isn't a named character dies. Shepard is scooped up by Cerberus, a morally dubious organisation with limitless resources and rebuilt as he was because they have the technology. With his new lease on life, he, and therefore you, must assemble a crack team of professional oversharers who understand even less about delegation than Shepard does, and take on the aliens who lasered you while investigating the disappearances of human colonies around the galaxy. And also do side quests with all the characters you assemble. So far, so good.\n\nMass Effect 2, moreso than 1, I think, is very good at developing at fleshing out the galaxy until it feels as epic as an actual galaxy. Every faction has different opinions, each subplot of each party member splinters off into their own missions that flesh out their perspective on the world. There's always a risk that \"stop the destruction of the galaxy because dying is cringe\" can become completely dull, but Mass Effect 2 understands there's no one single way to end up at that point. \n\nThe running theme of the game that ties it all together is justice. Each character has their own reasons for allying with Shepard and therefore Cerberus, mostly related to their complete distrust in the beaurocracy of the Alliance to get things done mixed with a duty for good that might come from abuse, love, loyalty, etc.. But without guidance or different opinions, each falls victim to the flaws in their own notions of right and wrong. Does a \"code\" endorsed by generations of a species supercede laws? (No) Does murder become justified if the law is incapable of detaining someone peacefully? (Not really) Does a family member have the right to let themselves go to prison for their own reasons, even though the truth proves they shouldn't? (Not if the criminal gets to go free) You as Commander Shepard become the great mediator of the galaxy, standing in the middle of all these perspectives you gathered, respecting each for who they are even though their opinions differ, and making informed choices they never could have made otherwise. It's honestly all great stuff. \n\nI do have some gripes with how all this is presented, however. Of the eight total squad members, each mission allows you to choose two. The sheer number of missions combined with the number of combinations is an exponential volume of writing, that is reasonably not done. So oftentimes characters only have one or two dialogue lines acknowledging their situation. It missions with moral dilemmas to make, like side missions, the debates on the subject are freqently limited to the mission-specific party member and Shepard, plus some NPCs, and the third wheel party member stands in the background of each shot if they're shown at all. Other times missions have such absurdly evil villains that there's no need to debate anything. Fine for the overarching plot, I guess, not so much for side missions. The reason I'm bringing specific party members on these missions is for their specific worldviews and opinions on the matter, but when it just doesn't happen I feel very disappointed. This doesn't always happen, though. I remember a few lines in the mission for the last party member you meet that unexpectedly flipped my thinking on the moral dilemma of day while being completely in character. Moments like that stand out to as the best parts of the game.\n\nAnother problem with the limited dialogue is that there's not much room for showing without telling - understanding how this or that character thinks based on what they say about the events around them rather than being told how they think like you're reading a psych evaluation. Mass Effect 2 prefers the eval method when you talk to your squad between missions. And it can be ages before that conversation is paid off in a side mission. You walk in, get some info - very interesting info, mind you, the krogan in particular was fascinating -  then walk out. Occasionally there's a nice conclusion but I don't feel particularly resolved afterwards. It's annoying, but not a deal breaker by any means.\n\nAs for the gameplay, eh. It's functional. The guns have a nice kick to them. Getting party members to do things felt a bit unnecessary because by the time they've done their ability you could have just killed the enemy yourself. I played on normal and got away with only changing my ammo types and using the team revive ability. The movement can be a bit sluggish and it feels like there are magnets in the walls, but apart from that it's functional. It's a decent enough vehicle for the more interesting story, which is all you can ask for, really.\n\nSo, yeah, all in all, hearty recommendation.

If you don't get enough points into the paragon or renegade scales you'll face consequences. But overall many of the characters such as Jack and Thane are just cheap sci-fi knockoffs.\n\nThe ammo system was changed from the first game, all of sudden you have to get \"thermal clips\" or something instead of having your weapons overheat.

For this, you have to create a big crew of different races, professions and moralities. Together, led by Shepard, you will trek across systems of planets to discover clues and allies to help defeat the Collectors, [spoiler]who are puppets to the even great threat of the series antagonists, the Reapers.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall this game is amazing, from the characters to the immersive worlds you get to play through, the game rarely lets you down aside from a few things here and there. The greatest aspect of the game however is the feeling of actually stepping into the boots of Shepard, and feeling like you're actually viewing all this from their perspective which makes you feel like you're actually becoming a space marine kicking Alien butt.\n\nGame systems have been either removed or improved since the first game. For instance, the game now works on a more Gears of war-esk system of cover and ammo as apposed to the heat sink mechanic of the first one. The dialog system is roughly the same say for an increase in NPC's you speak with during the game, and can freely talk to whenever to ask questions. Speaking of dialog, more romance options were added to the game to further give players more choice. Characters now romanceable of note include Tali and Garus from the first game, two of the more popular team members that return for more action in this outing. Their romances honestly are some of the best in the game, where through these romances we learn some of their fears, desires and maybe a hint of longing that has been there since the beginning.\n\nWhile I can sit here and speak for hours about how perfect this game is... There are some flaws that need to be spoken of. For instance, a lot of the early game feels slow and dull. [spoiler]Grunts mission being a huge bore from beginning to end.[/spoiler] This can be chalked up to that it's the first part of the game, and you need to wait to get into the real meat. Which only really starts at the 7-8 hour mark if you take your time and play through the game properly. Another flaw is that while the vast majority of the squad are amazing characters, some you will never pick and just kinda forget about. They also just feel like people that disappear and hide away on the ship till you seek them out to burnout their dialog tree until the next chapter in the game. Which contrasts to the first game, where there were times all the crew got their shine in the main story, where they had things to comment on and do during the main part rather than just their side stories that it felt organic.\n\nHere? You meet them, get a cutscene, maybe romance them, get their loyalty mission, and maybe get a conflict cutscene where you need enough points to calm both sides down. And that's about it... I would of much preferred at least some members of the crew to comment on and help during mainline missions. .[spoiler]apart from Mordin, when his part is over her gets shunted away again...[/spoiler]. It unfortunately, also suffers from 7th gen brown screen, where most of this game looks like it had a can of Irn-Bru spilled all down it, which makes the game look really awkward and ugly in some places.\n\nOverall, I love this game to death, I can live with its flaws and they don't stop me from playing the game from start to finish every time I pick it up. I can say honestly this is the best game ever made and I will die on that hill.

After playing ME1, a game from 2007, I expected the sequel to be at least as good, But unfortunately, apart from the improved graphics, the sequel brought a bunch of downgrades, the main ones being:\n- limited RPG elements. The improvement points were seriously reduced, leaving only 3-4 stats per character to improve. Additionally the XP seems limited in comparison and each trait costs more for the higher lvl, which means you can level up, but can't improve any stat. Very unfulfilling and frustrating.\n- repetitive missions. I played 16h and more than 20 missions and each looks identical to the prior one. You get to a zone with a linear map (can't explore, no open world, nothing) and there you basically have to shoot your way out. The shooting/killing missions are frustrating because of the limited ammo. I mostly used assault rifle and there were plenty of missions when I was running out of ammo for it and had to rely on my companions to finish the job. Just plain old frustrating.\n\nSome good things included character special missions which unlock a special ability and a much larger squad. And the story which was interesting, same as in the 1st ME. But because the missions were so repetitive and the limited ammo BS made me lose interest quickly.\n\nIn what seems typical for Bethesda - a game with a lot of potential, but poorly executed.\n\nUpdate:\n- I played an additional 15h just to finish the game. The limited ammo thing was solved as I got an upgraded assault rifle that had more ammo and almost never ran out. But the missions still looked identical to the ones before.

That said I couldn't help but notice that a non-casual challenge seeking approach wouldn't go well with it due to a number of small flaws (which mostly remain unnoticed in casual play). Anyway: I was excited to import my character to ME2 and continue a great journey!\n\nAs I interpret it Bioware noticed the same flaws I noticed and tried to fix them... and that's where things went wrong. \n\nNow we have ammunition, which leads to a need to change weapons in every fight and / or move a lot to collect clips during combat. To me (and a number of other people if I read the forum right) that feels forced and isn't really fun. I imagine it's supposed to break up a repetitive slow paced combat routine, which isn't necessarily a bad idea. XCOM2 tried the same with turn timers and it's basically the same problem: Forcing the player to play a style he never chose just doesn't feel right. Apart from that ME2 \"fixed\" the inventory clutter of ME1, but although it kinda works it also mostly gets rid of the fun of looting. \n\nThe game now allows to start on Insane (highest difficulty) right away. That's a plus. Only these games are best enjoyed casually and the combat system doesn't necessarily scale up well with difficulty. Efficiency can lead to silly and non-fun gameplay. The focus on casual play is actually what makes most sense - it is and always has been bioware's biggest strength as I see it. The plot, characters and atmosphere make their games great and distracting from it just makes those games worse. Mind if You played KOTOR 1 & 2 or Dragon Age and saw it differently chance is You'll also see it differently here, since I perceive that as a generic bioware thing.\n\nWhat I perceive as a major obstacle in designing a gameplay that works on very high difficulties without becoming silly might also be the clash of RPG and FPS. It's daring! Bioware RPGs seem to be real time, but under the hood their fantasy RPGs are more like continuous turn based games. That attracts certain players and a certain playstyle - different players and playstyles than First Person Shooters. Trying to allow both is tricky and I reckon that's a major part why it is really hard to come up with a solution that suits everybody. My guess, anyway. \nPerhaps going Vanguard class (close range and probably more action heavy) would be more satisfying for an FPS player. Since I lean towards tactical turn based RPGs I played Infiltrator (sniper) and was really annoyed to be forced out of cover, unable to carry enough ammunition to play through a single fight with my sniper rifle. Felt like my char is forced to do stupid. It's fine in difficulty, but it breaks with my idea of the character and diminishes exactly the very strength of bioware - storytelling. \n\nPlot wise it might be as good as ME1 I guess, but to me it doesn't feel like it yet. I'm not through yet, but I already lost my motivation. Although the story starts with the bang it basically [i]has to[/i] build up of course. After the high of ME1's endgame that didn't work too well for me: It feels shallow and can't seemlessly take off from where ME1 left us. It's not to be held against the game perhaps - it's just really hard to follow up on a great game. Sadly it feels, anyway. Add the gameplay disappointments and I'm kinda out of it. Heard similar perspectives from others on the forum.\n\nPerhaps the biggest problem are the [i]high expectations[/i] I carried over from ME1. It's Mass Effect alright!

SPAMMEROS DE MISIONES DE OLEADAS!\nNunca algo diferente, nunca un puzzle donde deba usar mis habilidades, nunca una mision donde mis compa\u00f1eros tomen relevancia, nunca nada.\nSiempre esas dos mismos tipos de misiones.\nLa unica mision interesante que recuerdo es del corredor sombrio, tiene un buen jefe final pero es solo un dlc, el resto de la historia siempre es lo mismo, pasillo simulator.\nCon la cantidad de lore que hay entre las diferentes razas pod\u00edan haberme puesto alg\u00fan puto puzzle, alg\u00fan acertijo o algo para avanzar en las misiones y hacerlos mas interesantes.\nDesgraciadamente no fue el caso.\n\nRealmente siento que el combate esta como relleno en esta saga de juegos, es muy malo e innecesario, realmente siento que armaron un esquema de \"Historia - combate - Historia\" y los combates solo est\u00e1n como excusa para tenerte un rato jugando a algo hasta terminar la misi\u00f3n y seguir avanzando en la historia.\n\nJuegos como Uncharted de PS3 ya hac\u00edan un mejor sistema de misiones. Tenia puzzles que resolver, parkour, hambientes variados, desde la selva mas verde hasta desiertos bien marrones, misiones en aviones y auto.\nY todo lo manten\u00eda con una buena historia, si, para nada compleja y enlazada como las de mass effect pero cumpl\u00eda su lavor.\n\nSi tan solo le dieran mucha mas relevancia al gameplay de combate este juego seria perfecto. Siento que no aprovechan bien lo que tienen y hacen un sistema de combate para cumplir.\n\nTodo es igual, ve de punto A a B, entre medios de pasillos que cambian de skin seg\u00fan el planeta.\nMata a *esponja de da\u00f1o con skin diferente*.\nEnfr\u00e9ntate a boss o resiste oleadas.\nFin.\n\nEl \u00fanico lugar miniamente memorable es el Afterlife, aqu\u00ed puedo decir que hicieron una buena ambientaci\u00f3n y es divertido pasarse por ah\u00ed, pero de ah\u00ed en mas no existe nada que sea recordable.\n\nSigo y mantendr\u00e9 mi opini\u00f3n, HASTA ESTE JUEGO, mass effect seria mucho mejor juego si fuese un juego \u00fanicamente de narrativa con opciones.\n\nNo recomiendo esta versi\u00f3n, comprar\u00eda la versi\u00f3n definitive edition y lo jugar\u00eda ah\u00ed.\n",

Released in 2010, this installment in the Mass Effect trilogy transcends the boundaries of traditional storytelling and gameplay, offering players an unforgettable journey through the Milky Way galaxy. As a dedicated fan who has experienced Commander Shepard's epic quest multiple times, I'm thrilled to share my detailed review of Mass Effect 2.\n\nGameplay (10/10):\nMass Effect 2 refines the gameplay introduced in the first installment, creating an action-packed and immersive experience. The cover-based combat system is smooth and responsive, allowing for dynamic firefights against a variety of formidable foes. Character progression is more streamlined, with a wider range of powers and abilities that enable players to customize their Shepard's combat style. The loyalty missions for each squad member not only deepen their character development but also contribute to the game's overall strategy, as building a strong team is crucial to your success in the suicide mission at the game's climax.\n\nStorytelling (10/10):\nThe narrative in Mass Effect 2 is a masterclass in storytelling. The stakes are higher, the mysteries are deeper, and the character-driven drama is both emotionally resonant and thought-provoking. The game excels in building a sense of urgency as Shepard assembles a diverse crew and confronts a new and insidious threat to the galaxy. Choices made in the first game carry over, shaping the world and relationships in meaningful ways, and new decisions further impact the fate of your crew and the galaxy. The game's ability to immerse players in its richly realized universe and its morally complex dilemmas is unparalleled.\n\nCharacter Development (10/10):\nMass Effect 2 places a strong emphasis on character development, and it excels in this regard. Each squad member has a compelling backstory and loyalty mission that delves into their past, personal struggles, and motivations. The interactions with these characters, both in the heat of battle and during moments of quiet reflection aboard the Normandy, deepen your emotional investment in their fates. The choices you make throughout the game can lead to profound consequences, including the potential loss of beloved squad members, making every decision weighty and impactful.\n\nGraphics and Sound (9/10):\nIn 2010, Mass Effect 2's graphics were a significant leap forward, with stunning character models and detailed environments. While they may not rival the visual fidelity of more recent games, the art direction remains captivating, and the cinematic presentation enhances the overall experience. The game's memorable soundtrack and expertly crafted sound design heighten the emotional impact of key moments and contribute to the immersive atmosphere of the Mass Effect universe.\n\nMass Effect 2 is often cited as a prime example of how narrative-driven games can excel. Its ability to weave complex storytelling, character development, and player choice into a cohesive and engaging experience has set a high standard for RPGs and narrative-driven games in general. The impact of the Mass Effect series on the industry as a whole, from storytelling to character development, cannot be overstated.\n\nMy personal journey with Mass Effect 2 has been one of profound emotional investment and awe. The characters, their struggles, and the decisions I made as Commander Shepard have left a lasting impact on me.

AI is improved. So is the use of cover. Making the skill tree less complicated, more straightforward is easier, but there's still kind of a lot going on so it's hard to build a team and grow it and make each member capable of doing certain things (tank, glass cannon, sniper, mage, etc.). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, true, but playing on those is difficult.\n\nI miss all of the vehicular and extravehicular parts of the firs game. There's just straight-up no MAKO; rather than improve on it, they simply did away with it. I feel like that was an important exclusion, a missed opportunity. What did become easier was exploring all of the planets.\n\nResource acquisition is so crucial for the early game, but by somewhere around the midpoint it doesn't become so important because you have way more than enough resources to get the job done. Somewhere around 60% into this game I stopped picking every planet dry because I realized I would never go through my resource stockpiles. Most of the planets after that I just threw one probe onto it for the sake of completion progress. Later, I started going back on that just to see how many resources I could stockpile. I ended up with 60,000 eezo, and 200k-300k of everything else.\n\nThe difficulty in acquiring money was challenging to work through. I had thought it to be unbalanced and unfair, but it's actually a very crucial check on advancing in the game. It's almost impossible to get *all* of the upgrades in one playthrough, but it's very telling that you can get *almost* all of them in one playthrough if you're careful. I ended my game with just 20,000 credits and only 1-3 outstanding upgrades left (all on the citadel).\n\nThe level design was deeply inspired. Gone are the repetitive building interiors of part 1, where a lot of the mercenary/pirate/cerberus buildings were carbon copies of each other. Every single structure you fight in and around is unique. This is seriously inspired level design. No two scenarios play alike. I think there's something like fifty different levels in this game? Maybe more? All were individually designed to be unique and serve a purpose, and the gameplay revolves around that. There is some literal, genius-level architecture involved here. Scenario design, too. The weakness of the actual scenario design is that it felt somewhat repetitive: you could always expect some amount of a given resource, unlocking computers for bonus money, etc. in every level. It was just repetitive enough to feel like it was breaking the immersion, and yet even THAT was covered up just enough by the amazing level design to make me not care all that much about it. Had the level design not been as good, the repetition would have been more ingratiating. Part of the repetition was getting resources that I already had piles of, and so the acquisition felt unnecessary.\n\nOne part that really bugged me was how few people you actually got to rescue when you discovered unknown or undiscovered ship crashes, boardings, etc. ALL of the \"good\" people were killed or slauthered or disappeared. Almost no one was left to rescue. It was sad. I carried that with me through the game. \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\" indeed.\n\nThe character DAS (design, acting, scripts) were deeply inspired. Easily as good if not better than the first game. That doesn't necessarily mean the character DAS wasn't good in the first game - it was at least as good as any big-budget Hollywood film - but it's that somehow they found a way to make it ALL even better in this game. What an unbelievable feat. This was due in no small part to all of the veteran voice acting talent. The ONLY two sticking points to me: 1) Shepard's dialogue, at times, felt somewhat terse and forced. It wasn't just the voice acting - and I definitely had an issue with the voice acting - but it was also the facial expressions and mannerisms. Shepard was supposed to be the rock, the one everyone could depend on. Not once did he shed a tear for anyone. The other sticking point was that Keith David's character really just didn't do much. There was almost almost zero interaction with the council, but I'll go over that in the next paragraph.\n\nThe council and political discussion is below. For now, I want to give major props to the amazing voice talent in this game:\n\nJoker - Seth Green (Idle Hands, Robot Chicken, Family Guy)\nJacob - Adam Lazarre-White\nShepard - Mark Meer, Jennifer Hale (Metal Gear Solid series as Naomi Hunter, and many more)\nGarrus Vakarian - Brandon Keener. I REALLY liked the character of Garrus, and I feel like he only got better in the second game. They gave him a ton of emotional depth and growth as a character, and it was very refreshing to see.\nTali'Zorah - Ash Sroka. Tali being considered a romance option took me completely by surprise. Her also having an extremely involving and challenging character arc was also a surprise. The exceptional job they did developing her character, and the amazing voice acting and scenario design around her character, was definitely a welcome change. I definitely missed having Ash as a romantic partner, but I guess the inner Captian Kirk in me won out because I definitely fell in love with a purple-skinned alien babe.\nLiara T'Soni - Ali Hills. Liara played a more minor role, and yet it was still a pleasure to see her. Ali did an amazing job voicing her again. I can tell she thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in the moment portraying Liara.\nMordin - Courtenay Taylor. Holy hell, Mordin doing theatre & singing was unexpected! It was goofy and spontaneous! And good! This is the kind of exceptional character design and thought that went into this game, and why I continued to enjoy playing it.\nGrunt - Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop as Spike Spiegel). Grunt is an amazing character. It helps that he's the best tank in the game, but despite being the Mass Effect analog of a caveman or gorilla or a Klingon, he's a surprisingly deep and complicated character. Steve Blum's acting absolutely helped Grunt come to life as a completely unique character in the game.\nThane Krios - Keythe Farley. I lost Thane in my playthrough, and definitely felt sad to be without him. He was a complicated character. His was a story of suffering and redemption. If you want a close example of what Thane is like, read \"The Way of Kings\" Book 1 of the Stormlight Archive. Thane is almost equal to Szeth in that book.\nSamara - Maggie Baird. I really loved this deep, insightful character. I have to wonder how difficult it was to properly voice Samara given that she was supposed to be warm and caring, yet cold and calculating like a machine. There's a lot of emotional complication going on there.\n\nNow, on to the politics: (see comments)", "timestamp_created": 1636322511, "timestamp_updated": 1636322855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102403245": {"recommendationid": "102403245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085522842", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2920, "last_played": 1695844143}, "language": "english", "review": "This is lying around in my library for years, finally picked it up and went on one hell of a journey.

The paragon vs renegade is no longer a morality counter but two separate bars you just fill up so that you can choose to punch someone in a weird sort of mid-dialogue QTE.

Most of those are actually good.\nAnd I can sympathize with devs being between a rock and a hard place. As you don't want DLC to just be pointless filler, that too will feel like ripping off players, you want DLC to feel like it's worth the money, something that was made with care, effort, passion. But, it's also something that, because it can be great and feel right at home in a game, could feel sleazy to a player being this thing not already integrated into the base experience without forking over more cash.\n\nThe sad truth is that ME2 on its own on Steam is an incomplete experience, you're missing out on great stuff without all the expansions that are available on Origin.\nBut where there's a will there's a way, one that doesn't involve anything illegal or fishy.\nThere's a Steam Guide going over steps to play ME2 on Steam legitimately with all the DLC. The catch is that you have to own ME2 & the DLC on Origin. But, if you have them there already, or will buy it on sale, then the steps are to make sure CD keys from Steam are registered on your Origin version, make sure you've logged into the Cerberus account (EA online) in ME2 on origin (you can uninstall it from origin after that and don't need to open Origin again), then install ME2 on Steam and make sure to also log in your Steam version ME2 with the same EA login, download all DLC manually to install for the Steam version, login again to your steam version of ME2 with EA online, and it should work, you don't need to login anymore.\nAfter that install mods from nexusmods with the ME3tweaks modmanager if you so desire, Project Variety could be good, but I've also had some issues, bugs, crashes with it.\n\nTo most that will understandably be too much, I have enough love for Mass Effect and enough intolerance to EA Origin these days that this wasn't an issue, and I've had a smooth fun complete experience of ME2 on steam now.\n\nStory picks up shortly after ME1, takes some neat twists and turns. And though there's a slightly grittier tone to ME2, it's also a lot more humorous, fun, bombastic, and has more environmental jokes sprinkled in with just overall more personality and charm than before. \nA lot more action integrated into your roleplaying and not just gameplay and dialogue. \nI remember not particularly liking the \"interrupt\" system originally, it felt too QTE-like to me, but on replaying, I see a place for them, it's not like failing to press in time the paragon/renegade interrupt will result in an instant death like is normal in videogame QTEs, but it's a choice, even not taking the opportunity is a part of that roleplaying (though usually taking them is more fun when you can). Interrupts allow a scene to flow without having to pause with characters just statically standing there locked in a conversation, but create a choice that's not necessarily just words or shooting, but an action.\nAlso appreciated in ME2 is how Paragon isn't necessarily anymore just a complete pacifist and diplomat, but can have an edge to them. And the romance feels slightly less forced, turning someone away can still feel like you're being friendly and on the same page.\n\nI've always liked the connection between the games, transferring a save, having that character, with their history with the previous characters, even if very limited and shown in offhand incidental dialogue, it's still enough to give a sense of having spent time with them, having built a companionship through adventures you've shared throughout.\nI wish ME2 had what ME3 had, with characters not just standing in their designated rooms just waiting quietly for Shepard to approach and talk with them, that's a positive ME3 did where you could find them between missions in different areas, possibly talking with different people.\n\nThe Animation quality is greatly improved over ME1. \nMany NPCs, critical and even incidental ones, have more varied and unique animations, so that you see less often the same ones, smiles, crying, angry expressions not only look better but are used more often to lessen the feeling that you're talking to robots, only Shepard comes off more robotic when you see them more often just asking a neutral question, and the transitions between animation states is smoother, which was a bit jarring in ME1. And the camerawork, more frequently dynamic framing of a scene coupled with more expressively distinct gestures makes each shot more lively, polished. Not to mention the improved writing, more characters that feel distinct from each other with different styles of speaking, both in voice acting and words. You put those together, more varied animations, better individualized engaging writing with voice acting, smoother more dynamic camerawork, and a lot more scenes now stick out and feel really satisfying to watch and engage in.\n\nThere are a lot of cute little optional \"missions\" that the game doesn't really throw in your face, just scan a planet, and run into one, and there's a lot less recycled content in them, the areas don't repeat like they did in ME1, and they can even be noncombat areas, just switching it up. Which was refreshing, as a person who tends to have that 100% completionist urge, it felt good to just go around the galaxy and see if I could find more of those missions that will switch things up between planet scanning (which can get repetitive) and bigger missions.\n\nCombat follows more of of the action shooter variety than a traditional RPG, you pick up new weapons that serve different roles, like you're playing a FPS with a swiss army knife arsenal, powers too, enemies have weapon variety and shields/barriers/armor that sticks out more and creates more of a need to prioritize and match your tools to their makeup. It's still fun, a bit frustrating at times though, there can be that bullet sponginess to enemies which require you to optimize how you hit them.\nSquad AI does seem surprisingly stupid, they do very little on their own, shotgun squadmates run away to sniper ranges, they stay behind cover with poor line of sights, you feel forced to keep giving them specific orders a lot.\nAlso a subjective thing, I did not like the original controls, having spacebar do interact/sprint/cover/mantle, so I edited my coalesced ini separating them, exclusive use for E, Shift for sprint, spacebar could be mantle and cover/exit, then I made middle mouse button to command both squadmates to move/attack combined, just so that I could more easily stay in the action without awkwardly individually in the moment give commands. Made the experience a lot smoother and juicier.\nJust something you can do if you want more control over bindings.\n\nTo save space I'm going to skip my usual performance points, just say that it runs well enough on a 7 year old potato laptop, and that ME2 is one of the greats, a fun followup to ME1 and the continuation of both story and your own journey, even if with a bit of illusory decisionmaking, still is a good enough magic trick to create that sense of it being your personal story with characters you've bonded with, appealing to universal human nature.\nSteam version needs a lot of effort for the best experience, but hey, Steam DRM gives a much better service than Origin.", "timestamp_created": 1632489154, "timestamp_updated": 1632497749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99827571": {"recommendationid": "99827571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148676717", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 541, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1508204583}, "language": "english", "review": "Get the remaster.", "timestamp_created": 1632388909, "timestamp_updated": 1632388909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449717313051223755", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99770815": {"recommendationid": "99770815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174541149", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1600356761}, "language": "english", "review": "This was everything.

There has been cases where I found the critically acclaimed game to be just OK (Bioshock Infinite) and critically okayed game to be brilliant (Darksiders), but I've never had a case where I found the critically praised and universally beloved game to be absolute trash until Mass Effect 1&2.\n\nI just don't get what's in this game that people love. I can name 20 games released before this that looks, feels and plays a 100 times better than this. \n\n- The graphics is garbage. The characters look like malformed wax models. The environment looks like prototypes created by amateurs\n- The gunplay sucks, the mouse sensitivity is too high, I never feel I am in control. And I hate those pew pew guns. It's so easy to duck and dodge. Just give me an AK47\n- And those $hitty cover mechanics. Shepard's head is always sticking out but no one can shoot him when he is covering. But when the enemy is ducking and covering, I can shoot his head. That is just lame.\n- Another thing I hate about cover mechanics in general. When there is a cover crate then I know the enemies are going to come in soon. It simply spoils the surprise. And the enemies are so stupid. They keep shooting when I am in cover knowing fully well that the shots wont hit me.\n- Movement is trash. Guy can't run fast enough and just a little bit of exertion and he gets tired. WTF\n- Lighting is all fu*ked up. The shadows are all at the wrong places. And there is no shades, it just goes black. We are supposed to be in 22nd century in all the glory of the future and the rooms are not well lit?? I mean who the f designed the lighting??\n- facial mechanics is laughable. Eyes has it's own mind, mouth has it's own mind. And it's interplay is laughably ugly. I can't make those faces even if i try.\n- Oh and those dialog choices. It is so frustrating to see one thing on the screen and Shepard uttering something else. This was touted as an innovation but it's a passing fancy at best and irritating crap at worst.\n\nok given, story is mildly interesting and dialog mechanics are competent. \n\nSo all in all, headache inducing movement, levels built with cardboards, graphics engine created by amateurs... and 94 on metacritic???\n\n10/100", "timestamp_created": 1630001664, "timestamp_updated": 1641842213, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.309455156326293945", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98111616": {"recommendationid": "98111616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111523041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1596732279}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice", "timestamp_created": 1629748978, "timestamp_updated": 1629748978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98080624": {"recommendationid": "98080624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205274197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1629894034}, "language": "english", "review": "Not gonna lie, best continuation ever", "timestamp_created": 1629705403, "timestamp_updated": 1629705403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98002596": {"recommendationid": "98002596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116459583", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 733, "last_played": 1591953321}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice\n\n[h1]9/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1629585899, "timestamp_updated": 1629585899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97992925": {"recommendationid": "97992925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142909441", "num_games_owned": 1021, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1629572088}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como logras cambiar tanto los controles para que sean mas malos que los de la primera entrega?", "timestamp_created": 1629572242, "timestamp_updated": 1629572242, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97981669": {"recommendationid": "97981669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164033173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1730, "last_played": 1675713929}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like Star Trek!\n\nIts my first playtrought. I am almost at the end. \n\nA classic Sci-Fi experience. It \"feels like Star Trek!\" The story is quite light but interesting. Characters arcs aren't to deep but also quite well put together. There is alot of interesting dialogue to be had with choices (Sometimes you need to make 'em quick!) that impact the game world and ending of course. Not to be mistaken with the dialogue choices  to be found in older action rpg's like FNV, fallout 3 and Oblivion and so on but more in like with Horizon: Zero Dawn. It gives the game a movie-like feeling and the story progresses in a healthy pace because of this imo. \n\nI am a 50% fan of this combat system because it feels clunky. Sprinting and cover fail so much. And thats about it but it has a big impact on the overall combat. Gun variety is not there but I actually like that. It is just more fun to not have to get distracted with gear. It is not so much a part of the game. Basically you get  four/five types of weapons as you progress trough the game and you can upgrade the overall damage output of the class of weapons via upgrade tokens/resources. Thats it. The biotic powers are fun. Not over the top just some basic stuff. They kept it simple. Again a fine choice imo. \n\nThe Quests are okay. Some are fun. Some are interesting. Some are intruiging and some are sad. But they failed to deliver a quest that combines all of these. Not one quests touches me emotionally so deep that it makes it interesting to think about afterwards. I feel RPG's miss out on this alot lately and also back in the day. Make it a grind. Keep 'em busy. Mass effect isn't that bad as that of course. I would rate the quests 7/10 actually. They have a really fun and exploring vibe to them. Like I said - Star trek. Only SOME side-quests are really meh. Very boring and some they even forced in the game. With dialogue and animations that are just cringe. \n\nAll round this is a very solid  RPG with mistakes in clunky combat. Some bad scripting in side-quests and the occasional bug here and there. (Quite often).

I was upset to find it did NOT include DLC.  Also upset it didn't support controllers. Also also upset that it crashed every 5 minutes (found out that was due to a texture mod ((Don't use ME3 Mod Manager from Nexus, ya'll.)))  But then I decided to shelve it.  Flash forward to the release of legendary.  Pc = Potato.  But maybe it can run the original ME's?  Yes, it can.  SO,  Nexus has controller support mods.  AWESOME.  They WORK!  And so I see someone in communities suggesting the following: use your steam key and redeem it in ORigin.  Purchase the DLC there and install.  Then, copy the DLC folders to steam version.  WHABAM.  ME2 with DLCs, in Steam.  Insert Tim Allen \"Man\" grunt.  I buy do this.  I buy the DLC in Origin.  They charged me.  I has a receipt with order number.  Insert Pepe hands cause here's where things go south...\n\nLong story short, Origin needs to be linked to your Steam account because.... reasons.  Since my account is so old, my EA account was ported to Origin and my Steam was linked... to an origin account using a typoed version of my email address used for my steam account.  Because of this, Origin/EA refuses to link to my steam or fix the error unless I can guess the typo or provide a proof of purchase from 2013 formatted in a way that Steam has only done in recent years.... not in 2013.  My email proof of purchase for ME2: useless.  Showing them that I have ME2 in my steam library, have had it since 2013 and can even provide keys: useless.\n\nPardon me while I spend the next 2 games arguing with a Turian Shopkeep in the Citadel Markets that I purchased my ME2 at his booth but get no-where cause my proof of purchase isn't proof of purchasy enough for him to help me...\n\nBuy game AND DLC straight from Origin... or better yet, get it on console.

Plus, there are a few moments that carry this game for me.\n\nThat being said, Mass Effect 2 has to be one of the least enjoyable experiences I've ever had in gaming. This game is an RPG, and that RPG-ness makes itself known through gameplay (weapons, powers, 'builds') and the choices you make throughout the story.\n\nThe gameplay is bad. It's absolutely pathetic. Even by 2010 standards, this gameplay and mission design is bonafide Prothean era. Your weapons and your powers (should you choose to have them) make themselves available in the most clunky way imaginable. Your squadmates' AI is laughably bad at best, and cancer at worst. It's not just that the gameplay is bad, it's that the levels feel endless, with the same bad corner-based shooter loop lasting for far longer than it should. It genuinely feels like BioWare thought they have the best damn gameplay in the world and decided to put the player through the same rut again and again. The game will drop you on an alien planet and force you to explore it with pathetic exploration mechanics that will make you long for some action. When you do get to the action, you'll want nothing more than to leave the fight sequences behind. The gameplay also wrecks any sort of 'immersion' you're expecting in this game. \n\nThe story side of things is where I'm a bit conflicted. For the most part, I didn't like it. Except for 3 levels, one of them being the final level (you know the one), every single 'RPG' aspect of this game feels more like spur-of-the-moment rather than something you earned. This game doesn't even have a lot of 'main story' missions, mostly just recruitment and loyalty missions that don't advance the overall plot too much. They add a lot to the lore, sure but that sort of gets old after a while. Of course, what little storytelling most missions do have is marred by bad gunplay. \n\nI've heard a lot about people playing this game, again and again, to see the different choices and the different outcomes. Unfortunately, I did not see any merit in warranting another playthrough. \n\nMy recommendation is to get the Legendary Edition and play ME1- import save to ME2 - play ME - import save to ME3 - play ME3 - eventually be greeted by an ending that doesn't care about your choices at all. DO NOT make the same mistake I did, which is playing this game as a standalone experience.\n\nAs someone who did play this game as a standalone experience, it's pretty damn clear to me how this is the same BioWare that ended up making Anthem. With what little I've seen, I do not doubt that these guys can make a decent RPG game. But an Action/Adventure game?

Unfortunately, all important actions are mapped to one button, which sometimes makes life harder and not easier. Much has improved though, from the third person shooting to the exploration of the galaxy as a whole. The story has a rough start, but soon picks up the pace and delivers a very rich experience, with three dimensional characters that each have understandable motives and relatable stories. This somehow makes the main storyline feel less central to the game this time, which feels a bit odd, but thanks to some amazing DLCs and an incredible finale, it makes up for it in the end.

no se aplica a este t\u00edtulo, si el Mass Effect 1 te gusto, el 2 te va a encantar.\n\n Seguimos la historia un tiempo despu\u00e9s de lo que paso en el primer Mass Effect, pudiendo importar tu partida del primer juego lo cual te da ciertos beneficios, la historia realmente esta genial y hay much\u00edsimas misiones secundarias practicamente diferentes todas ellas y valen la pena hacerlas no solo por las recompensas, si no por que expande el mundo del juego cont\u00e1ndote diferentes historias,  etc.\n\n En este segundo juego no usaremos el coche por los planetas, pero exploraremos la galaxia con la Normand\u00eda, donde podremos enviar sondas a los diferentes planetas para conseguir materiales que nos ser\u00e1n de gran utilidad ya que podemos fabricar nuevo equipo y mejoras.\n\n Realmente es un juego muy \u00e9pico, una historia gal\u00e1ctica interesante, con muchos personajes interesantes y variados tanto jugables como NPC\u00b4s, los gr\u00e1ficos no son nada del otro mundo, pero mejoran bastante conforme al primer juego.\n\n Una de las cosas que me gusto del juego es que a los enemigos les aparece un cuadrado rojizo que te ayuda a localizarlos f\u00e1cilmente y la mira de apuntar es grande y bien visible (cuando tienes una visi\u00f3n baja agradeces este tipo de detalles), la otra cosa que me gusto tambi\u00e9n es que en este juego hay balas XD, se que suena raro, pero en el primer juego no hab\u00eda balas y se hac\u00eda extra\u00f1o, es verdad que la saga esta enfocada al ROL (RPG), pero el detalle de las balas le da cierto punto de dificultad (Quedarte sin balas frente a un Cascar\u00f3n NO ES BUENA IDEA XD)\n\n En definitiva, para no hacer Spoilers y no hacer este an\u00e1lisis una biblia... si aun no lo has comprado te estas perdiendo un

I think I compared it too much with the first Mass Effect and found that it lacked RPG elements (I'm a big fan of KOTOR by BIoware, which is why I began playing the series in the first place). Playing it now without those expectations, I find it much more enjoyable. The shooter action is fun with the bionic element pretty well balanced. The story is not that great, just like building a team until the end (to my knowledge, haven't completed it yet though).

one\nCombat is engaging and not as brainless as in ME1 as enemies tend to kill us if we just run them down and you have to use abilities that are less powerfull and not as many as but on way lower cooldown (5 seconds that in some cases can be shortened with upgrades I think)\nStrong gears of war gameplay and it just lacks good melee or any sort of finishers but besides that it's nothing but pleasure to shoot from behind the boxes existing on every step\nAbility tree is smaller and more character specific as you have 2 class skills 1 for their \"specialization\" and one that upgrades after completing loyality mission and you get levels after missions both main with cool summary of the mission and after side quest that are way less rewarding but still can get us a level or two during playghtrough\nStory tends to be boring and it's still nothing special that you may have seen somewhere before but loyality missions and talking with crew to get to know them and their stories was interesting at least for me and they're nothing revelatory but just good way to make a brake in main story\nEquipment was replaced by chosing loadout at the start of the mission which is way better than looking through 40 weapons to see if something fit better or is stronger version of already equiped gear but they could have left gear modifications and still add upgrades from med lab station but I guess it makes more sense that way so it makes more sense and makes every weapon special if you can't turn it into same thing with mods\nFlying through galaxy is way better as we have fuel and sonds and there is no mako missions or whatever this shitty vehicle was and missions we can find exploring planets are not made of same building with boxes tossed somewhere else but I don't think that there is any need to check every system so I went for just enough to get every upgrade and didn't ventrue further with scaning\nBiggest flaw is the lenght as I completed it in 40h while watching yt for at least 10h and flying around the planets to look for quests and buying twice every fish as I forgot to feed them and first one with like same ratio of time spent on actual gameplay took about 20h more\nBiggest quality are fish and ship models that we can buy so our room will look nice\nBetter than first one but still not something I would go back to for paragon playgthrough as it's not worth imo\nAnd remember to buy legendary edition to at least get steam achivs from every part or go for EA play to just make it cheap", "timestamp_created": 1623887388, "timestamp_updated":

[/h1] \n  Mass Effect 2 - the second part of a wonderful trilogy from BioWare. Winner of multiple awards (including GOTY 2010) and probably one of the best sci-fi game out there. So, what is this game about ? \n  Let's start with a story - just like in ME 1, - it is amazing. It is a story of love, friendship, family. Story about overcoming difficulties for the sake of a higher goal. The only possible downside is that for the first \u2248 10 hours of gameplay almost nothing happens in terms of story. In the middle of the game, story slowly but surely developing and \"accelerating\". And in the final - the story \"explodes\" and hits you hard. Throughout the game, player can experience all possible kinds of emotions. Story is deep, emotional and dramatic. It is simply necessary to experience and go through it to understand how great and \"powerful\" it really is. \n   Compared with ME 1, gameplay has changed a little. Now, feels like it become less RPG-type and more shooter-type game. A couple of new interesting mechanics and things were implemented. Sadly, secondary missions became even more uninteresting and monotone: Travel to another planet \u2192 Kill everyone \u2192 Mission completed. Of course, there are exceptions, but this is the majority of secondary missions. Other than that, gameplay is great. Brilliant and unique combat system. Excellent dialogue system - you can literally spend hours talking to other characters. Overall, character development is insane. Each character is unique and feels alive. It is not just a bunch of emotionless dolls.  Also, game has interesting weapon/equipment/character upgrade system. Lots of different skills, mechanics. And although I must admit that sometimes it might feel like the game is boring - especially when doing secondary missions, it happens extremely rare - thanks to the interesting and unique gameplay.\n   Talking about the graphics, ME 1 looked absolutely incredible for it's age (2007). In ME 2, obviously there are some improvements, but really nothing special. For 2010 game looks just fine. Also, throughout all the  \u2248 35 hours of gameplay, I haven't \"discovered\" any bugs, glitches or crashes. \n  [b]  Mass Effect 2 is a great game. It has incredible story, interesting and unique gameplay and also an ok graphics with great technical part. Mass Effect 2 is a one unforgettable journey. Therefore, I would recommend this game to everyone. If you somehow missed it, don't waste anymore time and play this. Definitely worth your time.

I only played this recently, so the game probably felt much different in January 2010, but I still feel like the game aged pretty well and it's still got charm/value to it. Shooting felt fun thanks to the inclusion of special abilities, ammo augmentation with skills, and the ability to freely control where your allies take cover mid combat, though there was probably a little too much combat, wherein I was more excited for the dialogue choices and narrative.\n\nBuilding the crew was satisfying, with an assortment of very interesting personalities in it (Tali waifu asf). Overall the quests to earn their membership to your crew and the loyalty missions were pretty fun and their own little quirky adventures.\n\nNow tot he caveats: \n\n1) No cloud save means that if you beat 1 and then get a new computer without manually transferring the save files, means you lose access to all the work (I) you put into (my) your first game's paragon run that did almost all of the side content. There are apparently save files you can find online, I didn't do that and didn't think to do that till 10 hours into this one, overall just kind of shitty though. Especially since the default state is literally a trash run of mass effect 1, ie you have bad choices from the first game, did no side content at all, etc. This is extra bad because you are honestly probably locked out of choices in this game too, I due to doing loyalty missions in another order than the meta, had EVERYONE but Miranda's loyalty, which I think might play a part in the save file going forward. I also had to make a decision I didn't really want to make to get paragon points to try to alter that fate, but it didn't work. \n\n2) Scanning planets to probe for resources/misc side missions is pretty god damn monotonous and boring, holy crap, what a waste of time the actual probing for resources is, even if it's needed to a point to get an optimal ending + do misc side quests on the planets that aren't tied to your crew.\n\n3) Without looking online, you don't know where the point of no return to do side content is, luckily I knew.\n\n4) I don't like the inclusion of ammo, the first games charging guns that had cool-downs after overheating them was perfect for the setting and everything, this just added another annoying small thing.\n\n\nOverall a good game worth playing (if you play 1 first, both for technical reasons and narrative reasons), but with some annoying aspects to it, but still pretty great, EA and BioWare don't make games like this anymore.", "timestamp_created": 1622392895, "timestamp_updated": 1622392895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92834907": {"recommendationid": "92834907", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064740714", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1394, "last_played": 1624746108}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta bueno\n", "timestamp_created": 1622338092, "timestamp_updated": 1622338092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92809055": {"recommendationid": "92809055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013586377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4749, "last_played": 1622306084}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and exciting conclusion.", "timestamp_created": 1622306141, "timestamp_updated": 1622306141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92749772": {"recommendationid": "92749772", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012965913", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1622954202}, "language": "english", "review": "needs better controller configs but other then that still the same great game it was way back when", "timestamp_created": 1622229732, "timestamp_updated": 1622229732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92735029": {"recommendationid": "92735029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958439128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1425, "last_played": 1622331070}, "language": "english", "review": "tali best girl yes yes buy", "timestamp_created": 1622212747, "timestamp_updated": 1622212747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49154973030090332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92695033": {"recommendationid": "92695033", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982093588", "num_games_owned": 711, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1929, "last_played": 1607924300}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite in the trilogy.

If the player completed ME1 and has a save file, they will be given the option of importing that file with their already-built character and with the choices/consequences at the end of that previous game (though they appear somewhat minimal). Shepard and the Normandy are attacked by an unknown foe, the good commander is blown into space ... and the game begins.\n\nIn general, ME2 functions much like the first game; the player has an overarching mission (quest) to achieve and a lot of running around to do in the meantime. You get messages about potential team members you'll need to stop the Big Bads, and have to set off to recruit them from various far-flung locations around the galaxy. Some of them will be familiar from the first game and it was always fun to be reunited with my old teammates. The ship interface, to fly around the galaxy--where you can probe planets for minerals needed to upgrade gear and find side-missions--is pretty simple and easy to use. You'll engage in dialogue with a multitude of characters, which gives you the option to make create \"good\" engagements (paragon) or \"bad\" (renegade). The former generally involves acting more just, even-handed, and selfless, while the latter is more cocky or aggressive. The further a character gets down the paragon or renegade scale, the more dialogue options in those trees open up. Some of these decisions come up as color-coded Quick-Time-style events in dialogue, so be ready with a quick left/right mouse-click during cut scenes.\n\nEach of your potential followers is involved in some kind of local trouble you'll have to resolve before they can join your team. These missions also frequently offer other rewards in the course of solving them, such as equipment upgrades and credit opportunities. After each team member has been with you for a little bit, options to perform an additional (usually harder) quest for each of them comes available. Completeing those quests will earn their \"loyalty\" which unlocks additional powers. The recruitment and loyalty missions are the core of the game, and to me, were the most enjoyable aspects of ME2. The increase in loyalty also becomes very important for resolving the final mission. (Note: some loyalty missions can be failed, so judicious uses of saves is encouraged.) There are some missions unrelated to team members and/or the main story-line but they are incidental and unless you are a completionist or are looking for specific upgrades, are not necessary to finish the game. But I recommend doing every recruitment and loyalty mission, because those results matter.\n\nAnd so do choices. The final mission to stop the enemy is all but a suicide run, after terrible things have happened in-game. It is entirely possible for the player to get through said mission with all their members--or lose them all. Or even themselves. All of that is based not only on the decisions the player makes in the moment but on the choices made throughout the game. There are walkthroughs for perfect runs but I heartily recommend during your first playthrough, just making the choices you want and letting the chips fall where they may. I found that much more fun, and even though I did lose a single teammate on the final mission (which was depressing) it gave the game a more visceral feel.\n\nThat said, the final mission was surprisingly easy. Making decisions about which teammate to send where were harder than the fighting.\n\nThe combat in general was pretty smooth and easy. I am glad they dismissed the \"overheating weapon\" concept from the first game and just went with \"replaceable thermal clips\" for weapons this time (basically, hit R for reload). In addition to the pistol-shotgun-assault rifle-sniper rifle combo, there is a \"heavy weapons\" category, with several weapons of various effects, including grenade and missile launchers, and particle beams. ME2 also dispensed with that questionable ATV combat mode from the first game--or, if they didn't, I never ran into it in game.\n\nThe environments are attractive, colorful, and varied, from vibrant cities and space stations, to rusted out hulks of derelict ships and planets covered in debris. All of the dialogue is fully-voice-acted and the quality is excellent. In general, I thought the graphics were good but facial-movement rendering was an issue, unfortunately, and Shepherd's plastic lips always looked off. The game felt quite stable; I never experienced a crash or any stutters. I regrettably did not try any of the DLC.\n\nAll in all, Mass Effect 2, is a great game that I think a lot of RPG fans will like. Choice matters here, but the real choice it to grab this game and enjoy it.\n\nPros\n- Good action, smooth combat\n- Meaningful RPG choices\n- Wide galaxy to explore\n\nCons\n- Final battle was a bit underwhelming\n- Facial animations a little off\n\nFinal Score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1621692288, "timestamp_updated": 1621692288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92400097": {"recommendationid": "92400097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273843344", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1671498352}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games of all time!", "timestamp_created": 1621674994, "timestamp_updated": 1621674994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92392332": {"recommendationid": "92392332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025678043", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3271, "last_played": 1622777499}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible space opera.", "timestamp_created": 1621660598, "timestamp_updated": 1621660598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92387371": {"recommendationid": "92387371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068133725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16518, "last_played": 1630551443}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah, yes, \"Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.\" The game supposedly created as the ultimate way to enjoy the Mass Effect Trilogy.

There are some that I love, some that I hate and a few I'm more conflicted about but they all feel real and believable. I also love Shepard. I love how tough she is and doesn't take people's shit but still shows compassion to people who deserve it. Absolute stand out lead character.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure I'll even finish the game because the gameplay didn't age too well in my opinion. There's some kind of stiffness the cover and vaulting systems. And the gameplay really boils down to run to cover, shoot the heads that pop out, use abilities on big monsters, repeat. On top of that, the UI is obviously designed to be used for controller which makes some areas of the game tedious to interact with.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game if only for for creating one of the best sci-fi world, characters and stories.", "timestamp_created": 1621267515, "timestamp_updated": 1621267515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92145871": {"recommendationid": "92145871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081419444", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2116, "last_played": 1621232200}, "language": "english", "review": "Anybody who isn't a newbie to the Mass Effect series has already played this game, so, newbies, listen up: this game is a [b] MASTERPIECE[/b].\n\n I've never played the other games in the Mass Effect trilogy (though I will now) and had very little knowledge about the overarching plot between them before playing this game. Even still, this game enthralled me within the first twenty minutes. Sure, there were times when I was a little confused about who characters were or what they were talking about, but I ultimately think this game is very accessible for new players, especially with the Genesis DLC (don't forget to download all the DLC [url=https://help.ea.com/en/help/faq/dlc-for-classic-games/] here[/url]). Please don't be scared off if you're unfamiliar with the series because you will be missing out on one of the best games ever made.\n\nOne of this game's biggest strengths is how it approaches non-linear storytelling (the \"your choices shape the narrative\" system). In fact, it does this better than most modern games. Big and small, there are so many choices to make here. Some may have profound impacts on the story while others may only affect how smoothly interactions go, but they all feel like they matter. For example, even if you've been building a relationship with/romancing a character throughout the entire game, one bad decision can set you back to negative first base with them (and you won't unlock their special power). You can make some REALLY fucking terrible calls and [i] REALLY [/i] fuck things up, which adds so much replay value to the game.\n\nWhile I could go on for days about the things this game does right, there are some things it doesn't do so well. Firstly, while the shooting mechanics have aged pretty well, the cover system makes me want to bash my head in with a fucking rock. It's one of those \"snap-to-cover\" systems that's really clunky and has just enough input lag when snapping in and out of cover to be really frustrating to deal with. On top of that, interact, sprint, and enter/exit cover are all permanently bound to the same key, so you're probably going to be striking up conversations and getting into cover more than you'd like. Shepard also has this bad habit of getting stuck inside objects, so I recommend following [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_2#Clipping_into_walls.2Fobjects] this guide [/url] to fix it. While you're at it, just go ahead and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/24980/discussions/0/1700541698682921708/] remove the unnecessary 62 fps cap [/url] as well :).\n\nThe devs clearly put so much love into this game, which just makes me wish the BioWare of old was still making games.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] People call this one of the best games ever made for a reason.", "timestamp_created":

It was engrossing, captivating... like being part of a movie.\n\nWhich I gather is the point. I could go into detail about game mechanics and how combat has improved since Mass Effect, the seemingly pointless mining of planets for resources which it appears I really didn't need by the end of the game, the gratuitously (un)necessary cinematic camera angles during certain dialogue etc. but let's face it. These are a means to an end which is to bring the player into an epic story that spans over three games. That my actions and decisions in Mass Effect carried on into Mass Effect 2 is something I've not seen done in a game before. It's brilliant. It means the Mass Effect universe is one that I influenced. It feels more real.\n\nYet this goal has a downside: I don't want to replay the game. This isn't a criticism of the game. It's because my choices were ones I made, sometimes on the spur of the moment. Just like in real life, sometimes you regret those choices, but you have to live with them. To replay the game would take away those consequences. You don't need to have a perfect playthrough to enjoy the game. If anything any imperfection just increases the satisfaction level if you make it through.\n\nIf you've never played Mass Effect, you're missing out. This is the best blend of game and cinema I've experienced.", "timestamp_created": 1619337687, "timestamp_updated": 1619337687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90860227": {"recommendationid": "90860227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346522619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1690, "last_played": 1633406622}, "language": "english", "review": "A FUCKING MASTERPIECE!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1619297482, "timestamp_updated": 1619297482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90844603": {"recommendationid": "90844603", "author": {"steamid": "76561199052695320", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2460, "last_played": 1619277814}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la mera \u00f1onga", "timestamp_created": 1619278107, "timestamp_updated": 1619278107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90832602": {"recommendationid": "90832602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071853075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1143, "last_played": 1620462860}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best", "timestamp_created": 1619263229, "timestamp_updated": 1619263229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90808478": {"recommendationid": "90808478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272069617", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 3437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1310, "last_played": 1650938768}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite game on Steam", "timestamp_created": 1619224075, "timestamp_updated": 1619224075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90802842": {"recommendationid": "90802842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066230104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1857, "last_played": 1653835883}, "language": "english", "review": "great stories little to short on main quest but plenty to keep u busy easy character transfer", "timestamp_created": 1619214904, "timestamp_updated": 1619214904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90783057": {"recommendationid": "90783057", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984013966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13251, "last_played": 1619543301}, "language": "english", "review": "Great sequel for Mass Effect!

Seth Green is being retarded and won't leave so you convince and break his arm and shove him in a pod. After you do that, you fucking die.

game still hold up pretty well\nThe game generally just has way more quality content, better writting behind the missions and no more timestretching planet exploration\nFor nitpicks this one has alot more minigames in it (two hacking and one planet probing), with the later being essential for getting the best ending of the game due to reasources required to upgrade the ship.

Search \"EA dlc for classic games\" and you can find installers for them there. I recommend the complete package before beginning. DO NOT PLAY WITHOUT THE DLCs, SERIOUSLY.\n\nImproving on the lore and foundations of ME1, ME2 introduces an even wider array of unique characters, and a galaxy of people you actually care about. Where ME1 failed in its gameplay, ME2 succeeds. While movement is still sluggish, the level design works alongside this, with reduced walking simulator, and much better curated segments. No more open world nonsense, just curated levels. Combat feels much better, though still somewhat shallow, but is more than passable. Side content, just like the main content, now feels much better, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of it.\n\nThe crew really make ME2 special. Meeting returning characters from ME1, mourning any potential losses, discussing how lives have changed, revelling in victories, or meeting new friends and new enemies - uncovering a dark future never felt so good when fighting alongside these characters. I have never [i]cared[/i] as much as I have for a bunch of characters as I have the crew of the Normandy. \n\nThis, mixed with improved gameplay, make ME2 an easy recommendation in its vanilla state. Modding is available, and there are a few mods that are potentially recommended (such as removing the hacking minigames) but that is up to player preference.\n\nPros:\nFantastic writing.\nAn impressive cast of uniquely written, interesting characters.\nWell designed curated levels and missions, with interesting side content and a unique main story with a very solid ending that plays into the sequel.\nImproved class diversity and skill management, and overall gameplay improvements from ME1.\n\nCons:\nI have no immediate thoughts. I never ran into anything in ME2 that I felt was wrong, or needed improving. Every part of this game kept me interested, and I was devastated that it ended.

ME2 was the best of the three, so when it became available on Steam, I decided to play it there, hoping that the scene load time would be faster on my modern PC. It turned out that this needed a mod, but that was OK.\n\nWhat I discovered to my extreme disappointment after playing most of the way though was that my enjoyment of ME2 depended on several things:\n- An import of an ME1 save with some specific choices.\n- The ME2 DLC's.\n- Additional specific choices into ME2.\n\n So I would have to:\n- Buy all of the above additional stuff on Steam, which I already own for the PS3.\n- Install and activate the DLC's. There is no good official documentation on how to do this. The UI built in to ME2 to do this no longer works. Some people claim to have done it successfully, but it is certainly not straightforward.\n- Play though ME1 again, then import the save into ME2, and play through ME2 again to the same point, this time using a walk-through to guide my choices.\n\nI'm just not up for all that.\n\nMy recommendation for others is to wait until the re-bundled series comes out on Steam, and then wait to see if others have found that the DLC problems that everyone has complained about are solved.\n\nI have left comments open for now, in case someone has useful additional advice to offer.

Gone are the repetitive nature of side quests and buggy Mako but arrive the lush and diverse range of different side quests that each has a planet full of personality. The best part about this sequel is the entire production of it, if ME1 is the risky experiment of Bioware then ME2 is the fulfillment of that dream coming into fruition. Many of the cut ideas from ME1 is realized in this installment from the interruption mechanic to the dynamic \"Squad System\" that has a new loyalty mechanic that will later affect your final mission. With the new loyalty mechanic, the game suggests you to take on missions that will acquire the trust of each crewmate. \n\nEach loyalty mission is full of interesting narratives and great character building especially \n[spoiler]Tali's[/spoiler] loyalty mission. Before the loyalty missions is the \"Recruit Missions\" which have dedicated soundtrack to hype you up for each of the crewmates your about to meet. One of the best recruit missions is the one in Omege where you recruit \"Archangel\" where as you go deeper into mercenary territory you hear stories of why they despise this so called \"Archangel\" and in the end you find out why and its a very nice reveal once you get there.\n\nI think the final mission utilizes each decision you made for your crewmates throughout the game, this was lacking in the previous game leaving only two other crewmates be part of your squad in the final battle. But in this finale every character in your crew has a chance to have a spotlight and assist you in reaching the end, this is where the loyalty system kicks in because if you don't get the loyalty of some of these crewmates then you will arrive into dire consequences. Its a punishment that tells you to pay more attention to the extra content of the game instead of b-lining it into the finish line without a care for the world Bioware built for you.\n\nThe best quality of this game is its soundtrack and how it gave me goosebumps in the very end, the ending to this game is simply something that you must have to experience yourself. Play it through and experience the extra content and you will get the feelings I got when hearing the score in the ending. No other game today has got me into this thrill of just giving a speech while a heroic orchestra is in the background.\n\n[b]\"Came for the ass, stayed for the amazing story.\"[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1613326918, "timestamp_updated": 1613327044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86595629": {"recommendationid": "86595629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068145296", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1359, "last_played": 1613430752}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019m Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite game on the Citadel!", "timestamp_created": 1613274391, "timestamp_updated": 1613274391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86590572": {"recommendationid": "86590572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073354910", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4475, "last_played": 1613421691}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an amazing game and I couldn't recommend this enough.

Months after the events of Mass Effect 1, Shepard and his homie brigade are patrolling space when they\u2019re attacked by an actual space turd. The Space Turd fires its big space gun and messes up MY SHIP that was GIVEN TO ME by Anderson, my SPACE DAD. \n\nShepard is launched into space and then dies, but its okay because Cerberus, the weird paramilitary human supremacist group from ME1, finds his gross charred chicken remains and uses actual space magic to revive him. Weird how the collectors didn\u2019t just, like, you know, collect him instead of violently jettisoning him into space. \nAnd so begins another chapter in the life of Dirk Shepard, Intergalactic sex machine.\nAlso Cerberus took away my cool scar. Its gone, they healed it.\n\nMass Effect 2 moves away from Mass Effect in a lot of ways, focusing more on gunplay and shooting than the RPG aspects of its predecessor. People seemed to have problems with the gameplay of the first one, especially the Cuphead tutorial guy. I didn\u2019t, I really liked Mass Effect, but I don\u2019t mind Mass Effect 2. \nLoaning out from trends at the time, there is a big focus on cover and regenerating health, but you still have a chance to go nuts like you could in Mass Effect 1, its kind of nice how it, maybe unintentionally, lets you use the environments to your advantage, getting the jump on your opponents and dropping some powers on their dumbasses. At least on Normal you have more room to move around with your abilities. \nAlso, they took away my cool scar. \n\nYou have a new squad this time around with some returning faces. My best friend Garrus is back, but I had to replace my best friend Wrex with my wonderful son Grunt. I don\u2019t think Garrus being back is a spoiler anymore, since he\u2019s in a lot of the more recent promotional material. I like, mostly everyone. Jacob grew on me, turning from a piece of cardboard to someone I kind of felt like needed a hug. The big emphasis is on squad loyalty, so it helps when the characters aren\u2019t unlikable puddles of sludge like in other games. \nAlso, they took away my cool scar. \n\nI liked the story, even though it was kind of glue-eater at some points. Surprisingly a lot of the game is side missions, side missions that are mandatory if you want to get the best ending of the game. Bioware made a big deal about choices altering the outcome, but you have to actually be trying to get the worst ending. Its so easy to just paragon or renegade your way through most situations that its like, come on man, what\u2019re you doing? \nAlso they took away my cool scar. \n\nEven though its more streamlined, its nice that Mass Effect 2 continues to flesh out the series\u2019 universe and lore. It does that thing that smelly people do where they go back on something and retcon, but there wasn\u2019t anything too offensive, at least from what I noticed. You get a feeling that people actually live in this universe, and you kind of start to care about it as you go on. I was playing through Mass Effect recently and immediately moved on to Mass Effect 2 \n\nSo what are the downsides?\nWell for one they took away my cool scar. Kind of pissed about that one.\nI don\u2019t remember the game being this glitchy, though it might just be because my operating system is literally from the future from when this game came out. Sometimes Shepard would fall out of bounds or phase through something he shouldn\u2019t be able to. I also experienced a few crashes but strangely only when I was playing a DLC mission. Also, why did Shepard die? Couldn\u2019t the Collectors just, you know, collect him? Hold on to him for two years until Cerberus breaks him out with a daring rescue mission? Somebody can probably correct me, but I don\u2019t think Cerberus\u2019 magical resurrection tech actually ever comes up again. \n\nI know its expensive, but you\u2019d think they\u2019d abuse it.\nAlso, I miss the Mako. People had a problem with it but I thought it was fun. That thing could scale a 90 degree cliff, I love that four wheeled lady wagon.\n\nI got one more of these to go through, I haven\u2019t played since it came out but I remember\u2026Controversies. Still, It\u2019ll be fun to complete the trilogy in one go. \n\nMass Erect 2 gets 8 reloading for no reason out of 10. \n\nMale Koala have two penises. \n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/] I\u2019m Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite curator on Steam.

When compared, there's no doubt that this remaster outshines the original Mass Effect 2. The enhanced graphics, reduced bugs, more recent development, and inclusion of all DLCs make it an easy recommendation. Purchasing the remaster grants access to the entire Mass Effect trilogy and its DLCs, all at a significantly lower cost than buying the original games and their DLCs separately. While I did experience slight micro-stuttering in hub areas, this seems to be a rare issue affecting only a small percentage of players. Despite this minor inconvenience, I still find no valid reason to favor the original over the remaster. For a detailed review of the remaster, you can refer to my post [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/ciocolici/recommended/1328670?snr=1_5_9__402]here[/url]. I highly recommend considering the remastered version for the overall better value it offers.\n\n[b]Mass Effect 2 Editions on Steam[/b]\n\nIn addition to the Legendary Edition, Mass Effect 2 has two other editions available on Steam: the one you're currently reading about, and the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2362420/Mass_Effect_2_2010_Edition/]2010 Edition[/url]. A notable distinction is that the latter remains available for purchase, while the former has been delisted. Furthermore, the 2010 Edition simplifies the DLC acquisition process, automatically installing them without manual intervention, without even needing to buy them separately. If you previously owned the now delisted version, you should have the 2010 Edition in your library at no extra cost. The only drawback is that the 2010 Edition requires the EA launcher to run, though aside from this requirement, no other substantial changes have been introduced.\n\nMass Effect 2 stands as a true classic, revered as one of the finest accomplishments in the gaming industry. While its excellence is undeniable, it's not devoid of imperfections. As is often the case with sequels, it brings new marvels while leaving behind certain aspects from its predecessor.\n\nFirstly, addressing its shortcomings, the game hosts a substantial collection of non-Steam DLCs and unresolved bugs. The mouse sensitivity issue persists, along with other minor glitches. To optimize your experience and encounter the game at its zenith, I recommend consulting my comprehensive [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2496769538]\"All You Need\" guide for Mass Effect 2[/url]. This guide encompasses solutions for known issues, guidelines for obtaining DLCs, and enhancements that preserve the game's original essence while elevating its visuals, including higher quality textures and 4K cinematics. It's important to acknowledge that my guide doesn't address all problems, particularly two unresolved issues. The first is a rare game-breaking bug involving character teleportation onto textures, forcing a reload of a previous save. The second issue pertains to sound misplacement, occasionally leading to auditory confusion about the source's location. Fortunately, this issue is not as dire as it could be in more competitive games.\n\nThe Mass Effect series has ingrained itself as one of my personal favorites. It boasts captivating characters, enthralling narratives, a captivating universe, and a richly detailed world.\n\nMass Effect 2 diverges notably from its predecessor. While it continues the overarching storyline, it distances itself from the traditional RPG elements that defined the first game. This sequel leans more towards action, a shift that harmonizes brilliantly with the story's progression. The limited exploration featured in the original\u2014primarily on the Citadel and via the Mako vehicle\u2014is entirely absent, a change that disappoints me despite the mixed reception of these features. Another transformation involves the transition from heat-based weapons to bullet-based weaponry. Although this adjustment is logical for gameplay, it lacks a coherent lore explanation within the game itself.\n\nMass Effect 2 commands admiration as a gaming masterpiece. Its meticulous execution prompts emotional investment in characters and narrative. This installment exhibits a darker tone in both visuals and storyline compared to its predecessor. The narrative remains as compelling and enigmatic as before, though it takes on a different dimension. Characters' individual narratives and the consequential choices they present resonate deeply. The game's side content and associated narratives further contribute to its remarkable depth. While I wasn't entirely content with the ending\u2014albeit a subjective sentiment\u2014this scarcely diminishes the overall experience.\n\nThe gameplay's seamless flow and immersive event progression often made me feel as if certain segments would never conclude\u2014a sensation I welcomed wholeheartedly. The combat mechanics, including shooting mechanics, function impeccably, a stark departure from the first game's approach. Despite its merits, the implementation of powers left me somewhat unsatisfied, the global cooldown applied to all abilities remains a perplexing design choice, impacting my inclination to use them frequently.\n\nIt's curious how I find myself at a loss for words when endeavoring to elucidate my profound appreciation for something. This review, while comprehensive, barely scratches the surface of my sentiments. What I can confidently express is the sheer enjoyment I derived from Mass Effect 2. It represents a significant leap forward from the original game, irrespective of one's stance on its action-oriented direction. For me, it's become an essential part of an esteemed gaming collection, standing alongside cherished series favorites. I'm confident that indulging in this installment will lead to a profound and insatiable desire for more.\n\nFor achievement hunters: I believe it's worth noting that despite the in-game abundance of achievements, none are integrated with Steam\u2014a similarity shared with the original game.

ME2 brings you straight into the action; the Normandy is under attack by enemies that want to end your quest and let the Reapers rule again. You continue your epic quest in a much more refined game.\n\n[H1]The good[/H1]\nFrom the start ME2 shows it's a game from the next decade: the gameplay feels much more dynamic then the quite static ME. A cool feature is that you can continue playing with your character from ME1 by importing it (see below how to do that). The voice acting is great and I enjoyed the music much better. The RPG-lite system has been redesigned to a more action game with some RPG traces.\n\nI read that some people disliked the minigames and yes, they can be tedious at times but I actually enjoyed them as they offer much more variety than the single system that was used in ME. I also found there is a mod to completely remove them but I did not use that as I wanted to experience the game as it was meant to be played except with better graphics :-).\n\nThe game gives some freedom in the sense that you can pick most of the time what system you would like to explore: however when you find something interesting you then get a scripted mission. At first I did not like that so much however this provided the designers a lot of control of what you experience and it helps a lot with the story telling so in the end I believe this was the right choice. \n\nThe Codex deserves special mention: there is a lot to read, see and hear about the universe. Most of it is presented when required during gameplay - and ME2 still maintains the right balance of not to overwhelming you with lore, yet if you want even more information it is all there. The closest game I can think of that also has this is AC: Origin or Odyssey. \n\nThere is now a general research option that provides the whole squad with more bonusses if you are willing to find and spend resources of course. It is a good decision to know have you switch easily between various ammo (after you have research it) compared to the confusing ME1 inventory system.\n\nThe Overlord DLC started OK and became quickly one of my most favourite DLCs I've ever played: it's creepy, emotional and is presented so well. It's just amazing!\n\n[H1]The not so good[/H1]\nThe game is from 2010 and unless you really would like to relive that time in terms of graphics and videos I would strongly recommend to use at least a few mods to make the game feel and play a lot better. Find the hard work of fans at [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/] Nexus Mods [/url]. However, be sure to install all DLC and non-texture mods before you start installing graphics mode otherwise you might run into graphic issues.\n\nAlso the ME2 config tool does no longer works - you need that tool to tell ME2 where the save games of ME1 are located. Instead follow this advice (thanks to [url=https://answers.ea.com/t5/Mass-Effect-2/PC-Importing-a-save-file-from-Mass-Effect-1/td-p/751184] Holger1405 [/url]:\n[quote=Holger1405]Navigate to your \"Documents\\BioWare\\Mass Effect 2\\Save\" folder and create a folder named \"ME1\" (Without the quotes) inside the \"Save\" Folder.\nAfter you finished ME1, copy the Mass Effect Saves from the Mass Effect save folder (\"Documents\\BioWare\\Mass Effect\\Save\") into the \"ME1\" folder you created.\nNow ME2 should \"see\" your ME1 characters.[/quote]\n\nThere are now achievements on a separate screen but there are none for Steam. It's probably the age of the game - I'm not too concerned about it but some people might not like this so much.\n\nThe game runs at 60FPS on my RTX3070; most likely this is a limitation of the game engine. It did not bother me much as the engine delivers all the action well but after having played Doom Eternal at 144 FPS I had to adjust myself a little :-).\n\nOver the course of your adventure you are able to collect various weapons - it would have been better to also see the stats instead of just a vague description. It might to do that they wanted to dumb down the system a bit so it is more accessible.\n\nI experienced one crash - but I'm unsure whether it was the game or because of the texture mod. I had to restart Windows to continue. As with all games I would advise to frequently use quick save (F5) to prevent too much gameplay lose although there is an auto save system that generally works OK. During Jacob's loyalty mission there were some issues with clipping but nothing too serious.\n\n[H1]Summary[/H1]\nThis game came out in 2010 and with some mods it is still very playable in 2021. The game is much more accessible than the first game and the story writing and world building is great and just continues to build on the foundation that was laid out with ME1. It's good that you can import your old character and choices you made in the first game will affect your play through in ME2 to a certain degree. I enjoyed visiting old places to see how they are now (like for example the citadel) or meeting up with my old party members. \nThe music and sound effects have been greatly improved and there is no MAKO anymore (although they added some horrible drone instead but you hardly use that - it's mostly used during firewalker missions which you can skip IMHO). All in all, even now there is no reason not to play this game.\n\nNote 1: you can get all the DLC from the [url=https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/faq/dlc-for-classic-games/] EA website [/url]. Don't bother with the Origin launcher as it will not download any of them even if it states you can download or add it to the queue. Your browser may give a warning but that's because the DLCs are all .exe files (note it seems you can only download four files at a time - so wait until the first four have finished and then download the other ones). You then have to click on each file to have them manually installed. It's a bit of work but at least you get all the extra DLCs :-) - I'm a bit confused because at the EA store / Origin app (that does not seem to work) you still have to pay for it?\n\nNote 2: when you get to the point you have a mission with IFF please make sure you have completed everything you want to do in the game before continuing.", "timestamp_created": 1610269328, "timestamp_updated": 1610269328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84406788": {"recommendationid": "84406788", "author": {"steamid": "76561199071506070", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2494, "last_played": 1620759352}, "language": "english", "review": "If you don't like Mass Effect, your opinion needs some calibrations.", "timestamp_created": 1610254544, "timestamp_updated": 1610254544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84403948": {"recommendationid": "84403948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046659350", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1405474760}, "language": "english", "review": "instant classic.

La amenaza Geth sigue presente y, segun Cerberus cuentan con ayuda de nuevos y mas temibles aliados. Nos pondran al mando de una nueva nave Normandia con mejor tecnologia y algunos de los restos de nuestra vieja tripulacion para detener esta amenaza.[/i]\n\nLo primero que vamos a notar a la hora de empezar una nueva partida, al menos en mi caso que importe mi save del primer juego, es que la mayoria de desiciones que se importan son en su mayoria de las ultimas 2 misiones.\n\nGraficamente es muchisimo mas superior a su antecesor, contamos con animaciones que reaccionan al entorno y los diarios de las misiones principales tienen animaciones holograficas o de video que no tenia anteriormente.\nLos cambios no son solamente graficos sino que la interfaz y controles son diferentes, ahora tambien podremos esprintar sin la necesidad de estar en combate.\n\nEn su jugabilidad lo primero que encontramos es que ahora la municion tiene un contador y no es un medidor de calor como antes, permitiendo que te puedas agotar un arma y tengas que pasar a otra para poder seguir combatiendo, cosa que se agradece porque en Mass Effect 1 podias pasarte el juego usando 1 solo arma, ya no existen las granadas y se agrego un tipo de arma grande que tiene varias versiones tanto comprables como desbloqueables si las encontramos en el mundo. Tampoco encontraremos 8 modelos  diferentes de un tipo de arma como antes, de milagro si hay 2 a 3 versiones de cada tipo de fusil, pistola, subfusil, francotirador o escopeta.\nEn cuanto a las mejoras tenemos tanto como para el da\u00f1o de las armas como el da\u00f1o tecnologico o biotico del peloton, sino que tambien de vida y armadura. Tambien la propia Normandia se puede mejorar para que sea mas potente y en mi caso lo que mas agradeci para la exploracion que voy a detallar mas adelante.\nComo antes, la moneda de cambio siguen siendo los creditos, mas escasos en esta entrega pero se agregaron nuevos recursos para comprar las mejoras. estos recursos son 4 y se recolectan con la exploracion planetaria y tambien podemos encontrar contenedores por los mapeados.\n\nPara hablar de la exploracion planetaria, en primer medida ya no se usa el Mako, simplemente nos acercamos al planeta nos dira que abundancia de recurso tiene y podemos ir escaneando el terreno y van a salir lecturas de que recurso es rico en esa zona y lanzando una sonda lo recolectamos, cabe aclarar que estas sondas hay que comprarlas con credito al igual que el combustible para movernos entre sistemas solares. Tambien puede ser que se detecten anomalias que si decidimos lanzar una sonda en esa anomalia podamos hacer una incursion terrestre y tener una mini-mision para conseguir armas o mas recursos.\nTambien en algunas misiones hay un Mako nuevo que parece un aerodeslizador que permite mas verticalidad que antes a la hora de realizar estas misiones que sinceramente son bastante pocas aunque muy entretenidas.\n\nAhora lo que vamos a tener presente siempre durante el juego y en nuestra nave, son los compa\u00f1eros o aliados, en comparacion con el anterior, podremos reclutar hasta 10 aliados con sus diferentes razas tanto alienigenas como humanos. El maximo jugable siguen siendo 2 pero, ahora cuentan con nuevas habilidades bastante mas simple que antes, ya no necesitaremos tener un experto en tecnologia y electronica para desbloquear todo cosa que me molesto mucho, ahora puedo llevar a quien me caiga mejor y nada mas.\nTambien introducen el sistema de fidelidad, que la unica forma de conseguirlo es haciendo la mision que cada miembro nos pida, es siempre una mision, por lo general que dura 1 hora aproximadamente y cabe destacar que son bastante entretenidas y le dan muchisima mas historia a nuestros compa\u00f1eros. Cuando nuestros compa\u00f1eros sean fieles desbloquean un nuevo estilo para su traje y una rama de habilidad especial.\n\nEn lo que a las misiones respecta, se parece mucho al primero, casi diria que no hay muchos cambios y son mas detalles, cambiaron el sistema de hackeo con 2 nuevos puzzles, la derivacion para las puertas, que es un memory bastante simple y un pirateo para las terminales, este ultimo el mas complicado ya que hay que encontrar 3 lineas de codigos de colores que tenemos que ir comparando al momento mientras llueven lineas de codigo y tambien lineas trampa que si las pasamos por encima tendremos que reiniciar o en algunos casos perder ese recurso directamente.\nTambien continua el sistema de Virtud y Rebeldia, si bien siguen sirviendo para lineas de dialogos adicionales para solucionar o complicar algunas situaciones, tambien afectaran a las cicatrices de Shepard, siendo virtud la que lo curara y, creo, rebeldia supuestamente lo da\u00f1a aun mas. Digo creo porque jugue siempre con virtud y se curo por completo, tambien con una mejora de la nave podemos curarlas independientemente del estilo de juego. Tambien entre cinematicas tendremos opciones de las mismas a modo de Quick Time Event y aunque no lo parezca pueden cambiar mucho la historia dependiendo si elegimos actuar o no.

Other than that the game performs just as flawless as its console counterpart.

An odd Cerberus Network  connection error kept popping up  so I had to use my EA login to go to the Origins website and redeem my product keys there, then download the DLC's individually from  EA. It did fix the cerberus network connection problem though as it connected just fine afterwards. You just can't use your product keys in the game itself when you have this issue. It is pretty inconvenient but bear in mind this could just be a steam issue or it could be the result of the game getting pretty old.

That is what mass effect 2 is compared to mass effect and i don't like it. There you have it the short answer of the review.\nThe review may contain few minor/heavy spoilers so beaware.\nChanged it into reccomened after playing and actually enjoying me3. My negatives still stand if me3 didnt exist the review would still be a negative. If i had to name few positive stuff about the game quickly it would be: characters,their stories and you get to see the characters conclusion on me3.\n\nMAIN REASON: GAMEPLAY\n-----------------\nThe main and most disappointing fact about this game is its gameplay and simplfication of mechanics from first game. I loved mass effect 1. By no means it was perfect. It had its shortcomings but despite that it was a great game which had great ideas /concept that it wanted to achieve but couldn't for its time. Now when a series receives a sequel its is expected that it improves mechanics from previous game and also fix the shortcomings that holded the previous game back instead of entirely removing them. As a sequel mass effect 2 is a massive disappointment. It removes almost everything that made the first game great or simplfies them. And also totally axes first game's ambitious ideas instead of improving them and making them reach their full potential. This is what i call taking the easy way out by taking out things that were criticised instead of fixing/improving them. They also made every single feature that were taken from first game extremely linear and simple. A change that defeats the entire point why i liked the first game. I liked the first game for its in-depth rpg mechanics such as stats,upgrades and open ended nature of the game such as mission design,level strucure. The tacticallity of the first game is also something i loved. Squad combat was very open ended and player had full control over the squad. Now mass effect 2 makes level/mission design extremely linear. Missions now always tend to have a single linear path which player can execute. \nPlayer Level stats are also made very simple/linear and more combat oriented rather then letting players choose if they would like to play defense or attacking. Level stats are now broken down to few segments and 3 of them are literally weapon upgrades from mass effect 1. Now i don't know if stats are different compared to new save or imported save. But i won't worry about that as a review is a personal experience/thoughts of someone. Inventory system is also gone. Now you only get to change your gear before entering a single linear path or before starting the mission itself. That too only weapons. Amours and such can be only managed through personal office of shepard. There is also no way to manage crew mates armours. Now i will be honest i never changed my crew mates iconic armours on mass effect 1 only bought/used upgraded edition of their armour. But now only way to do that is to find a upgrade laying around on those linear mission and click few menus. See how much sense of tacticallty and player freedom is lost on this game. On the first game even the order you did the missions in matterd and here missions only tend to have single path/outcome with occasional changes to the story of certain mission but still using same linear path. The linearity of missions,simplification of level stats and removal of inventory system are the biggest downgrades/flaws of this game as a sequel. Squad combat is also way more simple now and favours more fast paced combat instead of slow tactical combat first game had. Some squad commands such as \"hold postion\" is also gone. Moving squad members no longer pauses the game like first game where player could admire his surrounding and throughfully move them. Squad mates are also very op and stupid at times making stupid decision themself instead of sticking with the leader. The entire nature of the game is made very linear in order to fit into this generic cover based fast paced shooter formula instead of light rpg direction first game took. Side missions only either last two secs and are WORSE fetch quests then first game. They had this golden opportunity to fully achieve their goals from first game by improving the shortcomimgs of first game but instead they took the easy way out and totally shifted their focus. Which resulted in a change of series's identity i do not like. Instead of improving the emptiness sometimes presented on open ended missions of mass effect they made the missions linear and worse. Missions that have generic cover based action segments instead of epic boss battles first game had. Missions are so linear and scripted that offers little to no control of player. Instead of delivering high quality side content they deliverd even worse side content. Instead of improving the stats system they made it even worse and simple/linear. Instead of fixing/optimizing the inventory they totally got rid of it.Instead of making the space exploration better they also got rid of it and turned most planets into none exploreable resource hub to upgrade Normandy. Instead of making the vehicle segments better or maybe giving us control of mini space ship they entirely got rid of it. Exploration wasn't perfect on mass effect 1. Planets felt empty and most were used for fetch quests. But i still loved the sense of exploration they gave. Instead of improving that they got rid of exploration all together. And gave planets even worse purpose. At least fetch quests on planets had good stories on first game, but here resource collecting aka new purpose of planets is very boring and bland. As you can already notice how lazy this sequel is. They got rid of good things of first game in the efforts of making the game more causal friendly and they got rid of meh things from first game in lazyness and to find a escape from the work that would be required to fix/improve those features. As a result of all the things mentioned above this game turns into a extremely boring game with missions being linear and having very scripted paths. Getting rid of almost all the features of the first game or simplifying them also resulted in a game which literally defeats the purpose and identity of the series and takes it into a direction i do not like.\nSECONDARY REASON:STORY\n------------------------\nThe story of mass effect 2 is also very lackluster with few crew mates story being actually good.Most crew characters were very unintresring expect few like thane,salarian scientist,jack.I already liked talia and garrus from first game.Their dialogues were more then enough on me1 to make them likeable.Their missions also don't add up much to their already existing character.The plot of this game is very bland and has very little purpose to exist.it felt like a giant side/dlc story to the overall repear threat story of the series.There are also very few plottwist and story is predictable.Collectors being prothean and all that Cerberus feels very irreverent to me.That being said whole story and plot of the game is pretty meh imo with some likeable characters.\nOverall Mass effect 2 is a horrible sequel with most good things from me1 being stripped away or made simple/linear and also has a very lackluster story.I wanted to explain story abit more and why i dislike it but couldn't because of review limit but the gameplay changes and removal are more then enough to dislike this game for me.", "timestamp_created": 1608678298, "timestamp_updated": 1609810734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468735426664352417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82874198": {"recommendationid": "82874198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999916475", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4168, "last_played": 1616488246}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1608631329, "timestamp_updated": 1608631329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82856359": {"recommendationid": "82856359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009168029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 20068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15067, "last_played": 1609836174}, "language": "english", "review": "I came back to this game after a long absence and a change of computer. I re-downloaded it from Steam. I had originally purchased a lot of the DLC that came with it, and I thought, naively, that it all would come back with the game. Of course it didn't, so I went to the unsecured site recommended by EA and re-downloaded the DLC and thought, problem solved. Alas, how wrong was I, gentle reader. \n\nThe game would  not load from the resume button. This was because it did not recognise that the DLC was, in fact, installed. The fault, it turned out, was mine: I had not followed the instructions in this extremely helpful post: \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/24980/discussions/0/1742229167209908670/\n\nIt's not just a case of downloading and installing the DLC - it is essential to download the zipped \"giveme2entitlements_v2\" file and run it. After that, the game and the DLC worked perfectly well.\n\nIn switching platforms from Steam to Origin, EA seriously compromised my DLC and the DLC of thousands of other players. And while I've been able to fix my game, I'm sure there will be other players out there who aren't prepared to click on unsecured links to get the repair job they need, because a corporation broke their game and doesn't give a rat's rectum. This kind of commercial chicanery gives games companies a bad name. The solution that has been provided is largely the work of dedicated gamers and not the companies who created the mess.\n\nI love Mass Effect 2. Bits of it are silly to the power of ten, but it has a brilliant plot line and a  sense of humour.  I like the settings, the 'star trek meets grunge\" vibe of the whole thing.

It's that good. But if you haven't played the first one, you are doing a disservice to yourself for not experiencing Mas Effects storyline and character development alone.

If you did everything in Mass Effect 1 such as Side Missions, going to every marker on planets, etc. you will be rewarded with little cameos and help along the way. The same is true for this game. Do everything and it'll matter, in small ways and once or twice big ways, and enjoy being part of a dope team. \n\nTo me, this is gamings first true poster child for a high quality AAA Gaming Trilogy.

This, however, doesn't overshadow the fact the game is great all around. Some of the best pieces of gameplay in the ME series is what happens in dialogue; such as punching women in the face for making disingenuous assertions, pushing people out of windows, and the snarky comments and input your compatriots will make throughout the game is definitely worth it.\n\nI would say my 'biggest issue' with the game is the Paragon / Renegade options. Instead of having the typical 'Good and evil' options, you have paragon and renegade. These aren't good/ bad options per se, but they give you more felxibility in how your character is played. Either 'By the book' or a Dirty Harry anti-hero. That's how it worked in the first game. However, in 2 - 3, they become less ambiguous and more good/ bad. And if you go down a renegade path, you become less Dirty Harry, and more Lev Beria. Your choices become more sadistic, and they leave negative consequences down the line. Also, you get red-eyes if you go full-renegade.\n\nApart from that. It's a perfectly flawed game. I recommend getting this game on origin with all the DLCs, if you can.

There's also a host of graphical issues (Though I don't think any quite as bad as the Shadow People glitch in the ME1 port).\n\nThe DLC for ME2 is fantastic. On the console version of the game, it's include. On the PC version, if you want it to work you have go through Origin. Upside, if you have ME2 installed through Steam, Origin will automatically install your DLC and do your game updates to your Steam install so you won't need to try and shuffle files anywhere.\n\nDownside: The Cerberus Network (through which your DLC is verified in-game) cannot remember that you're logged in, and can't see that you're currently logged into Origin. The login screen for the Cerberus Network poorly optimized for PC use. Tab doesn't work, so you have to manually click each field. The password field has a hard-coded character limit that is most likely shorter than your Origin password, so if you want to actually be able to USE your DLC (only $24.99 on Origin, and no the Digital Deluxe Steam version does NOT include it!), you'll have to change your password on Origin to something short enough to fit within the character limit in the game.\n\nDon't like the janky mouse and keyboard control scheme and want to use a gamepad?

UNTIL THE FIRST CUTSCENE!!\n\nThe beginning masterfully lets me remake my character if i wanted to make any tweaks to my look/class and I am super impressed by the evolution of the world! MORE ALIENS!! I love that! The new designs are so neat and i really enjoy talking to everyone, not just the crew!\n\nRegarding customization, there has been a give-and-take: The library of weapons of ME1 is gone. Poof. Instead, the inventory remains in weapon boxes where you customize a loadout much like in Battlefield4. While this streamlines the entire loadout process, i happen to LOVE stat comparison, weapon balance, and collecting / reading about the manufactures and fun marketing materials. The armor library has also been replaced with customizing a single suit with different parts you earn throughout your playthrough. Overall, I admit these all to be improvements.

In almost every department this game proves smoother, simpler, and very very well thought through.

Even so, I never really bothered to use the heavy weaponry despite my choice to play a soldier class! I prefer to begin games on the \"hard\" or \"Veteran\" difficulty and then dial it back as needed, still, this was too easy. My squad always had one biotic and one engineer which gave me he flexibility to handle just about any situation. The powers are balanced and recharge times never feel crippling. The adrenaline ability is such a crutch, it turns tense moments into shooting galleries and I found myself trying my best not to use it at all. \n\nTo anyone struggling: stay behind cover, gather a full team, level yourself up into an unstoppable force and the game will be a breeze.\n\n9/10 \nThis is one of Bioware's best!", "timestamp_created": 1607099417, "timestamp_updated": 1607279324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81569872": {"recommendationid": "81569872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004783984", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1610516898}, "language": "english", "review": "good game DLC is a waste of money there is no support for anything beyond base version of the game.

You can also pick your character's class that enhance different areas of the gameplay by giving you different powers to use and different weapons.\n\nBecause you and your other two squad members fighting by your side during missions have powers, you can do a little more than shooting. You can pause time in-game, select a target and then choose a certain power that you and/or your squadmates will use.

It can offer a bit of trouble considering that the enter cover and sprinting are the same button, sometimes it makes it easier to transition.\n\nProgress\n\nProgression has you upgrade your character's abilities as well as your squadmates' abilities via skill trees and you and your squad's equipment.\n10 out of fucking 10 from me.", "timestamp_created": 1606525301, "timestamp_updated": 1606546033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574126541614532471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80703607": {"recommendationid": "80703607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042238596", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1608448549}, "language": "english", "review": "Beaten this 4x and still my favorite ME game.

As mentioned in my review of Mass Effect, I think the first game is the best.  Let's break down the pros and cons of its sequel.\n\nPros:\n\nMore engaging combat.  The combat in Mass Effect was generally too easy and sometimes superfluously easy.  The combat in the sequel required more care decision-making.  I prefer games that require some thought and effort, even if some of the hilarity is lost.  \n\nSome graphical upgrades.  Tech marches on.\n\nNo Ashley and Kaiden as squadmates.  Those two were boring.  \n\nThe story structure allows you a great deal of freedom, even more so than the first game.  \n\nYou do not storm copy-pasted bases, freighters, and underground complexes dozens of times over; environments are unique.  \n\nCons:\n\nNo Mako and no exploration of planets.  The level design is very corridor-based and restrictive.  \n\nNo more inventory; you pick what weapons you want; you can get permanent upgrades through research; no more applying different upgrades to individual pieces of equipment.  The various vendors around the galaxy have extremely limited wares and you cannot sell excess gear to build up your space bank account.  \n\nLikewise, the skill system got massively nerfed; each squadmate gets only two abilities; in the first game they could have a half-dozen or so.  Not only that, but if a squadmate uses an ability, there is a cooldown for all abilities, not just that one (granted, the cooldowns are much faster than in the first game). \n\nAmmo.  The first game did not use it.  This one does.  The codex in the first game explained how the guns worked; I was cool with that.  \n\nYou may have noticed that the cons I point out are ones that affect the RPG elements of the game.  While I understand tweaking RPG elements, removing or massively downgrading them seems a poor choice to me.  \n\nOn balance, Mass Effect 2 is still a great game; most of the good things from the original carry on here; excellent characters, fantastic music, some terrific writing, and so on.  However, in an effort to streamline the game, some of the RPG complexity was sadly lost. \n\nIf you liked the original, hang onto your save file and import it into Mass Effect 2.", "timestamp_created": 1606393304, "timestamp_updated": 1606393304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80270140": {"recommendationid": "80270140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799516253", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1623837658}, "language": "english", "review": "best game i've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1606392248, "timestamp_updated": 1606392248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80247652": {"recommendationid": "80247652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034727511", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1618421611}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent story, although the gameplay and graphics can seem a little dated compared to more modern video games.", "timestamp_created": 1606388644, "timestamp_updated": 1606388644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80131424": {"recommendationid": "80131424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060485277", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2699, "last_played": 1606861596}, "language": "spanish", "review": "nada que decir", "timestamp_created": 1606368289, "timestamp_updated": 1606368289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627242565155029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "80093583": {"recommendationid": "80093583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173805471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 8574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6362, "last_played": 1612239698}, "language": "english", "review": "Mass Effect 2 is an outstanding game in its story department.

added and optimized mechanics the previous game had while also directed the game to be more casual friendly. Traversal became more efficient despite still being a game with a long playtime. No more fetch quests/sidemissions definitely encouraged me to complete the game to the fullest. When it comes to story driven RPG games with multiple outcomes I prefer going blindly rather than looking up for necessary informations outside the game, Mass Effect 2 did well in that regard. Just by following the story, interacting with NPCs, you could tell what you have to do. ME2 did its best maximize the playable areas potential to make sure you don't miss out things.\n\nResources collecting and hacking are introduced in this sequel. Due to the addition of a proper upgrades mechanics, the resource collecting is quite a necessity. Although I think there should be more varied ways to collect them. I quite liked the minigames for hacking as it isn't really time consuming and never felt like a chore to do because its present in missions/assignments. \n\nThe upgrades mechanism is a great addition because it effectively accomodate your squad's preferred playstyle. Like I mentioned before they perfected/optimized the gameplay in the previous game and it applied to the third person shooter gameplay with the perks it offers in your squad combat. Weaponries is now packaged with more casuality as they have removed the weapon stats and added effects instead. Despite that, you still can feel the difference between each weapons you use.\n\nNow onto the story. Its Bioware's Mass Effect. Always captivating, always a great experience. Once again proven to be serious in narrating its franchise's lore which they have designed in the previous game with its close to home social issues, politics, and diversity.

The story gets much more interesting with some great twists and character development. The relationships between characters is much more important in this game too. There are real consequences and the end of the game can be very different depending on the choices you make. \n\nThe combat mechanics have been widely enhanced and the controls are improved. The game also looks much better visually. There is a lot more content in this game when compared to the first, there is a lot that you can do and none of the side quests were boring for me. Some side quests are extremely short and only require you to talk to several people, but even these side quests are interesting because even the smallest most insignificant characters are so interesting with their own problems and you often get to deal with them how you like.\n\nNot too mention you can carry over your original mass effect save to this game so that the decisions from you made from the first game carry over into this one.

Mass Effect 2 manages to expand the deeper world that the first game already serves. This entry focused on a journey, where you'd assembly a high skilled team scattered around the galaxy. Each individual has an interesting story that makes you value them for their vital role in upcoming battles.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nImproved foundation of combats from the first game but still doesn't separated them very far. I liked how they compressed the upgrading system which is overwhelming on the first one, they make them straight to the point which turn them easier to use here. Character Actions and Decisions choices were always straightforward, which makes your intention very easy to spot either it was good or bad.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nVisual that doesn't look like it came out from 2010. The details were night & day compared to its predecessor. However, there are noticeable size decreased of levels, which make the free roam very shorter than the first one. There are also some few glitches where you get stuck in the air if somehow you walked in a wrong place which kinda ruin some immersion in some part.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nThe main narrative was straight to the point and can be easily explained briefly. It was like the first Avenger movie where you're Captain America and trying to recruit each hero for a great cause. However, that was not what make Mass Effect great. It was their storytelling and how they portray a non-existent world to be comfortably real at is it.\n\n[b]Overview:[/b]\nIt was an experience to remember.

Just use the gibbed save editor and only delete the face code.  I spent hours trying to recreate my character but this fixed it perfectly.  By removing the face code ME3 will import based on the vectors, not the wrong face code.\n\n---\n\nFor me this was the weakest of the series.  I disliked the direction of working with Cerberus and I honestly didn't like the feel of trying to recruit random people around the galaxy to do a suicide mission.  It took me until about half-way to realize what was going on.   \n\n\nJust understand that you are recruited for a suicide mission to save the galaxy and it will make more sense.  The first time through it wasn't clear.  And I had a hard time with recruiting certain people such as prisoners who seemed unstable.  Also I had spent a huge amount of time stopping this terrorist organization in the first game.  So it was a bit of a stretch for me to just up and run with them.  The game turns a corner about half way through and finally comes into itself. \n\nPersonally I felt this was the weakest game in the series in terms of story line.  It also is frustrating they spent a huge amount of time focusing on recruiting people yet in ME3 you don't have any of these people as crew members.  It made no sense to me to focus so heavily on developing these characters to abandon them.\n\n--- ME3 Review ---\n\n\nI don't have ME3 on steam but it is incredible both in game play and character development all the way until the very very end.  The game itself plays as a story line based on all your choices from the first two games.  The end of ME3 is garbage as I was actually totally confused on choices being given that didn't even make sense to me.  I would just recommend this.  As soon as you see the child they show from the beginning of ME3 foreshadowing, end the game.  Just turn it off and make up your own ending.  I had to come to the conclusion of rewriting the story line for ME3 as there was no choice my Shepard would have taken based on the choices given. Nothing that you had achieved really mattered and the choices offered weren't discussed in the game world.  I was literally sitting there thinking, what is going on and what are these choices?  It made no sense to me.\n\n*Spoilers*\nI had brought peace between the Geth and Quarians.  Tali mourned the loss of Legion.  The Geth had been upgraded to fully individuals and were working with the Quarians. None of this though highly relevant to the ending is even mentioned.  I had done so much that flew in the face of that last dialog as I never cared one way or the other about machines life versus chemical biological life.  It was irrelevant to my Shepard through the entire series.  I am a spectre, an alliance soldier and I bring peace to the galaxy.  ALL LIFE.  Not this garbage ending.\n\nIn my story I decided it ends by sending an energy wave through the galaxy that disconnects the reapers from each other.  They become emotionally self aware like the Geth and EDI.  We share the emotions, dreams, hopes and suffering of organic life.  They become emotionally aware as individuals.  Their shields disabled and unable to coordinate they falter, some flee, some fight, some die.  The combined might of my galaxy destroys them and pushes the stragglers back into dark space.  \n\nNow that is an ending that makes sense to me.  Not the ending I received.\nThe game is incredible.  The ending in ME3 is garbage.  To take 200 hours of gameplay and reduce it to a few minutes is an insane choice and to limit those choices without context to the actions taken was even more frustrating.  You don't end a game like this with hard choices that are highly limited after hundreds of choices.  You instead relive the characters moments.  This is what my galaxy achieved and this is where we stand.  Just disable the reapers and let the galaxy sort it out based on your characters actions!  That was all that was needed.  \n\nAgain I suggest go in at the point where you see the foreshadowed child at the very end of the game and already decide you write your own story past that point.  Watch the endings only after you have made the choice to write your own story before walking into that room.  \n\nBest game series ever!  Worst ending for a series like this ever.  You can't end a series like this in several minutes with a hard story ending.  Made no sense at all.  Just disable the bad guys and let the races sort it out based on your choices.  I don't understand why it was so hard to do that.  Insane choice by the authors for force lock the story like this.  And also locks them out for future development.

Game holds up pretty well story-wise still but the side missions (ie. the scanning of the planets) are pretty grating. Some of the combat gets pretty ho-hum, but the deaths aren't as cheap unlike in ME1. Less RPG focus, and more cover shooter, ME2's story is still one of the best parts of the game. Having played through the series a few times, I'm still uncovering choices and dialog that I haven't taken, which shows how great the game's writing is. \n\nHad come across a few bugs this time around. Turn around too fast when at the galaxy map and Shep will get stuck on the railing. In fact, there's a few spots in a few maps where you'll get stuck if not careful. This may have been because of the MEUTIM mod however. The game crashed when I did the Shadow Broker mission, it straight up froze in a corridor and I had to reset my computer to get out of it. A few instances in a few side missions it did this as well after that point - not sure if its MEUTIM or the game itself, but I had never come across any crashes of any kind in previous playthroughs. \n\nThe characters are all great, everyone has their favourite and while I felt the Collectors were severely underused (compared the severely overused Geth in ME1) as an enemy type, most of the fun in this game comes from seeing characters interact, and the actual role playing elements in the game. I felt that the weapons could have been a lot more varied and get tired after 20 hours of game play. You'll have collected most if not all the weapons by the mid way point and while the extra add-ons are fun, none of them feel quite as fleshed out as the Shadow Broker mission and just serve as a short distraction. Kasumi and Zaeed are okay DLC characters - Kasumi's mission is definitely the better of the two. \n\nI'd give this game a 8/10, just shy of greatness. It's definitely aged better than ME1, but the combat can get pretty easy pretty fast- which might be fair to say to all the games in the series. Just ramp it up to another difficulty, but stick around for the story.

Just a month ago I finally started my adventures with the mass effect trilogy for the first time with the first game and on my review I explained how much I loved it and how I felt like I discovered a huge treasure so late, I had a really good time with the first game even playing it the first time in 2020 so after a few weeks I moved to the second game and my love for mass effect has just grown even bigger, this sequel is even better on several ways apart of a few things, it was much more fun to play and  just like the first game it left on me a huge grin of satisfaction once I saw the credits roll.\n\nTo talk about this game Ill divide it on topics, graphics wise it still looks really good for a 10 year old game and the art style is stunning with really beautiful environments and a huge sense of creativity being shown pretty much everywhere. The gameplay had several changes that some would say it was dumbing down on the first game but I think they were just refining the experience and taking out things that were weak on the first. Apart from a few systems which Imo I preferred in the first game aka the armor system, I didnt like how it was handled in 2 and preferred looting them on 1 instead of buying pieces on vendors here in 2 and then having to go wardrobes to \"customize\" myself, I felt it was a bit cluttered and the thermal clips system that didnt make sense to me when you had overheating weapons with unlimited ammo on the first, those 2 changes were the only I personally didn't care about, every single other aspect was improved, the gunplay feels much more precise and satisfying, the enemy AI is much better and cover is now useful, wish the squad AI was better but they do their job, each weapon feels more unique and the worlds you explore are even better, they got rid of the vehicular exploration of the first which Imo apart from a few sections, it was lame and the worlds you explored on the first using that vehicle were extremely bland, they had no detail at all, in 2 instead we get the plannetary scan system which was not only cool but It never felt grindy to me, each class now feel even more unique and distinct too and I liked the upgrade system which felt better than swapping mods every single time on the first game, everything feels more dynamic, even enemy design is more varied here. Soundtrack and voice acting is still as good as they were.\n\nStory however it depends, the main plot felt like a huge sidequest to me which is what I call the second game syndrome, most second entries on trilogies either on movies or games or most medias, all they do is set the groundwork for the third entry and it feels like that here. The game lacks a main central villain like the first one did, however worldbuilding, stuff secondary to the main plot and characters are all better here, you have 12 squad members instead of 6, you get more romance options, bigger and more detailed hub areas to go around, better sidequests and less padding. Dialog and delivery of lines felt better here too, the quality of the writting has improved, the thing about mass effect is that I just love the world and the characters that live on it, after I was back on normandy when I just finished a mission I just wanted to hang out with my mates and let them talk to me about their lives, its so hard for me to engage or care about a video game character and in mass effect every single one of them, apart of 2 (jack and zaeed), felt like huge friends or family members to me, I wanted to be with them, thats what I call Immersion, I was fully immersed into this game's world, this happened on the first and this sequel kept it and even improved it for me and doing that to me is really hard, I just cant stop thinking about good things here, its so hard to point to a flaw to me, its nearly a flawless game to me to the point I would even call it Mass Perfect.\n\nIts hard to even accept that this is a game that has EA's name attached to it, its such a game of class, masterfully crafted, full of charm, like the first game but even better, Im so into the mass effect trilogy that Im already getting myself ready for the third game, theres no reason to not recommend this game, the first and second mass effects are games that every person should play at least once as I feel that theyre represent what gaming does at its best and I can safely say here that this has become one of my favorite franchises of all time and this sequel right here could easily enter on my top 10 favorite games of all time, thank you bioware!", "timestamp_created": 1601830123, "timestamp_updated": 1601830739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651873111724853516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76992725": {"recommendationid": "76992725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080405695", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1601816018}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1601763709, "timestamp_updated": 1601763709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568590342998504639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76980324": {"recommendationid": "76980324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314961497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1601746556}, "language": "english", "review": "blah blah blah. kill some robots. blah blah blah blah", "timestamp_created": 1601746733, "timestamp_updated": 1601746733, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.378093957901000977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76973894": {"recommendationid": "76973894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050333668", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 895, "last_played": 1601738411}, "language": "english", "review": "Needs texture mods as a minimum (ALOT and ALOV), first game is better but still a solid game and story is brilliant, looking forward to the playing the third and getting a conclusion.", "timestamp_created": 1601738749, "timestamp_updated": 1601738749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76966595": {"recommendationid": "76966595", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078126088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1601735181}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my first introduction into the series many years ago.

Personally, I tried to play Mass Effect 1 first, but for some reason I couldn't get into it (which was weird because I can stand other old games like Half Life). Mass Effect 2 is a lot better I heard in terms of graphics and gameplay, so I jump straight to ME2 after 5 months of quitting ME1.\n\nLet's first talk about gameplay. The gameplay in Mass Effect 2 isn't the best, but it's definitely fun and serviceable. It's a very standard cover shooter. Press Space then Shepard will duck behind a cover, and when you press the right mouse button Shepard will pop up and you can shoot enemies. The highlight of ME2's gameplay will be the squad system. You will have around 6-7 squad members (I believe?) at your disposal, and every time you can choose 2 to go into battle with you.\n\nThe AI for the squad members are surprisingly pretty good. Often times when there's a \"sidekick\" in the game that can shoot, they're often pretty useless and you'll be mad and blame it on them. In ME2 not once you'll blame your squad members, they all shoot fairly well and can deal quite a lot of damage. My only complain of the squad members AI is that they are pretty dumb in terms of cover. Of course, because the AI is dumb in terms of cover, the game forces you to use another mechanic ME2 uses: use the Q and E keys, and you can assign your squad members to go to a specific location you're pointing at. I personally like this system a lot because it makes Shepard feel like a capable commander, able to tell everyone where they need to go, and what they need to do.\n\nSpeaking of Mass Effect 2, let's talk about the main selling point of the game, which is the story. Personally I liked the story a lot, and I think it's one of the best among video games. \n\nCharacters are also a main highlight in this game. Every single character in the game has their distinct personality that is consistent throughout the whole game. I think keeping a character consistent is something games struggle to achieve, but ME2 just nailed every single character. ME2 allows you to romance your squad members, which is a fun little addition and really shows the devs' attention to the game. Romancing was always fun, although I didn't successfully romance my target, watching videos on Youtube was always fun. \n\nIn conclusion, Mass Effect 2 is a good third person shooter with a great story. The final mission of the game was one of the most intense moments I had in a game.

Instead, you scan planets from afar and use probes to collect something- including activation side missions discovered through anomalous signals.\n\nBy far, the best part is how much they improved the character development, interaction, and stories. Every single squad member has a special side quest which delves into their personal background and unlocks their loyalty, giving you new dialogue and a unlocking the use of a special power for them.\n\nOnce again I stress just how great this game is as a sequel, because it it packed with amazing references to the last game. It had me squealing in excitement from revisiting old characters from things as small as side quests to as big as previous squad-mates.  You even get emails from old side quests and characters. Even in passing you will overhear conversations in the citadel referencing conversations you could overhear in ME1.\n\n10/10, ME2 is a game full of intriguing, hilarious, and depressing lore.

It introduced players to it's new characters and universe, leaving fans salivating for its much anticipated sequel. Upon its release, ME2 received widespread critical and commercial success, and for damn good reason. ME2 is a much leaner, more refined experience compared to its predecessor. Its story-telling was going into darker territory, there's a whole new cast of characters in addition to old faces and the combat received a significant overhaul.\n\nThe game takes place a couple of years after ME. After an unexpected encounter with a new threat, Shepard finds himself working with the morally questionable Cerberus, led by the aptly named Illusive Man. He provides Shepard with a new ship, resources and dossiers on people best suited to help them launch a suicide mission against a race of beings known as The Collectors. Much like the first game, the general story-telling, while solid in its own right, takes a huge backseat to the individual characters and your relationships with them. The new characters you recruit are some of the very best in the series. There was not a single one that I did not root for or wanted to learn more about, especially when they are given their own individual loyalty missions to further flesh them out. The presentation also received a massive overhaul. General graphical fidelity and has certainly increased, but it's the art design, lighting and cinematography that really sells the experience. The bold colors and dark shadows perfectly add to the darker atmosphere that the game creates, and character interactions are far more dynamic and interesting. Despite the darker tone, the game manages to be surprisingly funny at points as well. The fantastic music and voice acting further sells the experience. BioWare was finally able to develop and refine their own style with ME2.\n\nCombat is another huge improvement. They were able to refine the shooting mechanics and even make a few improvements to character and enemy AI compared to the first game. The game is structured a lot more linear this time around, feeling more like level-to-level progression. The game streamlines a lot, from the exploration to the level up system, and in some respects I do feel that's a step back from ME. It feels far less like an RPG and more like a traditional third-person shooter with RPG elements. That being said, its refinements to gameplay more than make up for that shortcoming. The game also introduces resource collecting, where you would travel to different planets on the galaxy map and launch probes at select spots to collect resources for upgrades that are needed to improve you and your party, but also ones that are vital to your mission. On a fresh playthrough, this is easily the most tedious, boring part of the game. If you want to get the best outcome, however, you're gonna have to do some farming. If you are doing an imported playthrough or have multiple save files on hand, you'll have enough resources from the get-go for this not to be an issue.\n\nME2 continues ME's emphasis on choices. You can import your save data from that game into ME2, which not only provide subtle and big changes to game world, but you'll also get additional bonuses in resources and credits to make your job a bit easier. The game also retains the traditional Paragon/Renegade system, but this time adds an interrupt system to spice up your choices, some with significance and others just for humor. The decisions you make in this game feel like they have a lot more weight this time around, and have some of the most dire consequences for the series.\n\nIf you have more of an affinity for ME's more traditional RPG elements, you may be disappointed with how more stripped down it can feel. If you can look past that, however, you'll find a more interesting world, plenty of memorable characters and refined combat to keep you invested in.

It much more personal story, ME 2 to lets player forge deeper bond with thier companions and solve thier problems in order to prepare for the final mission.\n\nThe culminative point of ME 2 - suicide mission - is masterfully crafted set-piece, not only in term of direction, but also desgin-wise. It's here that player's decisions determines who survives.\n\nME 2 dialogue system has not only the same problems as original, but also I've been under impression that it amplifies them. Dialogue wheel, while cinematic, is ridden with vague paraphrasing and is heavily tied to game's morality system. Paragon-renegade, while not bad system in itself, is poorly implemented.\nIn majority of cases the paragon option takes upper right part of the wheel and rengade - right bottom, which turns the decision making into just choosing right part of the wheel without consideration. \n Further more, while different morality point don't cancelled out eachother, ME 2 gives player special conversation option locked behind a thresholds - some of them rather high - , which act as a ultimate problem-solver.This in turn incentives sticking to one path and never straying from it.\nThe new additon to a morality system are paragon-renegade interupts that flash during conversation. They suffer from the same issues as dialogue wheel, sometimes it's unclear what action taken will be and it further incourges  mindlessly clicking upon seeing icon of your chosen moral alignment. \n\nThe player's choice from ME1 won't affect the course of ME2 story, however it's the small touches that create the illusion. Depending on the choices taken in previous titles, player will meet diferent and old characters, player will receive new pieces of information or diffenrent reaction. \nIn comparison to the other games that boast about thier save import feature, ME 2 delivers on its promise, however small those decisions of impact may have. \n\n\n\n[h1] Gamplay [/h1]\n\nThe biggest shift that ME makes from the original is in gameplay. \nThe removal of many slower, RPG-like elements from the game and focus on more action based gameplay has mostly negatively impacted the worldbulidng and level design of the game.\nThe removal of inventory system saverly flatten the game's world ecomomy, all in game transactions has becamed one-sided means of acquiring upgradeds and collectibles with inablity to sell anything.\nIt also hurts the roleplaying aspect of the game, gaining new loot is no longer motivation to pursue objectives or make decisions and monetary gain is no longer something to consider as player has stable income from completing missions or finding credits during them. \n\nAnother change that the removal of equipment and focus on action necessitated is linear, more arena like level design with occasional exploration restricted to few story important parts. This decision also brought about segmantation of the game into 2 uninterchangeable location types. \nFirst type, hub like section where all non-hostlie npc are and all non-combat interaction take place ( dialogues, shopping etc.). Second type, shooting galery sections where the hostiles are and only means of bullet-communications take place.\nThis divide hurts the worldbulding overall, it breaks the consistency of the wolrd and make it look artificial.\n\nThat being said, how the shooting is in itself? Mediocre, but still quite enjoyble. ME 2 is cover-shooter with squad commands mechanics that comes from the time when the main character took half of the screen while aming.\nME 2 dropped weapons heat-mangement from previous for a ordninary reloading, which in turn makes combat more dynamic. Gun variety isn't great and, depending on your class choice, there are even fewer that you can use.\nMost of them are better iteration of previous guns or are version of trade off  for higher fire-rated or higher damage. The most interesting addition to gunplay are different type of ammunition, that have different effect on the enemies.\n\nFor a classes based more on special abilites rather than guns, changes were made for worse, every enemie in the game has either shield/armour/barrier that prevent usage of most power untill thier protection has been destroyed.\nIn turn, this limits the usage of special powers to either damaging specific protection type or to use it on unprotected enemy.\n\nSquad members ability also suffer from the same restrictions as player's, however in addition to that the number of commands and squad abilities has been reduced to only few. Crew members start with 2 abilities with 3rd unlocked later and commands have been reduced to go there/take this cover, come close to Shepard, atack/ use ability. \n\nME 2 doesn't excel in any of its shooting parts, however it's the combanation of these elements that makes it enjoyble.\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nME 2 isn't a perfect sequel, nor it's deserving of the critical praise that it received. It pales in comparison to Its RPG predecessor\nit copies the problem of the original and adds new ones, while cutting the features of previous . Finally, ME 2 as a product has been cut in to a pieces by E(vil)A greed and sold as DLCs that are only available on Origin.", "timestamp_created": 1597496180, "timestamp_updated": 1662017726, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469696968793869019", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74318825": {"recommendationid": "74318825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034545154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5093, "last_played": 1400994696}, "language": "english", "review": "Great, story-centered game.

Some things I really like about this game:\n- The characters, including a lot of your squadmates, are cool and fun to talk to, which is good considering a lot of the story-heavy missions involve recruiting them and earning their loyalty\n- The combat is solid, it feels more like an action game than Mass Effect 1 but less so than Mass Effect 3. Gunshots and other combat audio sounds appropriate in this installment in particular\n- Playing as a Paragon or Renegade is fun, and it's possible to be Renegade without screwing things up for yourself later (though admittedly Paragon does seem to give you the \"best\" outcomes very often)\n- Conversations are fun even if often linear, I'm a fan of the voice acting and writing in this game, the tone feels appropriate and never too goofy, which was a problem for me in Mass Effect: Andromeda\n- The universe is interesting, I enjoy the focus on only sci-fi (rather than, say, sci-fi fantasy)\n- There are some pretty good story-based DLCs, but Lair of the Shadow Broker is the best by a good margin\n- The main character Shepard has a good personality on their own, they don't feel like a blank slate as in some RPGs. This means you can't control everything about them, but I like their character more as a result\n- The ending feels good, I won't say any more\n- The soundtrack is great for setting the tone of the game\n\nNotable flaws:\n- The combat is not perfect, this game has a strange obsession with getting you to use powers specifically designed to take down one kind of defense (e.g. overload vs. shields, warp vs. barrier/armor, incinerate vs. armor). This tends to make things feel samey when you need to use the same power repeatedly simply because it's the best way to strip the defenses of similar enemies attacking you at once, especially on higher difficulties where almost all enemies have barrier/shields/armor on top of their normal health bar.\n- Movement is a bit clunky, the same button is used for sprinting, taking cover, vaulting, and interacting. This means it's easy to run into cover and then vault over it, which is great for moving quickly but not so great for avoiding the ol' swiss cheese treatment from enemies beyond that cover. Also, sometimes walking up to chest-high walls will automatically put you on top of them, which occasionally leads to getting stuck.\n- Whether you can take certain paragon/renegade dialogue options depends on how many  paragon/renegade points you have out of the max possible for where you've explored so far (according to the wiki). This means that, like Mass Effect 1, you sort of hamstring yourself by choosing a bit of both paragon and renegade. This is pretty much fixed in Mass Effect 3, but you're still better off choosing one alignment and sticking largely with it in this game.\n- Some voice actors are noticeably reused throughout the game. The primordial harbinger of doom for organic life is also a notorious criminal on the Citadel as well as a cranky mechanic who lives in a colony attacked by said harbinger of doom. Usually this isn't a big deal, but the voice actor for male Shepard pops up from time to time so you can have a conversation between the same guy voicing different people.\n[b]- Getting the DLC for this game is a bit convoluted - you can download it for free but you need to purchase a DLC bundle on Electronic Arts' Origin to actually get it licensed. Effectively, you can download the important DLC for your steam copy but you need the Origin bundle to actually get it working, even if you don't buy the game itself on Origin. This was my experience - feel free to check for yourself[/b]\n- Many of the side \"N7\" missions can be a bit boring, but they don't have much impact other than XP and other small rewards anyways\n\nMy recommendations for playing this game:\n- If you haven't played Mass Effect 1, play it first. Alternatively, get the Genesis DLC to get a story recap and make decisions that will transfer over to Mass Effect 2 (and 3 if you play it). Alternatively, watch a story recap online and use a save editor to modify the ME1 events of your playthrough\n- There are some good mods for this game. I personally recommend the graphical mods included in the ALOT tool, it gives a 10+ year-old game a nice new coat of paint (this tool can also be used for Mass Effects 1 and 3, I recommend using it for 1 in particular too). I also recommend a mod that skips the mining, hacking and bypassing minigames, they get tedious quickly. Note: for mining specifically, I recommend just using a save editor to give yourself plenty of minerals to do research. Getting the materials yourself isn't difficult, just very tedious.\n- As always, save early and often\n- If you get the game on Origin, disable Origin in-game if you have low framerate problems, it helped me immensely \n\nIn short, Mass Effect 2 remains a strong game that gets even better with some mods/external tools that account for some flaws and general aging. Definitely worth a shot if you played any other Mass Effect games or are at all interested in an RPG with solid action and a focus on characters.

I never played a Mass Effect game before this (shocking I know), so I have a fairly unbiased review with this game. My best friend recommended this game to me and I figured I would give it a try just to see what the hype was all about. First, lets start with the bad, then we'll end with the good. The bad.. In my opinion, I thought the game was too short. I beat the game in 20 hours (doesn't sound short I know but I'm spoiled by the Witcher, Skryim, etc.), and the side missions are boring and slightly repetitive. Also, the DLC, that I rightly paid for, refuses to work and you're constantly presented with an annoying \"Cerberus Network Product Key\" that you need to input even though the servers constantly refuse to connect. Now, that's honestly it for the bad.\n\nThe Good:\nThis game is a masterpiece. I absolutely fell in love with the characters and, while apart from Red Dead Redemption 2 and Arthur Morgan's character arc, I've never been so invested in characters before such as Tali or Miranda or Jacob or Garrus (I love you Garrus <3). The locations are expertly crafted and, while the levels may be linear, they are not boring nor repetitive and I didn't actually realize that my inability to plan ahead actually causes lasting in game consequences that carry over into the next game... I loved that aspect. It actually felt like my choices carried weight behind them. I thought every planet was beautiful, I found myself thoroughly invested in the story to the point where I am now going through a second playthrough as a Vanguard. I can see why so many people love this game. I truly grew attached to every one of the characters on my crew. \n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nSystem Specifications:\nIntel I7-7700K CPU\nMSI RX 5700 XT\nASUS Prime H270 Plus motherboard\nApex 600W PSU\nAdata DDR4 2133mhz RAM\nAdata 128gb SSD\n\nPeripherals:\nDucky One 2 Mini Keyboard with Cherry MX Black Switches (Hyperx white pudding keycaps)\nRed Dragon M801 Wireless\nBeats Studio Headphones\nAOC C24G1 24\" Curved Frameless Gaming Monitor 1080p 144hz", "timestamp_created": 1596590812, "timestamp_updated": 1596590812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489323854446411133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73778757": {"recommendationid": "73778757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090220232", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1596, "last_played": 1596584544}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 , would bang aliens again and again.\n\nEdit:Humans in the ship too.", "timestamp_created": 1596584701, "timestamp_updated": 1596585397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73757182": {"recommendationid": "73757182", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979544920", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6603, "last_played": 1467481325}, "language": "english", "review": "Unreal rpg.

Criticized in some major reviews for lacking a strong central plotline and for poor minigames (which you'll be playing a lot of, especially mind-numbing planet scans), this is one of the few truly over-rated \"great titles.\"  No, I'm not being unfair, as I do see all there is to love about this game.  And I clearly finished it.  But I was profoundly let down after how entrancing and immersive ME1 was.  Let's get into the pros and cons people won't tell you:\n\nCons:\n-Glitchy combat and cover system.  Even once you're good at the game you'll still go into cover or get stuck in it at critical times.  \n-Every Arena is designed (and poorly) for medium range rifle fights.  Almost no fights favor close range Vanguard-shotgun classes or long-range sniping.  Nearly every fight feels the same, even if the enemy design is cool.\n-Game really limps in 2020 without heavy modding.  Modding this game is not as friendly as you'd think for a simpler game.  At least get Me2 Re-calibrated.\n-DLC situation through Steam is 100% a nightmare.  People will be happiest who are on the EA Origin monthly passes that can include games with DLC.  Yeah, I know.\n-There's 0 reason to play it on the New Game + mode for a second time at a higher level.  Only a few fresh dialogue options.\n-Itemization sucks.  Rather than improving the cool companies, items, and variety of ME1 (as well as the aesthetics and lore) they nerfed it down to upgrade trees.  You'll only upgrade your weapons 1 or 2 times in the game.  And you may not like the upgrades.   \n\nWait, does this game have true greatness in any area?  Why did I play it through to the end as I suffered?\n\n+This game is a sidequest simulator.  If you love side characters and little storylines, this is the game for you.  I mean that sincerely.  They put far more effort, budget, and time into the core of this game than they needed to: recruiting your massive squad.  And helping each to reconcile with their past and family/enemies.\n\n+ The best of those character stories are some of the best in all of Sci-Fi videogames.  You can also pick some noble or truly grim and shocking options in influencing them.  \nThe S-tier storylines you should play dilligently are:\n-Samara, the Asari\n-Mordin, the scientist\n-Jack, the human experiment\n-Legion, the machine\n-Grunt, the Krogan\n\nJust right there are 5 small storylines and characters you'll never forget.  A few other characters are alright, but those storylines are objectively great Science Fiction storytelling.  \n\nThe gunplay can also have good moments.  And classes can feel different and unique for a game of this era.  In the guides section on Steam there's a neat few guides on the classes.   \n\nDon't hate on me for being one of the few people who did not enjoy this game.  But I honestly didn't enjoy this game and could viscerally feel the reasons why.  I am truly glad to have experienced a few of the storylines however.  \n\nIf this game receives a sufficiently impressive remake oneday, I *might* replay it.  But combat would have to be *insanely* improved and with difficulty options refined and an obscene amount of added content.

[/i]\n\nThis is exactly what a sequel should be. It improves almost every aspect of its predecessor while removing or fixing most of the things that people hated about it. It is bigger, more refined and certainly better. This is without a doubt the best gamee in the series. With that said. The first game did do some things better and it still has some flaws.\n\nFirst off. Instead of only having six characters (with one being Kaiden who sucks) as squadmates like you had in the first game you have ten plus two DLC characters. Most of these characters are new but some favorites return. There are no sacrifices to the depth of the characters though. These characters are still as (if not more) memorable, likeable and detailed as the first game. My personal favs being Garrus and Thane. The characters that do not get a return to your team still get appearances and seeing them is just as I stated in my review of the first game. You get excited to see them again even if the encounter is brief.\n\nThe combat has seen the biggest improvement. Instead of guns overheating you now actually get ammo, switching between weapons is faster, cover is no longer automatic and commanding squadmates is much quicker. The level design is better with much larger and smarter combat arenas, the AI on friends and foes has improved significantly (although there are at times still some hiccups with the enemy AI) and you no longer only have one of each weapon type. There is also a new health system. Health now regenerates automatically which I have mixed feelings on. I like it better in the third game. Hacking minigames get a comeback and they really disrupt the flow of combat with how frequent they occur, jumping over cover can still be awkward and there is a really bad effect whenever you take damage.\n\nThe side stuff has also been improved-ish... Gone are the uninspired missions, gone are the empty giant planet maps and gone is the awful Mako. There are however still some repetive filler missions, a at times tedious planet mining mini game and a more interactive galaxy map that can really slow you down. Side stuff is generally more tied to the main game this time around since you kinda have to do most of it to get the best possible ending. I do however love the loyalty missions which gives you a lot of insight to the characters and even some of the early fetch quests.\n\nThe music is still amazing even better than it was last time and the graphics are alright albeit with some stiffness on the animations. The story can really drags at times. Where as the first game had a lot happening in a steady pace this game has less substance spread more widely out. You basically spend most of the game gathering your crew for the final mission with a few stand off missions against the main foe of the game in between. I still love it though. Because it really feels like you and your team are on your own. You have \"joined\" a shaddy organisation led by a shaddy dude that your old friends dislikes, it has been two years since you were last seen and people are in denial about what is going on. I love it. It really makes the last mission so much more impactful. Speaking of which... \n\nThe ending is awesome! As in top five best videogame endings of all time. The villians are admittedly lackluster compared to those in the previous game, their plan stupid and there is also a really out of place and cartoonish final bossfight. The ending mission itself however is spectatular with very high stakes. All your squadmates can die, you can even die permanently. In order to get the best ending you have to really know your team, their strengths and weaknesses, you have to help them get ready for the mission by doing the loyalty missions, you have to pay attention to what is going on. I really wish there were more game endings like this. \n\nI also recommend the DLCs even if they are a bit overpriced and a hassle to get.\n\nThe game is great. Not perfect. But great nonetheless. It is for sure worth replaying or playing for the first time. \n\nScore: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1595929191, "timestamp_updated": 1595931210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73396925": {"recommendationid": "73396925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111892633", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1620457470}, "language": "english", "review": "Mass Effect 2 is a really fun game. The combat is pretty great, the backstory behind the squad mates is really good and the game looks graphically impressive and still holds up today in 2020 even though it is 10 years old (In some cases the graphics are even better than Mass Effect 3).\n\nThe only downsides are that the game ditched major RPG elements from the first game which was a little disappointing and the game does not have the same atmosphere or feel as Mass Effect 1. The music is amazing though which helps to make up for it. The last issue os that this game ditched the original weapon heat system and replaced it with a system where weapons can only coll down by using disposable heat sinks know as thermal clips. These clips make Mass Effect 2 just like all modern shooters and the combat does not feel as futuristic as a result. But you get used to it and it's much better than having enemy AI rushing you and killing you right away or acting clunky instead like in the first game.\n\nWhile this game has it's flaws it is still really good and worth the purchase, even 10 years later!", "timestamp_created": 1595905299, "timestamp_updated": 1595905299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50961536169052124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73390966": {"recommendationid": "73390966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198888955078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6171, "last_played": 1595504165}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not only the highlight of the series but also one of the best videogames of all time, and what really elevates it to that level are the characters. Almost every aspect in the game is made with them in mind: most of the tracks are associated with one specific squadmate, the main missions consist mainly of recruiting and proving your loyalty to them and pretty much every emotional beat is related to this characters. With this in mind, the game wouldn't be nearly as great as it is if the characters weren't interesting, engaging and developed, which they definitely are (except for maybe Jacob). Everyone brings something new to the table. Everyone has a distinct and unique personality. Everyone develops a bond with the main character throughout the game. Everyone matters, from Mordin Solus, the salarian scientist who grew a conscience, to Garrus Vakarian, former C-Sec officer turned vigilante, or even Legion, a talking geth who doesn't shoot you on sight. And everyone can die, which is, in my opinion, what makes the final mission in this game an absolute masterpiece, and probably one of, if not the single greatest mission in gaming history. Everything clicks: the score (which never fails to bring chills down my spine), the setting, the gameplay, and especially the stakes, the risk of losing these people you've grown to respect, admire and, dare I say it, love because of a single wrong decision. It's up to the player to know each crew member's strengths and weaknesses and to make sure everyone is loyal enough to commit to a suicide mission, otherwise heads will roll, and you can be sure that's on you. It's this sense of comradry and level of character development that I felt was missing from the first game, and it fortunately carries on to the third installment. The combat system is also a big step up. I really love the villains as well, who range from mysteriously eery to absolutely terrifying throughout the course of the game. The moment you hear their theme you know things are about to get real. Your relation with Cerberus is also a highlight, because you never really know when this fragile alliance might end, or if the Illusive Man, who provides a level of moral grayness I missed in the third game, is a friend or a foe. As for the negatives, they're really minor compared to the positives, but no game is perfect: some narrative beats are a little too convenient, the dialogue choices are less honest than in the first installment, the galaxy doesn't feel as vast and probing is really boring. Most dlc's are mostly totally worth it, those being Zaeed: prince of revenge, Kasumi: stolen memory, Project Overlord, Arrival and Lair of the Shadow Broker, especially the latter, which is integral in the development of Liara T'soni, former squadmate from ME1, and possesses some of the best action setpieces and moments from the saga (the rest of the dlc are skippable). Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a blast from it's shocking opening to it's bombastic finale. It manages to progress the overarching plot and develop the world and the characters in an engaging fashion, leading us to the final installment. The Normandy's crew shines the most this time around, providing us with laughs, emotional moments and eventually giving us a reason to fight for. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1595893548, "timestamp_updated": 1595893548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73378655": {"recommendationid": "73378655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139243040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1686, "last_played": 1445228552}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si Mass Effect 1 ya es una joya, Mass Effect 2...

The story introduces new revelations while retaining all of the groundwork of the entry title, albeit no Mako exploration \"funtime\". Instead, there is a large emphasis on planet mining through probes which deceptively seems mandatory, but you can skip most of it if you don't have OCD or don't care about every upgrade. (There is vastly more resources than you'll ever need.) There are more companions to recruit this time around and all are surprisingly well crafted while being unique.\n\nUnfortunately, while the initial entry gave out too many credits too easily, ME2 attempts to correct too much. You won't have enough credits to buy all the upgrades unless you did multiple playthroughs of ME1/2. Despite that, you can get most of the upgrades and just focus on ones more useful to your playstyle/specialization. Honestly, I miss the heat meter from the first game more than the limited ammo of the sequel. On the other hand, the guns function more like other games where each type of gun has it's own general playstyle and utility. You are far less likely to miss shots unless you can't aim whereas ME1 early on decided you were a StarWars stormtrooper.\n\nMusic and audio are slightly better than the first game. (very good) Visuals are pretty good, however some scenes are a mess when the camera is shaking and panning to mimic frantic movement/explosions/firefights. Unlike ME1 this game hasn't aged too poorly and is a 'fair' PC port. DLC's this time around are very much worth it even if activating them can be a hassle. (plenty of workarounds and options)\n\nI'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite sequel in a trilogy.

Combat-wise, probably.  Story-wise I still prefer Mass Effect 1 and its larger than life story and galactic politics of Sherpherds story.\n\nME2 has a large focus on small stories.  Almost every mission you go on is to recruit a team member or gain the loyalty of the team member.  When you complete that you will find yourself counting the other missions, main or side on two hands, if that.  There are also timed events that happen at points in the game.\n\nThe mini games are nothing to write home about, like they were with ME1.  Memory match unlocks money and upgrades.  Find the code sequence (another form of matching image above to image below) is the other type you will find on foot.  The scanning planets mini game is very boring but you need to do it if you want to research your upgrades.  Sometimes a mission is found through this mini game but it leads you to it with a message.\n\nThe ship in ME2 is a little more convenient to get around in.  That is good because you should talk to every main character on your ship after every mission to push your loyalty forward if you want the option of chosing your ending as the final mission limits your choices based on Squad loyalty.\n\nThere is a QTE (quick time event) portion to the game, mostly in conversations, that gives you Paragon or Renegade points (right click/left click).  These can make some mission easier depending on their point in the dialogue or harder but mostly just add to your morality points.  A renegade who fights the system seems to be \"the bad guy path\" but it all ends up in the same place.  It colors some choice dialogue but your crew will become loyal if you keep talking to them and go on their private missions when they pop up and in the end of the trilogy it does not really end up mattering because you can chose your ending regardless of these Paragon/Renegade points anyway and decide on the 3 color ending.\n\nThese stories came out before our modern day madness and ME1 and ME2 were written by the same writers, or close to it.  There was no smashing you over the head with modern day college concerns, and with one exception here or there all the characters from the Trilogy were well written with back stories and reasons their personalities cause them to react certain ways.  It would have been great if your morality choice affected if the side chars truly would follow you or not but some of the dialogue changes slightly.\n\nI highly recommend it based on story alone.  I am doing my first playthrough of the trilogy since 2012 release week when I put the series down and ignore the DLC from ME3.

I've never played the PC versions, I've never used mods for them, and I've never played the DLC. Holy crap was I missing out. \n\nFirst and foremost, for everyone bellyaching that the DLC is not available for purchase on Steam, it is available for download FOR FREE on EA's help site. Yes, it would be nice if it was available for free on Steam, but it's still free and you can still use it, so please stop complaining.\n\nI used to think this was my least favorite of the ME games, and I still hold most of the views that brought me to that conclusion. The armor and weapon customization is severely cut down from the first game. The level of RPG elements in the game as a whole have been cut back to make room for more streamlined action/adventure elements, and I don't care for this change on the whole. One decision in particular flies directly in the face of the lore (looking at you thermal clips).\n\nAll that said, this game has a style and pace that definitely outshine the first. And it's undeniable that these are in part because of the aforementioned changes. So it's a mixed bag. But I think all in all this game is just a different kind of amazing. The story is without a doubt still there in spades. The galaxy feels much more lived in than the previous installment. And impressively this is one of the few games with actual stakes in terms of building a good team and trying to get everyone out alive. I had forgotten some of the nuances of this and lost all of the crew that was captured by the collectors because I took too long to come rescue them. They are gone forever now. Got my team out alive though, so that's something. But they can die. Even Shepard can die. Like, for real. It's some impressive work from Bioware. They earned their crown, for the time they had it.\n\nNow I did play with mods. Most of these were centered around making the game prettier or fixing bugs. And for the most part it was a smooth ride. 33.5 hours to beat the first playthrough (I might go back and give it another go) and I think I encountered about 5 or 6 bugs, only 2 required a restart. I'll forgive that as simple luck of the draw. Surprisingly, this game was actually easier to run than ME1 (also with mods). \nThe mods I used were all off of Nexus Mods, a very well known and respectable site. Mods used are as follows:\n\n- ME2Contoller - Reapplies controller interface to game\n\n- Weapon Stats - Shows basic weapon stats for base game weapons based off wiki information\n\n- Modern Weapon Pack - Adds some weapons from ME3 and Andromeda\n\n- ME2 Recalibrated - Fixes bugs, broken lore, restores cut material, etc. NOTE: Moves the trigger for the Arrival DLC to post Collector base assault, to more accurately reflect the correct time line. This gave me pause for a while.\n\n- A Lot of Textures (ALOT) for ME2 - Exactly what it sounds like, makes the game look modern, or pretty damn close. Can't recommend enough.\n\n- A Lot of Videos (ALOV) for ME2 - Remasters and upscales prerendered cutscenes and attempts to force 60fps. Really good mod as well, compliments ALOT.\n\nPlease remember to follow all instructions when modding, for the sake of your game and PC.\n\nNow go enjoy this amazing game!", "timestamp_created": 1594059129, "timestamp_updated": 1594059129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602722346782684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72167488": {"recommendationid": "72167488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352400888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2894, "last_played": 1606736396}, "language": "english", "review": "was a great game, loved it. only a 4/5 tho bc jack is straight for some reason? nothing about that girl looks straight, let us be gay space pirates pls", "timestamp_created": 1594047144, "timestamp_updated": 1594047144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72167059": {"recommendationid": "72167059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102093431", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1592477256}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Story Continued.", "timestamp_created": 1594046716, "timestamp_updated": 1594046716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72163405": {"recommendationid": "72163405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040647053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1591, "last_played": 1594275372}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1594042965, "timestamp_updated": 1594042965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72161512": {"recommendationid": "72161512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031493827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 44827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39697, "last_played": 1603780041}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome story line and loads of fun for ME 1-3.

Another one of my complaints is that I can't fully romance Kelly Chambers, even though their relationship becomes platonic; by the way, ME 3 completely screwed up her character model so badly, she looks way prettier in ME 2. My last criticism of this game, which is mainly directed at ME 3, is how ME 2 does such a good job hyping up a potential boss fight with Harbinger, whose name makes him sound like the Reaper of all Reapers, only for there to be absolutely nothing in ME 3. \n\nThe Suicide Mission is my favorite mission in the entire trilogy, and if you save everyone, you witness a cliffhanger ending, which I usually hate, but this one is done so well with Shepard staring out into space as the camera cuts to the massive Reaper armada slowly moving towards the galaxy to begin their invasion in ME 3, all while the song \"Normany Reborn\" is playing. That song is my favorite OST in the trilogy since it perfectly captures and personifies the Normandy SR-2, which is just a ship/inanimate object, but it fills me with an even greater nostalgic and thrilling feeling than any Star Wars scene of the Millenium Falcon that made me go, \"Whoa! Awesome!\" To whoever made ME 2's music, you're a genius.\n\nAll in all, ME 2 is amazing and is easily the best game in the trilogy.

I really liked that character. in ME2 she was just some cold hearted information seller (whatever the english version is). I may understand, that grief changes characters, but then her mothers dead should have started that process. But as the character was merely a DLC in ME2 and not very important in ME3, one could forget about her.[/spoiler] \n\nWhat makes this game really great (at least for me) is, that you are actually building up a connection with most of your crew members. You have loality missions which give some insights on your characters. Althoug some of them were, well okay but not great, there were 3 characters which really made me feel: Tali, Mordin and Legion. I really loved their characters.\n\nTali:\n[spoiler]Feels somewhat like Liara in ME1. In her background story always a bit clumsy which really makes her feel alive. She always tries to do the best for most which is a really good character trait. Made me really feel like just wanting to hug her at times. Also the voice acting expresses her emotions in a very good way, although you never see facial expressions.[/spoiler]\n\nMordin:\nWell it's Mordin - he is just a funny guy and has some funny lines. Really liked him and his character develop over time.\n\nLegion:\nAlso just great, although a machine he has heart.\n\nOverall the game is about your team and rebuilding it, getting to know - and like - them.

Dialogue choices and story paths clearly suffered from Bioware's increased attention to the battle system and mission layouts. Affection and Loyalty are both trivial mechanics that require zero thought where romances will be triggered accidentally because you tried to get to know a crew member. I thought that the disconnect between the actual dialogue and the descriptive snippet on the choice wheel was especially bad in this one. More of my choices in ME2 were done after thinking about how my character is going to say this or what he is going to say than I would like in a game coming from the developers of Dragon Age Origins.\n\n     The combat is super solid, you can't break the (enemy) AI like you can in ME1 and the change to a global cooldown for tech/biotics skills serves the faster pace well. You can however very easily break the ALLY AI, doesn't really matter since MC does 95% of the heavy lifting and Bioware just made AI skills auto-hit, and the game is rife with glitches. I was also able to play on Insanity from the very beginning without the need for NG+ with my imported ME1 character.\n\n     I feel like ME2 pulled a Resident Evil 5 (when RE ditched horror for pure action) but not as severe as RE.

hour impossible. I say this as I worried starting ME2 that it would be more bug filled and choppy then I remembered. I don't have more than maybe 2 mods so I know it couldn't be those causing issues.\n\nI have come out pleasingly surprised. The game holds up INCREDIBLY well for it's age and I've been binging it for hours at a time. Not only that but the DLC is basically all free off of EA's own site, it's 100% legit. The game also isn't that ugly for being old.\n\nMy only MASSIVE criticism is getting the DLC to associate/launch properly with this game. The in game account/DLC network (Cerberus Archives) technically does not exist, but they replaced it with an EA account. This was NOT made clear. So in order to get all the DLC working right I had to:\n\n[list]\n[*]Launch ME2 at least once. Close it.\n[*]Have an EA account. You can do this through a web browser so you do NOT need Origin.\n[*]Take the three product keys you should have (Deluxe edition key and I had two others) and redeem those on EA's site.\n[*]Install any other DLC through the .exe you get from EA.\n[*]Log into Cerberus Network with your EA log in.\n[/list]\n\nThere were NO INSTRUCTIONS to do that, that I saw. Took me like 2 hours to figure that out.\n\nAdditionally, a minor criticism, I had to manually move over my ME1 save file in my documents folder as the built in transfer tool did not work for me.", "timestamp_created": 1592930193, "timestamp_updated": 1592930193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71228253": {"recommendationid": "71228253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832276675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1593105492}, "language": "english", "review": "get to boink Jack and punch that lady reporter \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1592926115, "timestamp_updated": 1592926115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71217191": {"recommendationid": "71217191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085831577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1652, "last_played": 1575059381}, "language": "english", "review": "The sequel to the story started in the first.

And to be honest not enough hours i think can cover Mass Effect 2 to it's fullest potential \n\nStory:\nYou are Commander Shepard; hero of the Citadel, the man (or woman) who defeated Saren, a rogue spectre and his army of geth. Now, human colonies have gone dark and it is up to Shepard and his team to investigate this and a new threat that is aiding the mysterious alien foe; the Reapers.\n\nTo describe Mass Effect 2's story it's like comparing Star Wars: Episode 5 - The Empire Strikes back, because it is on that level of awesomeness, the stakes are higher, and bigger; you must earn the loyalty of your team, through either your diplomatic firmness, or your renegade attitude towards everything.\n\nIt's not just the loyalty of your team you have to worry about, but also how sturdy the Normandy is - crazy right? Not just the crew, but the ship too? Everything counts, leave no stone, no upgrade, almost no side quest un-turned. The writing, voice-acting and cinematics are breathtaking in every way - quite a massive step-up for a sequel; DLC included. \n\nGameplay:\nThe leveling up system is more simplistic, as everything is more focused on upgrades now, you can do class types as always but there is no real huge deal with how you level up, it's upgrades and whether or not you are a Paragon of humanity, or a selfish dick who knocks people out for no goddamn reason.\n\nThankfully questing is more or less in hub areas so you don't have to worry about traveling back and forth across the Terminus Systems; mainly for scanning for resources to upgrade your ship, and your armaments. Yes, scanning for resources; you don't need to 100% each system by the way, just get enough resources through scanning to get ship upgrades and upgrades in general otherwise it will come back to bite you in the ass.\n\nAudio and visuals:\nVisually the game it's a bit meh, but far more stable than Mass Effect 1's visual. Audio is also still pretty damn good.\n\nDLC:\nGoing back to the DLC, you get two companions, a new vehicle (my god was that mission annoying), visiting a particular location, alternate outfits, and three really good adventure DLCs \n\nOverlord which has you dealing with a rogue VI incredible writing in that DLC even though most of it is through holograms, yes you will use the god awful vehicle again, but thankfully not too much.\n\nLair of the Shadow Broker - has you dealing with the mysterious Shadow Broker and teaming up with a certain familiar Asari, (also read the comics related to Shadow Broker to get the full picture).\n\nArrival - Clock's ticking Shepard; prevent the Reaper invasion from happening too soon or it is game over; Yes, this is the one the timed clock, be highly aware that you have NO TIME TO EXPLORE. IT'S RUSH, RUSH, RUSH. So ensure you save at any chance you get, and are upgraded to your fullest before tackling the DLC.\n\nFinally for those who don't want to pick a fight with the Mass Effect 1's technical issues, you can download the Mass Effect comic: Genesis which is more or less a prologue that let's you set up the \"universe state\" after the events of Mass Effect 1.\n\nIssues:\n- Cerberus Network is required, and it is glitchy as all hell. Don't worry though, DLC can be downloaded for free\n\n- Not controller compatible unless you mod it.\n\nMy recommendation is that you get an already done 100% game and test out controls and to see if the free downloads work or not before doing it on your own. \n\nOutro:\n\nMass Effect 2 has that Empire Strikes Back kind of feels, it is that awesome, that dramatic, and that emotional; whether it be on sale or at current full price.

It post-dates Dragon Age: Origins (which is a legitimate entry in the classic Bioware canon) and predates Dragon Age II, Mass Effect 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Dragon Age Inquisition, Mass Effect Andromeda, and Anthem.  Every game in that list is, outside of paid review circuits, somewhere between controversial to nearly universally reviled.  Mass Effect 2 is dangerously close to those games.\n\nThe core game is more refined, more polished, more effectively executed, but also more simplified, shallower, and blatantly derivative of other games.  It's Gears of War with a thin skin of RPG elements over it, and Gears of War is Resident Evil 4 with a cover system swiped from Winback.  The dialog wheel is back, but more consistently designed and with the interrupt feature added in.  The shooting and control scheme are both heavily improved from Mass Effect 1 at the cost of most of that game's actual featureset.  It really does hail from the heyday of whack-a-mole shooters, complete with all the deep and unavoidable flaws of that subgenre, all of which have us happily looking backward on it as a failed experiment that nobody needs to try, ever again.\n\nThe elephant in the room when discussing Mass Effect is the story.  The first game is blatant conceptual plagiarism, and so is the second.  If the first game is ripping off Alastair Reynolds, the second game attempts to take things deep into Lovecraft country and not quite succeeding.  It really feels like Bioware is trying to do the dark, edgy, deconstructive Avellone/Black Isle/Obsidian sequel a la Planescape: Torment, Kotor II, or Mask of the Betrayer but not really having the wherewithal to pass muster.  Most of the story focuses on the rotten underbelly of the Mass Effect setting; the player spends most of their time in ghettos, blasted out ruins, wastelands, and so on.  Most of your conversation partners and companions are criminals, washouts, mercenaries, pirates, terrorists, vigilantes, and other assorted types.  It takes more cues from Joseph Conrad than Rudyard Kipling.  One can't help but wonder if it might not have been in the cards at some point to hire Obsidian and got reworked at a later date.  The story itself suffers from pacing and structure issues that are relatively minor, but it also suffers from conceptual problems that sent the third game into a massive tailspin.  Mass Effect 2 is where the story starts getting off track with the end completely changing up some basics of the setting and overexplaining things that need no explanation whatsoever and for which the story began to suffer greatly.", "timestamp_created": 1592700675, "timestamp_updated": 1592700675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467625916004180908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71099212": {"recommendationid": "71099212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028626341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1593889534}, "language": "english", "review": "Old classic.

I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It has a strong cast of characters, engaging gameplay, good writing, and a decent-ish story.\n\nBut I'd like to dwell on some of this game's failures, in my opinion, just as a counterpoint to all of the praise you see online. \n\nSPOILERS FOLLOW FOR THIS TEN YEAR OLD GAME \n\nLudonarritvely, I've always found ME2 slightly lacking. You spend the whole game searching for specialists to add to your crew, and with both of the DLC packs this equates to a LOT of characters. The roster is huge, maybe even bigger than DA:O's, but unlike DA:O you can only have 2 companions on each mission (rather than three). This is fine from a gameplay perspective--commanding two NPCs is just about perfect for each combat encounter. But why bother with collecting all of these dudes like Pokemon when I'm just going to use Garrus and Jack, two of the first people you get, the whole time anyway???\n\nThere's a disconnect here between narrative and gameplay. The final mission rectifies it slightly, but I wish the system designers had figure out some way to integrate the ever-expanding cast more thoroughly into the every-mission adventuring. Now, in BioWare's defense, they do a decent job with this--companions give new weapons and new upgrades, so, in a sense, you are bringing them along with you on each mission. But this has always bothered me when I replay ME2 (and I replay ME2 a lot, if you can't tell from my time played).\n\nAnd then there's the story. Working for Cerberus was an interesting idea, but it's a little bit strange if you've played the first game. They're pretty evil. Taken alone, though, this isn't much of an issue. In fact, all-in-all, I like the story's limited scope--relatively--and I like the character focus. And I really like the characters. They're not nearly as good and complicated as David Gaider's in Dragon Age, but they're still on the better side of 'good enough for a video game.' Garrus, Miranda, Jack, Mordin, and not-Wrex are all great and engagingly conflicted. \n\nWe come to the final mission, then, and the stakes are reflected in the mechanics. You get to use all of those people you've been recruiting! Some of them might even die! YOU might even die!\n\nExcept then you reach the final boss. The collectors have been building a HUMAN reaper. \n\nWhat??\n\n????\n\n???\n\nWTF is a human reaper? Is that a reaper...that's fueled by humans? But then why does it look like a human, too? And aren't reapers, like, squid robots or whatever? And why humans? Is there something special about human DNA? Because I don't remember that ever being established?? \n\nI wish I could give you, reader, some kind of explanation, but there isn't one in the game. This comes out of nowhere as an explanation for the inciting incident of the plot and it has no set-up or, really, pay-off. It doesn't continue as a thread in ME3. In my opinion, this 'human reaper' thing is almost as bad as the ending of ME3. It's just terrible and nonsensical. Maybe there's an explanation in erata, or in some stupid ass codex somewhere, but I don't give a goddamn fuck about that shit.

If not, and you already have it here- alright then this is gunna be some work (Thanks EA)-but (at the time of writing this), it's not the end of the world- though to GET ALL THE DLC and possibly the game functioning properly at all, YOU WILL NEED ORIGIN. If you can't get the Cerberus Key to function at all- you'll need to go to origin's site or app, or EA's site- make a profile if you haven't already (they're all the same)- and redeem your Cerberus key and possibly other keys there- sign in in-game and it should work. For the rest of the DLC's you will have to buy the bundle (and only the bundle) from origin, at which point you can head to (might only work for United States) [ https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/origin/origin/download-dlc-for-classic-origin-games/ ] now you have the clearance to access these DLC, click the Mass Effect shortcut and download all of the DLC (The update file isn't necessary unless you're on the origin version I believe.) and launch the game once and sign in before installing them. You can figure out if they worked concretely- after the tutorial mission(s), in-game by checking your 'private terminal' (except for Shadow Broker, for that you'll have to manually get to and check-in with your contact on Illium).\n\nAlright- finally. As for the game itself its a refreshing turn for the Mass Effect series, you can import an ME: 1 save to deepen the experience this game gives you or start fresh (or if you did the work but didn't import from the first game you can play the Genesis comic-book style intro to make a few vanilla game main decisions and be caught up with most of the story), play through and either new game plus or upload your character into ME: 3 if you have/play it to further personalize and deepen the series experience (note- ME: Andromeda is not connected to the original trilogy by decisions).", "timestamp_created": 1592168655, "timestamp_updated": 1592168655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70792061": {"recommendationid": "70792061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038688293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1592363425}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, very enjoyable to play now that it's on steam, but there's a pretty annoying bug where you can clip out of a walkable area and are forced to reload", "timestamp_created": 1592161834, "timestamp_updated": 1592161834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70791765": {"recommendationid": "70791765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048994081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 7953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5388, "last_played": 1641254901}, "language": "english", "review": "Steam Good \nOrigin Bad", "timestamp_created": 1592161327, "timestamp_updated": 1592161327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70776439": {"recommendationid": "70776439", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974171399", "num_games_owned": 1057, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1539, "last_played": 1592274403}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably my fave game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1592140546, "timestamp_updated": 1644954132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70774887": {"recommendationid": "70774887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079628709", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 15067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15052, "last_played": 1595530690}, "language": "english", "review": "Best in the franchise for combining an improved combat system with fresh environments and great characters.

You really feel that you're assembling an unique team doing their missions, all for the mankind salvation.\n- The Justicar, Archangel, The Assassin, \"The Engineer\", and Legion are the BEST companions.\n- They put more tactics to help controlling the team. Combat system is improved as well (more ressemblance to an FPS, but it fits really good in this game).\n- More romantic options than in the previous game.\n- The Illusive man.\n- The Last Mission is ultra EPIC.\n- MARVELOUS OST.\n\nTHE WORST:\n- There are few main missions which are not involved on the recruitment of new members to the team; like 3 or 4.\n- The scanning planet mini-game is more tedious and boring, but it's necessary for acquiring resources for the improvements of weapons, armor, etc (only at first). THIS is the replacement of the Mako, and I think they failed with it.\n- The Last Boss. Not necessary in terms of plot story, and super easy.\n- The Spectres are not important in this game.

To me, ME2 represents a perfect sequel to an already really solid RPG. \n\nME2 takes place shortly after the events of the first, with Commander Shepard killed in action and then subsequently resurrected by the human group Cerberus. Who needs him to destroy a new enemy called the Collectors. While the main plot to ME2 is surprisingly disconnected to the events of ME1 and ME3, that's not entirely where the story ends. To destroy the Collectors Shepard needs to recruit a group of mercenaries for a suicide mission. Which is what you spend the bulk of the game doing.\n\nThe game excels at this aspect, recruiting people for a suicide mission. All of the mercenaries you recruit are genuinely memorable characters, and all with the exception of the two DLC characters have additional quests associated with them. The stand-outs are Tali and Garrus who reappear from the first game and developed since then. I genuinely love how the plot of this game is structured into tons of small side stories that allow you to just explore this galaxy. Many of the locations in the game such as Omega and Tuchanka really stand out. It feels so good to just live in this universe and experience these characters and it scratches an itch other RPGs really don't think about scratching. It genuinely feels like a game that rewards multiple playthroughs and playing through the original several times.\n\nThe gameplay to ME2 and the general aesthetic was altered. The game is much darker and contrasts with ME1's primarily blue color pallet with a more black and orange one. This allows the game to stand out considerably in comparison to ME1 and ME3 (Which both visually resemble each other closer). The gameplay was also much more streamlined and focused into an action title. This was liked and disliked by players at the time. Most players really enjoyed that the clunkier combat was made better but other players disliked the rpg elements were essentially dumbed down. Personally I didn't mind the new combat and I liked they focused the game on it.\n\nIt's really hard for me to pick favourites out of the entire trilogy but easily the game I played the most was ME2, I loved this game when it originally released. And I still love it now.

Mass Effect 2 takes you into darkness with a starting twist that will set the second game apart from the first one, but I'll get into that part eventually. As you gather a ragtag group of old friends, mercenaries, and criminals, the clock is constantly ticking towards doomsday on humanity. A new threat called the Collectors is invading and abducting human colonies. In Mass Effect 2, the brutal and vicious organization called Cerberus that you encounter in the first game will be your ally (?) in the fight against the Collectors.\n\nAs far as the narrative goes, the game did a really impressive job. Every mission was engaging, tense, and frightening. It's so immersive that you can literally feel that the stake is so high. Such as the disturbing ambiance in the Collector ship really makes you want to rip your skin off... or even flying your ship into the Omega 4 Relay as you wonder whether you and your companions will survive the journey or not. I mean the fate of humanity and the galaxy is literally in your hands, so no big deal.\n\nAll of these makes Mass Effect 2 really stand out as a video game and why it was such a big deal. I love the game but I hated how different the devs are approaching ME2 compared to the first one.\n\nOne of my (personal) problems is that planetary exploration is less present. I miss the sense of wonder and mystery while exploring the galaxy in ME. Granted, there's the Reaper problem that we have to solve. Oh and then there is my second problem. I just really wish we could get to know more about their background here rather than a DLC from ME3.\n\nThe customization is also an issue for me. I'm pissed off when I found out in-game that this feature from ME is more limited in ME2. The gameplay and combat are a step up from ME but you can see how it focuses more on being a shooter here than an RPG.\n\nMass Effect 2 is an amazing game and experience. I'm probably in the minority but these are just issues that some people would probably not care about.

This is more for people who are just now considering getting the game but unsure after all these years, rather than just purely a recommendation.\n\nThis game is truly one of the best games to ever exist, not only was it a milestone for RPG's and shooters alike, but the story is a magnum Opus against other games, putting old and modern storylines to shame. For reference, this is my favourite game/trilogy to ever exist, and it would take a feat to top it even after 10 years of its existence.\n\nThis game is perfect for all preferences. Its combat is stellar giving you many different options not only for weapons but classes, combat styles, companions, actions and exploration, but if the fighting isn't the main draw to you, then you are greeted with hundreds of story beats, options you can take that directly impact the ending, side characters in which every one is fleshed out to perfection, thousands of NPC's which have missions and personalities. I have played this game more times than you can imagine, and even now I still find new things that I didn't know existed in my last playthrough.\n\nThe only downfall to this game, is the one with most of the 'not recommended' comments address, which is the fact that DLC's do need to be paid for if you want them (And the deluxe version is missing one DLC I believe) however, this game is completely playable without them and aren't essential at all.\n\nI could sit here a gush for hours about how brilliant this game is, however we only have so much time. Don't get put off by the age of the game, or the fact that you are late to it. In my opinion, age doesn't matter, because this trilogy is truly timeless.
