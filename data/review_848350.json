And considering We Love Katamari is now available on Steam, I would much more enthusiastically recommend THAT game instead. Mainly for the following reasons:\n\n1) You can roll up all the cousins, but unlike WLK, you can't play as them outside of 2player mode. Bloody love playing as other cousins and considering you can do that in every other game I was surprised and DEEPLY SADDENED this game had no such feature.\n\n2) Compared to WLK, you lose stuff off of your ball a LOT more, nearly every bash against a wall or bigger object results in losing a recently rolled item, and if you're unlucky enough to get stuck (happens often in these games as you may or may not know) you will often have bouts of seeing a SEA of items flying off your katamari as you struggle to break free. This can be especially frustrating if you're trying to find presents/cousins/misc rare items as they can fly off and potentially be lost for that playthrough. Which is DOUBLY frustrating when you have to play through the entire level in order to keep whatever you roll up (except for the Eternal stages where you can quit whenever and it keeps what you rolled up)\n\nDespite those gripes, all in all, it's a fine game, even if just for the fact it highlighted things that WLK did that I previously took for granted.

And guess what? The game does actually have a normal control scheme to play, and even button mapping option... in options menu! THE SAME OPTIONS MENU YOU HAVE TO BEAT THE FIRST LEVEL TO EVEN ACCESS!\n\nThe usual control scheme for this game is so bad, that I have wasted over 5 minutes of my time TRYING TO MOVE at all in the game! It's that bad! And from other comments I have read online, I am not at all alone in this. The tutorial I mentioned above? I feel conflicted if I can even call it that, it teaches you nothing; and I accidentally skipped it by trying to pause the game so that I can access the options menu and change the game's screen-size and resolution. 'It's appalling that a huge company like Bandai Namco were fine with putting their name on a game that released in this state, and has not been fixed five years after release.\n\nSide note: I play the game with an Xbox-One controller, so I don't really know how bad the controls are with just a keyboard, but I understand that they're also pretty bad.\n\nIt's sad, really, as the gameplay itself (under normal controls) is really charming and fun.

It had interesting ideas, but was doomed when tasked with following up this miraculous first entry. The gradual increase in scale that begins with rolling up small things within a house, to rolling up the house itself, and then [spoiler]the whole world by the end, presented as if it all took place on the same map from the beginning[/spoiler] is pure genius, and everything attempted after felt uninventive, derivative, and most importantly failed to match the sheer impact of that satisfying sense progression). \n\nThere was a time before Katamari came out, and a time after; its impact is still being felt in many smaller-scale (dare I say \"indie\") games to this very day due to its fantastic concept and beautiful, effortless execution. And it would be remiss of me to not mention the intuitive controls that make use of [i]only[/i] the two analog sticks on the controller, but find so many inventive ways to draw different movements out of them. Of course, the game is not without its minor flaws (e.g., sometimes getting stuck is frustrating, and it feels like objects fly off your Katamari if you so much as gently touch a wall) but its sheer originality overshadows most of them.\n\nThe above paragraph was referring to the PS2 original from 2004; this is a remake (?) of that title released on different platforms. However, in my experience, the game appears essentially identical, though with the addition of widescreen support and a higher resolution. If any hardcore Katamari veterans would be willing to illuminate me on any significant changes, I would gladly lower my enthusiasm, but as far as I'm aware this is one of the most respectful re-releases of a classic title I have seen in some time and the next best thing to a simple emulated version (which I would still prefer). Anyhow, if you're looking to play this game for the first time, this is a good way to do so.

Since owning this on the Playstation 2, I've brought it to parties and any other get together for when people could relax, sit down, and just chat. It's an idle task we all could giggle about and commentate on without being too invasive to everyone's thought process.\n\nWith how this game is a feel good game for me, I'm not shy to say these 43.9 hours were sporadic over 5 days and I used the game to feel better in a dark time like I usually have. 100% completion was a fair and fun thing to do, no matter the annoyance on the Ursa Major or Taurus worlds. I popped it on while needing a break from the world and hiding away, but allowing my friends to hop in and watch as I streamed it on discord the whole time. I was able to steer away some pretty dark thoughts and held a game I know always cheers me up, and It was able to also entertain friends while we chatted and made sure I was going to be OK. This is a weird place to praise the game, and I know people may find this review to not be the usual \"Little guy rolls things good\" or \"Lonely Rolling Star\" fun, but I feel honesty is needed in stating how special this game is to me. Everyone else may not find the same emotion, the same nostalgia, or the same regard for this game, but this game is so eternal and it always holds itself to the same position it was before. It's age doesn't feel as weird as playing an old NES game you miss and were nostalgic for. When you Pick this up, it doesn't feel like you have to chase any of those feelings.

The first of these, from when I was youngest, was Final Fantasy 1 on the NES. It was not the first game that I played, but it was the first game I Played. As in, it was the first game I recognized as something to be solved, and not a bunch of lights I played with using a little square with buttons on it.\nThe next of these was Banjo-Kazooie. It drilled into my mind and made me think about it when I *wasn't playing it*. This was an important milestone in my development as an enthusiast of the medium of videogames not just as a game to be played, like monopoly or hopscotch, but as a medium of art.\nThe third game in that list is Resident Evil 4. I *strategized* for the first time because of that game. It stuck with me, and it informed how I understood mechanics, user interface, how the designers toyed with the player's understanding of the game world. It caused me to not just be engrossed in the world of the game as Banjo-Kazooie had first done, I was for the first time seeing the designers as people first and foremost, with intent and skill.\nI say all this as preface to the fourth game that changed forever how I see videogames, and that is Katamari Damacy.\nKatamari Damacy is a game that is incredibly dumb. It loves itself for being dumb.\nKatamari Damacy is a game that knows that YOU like to be dumb. And it loves you for being you, and for being dumb.\nKatamari Damacy is a game that is so full of life, and joy, and heart, and passion, and silly, stupid, idiot, heartfelt powerful delight for you, for itself, for the world, for everything.\nKatamari Damacy is a game that loves you. It is a celebration of you playing it.\nEvery level has a song, and every song, were it to be produced independent of this game, would be an absolute banger of a single that people would unironically listen to in perpetuity.\nEvery object, every sound effect, every choice as to the form of the UI, every line of dialog, every assembled worldspace, is so utterly joyous and clearly made by people who cared, not just to sell you a product, but to share with you the joy of life itself, that this game should, without a hint of exaggeration, be mandatory curriculum for human development.\nWhen I first finished the final level of the original Katamari Damacy, I believe I was 14 years old. When I realized there there was no more of this beautiful, brilliant, original game for me to play, and that I could not re-experience it for the first time, I stood in my shower under the running water and I wept.

[/h1]\n\nAlright, let me tell you about Katamari Damacy REROLL! This game is an updated version of the classic PS2 gem from 2005, and boy, is it a wild ride!\n\nThe story kicks off with \"The King of All Cosmos\" accidentally destroying the stars. Yeah, I know, it's wacky! So, you play as the Prince, helping the King by rolling a Katamari ball to collect all sorts of objects and make new stars. It's as crazy as it sounds, but that's what makes it so fun!\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn. You can use a controller for analog for motion controls, but I preferred the good ol' control sticks. Rolling the Katamari feels like building a snowball, but instead of snow, you're picking up bananas, people, and even sumo wrestlers!\n\nThe graphics are vibrant and HD, making the world even more charming. As your Katamari grows, you'll start rolling over things that once seemed like part of the environment. It's trippy in the best way possible!\n\nThe music is a blast from the past, and if you've played the original, you'll remember the catchy theme song. It's gaming nostalgia at its finest!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Katamari Damacy REROLL, whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer. It's quirky, fun, and utterly unique. With better graphics and portability on the Switch, it's a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. I'd give it a solid 9.5/10 for its excellence and zaniness!", "timestamp_created": 1690682270, "timestamp_updated": 1690682270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143016017": {"recommendationid": "143016017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198432807017", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1690705714}, "language": "english", "review": "my balls are sticky\n\nso is my Katamari", "timestamp_created": 1690632943, "timestamp_updated": 1690632943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142940792": {"recommendationid": "142940792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053532460", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1690532312}, "language": "english", "review": "My wife and I were having a spat when she threatened to leave me, as we went outside me pleading with her not to go her car was stuck to a giant katamari with me and her following shortly so now we're stuck together whether she likes it or not, so maybe if a katamari can save my marriage maybe it can help you too. \n\np.s. the kings is a dick but I will continue to prove him wrong and show off my amazing katamaris and bring him to tears", "timestamp_created": 1690532468, "timestamp_updated": 1690532468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142935577": {"recommendationid": "142935577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219211615", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 664, "last_played": 1693874290}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brought me out of my gaming block so its a win to me.

I came here after getting 100% of We Love Katamari Reroll 's achievements, and, damn, man. You can tell they just ported another console's version of this one and called it a day, with none of the qol stuff that WLKR got.\n\nFirst off, this one, compared to the sequel, is built for going slow as hell, which, it's kindof fitting that the levels themselves have like 40-30 fps while the prince in the bottom right and the prince's planet are constantly at or over 70. The turn is slow with a weird controller input where, with Simple style, you push the right stick up to have it go right, and down to go left, holding left trigger to make it turn faster, which was fixed in the sequel with quick turn being a single stick press, and, oh boy are you going to be slowly rotating a lot. The levels are huge, empty, and are more focused on exploring rather than quickly growing the katamari, which means that if you come here from the sequel, guess what? You'll be faster than the game was made for and will easily get a maxed katamari with like 3-5 minutes to spare, but you'll also notice how barren, empty, and collectathon it feels while you're doing every level.\n\nGently tapping anything will send 3-5 objects off of your katamari, leave you stunned for a variable amount of seconds, and will leave you vulnerable to getting hit again, by whatever else is around you, and, unlike the sequel, this one has no no-collide-on-long-hit, meaning you can in fact get stuck in places and easily lose 20 items or more, or get hit repeatedly by something and lose a similar amount. The level design is also jagged, so, when you're trying to climb something like stairs, you'll sometimes randomly bump and lose items because you hit a fragment of some unpolished collision.\n\nThere's an achievement for getting all presents, and you're told which ones have presents by the king, but unlike the sequel, you cannot tell which ones have presents left in them by hovering over the level, and, woo did they make them difficult to get, between the easy item loss and where they put them, it's like they didn't want people to actually grab them without specifically knowing when, where, and how to do so. An example is the Crown level. You'd expect it to be somewhere on the ground if you played the second game first, but no. It's being held by a tiny crow at the top of a ramp accessible only from one part of the level, which requires you to be at a certain size and to dash to get it, once you know it's there, through a tiny gap that you can easily bump off of. Yikes.\n\nAt least the levels are easily completable, they give so much time if you're coming off of the sequel that you can basically just zone out and get a level done no-sweat, so you can just play to finish it without an ounce of worry.\n\nCousins are.... So hidden that I literally can't find a single one! I've gotten halfway through at time of writing and I haven't seen a single one somehow.\n\nTLDR: This is VASTLY inferior to We Love Katamari Reroll in every way.

It was a nostalgic yet very enjoyable experience. I had already started a save awhile ago, but decided to finally finish it up recently. \n\nSome games and their subsequent franchises are timeless and Katamari is one of those. Particularly Damacy and its sequel [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730700/We_Love_Katamari_REROLL_Royal_Reverie/]We \u2764 Katamari[/url]. [spoiler]Katamari Forever on PS3 while not as good as the Keita Takahashi led duology still gets an honorable mention from me.[/spoiler]\n\nThis is a game that uses dual analog sticks to roll stuff up and that's all you really need to know. It's super simple yet very fun and hits those happy brain chemicals. Most levels you're trying to just roll up as big of a Katamari as possible. Other times you have a theme'd Katamari with particular items you need to roll. As well as some other minor challenges. The soundtrack is iconic full of whimsy and joy (Favorite tracks of mine include Katamari on the Rocks, Que Sera Sera, and Lonely Rolling Star). Lastly the remastered HD graphics really bring the cell-shaded minimalist art style to life.\n\nI still need to collect a few more presents and roll up the rest of the items I'm missing in collections then I believe I'll have 100%'d the achievements. All-in-all definitely worth a buy especially if you can get this on sale. I'd also urge you to take a look at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730700/We_Love_Katamari_REROLL_Royal_Reverie/]We \u2764 Katamari[/url] too since that's just a perfected version of Damacy gameplay wise and just the additional challenge it asks of the player. \n\nTL;DR - While its sequel is better in gameplay variety and difficulty Damacy still stands the test of time and is a goated videogame.

A faithful remake only occasionally to its detriment, as it still holds on to issues from the original like a fussy camera, wonky collision physics, and an archaic approach to UX (e.g. no autosave, no quick access to settings). With about 5 hours of gameplay, it's well worth your time whether you roll it up at full price or on sale; but don't buy it unless you have access to a twin-stick controller.\n\n[h3][b][u]Long Answer:[/u][/b][/h3] [i]Katamari Damacy REROLL[/i] is a remake of the 2004 PS2 title of the same name, and a very difficult game to properly categorize. When the King of All Cosmos destroys all the stars in a drunken stupor, he orders his son the Prince (that's you) to remake them and restore the night sky. How do you do that? Well, it's quite simple: you float down to Earth with a big sticky ball called a katamari, you roll it around to pick up as many objects and/or living beings in the vicinity as possible, then fling the whole thing up into space so it explodes into a new star--just like 8th grade science class taught me. If it wasn't obvious already, this is a bizarre game across the board, and yet one of the most charming I've ever played.\n\n[b]The first thing that stands out is the artistic elements, which are unique in all the best ways[/b]. Keita Takahashi has a very distinct art style--practical, yet whimsical and humorous, as he puts it--that permeates every aspect of the game, but most notably through the visuals. It's not just in the environments themselves, but everything and every[i]one[/i] that inhabits them--be it from the people or the animals nearby, it's hard to look in any direction and not find something silly going on. The eclectic soundtrack (directed and mostly composed by Yuu Miyake) further adds to the vibe; and its blend of electronic, jazz, samba, and J-pop influences ensures that no two songs are alike. Were it not for Takahashi's and Miyake's creative vision, I don't think [i]Katamari[/i] would be anywhere near as memorable as it is today.\n\nThat's not to say that art and music are the only things of note, though--a good game needs good gameplay, after all, and [b][i]Katamari's[/i] gameplay is deceptively simple yet surprisingly addicting[/b]. The goal is to stick objects to your katamari by rolling over them, adding their mass to it and enabling you to snag bigger and bigger objects. The challenge comes from the fact that you can only roll up something if it's smaller than your katamari, bouncing off anything that's too big; and if you hit something you can't roll up too fast (or if [i]it[/i] hits [i]you[/i] too fast), objects attached to your katamari can fly off and decrease your size. You'll have to start with tiny things like thumbtacks and sugar cubes while simultaneously avoiding everybody whizzing past you so you don't crash into them; but it won't be long before you're snagging entire islands full of stuff, or at least feeling the sweet catharsis of rolling up that one cat that kept batting you around when you were the size of a mouse a few minutes ago. It operates off this twin-stick control scheme that can be a bit weird to use at first; but once you get acclimated, it becomes an almost zen-like experience to play.\n\nThere are 19 levels total: ten where the goal is to simply make a katamari of a set size within a time limit; and nine that add a small twist, like scoring you based on how much of a specific object you collect. The former are easily my favorite thanks to the sheer spectacle they can provide as you reach ridiculous sizes, but the latter are also plenty of fun since they help make the game feel a bit less repetitive. Honestly, there are only two levels I don't like: \"Make Ursa Major\" and \"Make Taurus\". These levels have become infamous in the community, and for good reason: in short, they turn the arcade-y sandbox gameplay into a slower-paced (yet still time-limited) obstacle course, and it doesn't really work. They offer the biggest twist on the core gameplay loop, which I can appreciate; but [i]Katamari[/i] has rather floaty movement that isn't conducive to the kind of precision needed to get a good score here. Luckily, both of these are optional if you're only trying to reach the end credits, and achieving any score on them still counts as completing the level, so you can just try it once and walk away if you don't want to engage with it further.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game, and one of the few I can say I've replayed many times in both original and remade form over the years. It's not without a few hiccups, though they don't detract from the experience too much:\n[list]\n[*][b]You have very little control over the camera beyond moving left and right[/b], unable to even zoom out until the game does so automatically, so it can be difficult to see where you're going and avoid obstacles at times.\n\t\n[*][b]The advanced movement mechanics don't work very well[/b]. Dashing is hard to execute and even harder to aim, and climbing just doesn't work half the time because the game will think your katamari is bumping into something and drop you back to the floor mid-ascent. You can get by without dashing pretty easily, but a lot of levels require climbing at some point or another, so it can be frustrating.\n\t\n[*][b]The collision physics will misbehave sometimes[/b]. It's easy to get stuck in places or struggle to get through thresholds, and I once got myself wedged in a way that made the game think I was \"crashing\" over and over again, causing objects to fly off my katamari until its size got cut in half and I had to restart the level. It's not common, but it's possible.\n[/list]\n\nJust to be clear, none of this is the result of a bad remake or a bad port--if anything, it's the result of a very accurate one, because these issues were present in the PS2 original as well. It's almost [i]too[/i] accurate to the original, as [b]there are some useful quality-of-life features missing and some archaic design decisions kept in place[/b]. For example, your settings can only be changed in the level selection screen instead of the pause menu, and it lacks an autosave function as though it's still working off a PS2 memory card. These didn't have a significant effect on my playthrough, but I found it odd that they elected not to change them.\n\nOn a related note, [b]the keyboard controls are terrible[/b]. Instead of utilizing the mouse like every other PC title, it tries to mimic the twin-stick controls using WASD and IJKL to make even basic movement is a hassle, not to mention the ridiculous key combos needed to pull off the advanced maneuvers. Talking to a bird in the hub world lets you rebind your keys and even switch to a \"simple\" control scheme, but it's still not ideal. Using a controller is the way it's meant to be played, but be warned that [b]you can't natively rebind controls when playing on a controller[/b]. You do still have access to the \"simple\" control scheme to make movement easier, but any other changes you may need for ease of use or accessibility will need to be done externally through something like Steam's controller configuration tool.\n\nIf you don't plan on grinding for achievements (which is an ordeal, if you ask me) and just want to play through all the levels, [b]you can expect a full playthrough to last roughly 5 hours[/b]. It's not a long game and the gameplay loop doesn't evolve much throughout, so I can understand if you'd prefer waiting for a sale. Whatever price point you think is fair, though, pick it up once you find it there.

I didn't expect this game to be this good.\n\nThe core gameplay is really good, fun, engaging and satisfying.\n\nAlso you gotta actively search for the items you can attach to your katamari, because most of the things will be too large or too small (they barely add size, so it's not worth rolling over them), so it's not like this game is any kind of \"auto-scroller\" - meaning a game that plays itself without asking much of the player.\n\nThis game requires your full focus, BUT it's not hard. It's just very engaging - if you don't engage with the mechanics and the gameplay and just want to randomly roll things together into a huge ball without much thinking, then this isn't the game you're looking for.\n\nThe levels are very well thought out - as I stated above, you can't just mindlessly roll over everything, you gotta seek the \"good stuff\". To make this happen the levels are designed in such a way that not everything will be everywhere - sometimes you'll have to go to another area, cause the one you've been rolling for 3 minutes no longer has items big enough to make rolling there worthwhile. And to get to some places you will have to do some \"heavy\" lifting (it's not heavy at all, but will require a little more oompf to get to). Also, the levels are filled with hilarious items and creatures.\n\nSo, the gameplay is really, really great, but the humor and the story are just a cherry on top. The game's pretty hilarious.\n\nLast, but not least: THE MUSIC. It's AWESOME. Just, perfect, rolling is so fun with this music.\n\nOk, end of review.

You control a character rolling a ball around, and pick up things to make the ball bigger, which lets you pick up even bigger things. Extremely soulful, weird, and passionate. It knows exactly what it is and it owns it. Damacy REROLL has had a few small changes to the artstyle to reflect a bit closer to the Keita Takahashi's art, and minor time adjustments, don't expect any additional content over the original. Katamari games still put a smile on my face even after growing up with it, and by extension knowing everything that's coming. There are a few more in the series on PSP if you feel like emulating to see more. Just don't expect any toss-ups in the gameplay. There are secrets to find, challenges to complete, and items to collect, but what you see is what you get. The game is fun, very fun if you're bored and want something in your library to shake things up, and it oozes style. In a similar vein to Jet Set Radio, the presentation (especially from its era) still holds up today, arguably better now that its in a higher resolution than SD. I still listen to a few tracks from the OST in my free time. \"Katamari on the Funk!\" is worth a listen if you are interested, but don't want to buy the game.\n\nMy issues are the price, the poor translation to keyboard & mouse, and surprisingly, the requirements. This game is dated with the original release coming out on PS2 in 2004, and the PC version only being released in 2018 because studios are afraid of innovation now, or doing [i] proper [/i] rehashes of old ideas. I expected the port to be harder to run than the PS2 version because of the resolution increase and lack of streamlined optimization due to differences in hardware, but [b] compared to a PS2, [/b] the requirements are very demanding. The main reason it confuses me is because they were able to port this game onto mobile, [b] in 2007. [/b] Do not buy this game if you are on a system comparable to a school laptop. Be sure to check your specs if youre hooked into a toaster.\n\nThe main issue with the controls is they were designed to roll a ball around using an analog stick, with your character rotation being regulated to the buttons on the right side of the controller. Since keyboard keys are \"on\" or \"off\", the fine controls are much less ergonomic. Its still playable, but a controller makes the game much more enjoyable.\n\nAs for the price, I [i] want [/i] to say i'm fine paying full price, but I'm biased because of nostalgia, and I'm aware of the work that must've been done remaking a PS2 game in [b] Unity [/b] of all things. So while I can understand [i] why [/i] the price is as high as it is, the game doesn't have enough content to justify paying $30, especially when you can legally play the original on an emulator for as low as $2. It's just not an infinitely re-playable game. The only time I can recommend paying full price is if you're really interested in what you see, refuse to play any game in a resolution lower than 720p, and aren't willing to jump through a few hoops to emulate.\n\nOne last thing to note: \"Katamari Damacy REROLL\" is the only one available on PC right now at the time of review. The remake of the second game in the series, \"We Love Katamari! REROLL\" will be releasing in June 2023. That may be worth it at full price if the port is good, and the price is reasonable. [b] \"Royal Reverie\" is not a new entry in the Katamari series. [/b] It's a set of 5 new harder challenges for \"We Love Katamari!\". It will also include content only released to PAL versions in the original, with other minor quality of life improvements. Worth checking out if you like this one, but the bonus content will still not justify the price if its priced similarly.\n\nTL:DR: It's worth it on at least a -50% sale, but the game is still a [i] solid [/i] recommend if you don't care about value for money.", "timestamp_created": 1681045848, "timestamp_updated": 1681097329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136392652": {"recommendationid": "136392652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992990221", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1675053835}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no nostalgia, and i have to say:\nIf this game doesn't make you feel happy, you have no soul at all.", "timestamp_created": 1681020773, "timestamp_updated": 1681020773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136327203": {"recommendationid": "136327203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039860955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 623, "last_played": 1680962879}, "language": "english", "review": "Cozy rolling game", "timestamp_created": 1680945984, "timestamp_updated": 1680945984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136316145": {"recommendationid": "136316145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379820532", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 611, "last_played": 1697075070}, "language": "english", "review": "Pickaupa the dice\nPickaupa the mice\nPickaupa the whole house and wife.", "timestamp_created": 1680927613, "timestamp_updated": 1680927613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136304600": {"recommendationid": "136304600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025141337", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 387, "playtime_at_review": 1104, "last_played": 1700700761}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything", "timestamp_created": 1680910228, "timestamp_updated": 1680910228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136261700": {"recommendationid": "136261700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118004623", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4178, "last_played": 1680861419}, "language": "english", "review": "Funnest game ever", "timestamp_created": 1680861532, "timestamp_updated": 1680861532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136181324": {"recommendationid": "136181324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004420531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2759, "last_played": 1679434991}, "language": "english", "review": "In Katamari Damacy you take on the role of Prince of the Cosmos.

Although you can't expect this kind of game to be graphically intensive, especially when you're rolling and collecting what is essentially cities, so don't go looking for \"Realism\" in this type of game.\n\nThe soundtrack is definitely one of the best selling points of this game, it definitely makes you feel good and I'd be surprised if it didn't trigger some kind of dopamine hit in your system, dancing away collecting and rolling about.\n\nThis is definitely something I'll revisit when looking to decompress and chill out and overall just make my day a bit better down the line. Oddly enough as well, when I went on steam's store page, I noticed that there's a new one coming out on Steam on the 1st of June, so that'll definitely be a buy for me.\n\nKatamari Damacy ReRoll is a very Japanese game but it's super enjoyable and I don't really see anybody not enjoying it.

Yeah this is like a poster-child for that. In Katamari Damacy, you play as the harbinger of the apocalypse, collecting the world and all those who live into it into a ball of infinite friction, so your father (who destroyed his own domain of the cosmos over the course of a bender and is shoving his problems onto his son with the excuse that he owes him for giving him life [man emits red flags like a Bathurst marshall on Super2 race day] ) can crunch those aforementioned cities and towns into their component subatomic particles to begin nuclear fusion and create a star anew. This game is fucked up if you think about it, but you don't really think about it often, because you're having so much fun bringing about the apocalypse to Japanese-Clip-Art-Land, and chilling out to this game's absolutely banger soundtrack like  NAA NANANA NANA NA NA NA KATAMARI DA-MA-SHIIIII NA NA NANANA NANA NA NA NA KATAMARI DA-MA-SHI!!!!!!! \n\nI have a couple of gripes with the game though, and they are as follows;\nThe control scheme on keyboard is total donkey shite, use a controller like a real yakuza if you can, if you can't put up with it like me, its not thaaat bad once you get used to it. \nThere aren't enough levels, this is a VERY short game for the price tag, there are only about a dozen levels split between 3 maps, which is pretty bad. The variety is good though, so its not like you're doing the exact same thing every level. \n\nOverall, this is a very fun little Japanese(tm) game, its out of the box and very creatively designed put together, I wish there was more to it.

For one, it starts off in a small window with the volume cranked higher than Instagram videos, and you can't change the in-game volume, or any settings for that matter, until after you play through the tutorial and first level.  So, you have to turn the volume on your PC way down before you load the game, then you have to do a bunch of stuff before you can even get the game window to take up more than 25% of your screen.  Once that's taken care of, you're good until you quit the game.  Then, when you load up next time, the volume's cranked way back up, and while I can see my savegame displayed at the top, the only thing I can do after mashing the keyboard is start a new game.  I can see my saved game at the top, but there's no way to load it.  It displays what gamepad buttons to press, and if I hit keys on my keyboard it'll show me the keyboard buttons to use, but none of them do anything.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

I'm so happy to have it available on PC and all modern platforms so it doesn't get trapped on the PS2.\n\nYou are the Prince of All Cosmos, going down to Earth to collect raw materials to fix your dad's fuck-up erasing all the stars from the sky. There's not much of a story: Katamari is all about it's gameplay after all. It's fun, the premise is wacky, the music is stellar. Length-wise, this first game is a little bit shorter than the sequel that was just announced. At 5-6 hours, it's fine since there's almost infinite replayability, and you can easily close to double that going for 100% on achievements if you don't collect the presents in every level the first time.\n\nThere are some nits that I have with the controls. Ultimately, they're just Katamari-isms, but the main thing that irks me is how bad it feels to boost still, after all these years. You have to flick the analog sticks up and down rapidly to charge up the Katamari, but there's little to no feedback to know when it's done charging, and sometimes it takes a second or two to recognize that you want to initiate a boost. In a game with timed stages, boosts can be incredibly important, so it's frustrating not really having them on command. This games stages are fairly forgiving, but if I remember correctly there are some stages in the second game that really make you manage time well.\n\nThis is a great remaster, but at $30 I'd say it's a little steep for the ~6 hours of gameplay you get. At $20 or less, it's perfect.

This 6th Generation of consoles with Xbox Playstation 2 and Gamecube were firing on all cylinders when it came to creativity. You had no shortage of a genre to play or felt like any particular style of gameplay design was formed from one or the other like your CoD's or your Assassin's Creeds. Katamari was a game I had heard of once or twice shortly before I evacuated during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\n I can't tell you how much fun I had playing this, the endorphins of having a modded PS2 library at my finger tips at my 1980 born cousin's house. It felt more like a vacation at the time than a catastrophic natural disaster. I was 13 at the time. I thought I loved games before, but getting closer with my cousin whether it was learning how to build computers with him or mod Nintendo DS's We'd play some ethereal Silent Hill 2 at night after all day playing Burnout Revenge, A Dog's Life, Prince of Persia Warrior Within, REZ, SSX Tricky and Simpson's hit and run or Mr. Mosquito perhaps...\n\n I found a love for unique game design. But Katamari hit a different nerve, when I heard \"You are Smart\" while rolling a bunch of matchbooks and thumbtacks and eventually books to kids riding on bikes to cars and gas stations to skyscrapers. I was mind blown and taken back by just how many items were given a \"name\" and just how i could pick up any of it. \n\n\nThis game stands out to me as one of the more unique experiences in gaming. I suppose you could say it came out at a time when it affected me on that deeper level while developing an even deeper connection with my older cousin who I'd consider my mentor growing up.  I'd say anyone could enjoy it if they gave it a shot and would find it pretty hilarious or entertaining to say the very least.

This could be extremely frustrating to a new player since the controls are also a 1:1 of the original, meaning that a controller is highly recommended. Moving both the left and right stick in a single direction moves the Katamari in that direction while moving one of either sticks moves the camera. There are other advanced controls but let's stick with just the basics. Once you learn the controls you hop over to another area where you use what you just learned in action with no time limits, picking up everything smaller than yourself to get bigger and bigger so you can pick up more objects. If you survive that then the story can also start rolling.\n\nOne night the King of the Cosmos got drunk and crashed into all the stars, shattering them. The King being scolded by everyone is forced to make all the stars in the sky and forces you, his son The Prince, to help clean up his mess by rolling a Katamari and using those things as as a new star.\nOnce you complete a level the King of the Cosmos will tell you information about the star you made as well as telling you if you need to do better, you can then replay that level anytime or continue to the next level through the story. Replaying the levels and finding routes to try and get as big as you can before the time runs out is the game play loop. There are also challenge levels that require you to roll up the most amount, or frustratingly a single one item, of a certain object.\nAnother thing I feel that I need to mention is the soundtrack being incredibly good. Tracks that get you pumped up when rolling, relaxing tracks as well and that opening is so over the top you cant help but love.\nThe only other complaints I have about the remake besides the controls is that the voice audio is only in Japanese with English subtitles and I don't recall seeing an English voices in the options. Also on startup the volume is loud and will stay that way until you get to the main hub after the tutorial where you can then change the volume and sound effects. However, even after you changed the sound settings and saved a game file, the startup of the game will still be loud until you pick a save file where the sound has been lowered.\n\nKatamari Damacy REROLL is so nostalgic, cute, and quite the fun addicting game and seeing the things that bump you and block your path suddenly becoming a part of the Katamari as you become bigger is very satisfying. The King of the Cosmos, while he can be annoying criticizing you, his requests and dialog are funny, eccentric and off the wall. The game is weird, wacky and there is nothing else like it.", "timestamp_created": 1668282897, "timestamp_updated": 1668297914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655172049999237061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125348507": {"recommendationid": "125348507", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969062133", "num_games_owned": 2051, "num_reviews": 1210, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1545795709}, "language": "english", "review": "Start as a small thing and roll things up until you are a big thing.

What did I miss! An amazing gem which manages to capture the most bizarre and innocent feelings. \n\n[h3]Let's Roll[/h3]\nKatamari ultimately boils down to one thing: [b]rolling[/b]. And that's the core concept with the game. Suddenly, a so-called Cosmic God decided do wipe everything from the universe, except for the planet Earth. \n\nYour job, as the 5-centimeters tall Prince, will be to gather things on earth through your \"katamari\", a ball which grows larger and larger and eventually lets you pick up enormous objects as you go on. That's it! And I think that there's a lot of depth in its simplicity, even though commands are a bit clunky, in my opinion.\n\nThere will be some variations in level structure throughout the game, such as \"roll up the biggest cow\" or something similiar, to differentiate what ultimately will be you rolling and collecting stuff.\n\nOverall, I've found the whole rolling part extremely relaxing. I recommend using the controller to move around, because of the clunkiness cited above.\n\n[h3]In The Zone[/h3]\nThere's that sort of [b]Japanese Arcade Game[/b] feel, and I couldn't be happier about it. I can't put my finger on it: it may be the animations, the art style... the jazzy, fluffy music in the background. \n\nThe whole package screams creativity and originality, since the main protagonist will be instantly recognizable from the very moment you boot up the game. Everything has an innocent, blocky design and overall is very simple. I can see why this game manages to do well in terms of performance.\n\nEven though I didn't say much about the music, there's a lot to appreciate there too. The warm, jazzy, cozy feeling of almost childish songs in the background made the experience unique and, to be honest, pretty much replayable.\n\n[h2]Sending Love To The Prince[/h2]\nI felt very relaxed. \nEvery aspect of Katamari Damacy made me fell in love with it, and even though this wasn't a lengthy review, I highly suggest this game and I think it'll fall under my favorites easily. \n\nJust as [i]Wattam[/i] is making me feel the most basic, inner feelings... so did Katamari. \nThe gameplay is simple, and may be a bit repetitive, but its length isn't going to make you feel so, since you'll complete it in roughly 5 hours. Plus, as I've said, there are some variations on different levels.\n\nPlay it and you will not be disappointed.

Controls can take getting used to but once you're in the zone, the game delivers in spades an experience unlike any other.[/b]\n\n+ gameplay like no other game you've played before\n+ absurdist humour is a delight\n+ trying to beat scores incentivizes replays\n- very short game with very few levels\n- levels are not particularly varied enough\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nKatamari Damacy is a puzzle game, tasking you with sticking objects you find around the world to your katamari, a ball you roll around. Each level starts off at a micro scale and slowly your katamari becomes bigger and bigger, going from picking up dominos and pushpins to ripping out the ground underneath you and scooping up buildings.\n\nWhile there is a story here, it's not really important. It relies on inane and absurdist humor, which adds to the charm and allure to the game. However, the game doesn't really need a reason to keep you playing other than by the laurels of its gameplay alone. It's very satisfying watching your katamari go and when you get into that state of flow and everything seems to run autonomously, it's thrilling in a way that a game this simplistic normally wouldn't deliver.\n\nThe controls are simple to learn but difficult to master. There is absolutely a learning curve and you will frequently fight with the controls, especially the larger your katamari gets. As well, there were a few instances of my katamari getting caught on world geometry; watching my katamari just melt away because of the sometimes wonky collision detection is frustrating, but was infrequent enough that it wasn't a huge deal.\n\nThe game is a little anemic on content: there are 20 levels, 10 of which range from 5 to 30 minutes to complete, and the remainder have more flexible completion conditions. If you don't count retries or failures, the game can be completed in only a few hours. There are endless modes and treasures to collect padding the game length but a casual playthrough will be very short.\n\nAll that said, those are just numbers and they discount the fun factor of the game: you'll want to play it again and again because of its charm, humor, and just solid gameplay. It's a very pure videogame with everything else tangential to the gameplay. Even if I've completed it, I often go back to replay levels because it's designed so well and can be played casually while still being fulfilling.\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Specific[/h1]\nWith the few settings available cranked, 60fps can be maintained, even at as low as 4w, giving ample battery life. Game runs great with a flat frametime graph, it's exceptionally solid with zero dips or fluctuations.\n\nI always found Katamari games to be capable of skirting the line of controller abuse: I would keep that in mind when playing on the Deck. Some moves you can do in the game require rapidly alternating directions on both analog sticks at once, and at all times you are using both analog sticks. The analog sticks are used here to a much higher degree than most other games, so analog stick longevity could be a concern.

Katamari Damacy continues to be one of the most reliable games for inducing general happiness.\n\nA couple of niggles, which in the grand scheme of things aren't that big of a deal but should have been addressed:\n-The game launches in a 720p window and you can't change it until you complete the (very short) tutorial. This is bizarre. There is also a bug where the main game will not actually change resolution until you restart the game (until then, the main game window is just stretched 720p, while other elements will be 1080p/4k). Until I learned that restarting the game would set the proper resolution, I was planning to return the game over this.\n-While the framerate is unlocked, many things (including the Katamari) operate at a locked 30 fps. This can be quite jarring, when you get used to general 30hz and then the king moves the camera at 120hz.\n-No auto-save.

Although all cutscenes are definitely HD quality and you can use any resolution after playing the tutorial, you will be locked at 30 FPS, and the textures aren't very detailed. None of this makes the game less enjoyable than the original, but it will be jarring to anyone who plays modern 3D games at 60 or more FPS.\n+Music, sounds, and cartoonish look all work together to create childlike wonder.\n?Stuff can get repetitive by the last few levels after 3 hours in, especially if you don't alternate between stars and constellations, though the ball size of the last level has some extra uniqueness that makes it worth it.\n-Music and SFX volume level settings do not take effect until your save file is loaded.\n-Saving must be done manually, just like the PS2 game. There is no reason not to save the game after completing each level, because even after the final level all cutscenes, levels, and credits can be replayed.\n+Aside from the limitations of the port, it is otherwise polished from a functional perspective, controller controls worked well, and I did not encounter any bugs.\n?Evidently a controller is recommend for this game, and it can be really tough to control with keyboard.

Like Jet Set Radio, its sense of style is unique even today, and half the selling point.\n\n\tTo understand Katamari's initial appeal, I think its pertinent to know the time period it was released in. Japanese cultural exports have been around since the 80's, but around 2004 (Katamari's US release) it was still a relatively fresh well to drink from. I'd say that the 10 year span from '95 to 2005 was where most millenials got their 'taste' of Japan's pop culture (mostly anime and J-pop). By now (2022) their culture is so normalized that it isn't difficult to get an anime recommendation from a young mainstream celebrity or rapper. And I'd argue that Katamari would not have as outlandish an appeal today as it did 20 years ago because of it.\n\n\tI'm not arguing that Katamari Damacy is this 'landmark' achievement in Japanese history and culture. But for its time, it was certainly another 'uniquely Japanese' item for the burgeoning American sub-culture. Especially if your main consumption medium was gaming.\n\n\tWhat makes Katamari uniquely Japanese (aside from its development studio) is, most obviously, its soundtrack. Japanese vocals, in the 'Shibuya-Kei' style of music: an eclectic and quirky mix of light-hearted jazz/sambo/electronic music. Coupled with the music was its art direction, which emphasized bright and solid colors. Pleasant and serene everyday environments are portrayed with a level of quirky oddities that underlie its sense of humor. Sumo wrestlers bike with bears by ponds. Humans sport cube-shaped heads with static expressions. The King has a stoic and chiseled face whilst posing fabulously in tights. \n\n\tIt's a focused package that emphasizes light-heartedness, qurikiness, and an innocent sense of humor that creates a whimsical world. It's not that these ideas are outside the scope of imagination for Westerners, but its a Japanese invention that emerges from the colorful and serene creations of its home country. So unique is Katamari's style that it was exhibited at the NY Museum of Modern Art, which is no small feat. \n\n\tIt all makes sense when you learn that the director and creative head of the game-Keita Takahashi-was a former art student who worked in Namco's art department. \n\n\tI spent all this time talking about the game's art and music, and describing how unique it is, because its half the selling point. With Katamari being so bizzare and unorthodox, there was hesitancy on the part of Namco to bring it to the West. And rightfully so: 2004 was the year of Halo 2, MGS3, Gran Turismo 4, Paper Mario, and Metroid Prime 2 (phenomenal year btw). Katamari is absolutely nothing like these games in tone, content, or artistic style. Even if you shove aside the superficial, the game itself plays nothing like anything before it.\n\n\tYou roll an adhesive ball (a 'Katamari') around picking up items, growing larger and larger in the process. The only challenge is an arcade-like one: get the largest Katamari within the specified time limit (score recorded at the end). About the only unique level is the one where picking up a bear (of any size) ends the stage; you spend the time trying to pick up anything but bears to get a large enough size to roll up the largest bear. The game is very arcade-like: an extremely simple concept to pick up, with very little nuance. Supposedly Namco kept pushing for more complexity, but Keita pushed back.\n\n\tLuckily the game came out in the west, and to high marks. There was initially a low print run, since sales expectations weren't high. Given the landscape, sales expectations weren't high. It didn't move anywhere near Madden or Halo numbers, but it became a 'cult' hit with its ardent fanbase that slowly grew. Katamari's appeal is arguably stronger in the West due to it being that much more bizarre here. In the same way an American movie might have higher ratings in Japan because its foreign and different.\n\n\tCritiques that have existed since its release are that you are essentially doing the same thing level after level. That there are only really around 5 levels (stages are re-used with each subsequent one openinig up more of the level/altering stage items). That the game can be completed in under 6 hours.\n\n\tAll true. Which is why I say that its unique style is half the appeal. If you can appreciate the music and odd world, you're getting more mileage out of this. Katamari is a video game that can be argued to double as an art piece. To the games credit, even disparaging reviews admit that the rolling aspect is 'fun for a while'. So even if you're blind and deaf (but can still somehow play the game itself) there's some enjoyment there. \n\n\tI'd call it a classic. One of the 'must plays'. It's aged terrifically due to the art style (much like Jet Set Radio and Windwaker). There's nothing complex or intricate about it, but there doesn't have to be. There's an effective game loop, with some levels having a massive sense of scale that is emphasized when you start rolling over the skyscrapers that looked so huge 8 minutes ago. Hopefully they stop ignoring the second game and port that one as well.", "timestamp_created": 1658091265, "timestamp_updated": 1658106079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517076790332794189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118976487": {"recommendationid": "118976487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025147696", "num_games_owned": 2108, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1658089974}, "language": "english", "review": "roll", "timestamp_created": 1658090043, "timestamp_updated": 1658090043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118940622": {"recommendationid": "118940622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095371487", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1658975770}, "language": "english", "review": "A fucking classic.

This title is a remake of 2001's Katamari Demacy, released for PS2, published by Namco (before the Bandai merger). \n\nIn the game, you play as The Prince who is tasked to restore the stars of the galaxy after his father, The King of All Cosmos, accidentally destroyed all of them.. The objective of the game is to simply roll up objects on Earth to increase the size of your katamari ball to grow it bigger to roll up even bigger objects you normally couldn't before - these will end up being used as star replacements. Running into objects too large can knock you around and potentially knock objects off your katamari so it's important to avoid them as much as possible until you can roll them up, and some objects will intentionally come after your katamari or attempt to flee if they realize they can be rolled up. You will roll up things like: office supplies, toys, animals, furniture, people, cars, boats, buildings, giant monsters, and even god himself. You're supposed to reach a certain katamari size goal within the time limit, otherwise you will be scolded by The King of All Cosmos, and will have to replay the stage before continuing. If you reach the size goal before time is up, you will proceed as normal, but your asked to make it as big as you possibly can with the time left over - this makes the game an arcade-like title. There are also presents to roll up in almost every stage for a new cosmetic item for your player character, and there are additional stages with different objectives like: roll up as many crabs as you can, roll up the biggest bear, and make the katamari ball as close to 10 meters as possible without the tool to tell you the current measurement.\n\nAs I'm sure all the other reviews mention this, the game is certainly unique. While there have been a couple titles that I can think of that have taken inspiration from this title, they honestly don't do it as well. Rolling up objects that were once giving you trouble before is always satisfying along with rolling up buildings and hearing the individuals inside scream (I know it's weird to say, but it is entertaining). Also, the presentation is still pretty interesting, and the music will stick to you as well. The game's cutscenes don't really focus on the two main characters, but show the perspective of a random Japanese family during this strange time, most likely to give you an idea of how humans on Earth respond to this, and to crack jokes. Before and after each stage, you see The King of Cosmos talk to his son, and the man does come off as strict and maybe unintentionally verbally abusive as he questions whether or not you are adopted since you are so small and tells you he was playing catch with one of your royal presents just to name a few things.\n\nThe only criticisms I could think of for this title is the lack of variety, getting the katamari stuck, and, in the rare instances you fail, it sucks cause you might have to redo up to 25 minutes of work (again, it's rare as you really just need to learn level layouts and understand that you need to roll up bigger and bigger objects and not just small ones to succeed). And I'd recommend picking this version of the title on sale cause as far as I'm aware, there is no new content here aside from I guess the higher-resolution graphics. I think they could've bundled in We Love Katamari, the sequel to this title, as well as it plays off of this title and improves some of my nitpicks from the looks of it.\n\ntl;dr fun title, unique presentation and gameplay, good music.

I had seen some game play from the game grumps on youtube and was really curious about katamari. So It went on sale on the Playstation store back in April and I ended up buying it. Easily one of the best video game purchases I have ever made. Katamari Damacy is probably one of my favorite video games I have ever played (Which is saying something because the sequel We Love Katamari is even better). There is so much good about this game. The simple but funny graphics, the interesting controls, the absolutely unbelievable soundtrack, I could go on and on about all of it. It's not a long game, but it's extremely replayable. The main concept of katamari is controlling a little green man named The Prince who pushes around a strange looking ball called a katamari. With this ball you pick up objects to grow in size to reach a certain size to clear a stage. These objects range from thumbtacks, birds, cars, buildings, and even whole islands. The concept sounds very weird but trust me, it's extremely addicting once you get the hang of it. Some levels go beyond just growing in size. For example, One level has you picking up a bunch of fish to make the constellation of pisces. Another constaliton level has you picking up swan eggs to make the constellation of cygnus (The game has a lot of stuff about zodiac signs and stars and constellations). Since this game is very hard to explain, I would just recommend buying it. While some people say its not worth the 30 dollar price tag due to its length, I would say it's worth every penny, But that's mostly because I love this game to death.

This is just insane.\n\nIt's a one time annoyance, but it's super annoying. The second thing that I don't really recall being that annoying were the controls. In certain situations it's rather unwieldy and cumbersome. Of course, sometimes that's down to the katamari being what it is and the physics involved, but it was still frustrating. Another thing I found annoying was how rather small bumps would cause my katamari to come to a screeching halt and sometimes I would get stuck and just desperately watch how half the stuff would fall off my katamari. I guess back then I had a slightly higher tolerance for this stuff.\n\nDisregarding all that, this is a wonderful, wholesome, bizarre, fun game that is still unlike anything else.

It holds up strongly in today's gaming industry. Namco created a timeless classic through the use of their stylized and eye-catching graphics. Colors are vibrant and bright without being too saturated, shapes are well defined, no texture pop-in and maximum draw distance. Ailising is not a problem either. They are very appealing as you won't see this kind of art commonly. The music is absolutely memorable with its friendly but strong vocal soundtracks. There is chanting and full lyrics with a mix of singers. The game has a simple control system that doesn't take too long to learn while being a part of the difficulty (skill ceiling). The story is very simple which is fitting for a game where you just dive in and have fun. \n\nThe port doesn't add new content unfortunately, albeit it is faithful. You can't play as other cousins (characters) in single player mode as you could in the sequel PS2 game without mods. The camera still suffers but it is nothing unplayable. Aside from missed opportunities the one flaw of the port is that it boots in windowed mode, but you can change this.\n\nThe story can be done in about 3 hours without repeating anything, but there is plenty of side content which can extend this to around 6 hours. There isn't a ton of different stages but they differentiate between them enough to keep things always interesting. Trying to outdo your times and records creates incentive for competition as well.\n\nOverall this game is a no brainer to pick up on sale and still worth it for retail if you want to play something mesmerising and soothing.

Its simple, yet engaging gameplay, its hilarious writing, gorgeous art style, and catchy music are sure to charm any gamer, hardcore or casual, as long as they are open minded enough to engage with something a little outside of the box.\n\n9.5/10\n\nThe good:\n\nKatamari Damacy is a game about pushing a giant sticky ball, (called a Katamari) around while gathering more and more objects that stick to it, growing its size, and allowing bigger objects to stick to it, wreaking increasing amounts of havoc. It's basically a score based arcade game, where you try to get your Katamari as big as possible under a time limit. While that may sound fairly boring, Katamari Damacy makes it fun and exciting by engaging through its genious design and art. Rolling the Katamari around is handled by using the analog sticks on a controller (please don't play this on a keyboard, it's not as fun), each controlling one of the Prince's hands. This unconventional control scheme takes some getting used to, but it provides a very \"realistic\" feeling to controlling the action on screen. You really feel like a small guy trying to push a giant ball, with an increasing intertia, as more things get stuck on it, and it gets heavier. You start off in an open level by pushing a light, small Katamari, picking up pins, pencil erasers, small sweets etc. Getting hit by something bigger, like the house cat, causes items stuck to your Katamari to become unstuck fly off, so you really need to be careful in what you try to pick up. As you pick up more things, and the Katamari gets bigger, you can pick up bigger and bigger objects, including the house cat that gave you trouble earlier. In the later levels you can find yourself wreacking havoc with a ginat hard to control Katamari, picking up entire city blocks, trees, and Godzillas. This slow progression from a place of vulnerability to one of absolute dominance over one's environment is an inherently satisfying power fantasy. The visuals are colorful and vibrant, full of Japanese quirk and charm. There are tons of objects to be picked up in each level, both still and moving, but the art style's simplicity keep it from being visually overwhelming. The music is upbeat, high energy pop perfection, blending different styles from jazz and samba to electronic and J-pop in very imaginative ways. It is also incredibly infectious, and it fits the tone and gameplay rhythm perfectly. Finally, the game's writing (what little there is of it) is hilarious. The King of All Cosmos, the main character's father is a very efficiently written character, with his incompetency, self centeredness, and open disdain for the Prince becoming lovable traits through his cute and flowery dialogue. Thematically, the game serves as a satire/critique of consumer culture, where you're trying to collect as much stuff as possible, your efforts do so are never enough, and you're destroying everything around you to do so. This dark undertone of the game is presented subtly, and adds a layer of depth to something seemingly juvenile and meaningless.\n\nThe meh:\n\nThe number of different levels in this game is fairly small, as the same environments are reused for challenges at different scales. That is excusable, and something the later games in the series would improve upon. The gameplay. while absolutely fantastic, as described in the above section, can become a little samey after a little while, and not for a lack of effort. Some challenges are centered around picking up as many objects of a certain kind as possible, or picking up the biggest object of a certain kind you can. These are fun, but I wish the game did a bit more to diversify the gameplay. Finally, while the gameplay allows for some interesting challenges, the ones set by the game are very easy to complete, with ample time being given for each one. There's also no incentive to get higher scores than the ones expected of you, not even a high score board. I realize that this is probably by design, as Katamari is designed to be an aggressively accessible, and pretty laid back experience, but I wish there at least was an option for higher difficulties.\n\nThe bad:\n\nI honestly can't think of anything particularly bad about this game. It's nearly perfect in my eyes, and my only gripes with it are so personal and so minor that I can't explicitly call them bad.", "timestamp_created": 1646863906, "timestamp_updated": 1646863906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111861952": {"recommendationid": "111861952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072016138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1648401277}, "language": "english", "review": "Siempre me gust\u00f3 este juego, parece de ni\u00f1os pero tiene un fondo adulto.

What separates this from your average pacman clone is that you have a fully realised 3D world - and your ball can only pick up small things before it can grow big enough to pick up bigger things. Trying to pick up things before you are able to will knock something off your ball and slow you down - wasting time. What you choose to pick up and where on the map you choose to go is part of the game's strategy - in addition to trying to control a rolling ball and it's momentum from many of the zany things on each map.\n\nKeyboard controls on the PC game will take some getting used to: WSAD on your left hand and IKJL on your right hand. Once you get over the control issues (which is going to take some practice) you'll be an unstoppable rolling machine. Starting with small things around the house, eventually you'll be rolling over small animals, dogs, and eventually people, cars, heavy machinery, entire houses, well... you can see where this is eventually going to go!\n\nThis is a great casual game with an enormous amount of replayability thanks to some of the different challenges on each level. And that soundtrack - WOW - you'll fall in love with it and the songs are all genuine earworms.\n\nIf you haven't played it, you should.

This franchise is just not my cup of tea.\nThis game is honestly just so unsatisfying to play. You're constantly bumping into things all the time and losing parts of your Katamari because of how close-knit everything is, and getting jostled and slapped around by all the random things in the world. Or stopping flat in your tracks because something that looks like it should be an add to your katamari, is in-fact. Not. Or things that *can* be, have to be knocked-down to the ground first away from your katamari and you have to roll over it with the janky slow controls, instead of just being added to your katamari.\n\nIn-regards to difficulty, I found this game to be quite easy, I only got one gameover during my entire playthrough of the game. But despite it, the game for me is just not that fun to play. I always wanted to play one of these games and roll up loads of stuff because that sounds amazing and fun.\nBut the reality is, the game is just frustrating exercise in (excuse my crudeness) c*ck-teasing. Whenever you're starting to enjoy something about the game, the game stops your fun right in its tracks with being hit around, abruptly stopping due to being too close to something too big, sloggish controls, and at times poor item pacing.\n\nAnother mark against the game is just how awful the king is. He's so incredibly mean that I ended up just skipping all of his text. This game is such a silly, cute little funny fantasy romp through a weird world. And then you get this guy who's openly belittling you, and this is taken to 11 when get a game over (seriously, look it up on youtube). He just spends an actual full F*cking minute just shaming, belitting, and speaking down to you for failing the level. It's truly appalling. I don't see what's supposed to be funny about that, and all it does is serve to completely destroy my mood whilst playing the game.\n\nThe music was fantastic, and the katamari art style is still as unique as the day it released. The humor for the most part is pretty funny, but the bizzare humor really becomes stale as the game goes on as they clearly have no new jokes to tell or ways to switch it up.\n\nUltimately, I don't like this game. At every turn, the game's doing something to completely kill the vibe and mood of the game. And I honestly kind of hate it for that. I wasn't expecting this from a game i've heard so much good about and have been wanting to play since I was a little kid.\n\n(P.S, I recognize that as one's skill increases at the game, I have zero doubts that the bumping problem and abrupt stopping would deeply decline. But for someone who is only interested in playing casually with little regards to paying attention to the size values of everything and all that other stuff. It's just not fun for me.)", "timestamp_created": 1644899058, "timestamp_updated": 1644899058, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436472952365875244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110212040": {"recommendationid": "110212040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198945376202", "num_games_owned": 687, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1650417453}, "language": "english", "review": "i like collecting things in real life, the perfect game for me", "timestamp_created": 1644830101, "timestamp_updated": 1644830101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110187594": {"recommendationid": "110187594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212112473", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1644794123}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

The game is, of course, a remastered port of the original PS2 game, and while it doesn't add much beyond HD graphics, it really doesn't need to. The game is wacky and wonderful all on its own, and it has aged remarkably well.

I ran out of things to roll up several minutes ahead of time in nearly every stage.\n- I don' think the humor in the first game is as good as it was in the following titles. \n- You have to get through the tutorial using a keyboard before it'll let you access a menu that lets you use a controller.\n- The game has no auto-save. They double down on this in the game by clearly warning you that you have to manually save your data.

I beat it in 5 hours but stretched it for longer to do some completion content. Everything thing i said before still applies, but you probably don't want to spend more than $20 on this.

[i]Reroll[/i] introduces the beloved PlayStation 2 release to present-day platforms and embraces improvements that help [i]Katamari Damacy[/i] reach its full potential. \n\nRemasters are usually hit or miss due to the inherent awkwardness of updating a video game to suit modern technology. Gameplay changes and the jump to a higher resolution don\u2019t always support the original artistic intentions and technical decisions. Fortunately, [i]Reroll[/i]\u2019s simple image quality upgrade doesn\u2019t only clear up a screen full of clutter\u2014it enhances the overall experience while retaining the original minimalist art style.\n\nInstead of stretching out the image to widescreen, [i]Reroll[/i] maintains the same camera position as the original but provides a wider view, enabling players to experience and engage with more of the complex environment. This extended view also benefits players when the Katamari grows to larger sizes, as it supports a more efficient peripheral for when movement can get tricky.\n\n[i]Reroll[/i] also preserves the original textures from the PlayStation 2 version but sharpens and cleans them up for high-definition.

ROLLING UP THE WORLD!!!!! As long as you make your katamari big enough there's nothing you can't roll up from cows, giant radishes, to entire buildings, and chunks out of the ground. \n\nThe soundtrack is a true hidden gem in games I have played and is immediately going into my playlist as soon as possible since it just has a real fun unique sound that I don't hear out of to many games anymore. 10/10 would bop to soundtrack again\n\nI can't explain much about the little side story between the main missions besides there's a thing with a strange unnamed family going on a trip to a space station.

If it at least had a 'try again' option from these levels it wouldn't be so annoying. I ran into a sign and it had a cow on it and I died inside. So frustrating.\n\nBut otherwise, it's as crazy as I remember it. Rolling up into insane sizes is always fun. I would prefer if the dash was done differently. Needing to move the sticks up and down opposite each other multiple times is cumbersome and the distance the boost even takes you feels like it's barely further than if you just kept going without the interruption. *shrug*\n\nFunny/silly story.

There is local multiplayer. The story is mostly nonsense/random. There is some variation in side levels (for example, instead of getting the biggest ball you might be asked to collect the biggest specific object).\n\nIf you enjoy this type of game and have already played all the Katamari games, you could take a look at The Wonderful End of the World (which is a Katamari-like game which offers many more levels to play but isn't as polished (for example, you can't see items on the ball)).\n\nOther thoughts:[list]\n[*]You can actually see the items you pick up on your ball. When you crash and lose mass, things fly off nearby and you can pick some things back up. \n[*]I wish the camera was more zoomed out.\n[*]It feels weird at first but to properly turn you need to hold L-down/R-up or vice versa (if you just hold down-left to turn you'll just move the ball but not the camera so you can't see where you're going).\n[*]It only has a few levels. The most reused one is large and it changes where you spawn and the item locations to help make it feel a little different.\n[*]Sometimes small things are hard to pick up when you're too big (it matters more on side levels where you have to collect a specific type of object).\n[*]You can get pretty stuck in some areas (until maybe you lose enough mass to escape).\n[*]The most frustrating part was the 'collect the biggest bear you can find'. Since the level ends when you get one it gets pretty frustrating when you accidentally run into a random tiny item, a small one runs into you, or you get hit by a car and ricochet into one and have to waste like 20 seconds to retry the level. I'd much rather have it where you can discard the item (with at worst a time penalty) and continue playing (until time runs out).", "timestamp_created": 1632606260, "timestamp_updated": 1632606260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99902286": {"recommendationid": "99902286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198966226667", "num_games_owned": 1568, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1234, "last_played": 1679439396}, "language": "english", "review": "I love balls", "timestamp_created": 1632515911, "timestamp_updated": 1632515911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925341129302979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99898396": {"recommendationid": "99898396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304807932", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3268, "last_played": 1634941512}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been such a long time since I've found a game that genuinely makes me happy, and at last I've found one!

Following the previews in PSM leading up to its release, and finally picking up that odd little budget title at Best Buy when it came out (the clerk was very confused as to what the game was, I told him I'd heard great things). I have a fondness for the games that will never fade, so I was pretty excited to give this new port a shot. I say \"port\" instead of \"remake,\" because, beyond minor visual improvement in a select few areas, this is straight-up the same game we got in 2004, warts and all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the problems in the original aren't deal-breakers by a long shot. It was to be expected for such a new game concept. But the sequel, [i]We Love Katamari[/i], ironed out virtually all those issues. The physics were much more forgiving, and generally it didn't penalize you for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Going back to the original can almost feel like the game engine is just a prototype. So in \"Reroll,\" I was expecting at least some quality of life improvements from [i]We Love Katamari[/i] and [i]Katamari Forever[/i], but instead it plays exactly the same.\n\nNot only this, but new visual and audio bugs/glitches can be found in this version. Yes, they tend to be minor, but it's pretty bad to see it in a lazy port that bills itself as a remake.\n\nThat said, if you're a fan of the series, get it. If you like weird Japanese games, get it. As much as I don't want to reward Namco Bandai for the extreme laziness of this port, it's still a fantastic game, and I'm still holding out hope for a [i]We Love Katamari Reroll[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1631345090, "timestamp_updated": 1631426205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99119987": {"recommendationid": "99119987", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999363101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 412, "last_played": 1631457127}, "language": "english", "review": "Every time a new level got going and my Katamari scaled up one or two times, I found myself with a huge shit-eating smile on my face.

While the controls are god awful and can't be changed, the huge amount of charm will have you strangely addicted....as long as you remember the game is not supposed to be frustrating. \n\n[i]Positives[/i]\n[list]\n[*]Everything about the game just oozes charm and love. The character designs, the settings and the overall craziness of some items really enhances replayability\n[*]Every single item (1400+) has a section in the collection guide with a brief discriptions which are often actually quite funny.\n[*]I know the game is fairly old, but the gameplay is simply unique. I don't think anything has ever been done like this even until now. Katamari Damacy has such unique gameplay and there isn't any other game I can think of that even resembles it's gameplay elements.\n[/list]\n[i]Neutral[/i]\n[list]\n[*]The game is fairly short; you can complete the entire game in about 5 hours. It's also VERY easy. This is totally fine because it is meant to be leisurely but I did think there was more to the game.\n[*]The achievement list goes both ways. 19 of the 20 achievements are very easy and can be done just by beating the game (as well as another one that requires you to get a few extra items), while the final achievement which requires you to roll up every item is so time consuming and frustrating i'd go so far as to say I wouldn't recommend this game to completionists.\n[/list]\n[i]Negatives[/i]\n[list]\n[*] The controls suck, and I honestly think that is objective. The controls are straight from the PS2 version which is....fine, but it's almost impossible to play this with a keyboard. I played with a controller and I spent all 20 hours wrestling with the controls. They're kind of hard to explain but the biggest gripe is that there is no camera control. Instead of the left stick moving and the right stick being camera, both sticks do the same thing: rotate your character around the ball. In order to move you have to use BOTH sticks, and then have one stick to move your character around the ball while the other keeps the momentum. If you want to change directions you almost always have to come to a complete stop, move your character around the ball then start again. It sucks. I know this is the way the game is designed, I know there are \"purists\" that insist the controls are perfect but no, they aren't. You either will get used to them or you won't. The fact that is even a topic means objectively their bad. Good controls means everyone will eventually get used to them. Some might say \"well you're just bad and you suck!\". This game does not require you to be good. I was able to accomplish everything and get 100% while fighting with the controls so there is no point in debating whether or not I was good.\n[*] You can't really remap the controls at all because the control scheme is so brute forced you just have to play around it.\n[*] The game starts in windowed mode the first time.

Its soundtrack is made up of songs which take the katamari so seriously that it wraps around itself like some sort of ouroboros of absurdity, making everything twice as nonsensical. The king, your guide to this world, is the very definition of  flamboyance and quite rude to boot, perfectly introducing you to the task at hand. \n\nAmongst all the ridiculousness, Katamari Damacy also doesn't shy away from the sinister nature of the mission in front of you. You'll be rolling up random debris, people, and buildings alike in your effort to replace the cosmos. So anything that can flee will treat you like the kaiju you are and, as they often fail, the katamari quickly becomes a writhing mass of terrified limbs, rolling around to the beat of peppy pop or a chorus of children. There is a contradiction of tone inherent in this experience that 'mood whiplash' cannot even begin to describe.\n\nThe same could be said about the game itself. It runs perfectly well on a modern system and has a distinct enough visual design to avoid looking dated. However, dated is exactly how I would describe the settings menus. Reroll is more of a port than a full remaster and so, exactly like the PS2 original, all of its settings are tied into the hub planet which you won't see until after the tutorial. That means you'll likely be playing through that tutorial in glorious windowed 1280x720. You'll also need to exit a stage to save, check your collection, or adjust sound levels and you need to fly over to a whole other planet to choose a new stage, triggering a short cutscene every time.

As you collect the camera slowly and subtly pulls out, objects that were daunting before suddenly get absorbed by your Katamari and by the time the the timer is ticking its final moments you look around you and see how far you've come.

The music was overall, a real banger just like the first, the gameplay and controls are solid,  and It's still so terribly satisfying. All the satisfaction you may have gotten a little glimpse of playing those little dumb io games on mobile or online from getting bigger and consuming more is very well fed in this game. I am floored at the care to level design and just how fun it is to PICK UP THINGS WITH A SPHERE. There's always something going on at every corner of the map, and it always feels like there's that next thing to move on to. While I did say that some of the custom constellation challenges were annoying, all the other ones were fun and a nice change of pace for the normal game. I was actually really impressed and thrilled to do the last one (The north Star), and if you've read this far I'm just gonna leave that one a surprise to you ;3\nOverall, it's a bit more jenky, but I loved it for it's very innovative game play.", "timestamp_created": 1626112849, "timestamp_updated": 1626112849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95609561": {"recommendationid": "95609561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995962905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1669941167}, "language": "english", "review": "All time classic.

The charm, the humor, the music, and the frantic gameplay all come together in such a perfect package. I\u2019ve played this REROLL remaster on the Switch just recently and I also just played through it on Steam because I\u2019m a sick freak. One of the weird technical problems with this game is the Names listing in the Collection mode being weirdly laggy in both the Steam and Switch versions. However I can say that I believe Katamari Damacy is one of those games that everyone should experience at some point, be it in its original form, or the REROLL version, which is really little more than a rerelease. And that\u2019s just fine because the core game is so thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nI purchased my PS2 and a large bundle of games from a garage sale one warm summer afternoon at the height of puberty for $100 even. I had known a PS2 lot was being sold at this particular garage sale because I had scoured the neighborhood listings in the days prior. So when the seller saw that I was oddly prepared to make this exact transaction, she asked if I had seen one of the postings about the sale. For some reason I said that no, I had just happened upon this sale, suggesting that I often ventured out with only a one hundred dollar bill and an empty backpack on my person. I don\u2019t know why I said this. But that was fine, because there were plenty of nuttier people around town for whom biking was their main mode of transport, such as Crazy Bike Guy, who seemed to do nothing but ride around town everyday shirtless no matter the season or weather. One time I saw him in the middle of an intersection picking up and smashing his bike on the ground. But anyways, after I made the purchase I gleefully rode back home, trove stuffed in my bag,  \n\nAmong the titles were each incarnation of Grand Theft Auto available for the system, BLACK with its bullet casing-riddled boxart, and a host of indistinguishable Tom Clancy games. Katamari was not among the lot, BUT it didn\u2019t take long for me to pick it up from the local used game store, now deceased (rest in peace Jonny Cee\u2019s). I will say this was a time in my life when I was very unhappy with myself. It was great and still is great to have a game that really is just pure distilled joy. Today I\u2019m unhappy with myself for many of the same reasons, if not quite as angsty. But I digress.\n\nEven if things are just things, they still have their purpose. There is a time and place for everything. You wouldn\u2019t guess this at first glance playing Katamari Damacy, which relishes in the excess of materialism. On the surface the game world is littered with anachronistic objects, but closer up they all have some sense of order to them. They may be part of some little vignette somewhere within the organized chaos. The cosmos are in chaos too. When you restore the stars to the sky you may wonder if the end result is really better than what it was like before. But that\u2019s okay. Things often have an order and purpose to them even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it from a distance.\n\nA dual stick controller is necessary for this game. The controls are unique and may take a while to get used to. This really is the only downside to the game and can be a significant hurdle to overcome, but it\u2019s worth it and the controls do make sense. The gameplay is nonstop kinetic action as you roll around your little ball in the shape of those Covid-19 news renderings. The soundtrack is among the best in video game history. The writing is witty and sharp.

Eventually, I pulled the trigger when I found out that it was on sale for $10, and was delightfully surprised with the amazingly unique soundtrack, simple yet relaxing gameplay, and at times strange Japanese-esque humor. Falling in love with the concept, I made it a goal to 100% the game, and found myself losing several hours to it.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] The Actual Game, Now. [/h1]\n\nThe story starts off with you finding out that your irresponsible father, the King of All Cosmos, had gone on a drunken stupor and destroyed the entire starry night sky. He then tasks you with repairing most of it. Fun, simple and relatable. \n\nIs simple game, yes?\n\n[h2] Controls [/h2]\n\nThen it moves onto the tutorial, where you find out how the play the game. Wow, my first grip already is here, that was quick. This is where many people get confused, me initially included. This probably shouldn't have been forced before the ability to change the options. This isn't a console anymore, the game should've given options to change resolution, sound. etc. \n\nRegardless, I ask that you stick it out, as it's just one of those minor grips that many have with the port.\n\nThis is also the point of the review where I say that...\n\n[b][u][i]you should be playing this game with a controller.[/i][/u][/b]\n\nI played this game initially without it, and came to this conclusion on my own. Despite being a port for [b]PCs[/b], the keyboard implementation is strange and will always be strange, to say the least, since it benefits greatly from analog inputs. It's doable, just weird. Another reason why this PC port is a bit wonk.\n\nYou get a choice of Usual Controls versus Simple Controls. I would recommend Usual for those using controllers/gamepads, and Simple for keyboards. This is because keyboards can't use boosts effectively otherwise, and Usual offers more control for controllers. \n\nRegarding Usual Controls, you roll with both analog sticks in the same direction. It's strangely intuitive and also not, resulting in something that's easy to use but hard to master. I like!\n\n[h2] Gameplay Loop [/h2]\n\nAlright, stick with me now, it's a little complex, so I'll dumb it down.\n\nYou. Roll ball. Get small thing. Grow Big. Grab Big Thing. Simple, Satisfaction. BUT!!! Time limit. Hurry Up.\n\nAt the end of the level you get to see how much you picked up, and its fun seeing it turn into a star, thus fixing the sky. That's it, and that's all you really need. Hours of fun.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1] Minor Grips [/h1]\n\nThere are a few, but nothing major. They are as follows:\n[list]\n[*] Keyboard support is wack. So try to avoid it. I really mean that, since I don't want your first impressions to be hampered.\n[*] The weird forced intro tutorial. I've seen people just refund the game from that point, so that probably shouldn't really be there.\n[*] The Constellations don't give you anything for 100% them. They are the hardest challenges full stop, and are great fun. Atleast the Shooting Stars gave you a show. I still did it, anyhow.\n[*] Getting Shooting Stars and 100% Constellations don't add up to the 100% achievement. [spoiler]Also 100% credits don't do anything either.[/spoiler]\n[*] It really is very short, and I can see for some the game being a bit pricy. Please get it on sale for atleast 50% off, it goes on often.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclusions [/h1]\n\nVery fun and relaxing.

This game captures all the fun, zanny, charm as the original ps2 version did with some more polished graphics that make the entire world seem so much more weird and brighter then it could ever be, once again caught this one on sale for 9.89 and for that price tag it is an absolute steal!

You begin by rolling a minuscule ball around and rolling up items to make it bigger and bigger until you eventually reach colossal sizes over the course of 19 levels. Please ignore the screaming of the hapless citizens and animals you rolled up along the way, those are tears of joy!\n\nThis is a port of the original PS2 Katamari Damacy and my very first time playing one of these games, like many other reviewers I would be very excited for more ports of the other games in the series as I would love to experience them as well. \n\n[h1]VISUALS & AUDIO[/h1]\nJust from looking at the preview images for Katamari Damacy, you\u2019ll probably be able to tell whether the artstyle is for you or not. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to tell you how colourful, vibrant and charming this game is to look at. The visuals are simply timeless and it\u2019s blocky, cartoonish style is just as appealing now as when it was initially released back in 2004. \n\nThe soundtrack and sound design are as equally charming as it\u2019s visuals. With an eclectic and memorable track that could stand on its own and was clearly composed with a lot of love. The sound design adds to the whole experience as well, giving you useful audio cues and playing into the game\u2019s lighthearted charm.  \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe majority of levels task you with rolling up your katamari to a predetermined size, preferably exceeding that goal before a set time limit. In order to do this you will need to collect objects at or of a smaller size to your katamari, allowing it to gradually grow and collect larger objects. You will have to avoid colliding with animals and larger objects as crashing into something will cause items to fly off your katamari reducing its size. However there are seven constellation missions with unique challenges, but I won\u2019t spoil them here. Instead I strongly recommend you try them out for yourself. \n\nWhile it may sound quite simple, and in a way it is, it's an excellent puzzle game and overall a great experience. If I had to summarise this game in three words it would be quirky, infectious fun!\n\nThe controls are quite unique, emulating the feeling of pushing the katamari with both hands. On a controller this is done by pushing or pulling on both joysticks and on the keyboard you\u2019re given two sets of 4 buttons for each hand. You will not need a mouse for this game. \n\nAdmittedly the controls aren\u2019t very intuitive on the keyboard and I found that my fingers would start to hurt if I played for an extended period of time so I strongly recommend that you use a controller while playing. This was originally designed with the twin-joystick controller in mind and I can understand that they intended to replicate that feeling on the keyboard but as I\u2019ve already said it\u2019s a little clunky and not explained very well in the tutorial. Still I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s broken and it\u2019s entirely possible to play the game without a controller, so it\u2019s up to you. Either way, part of the fun is in practising and mastering the art of katamari.  \n\nAn additional minor warning that I forgot to give a friend before they bought the game was that it loads straight into a tutorial in windowed mode and is very loud at first. Both these things can be adjusted after the first level but you can also adjust your volume mixer if you don\u2019t want your eardrums blasted out in the opening of the game. It\u2019s just a small thing and won\u2019t affect the overall experience but I feel that it\u2019s worth mentioning. \n\nThere is also a local multiplayer mode that allows you to compete with friends. That said, I haven\u2019t played it for myself but I\u2019ve seen examples of it online and it looks like a lot of fun. If they ever port the other games to Steam I hope they\u2019ll add an online feature as I\u2019d love to play with my friends from across the world. \n\nI completed all of the levels in about five hours but 100% completionism builds from there and the levels have a lot of replay value. I\u2019ve heard there\u2019s an eternal mode where you have free reign over the levels with no time or size limits and I\u2019m looking forward to unlocking them and going wild. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nIf any of this appeals to you then it\u2019s time to get the ball rolling.

It's a lot of fun. It's amazing starting the level small but then getting large enough to collect entire skyscrapers in your Katamari. There's a fantastic catchy soundtrack to go along with it as well.\n\nI'd recommend it, but keep in mind that it's quite a casual experience, only taking me five hours to reach the ending. For those looking for more of a challenge, there's a bunch of extra stuff left to do afterwards. I'm not usually one for full completion though, so for me it was just the right length.\n\nI had never played a previous Katamari game before, so it took a bit of time to get used to the controls. I feel that they could have made them easier, but I got the impression that this was by design, probably making the game too easy otherwise.\n\nThe PC port is a bit half-arsed. You're locked in to 30 FPS for one. You're also forced to play the tutorial in windowed mode, only being able to reach the options menu until it\u2019s finished. To be fair though, due to it being a remaster, rather than a full remake, it may have been too difficult to fix the former issue.

play it as a kid, so i decided to finally buy it and let my inner child have some fun. Well what is there to say about it? It's Katamari. You roll over stuff and grow your Katamari bigger. Its hella fun! I recommend playing it with a controller since keyboard controls are awful. Lets stop talking about the core game and talk about the remaster itself. A big plus for me is it runs in 1440p AND supports borderless windowed mode. (Still don't get why so many modern games are missing that.). The only downside to it is, that you can only access the options menu after the tutorial and so you are forced to play the game in 720p windowed mode.

The controls are unique and require both analogue sticks to control. I won't get into it here but I do think if the controls were better more people would've played this game. As it stands it's OK for the first few levels but after a while your fingers will ache and you're analogue sticks will hate you as you scream and shout trying to control your massive katamari ball.

So should you get it?  Despite the flaws, it's a great way to experience the game, but I would recomend you just get the original PS2 version if you have a PS2.\n\nWhat can I say about this game that hasn't been said.  Katamari Damacy is one of those games that really brightens the world.  It's artstyle, music, and gameplay make it one of the best experiences out there.  It was cool to see it remade for a bunch of platforms.\n\nKatamari Damacy's gameplay is the most charming and fun thing about it.  It's easy to understand, and somewhat difficult to master.  Properly controling your Katamari requires not pushing the analog sticks all the way in a direction, which requires a bit of forethought.  But the game itself is incredibly well made, with barely any gameplay issues in this or the original PS2 version.  It's quirky and absurd, but charmingly heartwarming.  Some of the levels can be frusturating, but the absurdity makes up for this.\n\nGraphics are relatively unchanged, despite raising the texture quality and putting the game in HD.  The models for objects are simplistic and blocky as they were in the PS2 version to save memory, but it's charming style has stuck with it throughout the entire series.  The worlds are humorous.  You often roll up to strange situations with no context, and the devs made built objects out of existing objects.  The context is also absurd, and the cutscenes are hilarious.  It's a game that defined the indie titles to come.\n\nThe music is not cannot even be described as legendary.  That's all there is to it.  It's beyond legend.  Every song in the Katamari series is one of the best things to cherish your eardrums.  The soundtrack consists of a large variety of J-pop, jazz, and more experimental melodies.  Most of the songs' lyrics are in Japanese, which to me makes the game feel more authentic rather than translating everything for the rest of the world (coming from a guy whose only anime exposure is Ghibli dubs, this says a lot).  The varied musical styles and rhythms grab the heart and will not ever let go, \"like a curse,\" as the composer put it.\n\nBut the remake... has a lot of work to do.  This game has some questionable design choices.  For instance, you can't put the game in fullscreen during the tutorial, or ajust graphics settings during gameplay.  You have to be in the hub.  The game also has no autosave, requiring you to save in the hub.  The game doesn't even give you the option to save when you close it!  You have to go to the data section of the hub.  Keyboard controls are pretty bad.  I'm okay with this, since the game is designed for a controller, but it would've been nice if they put more thought into non-controller methods.  Finally, they took out endless mode, which was the best part of the game, letting you get your Katamari as big as you wanted with no time constraints.  That irks me in a pretty bad way, because I first experienced Katamari Damacy through endless mode on my cousin's PS2.\n\nOverall, Katamari Damacy REROLL is a decent recreation of a masterpiece.  So should you get it?

They seemed to have doubled the time limits for them, and while I love they're making the game more accessible maybe they should've had a difficulty setting. Speaking of the settings, they haven't changed. I was hoping I could edit video and maybe change the screen from the window, but there are only the controller settings and the basic audio settings from the original. Also there are still some game changing bugs such as getting stuck in between two objects until your katamari spits out everything to get out, and I was hoping they'd fix those. Another thing I'd like to note is you still cannot play the cousins in story mode, which is accurate to the original, but we have the technology to play the others now. Lastly, and this is just my opinion, I wasn't a huge fan of the retextured game. I'm glad they're trying new artstyles, but I don't think this one would be the one I want for the new games if they're even making new games.

This is the game I would have and wished I grew up with.\nThe objective of KDR of literally rolling up everything in sight and turn them into stars is unique yet addictive, chaotic yet charming, mischievous yet innocent. The controls were a first time for me but I got into them really fast.\n I couldn't get enough of the game's unique vibrant colorful visual designs from cute and funny character designs to a fun lively menu segment. \nThere's a time limit for every level but the time amount granted is really generous which I like since not only you have to beat the level's main objective with plenty of time to spare but also go back to levels for exploration, beating your score and rare collectables.\nThe game's OST are new to me, there are crazy mixes of Japanese pop and I love them, I easily jam to them in my car. The songs vary instrumentally from each other but sure are toe tapping. Some are bouncy and energetic listening to them during a level will make you hysterical as you roll around and around. Some are also slow sweet gentle tunes like the menu screen where you just want to listen to the strumming guitar and hums as you watch the prince walk around in his home planet.\nI wish I could keep singing praises for KDR but there are a couple of things that bother me and made playing for me a struggle, especially fir completion.\nOne was the controls. Now I love moving around with two analogue sticks it's unnatural any other way, but the controls are really bad for me when I had to dash, climb or quickly move the camera. I could do them fine but losing time and items was almost inevitable for me. I'm not sure if Steam version is at fault, the game was like this since the PS2 or it could just be me.\nThe other thing is that you lose your items way too easily. When I hit a wall or was pushed is not bad since it's my fault but when I got stuck, had to climb for items or lots of things pushed me at once I ended up losing 10cm to 20cm worth of items. Whenever I collected anything rare I had to be extra careful and watch my katamari to make sure I don't drop it until I was home free \nI didn't mind these faults during my initial play, but they were an annoyance during my completion run, turning the fun collection hunt into a struggle and a chore.\nOverall, I really adore and had a good time with KDR. This is the game I would have easily loved, cherished and played during its PS2 era. It is different but sweet and inviting for anybody, there's no other game like it with lots of things to offer, even if you'renot Japanese. I really hope more Katamari games will be coming to Steam.

A worthwhile experience IMO for anyone who views video games as a form of play and fun and desires to add novel/unique/fresh experiences from their gaming.   I knew of the Katamari games from PS2 era of games (2004), but I never got a chance to play any of them during those times.  What a joy it was to get into it just now, although I regret that I have been so late to the party.  I also really enjoyed the Japanese pop music that accompanied the gameplay which I assume represents the 2004 era. \n\nAs the game was originally released in 2004 there are some nostalgic flashbacks such as cassette/CD players, oldschool CRT TVs and other household goods of the times as you run them over with the Katamari to make your Katamari bigger to then roll over more stuff to get bigger and bigger. This game also definitely feels like it\u2019s a game from Japan and I think that is part of why it was so charming for me. \n\nI\u2019m real glad the game has found its way to me on PC. It\u2019s something I missed out on that I wanted to play but didn\u2019t have the means back in the day and have since completely forgotten about.  Performance wise it never crashed on me and it ran well with practically zero load times.  The dual thumbstick controls to navigate the Katamari took some getting used to, but after about 4-5 missions I go the hang of it.  A tiny annoyance is that on first run, you are forced to complete a short tutorial of a few minutes before you can access settings to change the game\u2019s resolution and make it full screen.\n\nPS: My biggest Katamari was 828 meters!  :D", "timestamp_created": 1620598730, "timestamp_updated": 1620598730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91722265": {"recommendationid": "91722265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198909934997", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1629032724}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game!

Whoops! How will you collect those things you ask? With a Katamari of course! As Fred Durst once famously said: \"Keep rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'\" \n\nAs you roll up more and more things, your Katamari will increase in size, which will allow access to more of the stage, and the opportunity to roll up even more things around you. This creates a very engaging puzzle like loop of navigating the stage to avoid the larger hazards, all the while keeping in mind the location of those hazards for when you're big enough to get your revenge and turn them into a star. My biggest gripe with Katamari Damacy is collision can sometimes be particularly devastating, and send many of your hardrolled objects all over the place! Couple this with getting STUCK in certain places, and you're liable to see many, many, MANY(!!!) items go flying off your Katamari while you helplessly attempt to get unstuck and cease the losses. I encountered this many times on my playthrough, and while it is frustrating, the levels are forgiving and usually quite quick.

But you can't. You cannot get to any settings or options without passing the area where the wrong keys are highlighting different moves, not even to resize the forced windowed-mode. Checking through discussions was not very helpful, as the overwhelming advice is \"You need a controller!\" The Store page doesn't mention that, the game doesn't mention that, and the nature of being a PC port should remove that requirement in the first place.

And I don't mean minor improvements here; we're talking Assassin's Creed 1< 2, Red Faction 1 < Guerrilla levels of escalation. More missions with more mission types, larger worlds, more maps, better load fidelity, far better balanced time limits, interesting side characters, switchable characters, collectables, everything. \n\nThose two games are what I grew up with, and playing them back again today, I can assure you there are no nostalgia goggles involved with their shining quality. I gave up completing this halfway through, because my only two thoughts while playing it were \"Damn, this is where it all began\" and \"This game has utterly nothing to offer that I haven't seen done better\". A more sensible thing to do would be break the console exclusivity with the two consoles and bring remastered versions of [i]those[/i] to PC. \n\nThat might sound harsh on the original here, and don't get me wrong, it was a groundbreaking idea nicely executed. But it's obsolete, and unfortunately no amount of fresh paint can fix that. You'd be better off buying a copy of We Love Katamari and an entire PS2 to play it on (or, you know, an emulator). That said, I want desperately for Katamari Damacy's legendary sequels to be shown to the PC crowd, so maybe buying this will incentivise that? \n\nI don't know, do what you want, but don't say I didn't warn you as you sit there in this game's empty levels, having hoovered up everything with five minutes to spare contemplating existence.", "timestamp_created": 1620143414, "timestamp_updated": 1620143414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425384879112243652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91397396": {"recommendationid": "91397396", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966824208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1700539985}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh!

Despite how antithetical Katamari Damacy may feel to our collective perceived notions of videogame conventions and norms, Keita Takahashi still managed to tap into that same escapism primeval soup that characterizes so many of our favorite games, abstracting its violence to a family friendly degree while maintaining its appeal and utilizing it to create one of the most cathartic power fantasies in the medium.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly brilliant about KD is how much of its chaotic and free form nature ends up dictating its narrow and tightly focused design by default without resorting to any hand holding or pushing the player in any particular direction beyond the main premise of rolling a ball over stuff to make it bigger. Its progression naturally unfolds before you, as you increase the scope of your katamari and more things become available to be consumed by it, immediately a consequence of every choice the player makes in their unconscious toddler rampage. And whatever frustration that might arise from its more clunky mechanics and physics is quickly subverted when you finally get big enough to roll over that annoying bear that would always stop you on your tracks.\n\nFunny then how that stroke of incredible originality and genius seems to have sparked by mere accident from just approaching video games from an outside perspective and being dissatisfied with the industry\u2019s modus operandi and never taking itself too seriously. The final stage that beautifully represents the apex of the experience unveils the artifice of the game in its final moments, showing that you have been playing in a playground all along, and that recess time is over, the self indulgence was fun. Pardon my boomer-ism, but it\u2019s a major bummer that we probably will never return to an age like the PS2 gen where people like Keita Takahashi get the opportunity to take the wheel and produce a unique title like this one that sits nicely next to its big budget pals.\n\nIt might come across as corny or histrionic of me, but the feeling I get while playing Katamari Damacy is one of love. This is a labor of love, a life affirming appreciation of all things that encompasses our planet, and while it does have something to say about consumerism or capitalism, it does it in a humorous and non condemning way in the same vein as Jacques Tati would with his films and without ever sacrificing the joy of rolling up everything on sight as people scream and a cheerful jazzy song plays in the background. Katamari Damacy is above analysis or interpretation, it is an achievement of ludology, up there with the likes of Tetris, and you don\u2019t have to question where the art is because you can see it right in front of you, and you can play it.

For casual gamers, the progression of going from tiny to massive is rewarding on its own. With the unlockable endless modes, moseying around and collecting things at your leisure is one of the best feelings. I have personally done the final Endless mode several times as a way of relaxing. The way that you can come back to the area you started in with a fresh perspective on what is now obtainable given a new size is always a design mechanic that I think is incredibly appealing. No matter where you start growing, or what level you're on, it always feels like there's a new goal to roll towards.\n\nI have also gone ahead and finished all of the achievements in the game. Most of them are pretty simple, only requiring you to complete the standard levels, which you'd do to finish the game normally anyways. Two achievements are notably harder though. The collect all presents achievement is challenging since they are usually hidden, and the King of Katamari achievement literally asks you to grab at least one of the 1400+ items in the game at least once (120 or so of which are fairly to extremely difficult). If you're looking to 100% the game, I'd get very used to the sight of cows and bears, since you'll probably be resetting those levels about 60 times wondering how you touched that tiny object that resembles a bear or cow. You will definitely end up redoing all of the levels several times over to get all achievements. If you're an achievement hunter, this will definitely be a tedious undertaking, but will definitely feel rewarding after you've successfully gathered everything. I'll definitely still be rolling around, even after 100%ing the game though, couldn't recommend harder.", "timestamp_created": 1618902874, "timestamp_updated": 1618902874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711098253726959229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90608453": {"recommendationid": "90608453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016343991", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1678443352}, "language": "english", "review": "ball:)", "timestamp_created": 1618887686, "timestamp_updated": 1618887686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773764669895172119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90602388": {"recommendationid": "90602388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024840468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1683489364}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish they remade/released all of these on Steam.
