That sounds like I'm just praising it, but it really was kinda surprising how short the game was. Completed the full game, and the DLC (Which was free) in under 6 hours.

A surprisingly fun puzzler, wrapped in an atmospheric package. \n\n[h1]What I Liked[/h1]\nThe atmosphere in this game is really great. You feel like a menacing \"THING\" like entity that can devour anything in it's patch. It feels really great to naturally gain new abilities over the course of the story that also unlock new areas. this is nothing new for metroid-vania style games, but it was well done here. \n\nMovement and combat are physics based, and rather fun to experiment with. Bursting through a vent and hurling enemies at each other never got old. \n\n[h1]What Could Be Improved[/h1]\nThe game is fairly short, which some may see as a negative. However, with all the 80+ hour games in recent memory, I found it rather refreshing to have a self contained playable experience that is short but doesn't compromise on content. \n\nI did find a few instances where I needed to reload in order to \"unstick\" myself from certain puzzles. I'm not sure if this was required, or if I just could not think of any other solutions. Thankfully these instances were really rare. \n\n[h1]Final Thoughts & Rating[/h1]\nA standout entry in the slew of recent metroid-vania style games. This one offers a fresh take on the player character, and the puzzles felt very satisfying.

Let's say there is Obstacle-A that needs you to be your level 1 form. If you happen to be level 2 (basically eat 2-3 people), you cannot solve that obstacle. Later, you get a long range tentacle for possessing people. That thing can go through the same gaps as the level 1-ability, yet sadly the game says \"no\". So what you have to do is to go to some red water and \"drop biomass\" to be level 1 again, solely for the purpose of turning a lever.\n\nThis, creates a lot of dead air. Really a lot.

decent game with an innovative concept. Yes, the price is surely too high for what you get in return, wait for a heavy discount. Although I rarely enjoy forced stealth, this one was pleasantly executed. Even threw some puzzles at you in between the slaughter. It does get a tad bit repetitive despite your arsenal growing throughout the game. Maybe a bit more variety in playstyle could have improved that. But in the game's defense, it's pretty short anyway. And yes, that's sort of what makes the price unjustified. I think my biggest problem is the navigation, however. It's easy to get lost or wander an unintended path. This is the sort of game that would have greatly benefited from a map. Or at the very least some form of fast travel between the areas so I'm not stuck searching for a needle in a haystack. I understand that this is a creative choice to convey that you're a fish out of water and have nobody holding your hand, but some kind of upgrade to assist the navigation sure would have been nice. The only feature that partially aids you in finding points of interest is rather obsolete as you would have to pass those areas anyway to proceed.

It's awful, i had to look for a steam guide to check the layouts of those 10 locations because there is a main \"hub\" from which you can get to every other location, but it is impossible to guess whether the location is main hub or not, you just have to spend some time rolling around trying to get to the next chapter for you to lose patience and go look for player-created map layouts.\nThe game felt super claustrophobic, but not because of narrow tunnels, but due to how close to the action the camera was positioned. This is probably because some locations are tiny and it wouldn't make sense to pull the camera out, but still i'd love to be able to zoom out at least a little bit. Sometimes it felt like i was watching close-up documentary about alien lifeforms.\n\nOn the other hand, Carrion is pretty challenging but enemy encounters feel fair.\nThe puzzles were interesting and made me use my brain, so that's a plus.\nGetting new abilities is interesting and i was always looking forward to what i was going to get next.\nIt took me almost 5 hours to 100% the game, which is decent, since the game didn't get too stale in such a short amount of time.\nAlso, the achievements made sense and there was no bs.

Though there's entertaining sounds and some vaguely challenging segments, it never becomes really amusing to play. You're at your weakest at the start and it's insanely disappointing, but by the end of the game it just feels tedious.

I thought I might have trouble with the puzzles but it was all very intuitive to me. I'm sure thousands have said this already but a sequel would be incredible, it doesn't even have to be the same style of game.\n\nOh, and my computer is bottom of the barrel dirt garbage and the game had zero performance issues even when there was a lot happening on screen, so don't worry too much about having performance issues.\n\n[h2] Gameplay [/h2]\nYou [i] can [/i] get lost but following your gut instinct will usually lead you where you need to go.  I also really liked how you can approach problems and areas creatively, you can go in and rampage through a room, or you can be insidious and terrorize the helpless workers until you get bored. Maybe there's something wrong with me but cornering somebody and letting them live after I just ripped their co-workers head off just fills me with glee, like yeah lil guy go home and tell your family what you witnessed, tell the world the terror you've experienced.\n\n[h2] A Very Small Critique [/h2]\n\nHonestly the only part of the game I had issues with was [spoiler] the first human portion of the game where you're supposed to plant C4 on the wall but it isn't very clearly communicated at all that you're supposed to do that [/spoiler] which consumed a good 10 minutes of my time. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nI would love to see this turn into a large franchise, it really ticks all the boxes for me.

Gameplay was super fun and easy to follow! Some puzzles required some thinking but you feel so satisfied when you connect the dots together! I usually struggle with games being unclear, but Carrion does a great job at giving you enough information for you to figure everything out and I love that! The level designs were PHENOMENAL, with how everything could lead back to the same place but with new powers to unlock different sections of the game. I know this game is supposed to be scary, but look at the creatura!!! His tentacles make a cute lil' patter noise and the tippy taps are soothing to hear (despite the screams in the bg smh).

It's a game that takes the traditional concept of being the hero and flips it on its head, allowing you to become the lurking monstrosity.\n\nCarrion casts you in the role of an amorphous, tentacled creature that escapes from a containment facility. Your primary objective is to wreak havoc, consume everything in your path, and navigate the maze-like environment to unveil the secrets behind your existence.\n\nOne of Carrion's most intriguing aspects is its gameplay. As the nameless monster, you are a force of destruction and chaos. Your abilities include slashing through obstacles, latching onto humans to devour them, and regenerating health by consuming biomass. This unique approach to gameplay provides a refreshing change of perspective from traditional horror games, where you are usually the prey.\n\nThe level design in Carrion is praiseworthy. Each area offers a series of puzzles, challenges, and enemies, making it feel like a living and breathing ecosystem that you, as the monster, must adapt to. Progressing through the game involves using your evolving abilities strategically to bypass obstacles and defeat adversaries.\n\nCarrion's atmospheric design also deserves recognition. The pixel-art visuals are both gruesome and beautiful, capturing the grotesque nature of the creature and the dark, eerie environment in which it thrives. The sound design further amplifies the tension, with eerie noises and cries of terrified humans, adding to the sense of horror and immersion.\n\nHowever, the game's brevity is one of its main downsides. At 3.5 hours of gameplay, Carrion is a relatively short experience, leaving you craving more of its unique and terrifying world. The narrative is minimal, with the story mostly conveyed through environmental storytelling and notes found throughout the game, which can leave you wanting more depth in the plot.\n\nCarrion is undoubtedly an unconventional and memorable horror experience that flips the genre's conventions on their head. As the player, you get to embrace the role of the predator and become the embodiment of terror. Although it's a bit on the shorter side, the game's gripping gameplay, atmospheric design, and inventive premise make it a must-play for horror enthusiasts looking for something refreshingly different.", "timestamp_created": 1697717625, "timestamp_updated": 1697717625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148465087": {"recommendationid": "148465087", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971085298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1699232228}, "language": "english", "review": "YOU get to be the squiggly alien horror monster.", "timestamp_created": 1697678799, "timestamp_updated": 1697678799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513888895511627197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148457136": {"recommendationid": "148457136", "author": {"steamid": "76561199193116171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "playtime_at_review": 2553, "last_played": 1699578680}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing.

I wasn't sure if I would like a reverse horror game, but I may've had too much fun playing it... +1 perfect games!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[u][b]Detailed Version[/b][/u]\nI've enjoyed some 2D games here and there, but I've never gone out of my way to seek one. After playing this though, I might be swayed... I don't know if it was the reverse horror sub-genre or the satisfaction of swinging people around so fluidly, but it was kind of a vibe!\n\n[i][u]Story[/u][/i]\nIt seems Carrion was more of an introduction to the \"amorphous creature of unknown origin\" as any remnants of a story reside in the various flashbacks you encounter along your path of carnage. In the end, not much information is given on the creature other than it being hungry. I haven't looked much into it, but it seems there're hints of a sequel. I hope so! I could see writers taking what was given to us already and spinning quite a story out of it for the next game.\n\n[i][u]Movement[/u][/i]\nI found the controls pretty clunky. It defaults to controller, but it made more sense to play on MKB for me. Even near the end, I found myself getting a bit jumbled here and there. I really wish they would've allowed for WASD movement instead of just the mouse. On a similar note... No map. Period. I get why though! I say more later, but it would make the game far too easy.\n\n[i][u]Combat[/u][/i]\nThis is where the game really shines. Grabbing and munching down on people, grabbing and throwing people, throwing objects at people... There're just so many ways to get the job done. That doesn't even take into consideration the best part of this game...\n\n[i][u]Abilities[/u][/i]\nThere are quite a few. I won't say how much, but I'll say that the creature ends up with 3 varying sizes. These sizes grant the option of using certain abilities, if unlocked. This added a bit of a puzzle aspect to the game, which was unexpected, but I absolutely loved it.\n\u00a0\n[u][b]For 100%ers[/b][/u]\nThe biggest obstacle is the map. Or rather... the lack thereof. I urge you to try your best before using this, but you do you! Below is a link to the maps from the official wiki. I ended up using them after failing to navigate the world for probably an hour...\n\n[b][url=https://carrion.fandom.com/wiki/Special:AllMaps]Interactive Maps[/url][/b] on Carrion Wiki\n\n[u]Please thumbs up.

Absolutely, but that isn't all that the game is about. Beyond the nonexistent map, which is just absurd and offensive, the controls can be janky as well, especially when you unlock the bigger forms of your monster.

I beat the game in 4 hours, including all the secret finds. I did get this on sale, and for 5 bucks, that's reasonable; however, for a full 20, I can't recommend the game. \n\nDone well:\n-The aesthetic of the game is excellent. The monster looks and sounds creepy and the game world complements it well. The screams of terrified scientists are a fun incentive to tear them apart mercilessly.\n-The game blends puzzles and combat very well; MOST of your combat tools can be used for puzzles, all the puzzle tools can be used for combat.\n-The puzzles themselves are well designed; none of them were particularly difficult, but some did require some thinking. They are mostly obvious through trial and error, with a couple big exceptions due to a point of game design.\nDone poorly:\n-Nitpick, but the energy-using upgrade for the mid-stage form I used exactly once when I got it and never again, since it's only applicable in combat and you have much better options.\n-The puzzles that involve the explosive clamp spears are very annoying, since the clamp-spears instakill you, instead of simply blocking your progress like a door or lever. That's the puzzle disappointment I mentioned earlier.\n-The control scheme relying so heavily on the left mouse button meant I had to play the game in short stints, since holding it down for too long became painful. \n-The lack of a map or a central hub area made backtracking for the secrets tedious. There is a central area from which you can see the status of every level, but you actually have to find the level gates to get back there, and the monitors don't indicate their positions at all.\n-The echolocation ability that lets you find nests is worthless, since active nests (where you've been) and inactive nests (where you haven't) appear the same, and there's an upgrade that further clutters the ability with a response from edible corpses.\n-The ending was rather abrupt and disappointing. INSIDE this is not.\n\nIn short: wait for a sale, enjoy it for what it is.

soldier's heads in the ceiling... But I love scaring them to death, in a quite literal way. You really feel that everyone is terrified when you suddenly show up.\nAnd that's what I like too : you can choose to sneak up discreetly or try to rush them brutally, and both methods work great! There are also a few puzzles that are not very hard but use the various mechanics in great ways.\n\nThe game is very linear, I didn't find it to be a problem but you may find it annoying (maybe). However, after completing the last area, you can feel kinda lost because of something I both like and dislike : there's no map. As an Evil Creature you can't access a map, it's immersive, but adding a wall map per area could have made exploration better... Or not. It's a small world after all so it's not that hard to navigate (however I admit that I used some community-made maps for 100%).\n\nGreat feelings, great game, 6 hours to finish (short :/) and a bit more for 100% and/or completing the included \"Christmas DLC\" map.", "timestamp_created": 1694127264, "timestamp_updated": 1695158014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145859174": {"recommendationid": "145859174", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247631899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1694321161}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1694101938, "timestamp_updated": 1694101938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145816682": {"recommendationid": "145816682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029229878", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1694037907}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a Monster, I'm a MonStar!", "timestamp_created": 1694038042, "timestamp_updated": 1694038042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145784460": {"recommendationid": "145784460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008929552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 436, "last_played": 1694005293}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I don't like it when games overstay their welcome, I feel this may be a bit on the short side.

This is thanks to impressive level design that creates a sense of complexity while maintaining an unbroken flow from one area to another, with no interruption, and no slowdown, keeping you fully immersed at all times.\n\nThis seamless 'flow' contributes to the game's shorter duration (5-6 hours) and relatively low difficulty. Yet this aligns perfectly with core theme of the game. You assume the role of a unstoppable biological contagion, reminiscent of sci-fi horrors like Alien, The Thing, and Life. The game's length and difficulty mirror the nature of your character as an unstoppable force, delivering a reverse horror experience that masterfully nails homage to its inspirations.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the graphics are simple yet solid with \"meaty\" feeling that complements the game's overall vibe. Music and sound design are good, further contributing to the immersion, and I'm almost sure I could occasionally hear familiar cues from Alien. Controls might require bit of getting used to, but ultimately don't hinder the experience.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Carrion.

an indie gem that thrusts players into a spine-chilling, asymmetrical horror experience unlike any other. Developed by Phobia Game Studio and published by Devolver Digital, this game takes a bold leap into the unconventional, allowing players to become the nightmare itself. As you delve into the dark depths of this reverse-horror title, prepare to be both thrilled and horrified in a way that only \"Carrion\" can deliver.\n\nSet in a sprawling underground research facility, \"Carrion\" places you in the role of an amorphous, tentacled monstrosity with a single aim: to escape and unleash chaos upon the unsuspecting world above. What immediately sets \"Carrion\" apart is its reverse-perspective, turning the traditional survival horror genre on its head. No longer are you the prey, cowering in fear of lurking terrors \u2013 you are the predator, a relentless force of nature that grows stronger with each passing moment.\n\nThe pixel art aesthetics of \"Carrion\" deserve a special mention. Despite its retro-inspired visuals, the game manages to create an incredibly eerie atmosphere, dripping with tension. The labyrinthine corridors, dimly lit rooms, and gory carnage are all brought to life with an impressive attention to detail. The animation of the titular creature is a highlight, as it squelches, stretches, and unfurls its gruesome form to navigate the environment in a truly unsettling manner.\n\nThe game-play in \"Carrion\" revolves around mastering your unique abilities. From the start, you'll feel both powerful and vulnerable as you gradually gain access to an arsenal of gruesome tools. Your amorphous being can slink through vents, squeeze through tight spaces, and lash out with deadly tentacles to snare and devour your human prey. The controls, while a bit unconventional at first, quickly become second nature, allowing you to execute gruesome kills with precision.\n\nThe level design is a mixed bag, offering a combination of intricate puzzles and intense chase sequences. While some areas encourage methodical exploration, others push you to use your agility and cunning to evade armed guards and security systems. The puzzles are generally well-designed, requiring a balance of strategic thinking and experimentation. However, there are instances where trial and error can feel frustrating, disrupting the overall flow.\n\nOne of \"Carrion's\" minor flaws lies in its lack of a compelling narrative. While the premise is intriguing and the game's minimalist storytelling approach aligns with its retro sensibilities, a stronger narrative thread could have heightened player investment and motivation. That being said, the absence of an intricate plot doesn't detract significantly from the overall experience, as the game-play itself remains the central attraction.\n\n\"Carrion\" also boasts a hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack that complements the game-play perfectly. The eerie ambient sounds and subtle musical cues enhance the tension and contribute to the overall feeling of dread as you navigate the claustrophobic corridors.\n\nAll in all, \"Carrion\" is an electrifying journey into the unconventional, offering a fresh twist on the horror genre that fans of unique gaming experiences will relish. It's a testament to the creative potential of indie game development, delivering an immersive world, captivating mechanics, and a truly unforgettable role reversal. While a stronger narrative and some refining of level design could have elevated it even further, \"Carrion\" undeniably stands as a remarkable and nightmarishly fun title that dares to be different. If you're ready to unleash your inner monster and revel in a macabre adventure, \"Carrion\" should absolutely be on your radar.", "timestamp_created": 1693111168, "timestamp_updated": 1693111168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145104160": {"recommendationid": "145104160", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467000658", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1693109000}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT", "timestamp_created": 1693109128, "timestamp_updated": 1693109128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145097768": {"recommendationid": "145097768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252361900", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1697509628}, "language": "english", "review": "the thumbnail icon looks like a vagina", "timestamp_created": 1693100259, "timestamp_updated": 1693100259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145095467": {"recommendationid": "145095467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267276072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1693780230}, "language": "english", "review": "Starting with cons no map or check list of what areas you have fully breached.

In this game, players find themselves in the role of an amorphous and malevolent creature, an abomination escaping from a research facility. The game's innovative premise and mechanics create a truly captivating experience, but at times, it can be hindered by elements that introduce moments of tedium.\n\nOne of the most exhilarating aspects of Carrion is the ability to control a creature that embodies pure chaos and destruction. The creature's lack of defined shape and the way it elegantly traverses the environment, using its tentacles to cling to surfaces, deliver a sense of empowerment that few games can match. This power fantasy is the foundation of Carrion's enjoyment, as players revel in unleashing havoc upon the terrified humans who cross their path. The unorthodox approach to the horror genre makes Carrion stand out, offering a fresh perspective from the typical protagonist-versus-monster formula.\n\nThe game's puzzles and challenges contribute to its excitement, as players must solve intricate tasks using the creature's unique abilities. Employing stealth, strategy, and brute force, players must outsmart armed human adversaries and navigate through tight spaces, all while devouring hapless victims to grow stronger. These engaging gameplay elements make for a rollercoaster ride of adrenaline-pumping moments, culminating in a satisfyingly satisfying experience.\n\nHowever, amidst the excitement, Carrion does suffer from occasional bouts of tedium. Some sections of the game can feel repetitive, with players having to backtrack through areas they've previously explored. This repetition can dampen the otherwise intense pace and sense of progression. Additionally, the lack of a clear map or objective markers can lead to moments of aimless wandering, which might frustrate players seeking a more streamlined experience.\n\nFurthermore, the game's narrative is deliberately minimalistic, leaving players to piece together the story through environmental clues and scattered notes. While this storytelling approach can be intriguing for some, it may leave others wanting a more well-defined plot. The absence of a deeper emotional connection to the creature's motivations and background might hinder some players' investment in the game's overall narrative.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Carrion remains an exceptional and memorable experience, especially for players seeking something different from the usual horror-themed games. Its gripping gameplay, innovative concept, and darkly atmospheric setting provide a refreshing take on the genre. The moments of tedium can be overlooked in light of the overall thrill and enjoyment the game offers.\n\nIn conclusion, Carrion is a game that takes risks and successfully ventures beyond conventional gaming norms. It is fun, exciting, and leaves a lasting impression on players with its unique premise and gameplay. However, the occasional tedium and lack of a robust narrative might not appeal to everyone. Nonetheless, Carrion stands as a testament to the potential for ingenuity within the horror genre and should be experienced by anyone seeking a fresh and visceral gaming experience.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1691619528, "timestamp_updated": 1691966927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668167650699615479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143738564": {"recommendationid": "143738564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094410104", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1691528312}, "language": "english", "review": "Rawww Grrr Grrr Rawwwww...\n\n11/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1691611991, "timestamp_updated": 1691611991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518846988677978516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143709790": {"recommendationid": "143709790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190196506", "num_games_owned": 1730, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 692, "last_played": 1691577948}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Brutal.

Seems sloppy to me.\n- No final  kind of boss fight, they just chuck more populated puzzle rooms at you.\n- The puzzles  can get kind of repetitive as they crutch on the same mechanics most of the time.\n- All game achievements are hidden.\n\nAll in all, this  is a game that could have  been  MUCH better if they had a better take on Metroidvania style games. There are  multiple realities in  the game that don't  really make sense-\n\n1) You often  run into barriers that you cannot move through, even though you're a conglomeration of writhing worms and tendrils. This makes sense in some senses- like a fully impermeable plane like strong plexiglass or something like that. But there's a specific block that  is pretty much just  4 stone pillars, that serve as a bodyblock,  while allowing you to shoot webs through. HOWEVER,  if you are submerged in water, you can dissemble into a colony  of worms and slither past them... what? Why? Who thought this was a good or reasonable idea? If this thing can squeeze into vents, it can slide around some pillars.\n\n2) You have exclusive abilities tied to your size, which is tied to your health. While this makes sense in some cases, it doesn't  make sense in most others- you can shoot  web in your smallest form, but somehow lose that  capability by getting bigger? What? One of the upgrades you get isn't even  useful, which feels underwhelming and frustrating. (Spike armor) This game would have had much more interesting possibilities if you were able to use all abilities at all sizes, but made physical size correlate  to another aspect of tile puzzles, like some vents  or pipes require smallest form, and some gaps requiring maximum size  to  cross. It feels like a lack of thought.\n\n3) Non-required game upgrades are underwhelming- just health and energy buffs, or additional  tendrils (doesn't really change anything, compared to something like increasing tendril range, which would be VERY beneficial)\n\n4) The ending  is quite lackluster in  my  opinion. It could have been  fixed if they let you actually rampage or something... but with the lack of a final bossfight, it feels...  empty.\n\n\nTLDR: Enjoy the game on sale, or perhaps delve into modding it into what you hope it could be.

You have a great feeling of power and satisfaction whenever you make progress.  The game has a nice pixel style kind of like rain world or old retro games, going well with the side-scroller gameplay.\n\nCons: THE MAP IS A FREAKING MAZE SOMETIMES.  The game doesn't always do the best job telling you where to go and how to do it.  I've spent an hour alone just looping back and forth trying to find where to go.\nThe game could REALLY use some sort of mini map system.  This might sound like a skill issue on my part, but if you play it you'll know what I mean after 30 min,.\n\nOver all this game is an acquired taste.  If you like games where you are the antagonist and/or a monster, and if you're ok with navigating a map that would put the randomness of The Backrooms to shame then try this game out!  If the aforementioned is not your cup of tea, then don't bother.\n\nOver all 7.5/10 \\\\ I'd recommend .", "timestamp_created": 1691078444, "timestamp_updated": 1691696910, "voted_up": true,

This game is actually quite easy. If you understand the movement most combat sections are quite simple, and in some cases even avoidable. The hardest enemy is a tiny drone and flamethrower soldier, that's it. Everything else is quite easy to navigate around so long you play with a little bit of skill. \n\nThere are some aspects similar to metroidvanias, but excluding a few extra power-ups, the game is quite linear.

The other two just require some hunting and backtracking. \n\nI really wish there was more! It is quite short, but for the amount of game that's there it's well worth it in my opinion. \n\nMy only real complaint for this game is that the main \"trail\" is entirely too easy.

Atmospheric and environmental effects sound natural and effective, while the subtle flow of the soundtrack tells its own story.[/td]\n\n\t[td]\ud83d\udfe5 There is little to no narrated plot. Everything within the game merely occurs with remarkably little explanation.\n\n\ud83d\udfe5 Extremely short gameplay time.[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe red, amorphic organism you control in the game remains unnamed for the entirety of [b]Carrion[/b]. You take control of it as the creature awakens from hibernation within a Seattle-based research company called Relith Science. After breaking free from its containment unit, the monster has to fight through the facility staff and security, consuming them for biomass as it seeks a means of escape. Along its journey to freedom, it discovers surgically removed pieces of its genetic code, and upon reinstituting these into itself, the creature can evolve, allowing for greater size and more means to both offence and defence as the security heightens the closer it gets to escape.\n\nAs I mentioned above, there isn't a lot of narrative to this title, where much of the game is left to you to decide what has happened and why this is happening. You get small snippets of information through flashback cutscenes you unlock through progression, but they are very short and don't convey much more than how you got to this facility. I didn't find this method of story-telling necessarily bad, it just leaves you guessing a lot of the time, and I feel the developers missed an opportunity to implement an unlock lore and story through consumption mechanic.\n\n[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]\n[h3]Would you like parmesan cheese with your brutal carnage, sir?[/h3]\n\ud83d\udfe9 The creature is not a being of grace. It is primal wrath and chaos unfurling within the walls of the research facility, to everyone's great dismay. [b]Carrion[/b] does an exceptional job conveying this by allowing you to tactically stalk your prey and rip them to pieces within its brutal control mechanics.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3004088940\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Combat is visceral as the creature tears through the facility without reservation, and avoiding both gunfire and actual fire will be crucial to survival. And with every cleared room, the chaos you have wreaked will be evident through the blood and entrail-stained walls depicting the tale of your eventual escape.\n\nWithout the pieces of your former self, you can't adequately evolve, and devouring enemies without these merely allows you to recover health and recover size back to your current cap.\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 You progress and save the game by depositing samples of your biomass into cracks and fissures located across the facility grounds.The newly formed hive is used to rip open seals between biomes, destroy large pieces of walls and many other things over the course of the story including saving your progress and healing you back to full.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3004088857\n\n[h3]A different type of hide and seek.[/h3]\n\ud83d\udfe9 You rarely have size and power to your advantage, and you are, for a majority of the experience, poorly equipped to take on groups of or singularly powerful enemies without a plan in place. You will have to use your speed and timing to exact your revenge, and this often means hiding in air ducts and sewer systems, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and consume.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3004089203\n\n\ud83d\udfe9 Using your evolutionary abilities will help you greatly in the grand scheme, with each size variant of the creature having a different set of unique capabilities and talents that allow it to traverse the expansive confines of the facility and protect itself from the growing deluge of destruction that has been ordered to standing in its way.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]\n[b]Carrion[/b] is a beautiful game that employs pixel-style graphics to depict a realistic and intensely graphic situation where a creature has escaped captivity. Blood-splattered rooms and devouring people is still a startling aspect of the title, but it somehow dulled thanks to the style, which wants you to focus on the experience of trying to escape more than the horror of the situation.\n\nThe audio is also astounding. All your movements as the creature sound as true-to-life as my imagination can dictate, facility workers screaming in terror at the sight of tendrils flying towards them, the splash of water as you dive into it to escape, all provide excellent atmosphere and immersion as you play, all of this coupled with a near flawless soundtrack and this is one hell of an experience.\n\n[h1]Deck Performance and Specifications[/h1]\nThis title is the perfect game to play on the deck. The controls are responsive and clean, and the resolution is excellent for the graphical style.\n\nThere were no major or minor graphical issues to report.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts - Excellent[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]\nFalling short in only a couple of minor areas, [b]Carrion[/b] succeeds at creating an incredibly entertaining experience that takes you to the other side of a facility breach but also delivers an emotional journey as you witness the struggle to survive on both sides and the longing to be free. Despite its short length and lack of sufficient plot, I firmly believe this game is worth its current price point, but if you can get it on sale, even better!\n\n[quote] Hunt, stalk and consume all you can, but when you finally achieve your freedom, head over to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43064204/] Hell, Purgatory and Paradise[/url] to truly get your fill.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1689330790, "timestamp_updated": 1697070742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.70628434419631958", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142029142": {"recommendationid": "142029142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126881121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1689295422}, "language": "english", "review": "Carrion is the perfect example of how playing as a horror movie monster should feel.

Grab it on sale if you think the concept looks cool.  ..Because it is.  \n\n=====================\n[b]My Metroidvania Tier List[/b]    [i] (excluding Metroid & Castlevania titles)[/i]\n=====================\n\n[b]S Tier:[/b]  Aeterna Noctis | Astalon: Tears of the Earth | Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom | Hollow Knight | Cathedral |\n\n[b]A Tier:[/b]  Doomblade | Afterimage | Elderand | Ori and the Will of the Wisps | Environmental Station Alpha | Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights | Depths of Sanity |\n\n[b]B Tier:[/b]  Blast Brigade | Alwa\u2019s Legacy | Steamworld Dig 2 | Islets | Blasphemous | After Death | Haak | Outbuddies DX | Mortal Manor | Escape From Tethys | Treasure Adventure Game | Chasm | Haiku, the Robot | Monster Sanctuary | Rabi-Ribi | Elliot Quest |\n\n[b]C Tier[i] (enjoyed playing)[/i]:[/b]  Carrion | Momodora: Reverie under the Moonlight | Lone Fungus | Aggelos | Iconoclasts | Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night | Death\u2019s Gambit: Afterlife | Catmaze | Omega Strike | Plague of Yamorn | Infernax | Wuppo | Sheepo | Ato |\n\n[b]D Tier[i] (liked some things, but had issues)[/i]:[/b] Moonscars | Rusted Moss | The Messenger | Castle In The Darkness | Alwa\u2019s Awakening | Pharaoh Rebirth | Yoku\u2019s Island Express | Guacamelee! 2 | Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse | Shantae: Half-Genie Hero | Axiom Verge | Strider | Minoria | Souldiers | Bone Appetit | The Witch & the 66 Mushrooms | Transiruby | Destroy Space Aliens | La-Mulana | Guacamelee! | 8Doors | Gato Roboto | Super Panda Adventures |\n\n[b]E Tier[i] (Didn\u2019t like)[/i]:[/b]  Rain World | Dandara | Vernal Edge | Blaster Master Zero | Medusa | Sundered | Salt & Sanctuary | Valdis Story | Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet | Chronicles of Teddy | B.I.O.T.A. | Shadow Complex | Grime | Timespinner | Rex Rocket | Phoenotopia: Awakening | Aquaria | Nyaruru Fishy Fight | Apotheon | Bad Pad | Lootbox Lyfe | Angel\u2019s Gear | Fearmonium | Dust: An Elysian Tale | \n====================", "timestamp_created": 1688911653, "timestamp_updated": 1688911653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141660213": {"recommendationid": "141660213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004660319", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1688886077}, "language": "english", "review": "Whoever made this is definitely a psychopath.

These increase as you unlock new abilities. If you like you can leave a pair of legs in the room in case you pass through later wanting a snack. As alluded to, it's delightful to discover how many things in the environment you can play with, like breaking lightbulbs and picking up rusted rail-carts.\nAs you acquire more abilities, as well as opening up new areas to explore, it gives you more tools to consider how to tackle humans. As they equip themselves with measures to counter grab-and-nom, the game takes on a puzzle aspect. Do you rely on your powers at a smaller biomass to protect your smaller healthbar, or take it more up close and personal with a higher biomass better able to soak up damage? If you're like me, an approach with the latter going wrong forces you to try another approach...or you could backtrack to regain health but that's less thrilling, heh.\n\nUnless you're making an effort to backtrack and check for all the hidden extras, pathfinding generally isn't an issue, in spite of no map. One way pipes and which routes are open to you with your current abilities make it quick and easy to find the way forward. I wonder if the devs decided a mini/map would be immersion breaking for a ravenous inhuman entity. You always have a button to get an idea which way the nearest save point is, but I rarely used it myself.\nThe game always feels fair, as sound effects telegraph a gun's safety coming off, or a barrier going up, and visual indicators when you've dropped a size category. It certainly helps that the design of more dangerous enemies makes it easy to tell at a glance who is still a threat to you.\n\nIt's also worth noting how well-tailored for the experience the sound design is.", "timestamp_created": 1688657478, "timestamp_updated": 1688657478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141447002": {"recommendationid": "141447002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316526651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1697907811}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game", "timestamp_created": 1688650407, "timestamp_updated": 1688650407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141420904": {"recommendationid": "141420904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066760230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1688616630}, "language": "english", "review": "Entertaining from start to finish", "timestamp_created": 1688616661, "timestamp_updated": 1688616661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941185235977173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141399381": {"recommendationid": "141399381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179370737", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1688590002}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como si John Carpenter hubiese sacado un videojuego inspirada en su pel\u00edcula The thing, algo completamente org\u00e1smico para cualquier tipo de p\u00fablico.", "timestamp_created": 1688590399, "timestamp_updated": 1688590399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141394350": {"recommendationid": "141394350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387939871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1689522535}, "language": "english", "review": "good but short", "timestamp_created": 1688585616, "timestamp_updated": 1688585616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477941185235977173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141393773": {"recommendationid": "141393773", "author": {"steamid": "76561199224026979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1688586016}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good\n", "timestamp_created": 1688585085, "timestamp_updated": 1688585085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141362199": {"recommendationid": "141362199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009126678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1688554267}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a marvel of a game!

This is also compounded by the two-forms system being theoretically a great idea yet not a single point in the game actually allows you to take advantage of it. There's just a few points where you need to downshift to solve a very obvious puzzle then go and get your mass back to continue, rather than having any exploration with alternate takes on how to handle situations. Sucks if you like the webbing upgrade because the need to break wood to be able to actually make it through the game means you're only allowed to use it when the game says okay.\n\nI'd also argue the store description is a lie. It's not a game where you really do much stalking, you just have AI that's dumb as bricks so they act like they've no idea what's going on despite also very clearly being able to know exactly where you are at all times and respond to sounds more than two rooms away. That's not a bad thing, but not describing it as a puzzle game first and foremost is misleading- and the lack of transparency about it being a puzzle game plus how utterly short it is, for \u00a317? Get it on sale or don't get it at all,\n\nAs to the DLCs - the OST is great, don't get me wrong but also incredibly samey and nondistinct. I couldn't possibly tell you where any part of the game the music is from, nor in a month or two could I even go \"oh yes that's Carrion music\" if not for the fleshy sounds included throughout. Not worth the \u00a38.50.\nDeluxe edition art book is neat, but also not worth a separate \u00a39 either, and we're several years past a desktop wallpaper being something that's worth any monetary value at all so I'm opting to consider it a free bonus included with the art book, with the art book itself being the thing they're asking \u00a39 for.\n\nFor me? Summer sale dropped it to \u00a36.70, and that's a price that's fair, as is the deluxe edition bundle dropping to \u00a37.60 (price not including base game). If the soundtrack were rolled into deluxe edition outright rather than having them be two DLCs, I'd feel happier with the pricing but the core game is just asking altogether too much. It's short, frustrating and feels half-baked and almost 100% of that is attributed to the shoddy level design, because the potential present with literally everything else can very much be felt.

My biggest turn off is the visual theme and audio. Although the premise of the game is to be the monster, I find it disturbing to massacre screaming bleeding people who did nothing to the extent this game portrays. Don't get me wrong there are several games that involve murder of innocents. (GTA5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 are the biggest 2 I can think of) and there are several games that involve blood and death of humans. This game ups the scale of screaming and blood to a rate and me as a kinda snowflake individual with this kind of things I feel bad and almost sick playing. If you enjoy this type of game play I understand why but I prefer more \"Metroid\" movement in my 2D games with simple to learn yet difficult to master movement and weapons  that allow for incredibly punishing attacks but risk getting insanely hurt if you mess up the precise movement. This game just feels like there isn't much that can change from the start (acknowledge that I only played about 23 minutes before I got a sick feeling playing so I am judging off of the first several minutes and not the whole game). Also I felt lime I was already repeating tasks in these several first minutes. I guess the fact I disliked the game play and theme choice would mean I wouldn't recommend this game to somebody like me. However, I see the value for other players in this game, this type of game may be the perfect game for you.

Enemies feel weak and vulnerable while still posing a genuine threat, and the way you destroy everything in your path gives a great feeling of power.\nMoving around feels great, although it can get cumbersome when you reach larger sizes.\nNavigation can be a bit weird, and the lack of a map led to me getting lost a few times. But the world is small enough to explore reasonably quickly, and it wouldn't make any sense for whatever it is you're playing as to have a map anyways.\nBoth combat, and general exploration takes the form of a series of puzzles, and they are generally fun to solve.\nObviously I shouldn't spoil the ending, but just know that it is thematically perfect. And while Carrion isn't a deep game in any sense, the final minutes of the game had me both in a bloodthirsty rampage, and dreading what I had just done.\nSolid 8/10 would recommend\n", "timestamp_created": 1686709188, "timestamp_updated": 1686709188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140027530": {"recommendationid": "140027530", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970201312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 214, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1684357935}, "language": "english", "review": "Crawl.

The soundtrack sounds nice but is nothing special. the deluxe edition content is actually pretty good, but not worth the base price. Get it on sale.

It doesn't seem like it has too much replay value (which is fine, not every game needs it), but it's got stellar art, sound design and music. In fact I think the short playtime can be seen as a plus. It's not a game that needs a lot of time to deliver its ideas, and it respects your time by not filling the game with a bunch of tedium to pad out the playtime. I see the full price tag as a way to pay the devs for their good work (but it seems to go on sale often enough anyways).\n\nYou can tell the artists and designers worked their asses off to get the environments to look as good and diverse as they are; to get the visual language down and polish the experience so that figuring out the game felt intuitive without sacrificing the satisfaction of feeling like YOU figured it out.\nMessing around with the unique controls and movement is fun, and it gives you plenty of time and encounters early on to figure things out before it gets to the challenging parts.\nFights later on play out in ways that still feel open-ended and reward experimenting with your abilities without feeling like they're too easy, and the music during these really stands out to me as some of the best in the game.\n\nMy only real gripe with it is that I wish the hub area had a map of some sort, since you can end up spending very little time there between new areas, leaving it a lot harder build a mental image of how to get to older zones and grab stuff you missed, or to not accidentally backtrack when you're trying to get to the next one. They have some doors close behind you in sections you don't need to access again to help with this, but I think they ended up just making it harder for me to get my bearings, and sometimes momentarily made me think there were still areas I hadn't reached.\n\nOther than that, it's a fun, short metroidvania with a streamlined flow. It delivers the satisfying highlights of getting new abilities, using them to get into old and new areas both, and figuring out how they can help you fight some of the harder enemies, without ever convoluting or drawing things out.\nIf you feel like supporting the time and thought that went into making all of that, buy it at full price. If you don't like that it took me only ~5 hours to 100% my first playthrough, wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1685078417, "timestamp_updated": 1685078417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573998332023620605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138998988": {"recommendationid": "138998988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042765187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2139, "last_played": 1687149166}, "language": "english", "review": "It's how Pac-Man should have been.", "timestamp_created": 1685071780, "timestamp_updated": 1685071780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138960219": {"recommendationid": "138960219", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987932991", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1695896217}, "language": "english", "review": "nine houers stuck on part recomend\n", "timestamp_created": 1685017358, "timestamp_updated": 1685017358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138955902": {"recommendationid": "138955902", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089292673", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1686038864}, "language": "english", "review": "haha eat ppl", "timestamp_created": 1685010304, "timestamp_updated": 1685010304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138938421": {"recommendationid": "138938421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436413278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1684974832}, "language": "english", "review": "super fun and has some fun puzzles to figure out. plus great story and lore!", "timestamp_created": 1684974902, "timestamp_updated": 1684974902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138937283": {"recommendationid": "138937283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076920331", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 1111, "last_played": 1700584373}, "language": "english", "review": "a truly horrific game! i love it!", "timestamp_created": 1684972739, "timestamp_updated": 1684972739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138899050": {"recommendationid": "138899050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986589666", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 788, "last_played": 1684962245}, "language": "english", "review": "What is not to love!

From the design of the playable creature, to the NPCs, and to the graphics, all of it is just a treat to look at. It reminds me a lot of Broforce in the graphics department.\n\nMost of the gameplay I would count as okay. The puzzles are decent and the combat (while a little wonky) has some degree of freedom to it. Throwing objects at enemies doesn't seem entirely immersive, and somewhat more like I'm cheesing the game, but it is expressive and free in that regard. As for the puzzles, the main issue I had with them was the repetition of the \"deposit\" mechanic. Commonly, I would misclick and deposit more than was necessary and be stuck in a long, repetitive animation for some seconds. \n\nMy main problem lies within 2 things, the lack of a minimap (which everyone seems to complain about), and the shocking lack of horror. Starting with the lack of a minimap... really? This seems like something that would be in the Game Design 101 class for Metroidvanias, and yet they completely forgot its inclusion. Secondly, I get that this is a \"reverse horror\" game, but after the first couple of kills the lack of psychological thrill really makes me feel like I'm missing something. The characters do not do more than scream incessantly, you can only rip them in half, and the gibs/blood are barely even noticeable. I was expecting to feel more like a villain while playing this game. Where is the horror? \n\nThe music was just okay, nothing spectacular and it didn't add enough to the game in my opinion.\n\nThe ending was incredibly bland and left lots to be desired, 4 meh hours for 20 dollars isn't a great deal.\n\n2.5/5, wouldn't really recommend for this price.", "timestamp_created": 1683938941, "timestamp_updated": 1683938941, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49794614315032959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138206916": {"recommendationid": "138206916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040555932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1684180743}, "language": "english", "review": "super unique premise, great pixelart, super meaty sound design, perfect for a short metroidvania experience. ive already recommended it to multipl people irl", "timestamp_created": 1683930374, "timestamp_updated": 1683930374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138206300": {"recommendationid": "138206300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974457930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 607, "last_played": 1693595290}, "language": "english", "review": "Just beat the game and got everything I could.

Might have to do with the more mature content\n- There's lots of lovely gore everywhere. Your character is a gooey, bleeding, toothy collection of chomping maws that leaves a trail of blood (and maybe half a body or two) in its wake\n- The music is pretty good. The cueing for exciting bits is really well done and helps to ramp up the tension\n- The sound effects are great. Tinkling glass, human screams, and crunching bones form an excellent auditory backdrop to the roars of your creature (frequently punctuated by explosions)\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- Being that you're a scary sci-fi beasty on a rampage, there's not a lot of overt narrative or dialogue. The game uses environmental storytelling to varying degrees of success to convey the background story underlying all the mayhem\n- Leaving the player little breadcrumbs and clues is a fine approach to storytelling, but I always feel like I'm left with more questions than answers when all's said and done\n- Carrion is very proudly a reverse horror game where you get to have all the fun as the scary monster. It's wholesome in that metal sort of way\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- I wouldn't say it's a platformer in the traditional sense as there's not really any platforming challenges. You just ooze around and solve door puzzles while wreaking mayhem on various scientific facilities\n- The tentacle controls felt super awkward at first, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly\n- You grow in size and ability as you munch on delicious humans (the ones without the shells, anyway). Each size level you reach comes with a different set of skills that you'll need to use to metroidvania your way through the map\n- At some point, the game switches up the puzzle solving by making you switch between various sizes/abilities in order to progress. Sometimes this ramps up the challenge by putting you at a considerable matchup disadvantage against groups of enemies\n- The level design is pretty good, and I like how the game sometimes presents you with different options on how to progress. Unfortunately, this means that you can sometimes find that your creature is too large to comfortably navigate some rooms. Still possible, but often very awkward\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- Will run well on most hardware\n- An excellent Steam Deck game that performs well without fiddling with settings\n- It's a short little snack that won't take you too long to beat. It limits the experience somewhat, unfortunately. At least the ending seems to suggest there will be a sequel that may tie up some loose ends\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]7.5/10[/b]. A simplified metroidvania that intertwines combat and puzzles in an interesting way. I just feel like I wanted a little bit more of everything the game offered, which was a little unsatisfying.

Slither through air ducts, along metal grated corridors, and through concrete bunkers devouring all in your path. Adapt and overcome enemies, puzzles, and environmental hazards. Delightful, charming, and gruesome gore courtesy of excellent art direction and stellar sound design help sell the fantasy.\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe game follows the metroidvania design that has you backtracking to previously explored areas as you unlock new powers. This in and of itself is not a negative but the game lacks a map function and the warren-like maze of caves, corridors, and pipes can become more than a little disorienting. \nThe controls can be a little haphazard when you're trying to grab onto a specific thing, be that a lever, enemy, or access grate in a crowded environment while under fire from enemies. On that note there are four enemy types in the entire game, not exactly a wide diversity, although I suppose enough for the games runtime.\nAnd here is the true shortcoming of this game, it's short. Expect to 100% it in roughly 5 hours.\n\nThe Verdict:\nA gore slicked romp through a fun pixel art world. Short game length, a lack of enemy variety, and no real story or challenge modes hold back what could be an intriguing premise of a more fully fleshed out experience. A true 7/10 game, pretty good, not bad.

This game isn't insanely difficult but isn't too easy either one of the biggest things going for it in my opinion is the music, puzzles, atmosphere, and Metroidvania-type game play. Although for me there were some downsides to the game, that made it be a 9.5 and not a 10. First off, late game enemies and area's are  hell to deal with the first couple times, such as the droid enemies who basically rush you and just stun the hell out of you until your like one hp, then you start running away but because there are so many enemies you instantly die from all the other enemies who just saw you, and also the puzzles like the spear grenade ones well sometimes they will clip through walls and since you have no energy you will just die, this was especially annoying when I was in the section in the leviathan reef base trying to get a side containment biomass thing, and i died too many times to this thing even after I figured out the puzzle, but really that's it. Also one tip for late game areas and also in general in the game, when in an enemy area, try to stealth them to the best of your possibilities, if go in guns-a-blazing, you will most likely die if your not an absolute god gamer, and one last thing I swear when you play this game and you slowly watch your monstrosity get bigger and stronger you get like a large ego, like for me, if like some random person with a handgun hits more than once I straight-up get a little mad.                    \n\nUhm... why are you still here, and wait... you read through this whole thing... good on ya, by now.", "timestamp_created": 1683338345, "timestamp_updated": 1683338345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137855684": {"recommendationid": "137855684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049778527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 88, "last_played": 1683334020}, "language": "english", "review": "CONSUME.", "timestamp_created": 1683334469, "timestamp_updated": 1683334469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137849588": {"recommendationid": "137849588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859999522", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1683323981}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1683323988, "timestamp_updated": 1683323988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137849478": {"recommendationid": "137849478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155497299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1683323600}, "language": "english", "review": "An extremely fun and creative game, much recommended.

It is a game that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys horror, action, and gore.\n\n8 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1683228266, "timestamp_updated": 1683228266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137791034": {"recommendationid": "137791034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089533283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1683224065}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short, but very fun", "timestamp_created": 1683224529, "timestamp_updated": 1683224529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137776595": {"recommendationid": "137776595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046400647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1692661599}, "language": "english", "review": "i haven't had this much fun on a little game in a long time !", "timestamp_created": 1683205914, "timestamp_updated": 1683205914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137774619": {"recommendationid": "137774619", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178746081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1687724311}, "language": "english", "review": "very gamerz", "timestamp_created": 1683202709, "timestamp_updated": 1683202709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137774311": {"recommendationid": "137774311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017932896", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1683313765}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

I enjoyed playing as a vicious meat blob destroying and killing everything in my path. I did complete both the base game and the Christmas campaign to 100% completion in about 6 hours.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good and the progression is well paced. CARRION does a good job of pacing the game and changing how you play as you go. It introduces new abilities for you to use just as you feel like you've gotten use to the previous one. The game never feels like it gets dragged out or padded for content. In terms of difficulty, I think that they've hit a good balance of just difficult enough to provide some challenge while also still being easy enough to make you feel like a powerful flesh monster.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that navigating the map late game in order to get all of the abilities and achievements is a little frustrating without a map, I kept finding myself going around in the same loops while trying to get to a previous area of the game, but it's not that big of a deal, more of a minor annoyance.\n\nI did see that there is a workshop section for this game, but it seems kind of barren. At the time of writing there is only 50 items in the workshop.\n\nOverall I think that CARRION is worth playing if it seems like something that interests you. $20 may be a little steep for how long the game is and how soon you'd replay it so maybe pick it up on a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1683169838, "timestamp_updated": 1683169838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137760942": {"recommendationid": "137760942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996140790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3671, "last_played": 1692669043}, "language": "english", "review": "meat glob", "timestamp_created": 1683169158, "timestamp_updated": 1683169158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137760871": {"recommendationid": "137760871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285906503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 582, "last_played": 1692674642}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this a little too much.

Aspects of survival and challenge are never gone.\n\n[\u2714] The way the creature looks, shifts and slithers around feels convincing within the deliberately retro graphics, while leaving some room for imagination.\n\n[\u2714] Unique spacial perspective and the way the monster can quickly move in all directions is intuitive, satisfying and a pleasure to behold.\n\n[\u2714] Atmosphere supported by great music and sound effects, with some neat subtle nods to / inspirations from genre classics.\n\n[\u2714][b] / [/b][\u2716]  The game's fairly short, clocking at several hours (I'd say 4h for a normal playthrough, 6h when playing leisurely, and about 8h for an unhurried completionist run while keeping away from guides). Which is imo fine, however the price is a bit steep for that length and I'd personally recommend getting it on a sale.\n\n[\u2716] One thing the game [b]desperately[/b] needed was some/any kind of map, or at the very least better indication which pathway/entry leads to what section. Progressing through the areas in order is (for the most part) reasonable - however, going back to previously inaccessible sections with new powers is very confusing, easily results in getting lost, and only gets more frustrating the greater the total unlocked game area becomes.\n\n[\u2716] Minor issue, but the mentioned pleasure when moving around? At the monster's biggest size, it becomes a bit confusing and counter-intuitive, as its \"centre of balance\" you steer with isn't exactly at the front. Leads to occasionally going down the wrong hole, or getting shot because it's hard to account for the entirety of your mass.

For one you don't have a map. And everything looks the same. Its almost comical whenever a cutscene triggers to show you that somewhere a door opened. As if I remember where that was. I just randomly go through tubes until I spits me back onto the way forward. I remembered a line from Terry Pratchett's Only You Can Save Mankind: \"Where does this airwent lead?\" \"I don't know\" \"How can you not know? I watched a movie once and the Alien always knew perfectly where it was on the ship!\" \"Well, they probably had a map then.\"\n\nThe combat is you holding right mouse button and grabbing people. The guys with electroshields need to be hit by a physics object first and then jammed into walls. That's the combat. Other abilites could theoretically be used in this \"combat\" but nothing beats holding right mouse. \n\nSo really as a \"game\" the thing is not very interesting. But what about the reverse horror. This part of the game is even more lackluster. The humans do screem if they see you but they don't run away convincingly. And if you actually try to toy with your food the illusion breaks. I was sitting next to two unarmed women that were cowering in a corner and they would not try to run away because I was ontop of them and the game really wants you to insta kill everyone. Also the enemies do not react more intensely to seeing you eat a human than you just running past. And they have the typical AI of \"oh I didn't see him for like 3 seconds. Back to walking around in circles.\"\n\nAlso the humans don't talk. No screaming \"please don't kill me!\" but also no chatter between the civilians.

Despite the visual and tonal presentation of a movie-reminiscent monstrous horror, Carrion's actual gameplay comes as primarily puzzle solving and nigh-tactical action, with little story or narrative to assist in creating a horror or suspenseful experience. It's not what I \"expected\", but it's a competent pivot from something that may or may not have been more enjoyable (a question I hope won't go unanswered). The fundamentals of controlling a formless flesh beast are definitely very original, with a comfortable ease to sliding and zipping around between ventilation ducts and hallways, and the abilities are at least relatively inspired and fitting for the... protagonist, if you can really call it that. There's a glimmer of a deeper meaning with a few small playable cutscenes of presumably scientists unearthing something ghastly and ancient but it's not expanded on in any meaningful ways, nor does the beast ever gain the ability to read, which I wouldn't have minded even if just for a few little snippets of extra sauce. While an undoubtedly short game, I think the designers knew just about how long they could take the concept of the \"flesh puzzle\" ideas and bowed out at a respectable moment, but for me, it's easy to see where additional content could've been added without much adjustment to the whole picture.

"playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1684018897}, "language": "english", "review": "hello! this is my review for the game carrion. i am not a professional and haven't played the full extent of the game such as the bonus unlock-able abilities and bonus math puzzles, that aside ive beaten the base game and the currently only dlc so hopefully my review can be of assistance, warning this will have some spoilers for the game such as powers and story line. \n\nalso note- im aware there is a movie somewhere sharing the same name, or so ive heard- i don't know if this game if based off the movie and i don't particular think it matters for this review. as im more judging them off what i saw and understood from the game and not from other sources\n\n[world building / lore]- there world building is clear and blunt along with there lore and general understanding, you are a unknown species of \"monster\" being studied in a lab when suddenly you escape and begin to terrorize the lab that's kept you prisoner such aka the frontier, its a very unique premise but it lacks a lot of information and ideas that would make it clear. it gives off a scp or major organization dealing with monsters and the abnormal but as far as i could find they only had you kept prisoner and didn't seem to be studying you, and strange samples you can adapt to that's not explained wether its parts of you gone missing or samples they had laying around the lab, but im getting of track. i think its blunt, straight and works well for the game-play and inst something that has a lot of lore or backstory shown on surface level, if your casual and don't think to much on it then dw about it. but i think it'd do really well to have more optional information, even something like having information about who runs the place and why they run the place, etc. but its easy to just make a head-cannon such as \"there not necessarily into the abnormal there merely a large funded organization that studies anything that can better humanity\", i think that works best considering a lot of the lab makes more sense such as there large number of weapons and scientists that don't seem like they have a lot of things to study, just saying adding more information even shadowing at more lore would've been a lot of fun. but maybe they had something in the movie i keep hearing about \n\n[appearance / visual aspects]- the games art is a lot of fun and while everything's pixels it works shockingly well, its nothing to gawk at but it feels like everything just works. it also isn't very stressful on your device and ran well on my old pass-me-down pc, the monster and \"protagonist\" looks very convincing and pretty cool if i can say so,\n\n[adult or sensitive content]- if your prone to easy disgust or feeling bad after murder- then dont bother getting the game, your a monster and while some areas can be passed without murder- you will end up killing over and over again. and it has a level of gore, its all pixels but blood is slung everywhere and often you can bite people plainly in half and just damage them over all, it certainly is bloody and full of gore. it also is very violent and i know in this day and age there are people who are easily acceptable to aspects of fear and disgust, this is a reverse horror so if you cant handle horror elements (aside from jump-scares) then probably don't get it \n\n[audio- sound]- sound is excellent, and other then the choice to just make humans without weapons scream alot which made me kill them even when i didn't need to- it was amazing. the music puts you on edge despite you being the monster, the weapons sound incredible, the monster sounds like a giant flesh monster but they made it so its not unbearable or gross to listen to. i love how they make it sound like a horror game but with you playing it, and honestly it was a incredible feeling when the music spiked when i attacked after emerging from stealth. very good atmosphere and everything sounds natural and good \n\n[weapons / abilities]- abilities where A LOT of fun, and weapons where more smooth and entertaining to use then most shooter games in this style, i wont list them all because if you are reading this before playing the game i don't wish to ruin your fun. they where very creative and it was so much fun exploring ways to kill with these abilities, i do wish we got a lot more time to use some of them and id love if they added something like a skill tree or a evolution option to gain different abilities to give a lot more replay-ability and more things to do, for those curious you unlock abilities slowly threw out the game in different levels, most having a lot of purpose for different puzzles and killing methods, very entertaining but i wish there was... more, i also wish they buffed a few of the powers- some of the abilities felt insane and deadly but useful, while other powers like the beginning ability to roar felt useless \n\n[puzzles]- ngl, im not a puzzles man- ive owned games built around puzzles, i feel the same satisfaction when people solve them. but i despise puzzles in general because for me there sluggish and just annoying to get threw when you could be doing anything else, BUT im happy to report in this game they weren't to bad- other then being confusing at some parts they were creative and not repetitive enough that it was seriously entertaining or in the least didn't slow me down so much that it was slow, but it should be noted the whole map is progressed via different puzzles, such as learning how to open and operate different doors and using your abilities. \n\n[map- travel]- o boy, if the game is lacking anywhere majorly- its here... the level of rage and annoyance i had moving around this map is ridiculous. theirs no mini map and there is only a lack luster attempt at allowing you to locate your next goal, i think it adds more atmosphere with a lack of quests and game like menus of the sort but they could've done something with the ability echolocation, like you had a blank map but briefly saw around you or something with the ability- or just any clue to know where to go next. but no, a massive chunk of the game play was trying to find whatever the h-ll i was supposed to do next or where to go, a lot of time that could've and should've been spent on actual fun game play such as killing and a number of the puzzles, still- traveling wasn't horrible if you knew where you where going and the blockades where creative and you are fast, speedy and fit into areas that is fun to move around with- but i swear i did not need to spend 2 hours of that time finding out how the f--k where i was meant to go \n\n[AI / npcs]- fun and reasonable, only dialogue you get are screams and yelling but its honestly not something you need in a game like this. the guards shot at you and move carefully and not robotically, the humans cowered and it was fun to see them do so, many- to many met my wrath cause they didn't stop there screaming though. \n\n[ending/ pay-off]- going to avoid talking about the process and appearance as to keep away from spoilers, but its satisfying and pays off well. i do say it left me wanting more and to play around with my abilities a bit more, but honestly it was a good ending that took me (casually playing) around 5 hours to complete? not including the two hours it took to navigate when i was lost, and the dlc was a short but fun time and its free- it took me around a hour but i also played around alot and goofed off... \n\noverall id rate it a 8/10- its faults aren't few and aren't easily ignorable, and it can be irritable to play at times- but its game play was far to entertaining and the concept was way to good for me to rate it any lower. so ill deduct the two hours as points, and call it there. i really really hope to see more of this game and more interesting concepts dealt with it, such as maybe a co-op where you could even kill and hunt others of your kind with no little difficulty, almost like a predator vs predator fighting over there prey. or more abilites and a skill tree,", "timestamp_created": 1682311795,

The levels are branched, there are puzzles, in some places you will have to go back to the areas that you can now go through.\nBut to be honest, it's still not quite what I expected after the trailer.\n\nAmong the advantages of the game, I can note the following::\n[olist]\n    [*] Genre itself, reverse horror is still not so common these days\n    [*] Sound accompaniment, ambient is pleasant and works on the atmosphere\n    [*] No difficult puzzles. Some consider this a disadvantage, but believe me, the game has several problems that, coupled with difficult puzzles, would make it unplayable for most people\n    [*] Replayability, which is implemented through mods for new maps. Unfortunately, I didn't check the quality and quantity of custom maps, I only went through the main campaign and the Christmas DLC (which is super optional, by the way, you won't find anything new there)\n    [*] Backtracking is here, but it's not so difficult (when you understand how it is implemented, but more on that below). You won't have to replay locations 5-7 times\n[/olist]\n\nDisadvantages:\n[olist]\n    [*] I lied >:) You [b]will have to[/b] replay locations 5-7 times. But for another reason - there is no map in the game. Okay, you say, how can a humie-eating tentacle monster have a map? Well, at least he(it?) could remember places he's already been to. Seriously, the second half of the game without a map turns into a series of endless situations when you don't understand where you are, where you should go and how to get back. By the way, it is because of this problem that I consider easy riddles a plus. In the absence of a map, it would be too much to puzzle over complex riddles in order to go further or get a new ability. This is the main gameplay disadvantage.\n    [*] The game is not meaty enough. The trailer from the game situations is great and resembles a good-quality horror. The animated video is also good, but they exaggerate what will happen in the game. Initially, I expected that I would chase the surviving humans with a growl or secretly kill them so that no one would notice anything. In general, this is not how it works. You can really break into the room like a real monster and arrange a massacre there only in the second half of the game. There are practically no situations when you, in the best traditions of horror films, secretly and bloodily kills a victim who has separated from the rest. [spoiler] Infection with a symbiote does not count, at this point the game usually turns into an unassuming shooter [/spoiler]\n    [*] AI is not very smart. You can catch the eye of a soldier and he will start shooting at you, but it is enough to hide from him for 10 seconds, he will forget about you and you can surprise attack him again. Is it a reference to Skyrim, like, \"i guess it was just my imagination\", right? Right? Right?\n[/olist]\n\nIn general, as I said, the game is good. I would still like to add a location map, but I understand that the game is already 3 years old, most likely the developers will not make such major changes to it.\n\nP.S. An important point that I didn't understand at first is that you can return to any location near the end of the game, the first half you just need to move forward.\n\n8 tentacle meat monster in a toilet out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1682266510, "timestamp_updated": 1682266510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137177405": {"recommendationid": "137177405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043595300", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1630509108}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm really not a fan of metroid-like games because I get confused by these types of layout/maps, but I had a lot of fun with this game!

Trying to go through a small space, which you need to do a lot, has a bit of aim issue since you're not really controlling a centre point, but instead actually controlling the whole mass, so the top, middle bottom section of this lump of mass may be moving independently.\n- Then, there's also the atrocity of the aim. Once again, since you're not exactly controlling one point, the aim sometime come out of nowhere. Thinking you can aim and grab with the middle of the body? Wrong, it will start at the front section. Move and try again, now it's the back section ...\n- Combining the two points, trying to rush through areas with multiple enemies can be really really horrible.\n\nNow, the neutral part:\n= I've seen a lot of complains about the short length. To me, that is still a-ok.\n\nFinally, the good part:\n+ The good reverse horror! I really love it. No word can describe it but maybe number can. For this part itself, 10/10!!!\n+ Using your newly gained ability to go back for a tiny bit of upgrade is cool.

You play as an experimental death creature meat thing whose goal is to gain biomass and escape the facility. That's the game in an overly simplified manner, but I think you got that from the trailers. I personally didn't expect this to be a Metroidvania when first starting it, but it turned out to be one of the most innovative Metroidvanias I've played to date; enough so that I think it blurs the lines on what can be considered as a Metroidvania. \n\nIt has fun gameplay with a ton of engaging abilities with great applications. Some make you feel like a sneaky and conniving fiend, whereas others make you feel like an imposing mass of meaty death goo. The abilities, their uses, and the overall gameplay make you feel like a mass murderer, but in a good way.\n\nAs for the art style, I feel like it is really well done. The animations on your creature and the enemies you mercilessly slaughter really let you understand the terror that these people are likely feeling while also making you disregard the brutality of your actions with the help of the emotionless nature of your personal death abomination.\n\nThe story isn't too established in this game. You have some pieces of lore throughout the game, and it is pretty straightforward to piece these points together, but even once you piece the nuggets of lore together, you don't get much story in the end. Thankfully, CARRION doesn't need a fleshed-out story to make it a good game.\n\nOverall, CARRION is a very fun and unique Metroidvania that makes you feel like a real menace. I highly recommend giving this game a try, as it makes slaughtering people so much fun!", "timestamp_created": 1681745293, "timestamp_updated": 1681745293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816904008388519287", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136831674": {"recommendationid": "136831674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084535575", "num_games_owned": 1060, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1681683926}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Tendril Slaughter[/h1]\nCarrion is such a fun idea and its very well executed here! The main premise here is that you play as a grotesque monster that has to take over a research facility. You are a mass of flesh and tendrils and surprisingly that makes for a really entertaining control scheme. I would highly recommend playing on mouse and keyboard as this lets you swipe you're mouse around to fling yourself into doors, scientists, and vents!\n\nThe game plays out like any other metroidvania having you explore new zones and gaining new movement and combat abilities that unlock access to further areas. However Carrion really makes this feel fresh, you arent shooting, swinging a sword, or punching you're enemies. Instead you lash out with come bouldering in smashing into enemies, tearing them apart and eating them to gain mass! I wont reveal the later abilities but every one of them is fun to use, the game does a good job at making you think about how to use them to clear a room but doesn't make you slow down so much that the pace dies. \n\nThe art is also a big strong point here. The environments are change from sterile to organic and I found them nice to explore. The main thing to take note of is the playable character. The animations look awesome and the pixel art style is used very well in this game. I don't think ill get to play anything with such interesting visuals for a while. \n\nLastly I want to note the sound design. Its gross, its creepy, and its crisp. The sounds you make when eating is great and you'll hear it a lot so thats good! On top of that the ambient noises make for a very good atmosphere. You will also encounter lots of screaming through you're playtime and it never felt like too much or sounded too cheesy like some other games i've played. \n\n[b]In conclusion:[/b] Go ahead and treat yourself to this fun and unique take on the metroidvania formula!", "timestamp_created": 1681686090, "timestamp_updated": 1681686090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136816409": {"recommendationid": "136816409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263635928", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1681666373}, "language": "english", "review": "Fling crap everywhere!", "timestamp_created": 1681666420, "timestamp_updated": 1681666420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136806406": {"recommendationid": "136806406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994029761", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 898, "last_played": 1682270112}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING game, amazing graphics, amazing gore, amazing puzzles (not really they were kinda annoying) amazing story, and the best part is...

Although this is technically not a horror game (coz you know, you ARE the horror itself), it never fails to convey the terror of the monster that you control. It's always groaning, splatting blood all over the place when moving, and I get the chills every time I hear the hellish screaming when I managed to breach the containment valves and escape into new areas. Oh, and the victims you just killed will always have some agonizing and painful death screams, just to make you extra bad lol.\n\nOne thing I really like is the graphical design of the game. I don't know why but pixelated styles are always fitting with horror game to me personally, I geuss it's probably because of the grittiness of the art style? Like when you're massacring people, it manages to tell what is happening but also not too focusing into all the minute details, vague enough for you to fill out the blanks, so less is more eh?\n\n\n\n[h1] Nitpicks [/h1]\n\nSpeaking of designs, the game's map design is basically a maze, it revolves around you finding a way to escape the research facility, which is a great way to kick in the atmosphere, makes you feel isolated, abandoned. You know, typical cosmic horror stuff... \nBut one of the main issue I noticed about this design is backtracking without any maps. Okay personally, I have no problems with backtracking, I've played hollow knight so this kind of backtracking is mild (just that other people might found it frustrating), my problem is just that there's no map for viewing, sometimes it feels like I have to trail my path back and forth needlessly, again and again just to make sure I am heading the right way. Not to mention that some of the areas are blocked forever once you finishes so it kinda messes up your memory of where you wanna go, so it kinda disrupts the game flow. \nIt's okay if you wanna let the player to learn the paths, you don't even have to show their location at all, but at least put the map on specific places and let the player know how big is this place exactly, this should make the players less overwhelmed by the map design and improves the sense of progress in the game.\n\nAnother nitpick I had is that the monster's special skills are useful only in specific occasions, like really the only time I use them are when I'm in puzzle maps, which in that aspect works perfectly fine, and I enjoy my time solving the puzzles to get fulfilling rewards. But in other areas, those special abilities are just not that helpful, as the energy slots uses up pretty fast, it couldn't display its potential when it comes to combat. \n\nOh and the combat, I feel like the game had too few enemy variety, like in the late game we only got 2 ([spoiler] shielded flamethrower soldiers and shielded attack drones[/spoiler]), which makes some of the challenges in combat kinda lost in the late game since you're too powerful to be stopped. But I understand it's a short game (if I didn't do any backtracking I think i'd have finished the game in 3 hrs), so it's a bit hard to polish the difficulty curve. I just think that maybe adding a final boss battle or new types of enemies in the final part of the game could raise the stakes more and make the endgame more entertaining, perhaps you need to fight a different specimen, or a giant death robot driven by the remaining survivors or some sorts...\n\nOverall, Carrion is a pretty compelling game, it had great artstyle and game concept. Although not being utilized to its fullest potential, it manages to make a horror-based game quite enjoyable.

For a buck or two.  It has good visuals and mood, good puzzles and somewhat interesting combat. Altho its incredibly short. Most of the time you spend in tedious roaming around searching for a path. No global map hurts alot, but with map it would be twice as short. Puzzles are nice, but they are scattered around the map, and mostly hidden behind  skills you have yet to unlock somewhere on the other side of map who even knows how soon. Pacing is off too. Its nice when game forces you to spend more time in 1st weak and sneaky form, hiding and creeping on enemies, but you have to find a spot to switch forms. Its good when it build right into puzzles, but most often its 1-2 levels far, wasting your time ance again, and you have to slugh your 3d lvl body around. Switches that open one doors and closing others are annoying too, couse they keep some doors shut even when you done with puzzles and cleared the level. Elevators are the same. And you only get like 3-4 good fights for 3d lvl at the end of the game. Still have to be in this form to open future passes. Or not, guess which form will be needed. And waste you time again to find pool to change form. So the game massively wastes your time and let you choose which form to approach half of the battles. That should give you some feel of freedom, but it mostly hurts the game and pacing.

The creature you play as moves so fluidly, and the controls are intuitive and easy to pick up which makes that movement even better. This game absolutely NAILS the \"you are the monster\" feeling and it's so damn fun while also piquing your curiosity about the story. There's something so satisfying about coming into a room of armed enemies and figuring out the best way to get rid of them, whether it be sneakily snatching them from a vent or barreling at them like an angry plate of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nProgression is very smooth and well-paced. You unlock new powers over time which both open up more areas and improve your monster's killing toolkit. My only gripe is that occasionally I got a bit lost while trying to find my way around, but overall the game does a solid job of keeping you on track.

The game features a unique movement system that allows the player to slither, crawl, and squeeze through tight spaces, as well as a variety of abilities such as tentacle attacks and the ability to mimic objects. The game is fast-paced and action-packed, with satisfying combat and challenging puzzles. However, some players may find the game's lack of variety in gameplay and short length disappointing.\n\nStory: The game's story is minimalistic, with no dialogue or cutscenes, but the player can piece together the events of the story through the environment and encounters with NPCs. The game's atmosphere is eerie and unsettling, with a sense of isolation and desperation.\n\nGraphics and Sound: \"Carrion\" features impressive pixel art graphics, with detailed environments and gruesome creature designs. The sound design is also effective, with atmospheric sound effects and a haunting soundtrack that adds to the game's horror elements.\n\nReplayability: The game offers some replayability, with the ability to replay levels and unlock additional abilities. However, the lack of variety in gameplay and short length may limit replayability for some players.\n\nCriticism: \"Carrion\" has been criticized for its lack of variety in gameplay and short length, which may not provide enough content for some players. The game's minimalist storytelling may also be disappointing for some players who prefer a more narrative-driven experience.\n\nOverall, \"Carrion\" is an excellent game that offers a unique and engaging experience for fans of the horror and action genres. The game's impressive graphics, effective sound design, and fast-paced gameplay make it a must-play for those looking for a different take on the horror genre. While its lack of variety in gameplay and short length may be disappointing for some players, its satisfying combat and challenging puzzles make it worth checking out for anyone who enjoys a good horror game.", "timestamp_created": 1678423600, "timestamp_updated": 1678423600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134348810": {"recommendationid": "134348810", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022460594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1678368849}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1678369122, "timestamp_updated": 1678369122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134335008": {"recommendationid": "134335008", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031828493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1678442348}, "language": "english", "review": "i like how npc in this game are just screaming", "timestamp_created": 1678342372, "timestamp_updated": 1678342372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134280567": {"recommendationid": "134280567", "author": {"steamid": "76561199238762269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1697495144}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, lil short", "timestamp_created": 1678256042, "timestamp_updated": 1678256042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134267588": {"recommendationid": "134267588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325052564", "num_games_owned": 575, "num_reviews": 324, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1619945415}, "language": "english", "review": "...", "timestamp_created": 1678231674, "timestamp_updated": 1678231674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134265752": {"recommendationid": "134265752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254876761", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1678226412}, "language": "english", "review": "A great experience, playing as the monster is seriously exhilarating, whether by sneaking around and picking off your enemies one by one, or charging at them with brute force, the game gives you more options for how to approach situations as you go.

Eres el \u201cmalo\u201d y punto. Algo que antes no era ni mucho menos la norma, y en cierta manera era hasta un tab\u00fa. \n\nParticularmente, la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol de esa frase me parece infinitamente mejor que la original en ingl\u00e9s, porque incluye la dicotom\u00eda bueno-malo dentro de la misma frase (chupaos esa, angl\u00f3filos). Sea como sea, y rolletes de abuelete aparte, Carrion es un \u201cEs bueno ser malo\u201d, y lo hace realmente bien.   \n\n[h1]Al m\u00e1s puro estilo John Carpenter[/h1]\nEn el juego, tomaremos el control de una masa de carne informe que escapa de su unidad de contenci\u00f3n dentro de un laboratorio secreto subterr\u00e1neo. A partir de ah\u00ed\u2026, venganza y muerte.\n\nAl principio comenzaremos como un ser peque\u00f1ito y adorable de grandes mand\u00edbulas y peque\u00f1os tent\u00e1culos para ir posteriormente creciendo hasta convertirnos en una aut\u00e9ntica bestia atroz de varias docenas de metros de tama\u00f1o. Y para conseguirlo, lo que debemos hacer es explorar las instalaciones, conseguir mayor poder consiguiendo mejoras e ir desmembrando y mutilando a todo humano que se nos cruce por el camino. Y cr\u00e9eme, est\u00e1 muy bien conseguido y es muy satisfactorio.\n\n[h1]La presa se convierte en cazador[/h1]\nUna de las mejoras cosas que tiene Carrion, por no decir la mejor, es que tiene la virtud de hacerte sentir que t\u00fa eres el cazador y que los humanos son meras alima\u00f1as que merecen ser partidas en dos para ser devoradas posteriormente.\n\nA esto ayuda enormemente que cuando te ven aparecer en una sala empiezan todos a correr y a chillar como locos, con unos efectos de sonido realmente conseguidos. Claro, al o\u00edr los gritos pues te vienes arriba y piensas: \u201cCorre, corre, que no te va a servir de nada\u201d. Y efectivamente, segundos despu\u00e9s el o la que gritaba yace en el suelo en dos trozos. \n\nSin embargo, si esto fuera as\u00ed siempre el juego perder\u00eda la gracia r\u00e1pidamente. Es por ello que mientras m\u00e1s avanza la aventura m\u00e1s peligrosos ser\u00e1n los humanos con los que nos encontremos. Algunos con pistolas, pero otros con ametralladoras o lanzallamas, e incluso con cosas peores.\n\nEst\u00e1 mal que lo diga porque es el personaje que controlas, pero cuando lo queman con un lanzallamas y empieza a chillar es bastante divertido, primero porque est\u00e1 muy bien hecho, y despu\u00e9s porque te vas a dar patadas en los tent\u00e1culos buscando agua para no quemarte por completo.\n\n[h1]La clave de todo es el movimiento[/h1]\nUna de las dudas que pueden surgir, y era una que yo ten\u00eda, es saber si el control de nuestro monstruo informe era c\u00f3modo y estaba bien hecho, y lo cierto es que est\u00e1 realmente bien ejecutado ese aspecto.\n\nAl principio se hace un tanto raro, pero al poco tiempo ya estar\u00e1s totalmente acostumbrado a desplazarte por todo el escenario y a utilizar los m\u00faltiples poderes que ir\u00e1s acumulando durante tu periplo de venganza. As\u00ed que, en ese aspecto, todo funciona a las mil maravillas y no tienes por qu\u00e9 preocuparte.\n\n[h1]Debajo de tanta matanza hay una historia[/h1]\nAdem\u00e1s de pas\u00e1rtelo pipa desmembrando a la pe\u00f1a, el juego se toma su tiempo para contarte la historia que se oculta detr\u00e1s de este ser. Hay determinados flashbacks que te pondr\u00e1n en situaci\u00f3n, y aunque no entran en excesivos detalles (tampoco es necesario), s\u00ed que sirve para situarte un poco dentro de la historia, y adem\u00e1s el final es \u00e9pico.\n\nS\u00ed que es cierto que la historia como tal, los flashbacks, no vienen porque s\u00ed y tendr\u00e1s que buscarlos por la base, pero tampoco ser\u00e1n nada complejos de encontrar. Adem\u00e1s, el juego juega mucho con el backtracking (volver a visitar escenarios ya visitados, pero con nuevas habilidades que nos permiten el acceso a nuevas partes del mapa) y en cierto modo podr\u00eda decirse que el juego tiene unas fuertes dosis de metroidvania. \n\nSin embargo, esto es algo puramente opcional en la mayor\u00eda de los casos y sirve m\u00e1s para el tema de logros que como algo indispensable para acabarte la aventura. Por lo tanto, hay componente metroidvania, pero no es un metroidvania propiamente dicho ya que el backtracking es opcional. Aun as\u00ed, yo recomiendo el backtracking, ya que si no el juego puede durar unas 4-5 horas como mucho y pierde bastante encanto por algunas cosas que dejas sin descubrir.\n\n[h1]Aspecto t\u00e9cnico bastante cuidado[/h1]\nComo ya habr\u00e1s podido ver por las capturas y v\u00eddeos el juego es puro pixel art, y lo cierto es que est\u00e1 muy bien hecho en casi todos sus aspectos. A destacar especialmente, y como no pod\u00eda ser de otro modo, las animaciones de la criatura al desplazarse, ya que son r\u00e1pidas y est\u00e1n muy bien realizadas.\n\nSu m\u00fasica es otro aspecto tremendamente importante, y te ayuda a meterte en situaci\u00f3n enormemente. Pero en este caso, esa musiquilla de suspense que suena no te agobiar\u00e1 a ti, sino que har\u00e1 que te vengas m\u00e1s arriba para seguir cazando. Es algo curioso c\u00f3mo cambia la pel\u00edcula cuando tienes una docena de bocas con colmillos afilados y tropecientos tent\u00e1culos a cada cual m\u00e1s mortal.\n\n[h1]Conclusiones[/h1]\nPor todo lo dicho, Carrion es un juego pr\u00e1cticamente \u00fanico en su especie, nunca mejor dicho. Ofrece una jugabilidad tremendamente entretenida, muy din\u00e1mica y llena de sorpresas, y adem\u00e1s de todo esto, t\u00e9cnicamente est\u00e1 muy bien realizado.

That being said it most definitely leans toward the explore part of that formula more then anything else. Combat is more a puzzle type of scenario  and Powerups are generally required to continue exploring. \nThe Game itself is fairly simple and generally can be completed in a few hours. Controls are rather spotty  and music/sound is rather lowkey.\n\nThat all being said I actually rather enjoyed the game. It is a fresh take on the metroidvania/adventure genre It fits right in with my twisted sense of self and takes  some very heavy inspiration from one of my favorite movies. John Carpenter's The thing. \n\nAs I mentioned the controls are a bit spotty but I feel they don't break the game. I would of preferred WASD controls as a option, but lack of them doesn't make it to difficult as it rather simple overall.\n\nSound/music I generally is one of the biggest things I rail on but in this case the lack of variety actually enhanced  the feel/mood of the game. It makes it more alien? other? something like that. It helped set the mood and made me feel I was something else.\n\nDecent steam workshop and mod integration but it does seem to suffer a lack of content there. However, I'm willing to over look that as the game is more of niche type of game and does fall more on the weird side then mainstream side. \n\nGameplay its fairly solid. Enter the area explore the area figure out how to get to the bio container. Removing/adding biomass to change which abilities you have I felt was a nice touch.\n\nA few things I do wish was some type of map or ability to see where you are.I'm not asking for a super detailed map but maybe something that says you are in this area type of thing. Second was some more collectibles/Notes that type of thing. This is a research base your in, it would make sense to have some type of data logs or something we could collect .\n\nOverall I give a it a solid 7/10. Which leads to the question of is it worth the asking price. At the time I am writing this it  is currently 20$ USD. As much as I would like to give a firm Hell yes  it is worth that price, I can't. The game was fun and I do recommend it  but I feel that it is falling just shy of the bar needed to justify a  20$ price tag.

I usually don't like backtracking in games, but in this I actually enjoyed traipsing back through the areas that I had caused havoc in earlier and remembering the routes I had taken through the levels because the movement is so fluid and joyous to control. I didn't feel like the game was wasting my time at all, which was really refreshing.\n\nThe art is gorgeous and really gives an excellent 16-bit or early 90s PC vibe which my nostalgia lapped up! Again, the animations and movement is exceptionally well done and feels so nice to play.\n\nI was a bit disappointed when the campaign ended around 8 hours in (and that was me really taking my time to enjoy every second of it and also doing the free winter DLC), however I thankfully found out that on the workshop is several lengthy modded campaigns, one of which is extremely high quality and gave me nearly another 6 hours of fun with this game! So if you do get this game and enjoy it, definitely check out the modded campaigns, it made up for an otherwise relatively short story mode.\n\nThis is one of those games that I truly hope there will be a sequel or a couple of games that are inspired by it because it was a complete breath of fresh air.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675886036, "timestamp_updated": 1675886036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132397741": {"recommendationid": "132397741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070047555", "num_games_owned": 750, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1673301862}, "language": "english", "review": "Carrion, Carrion, Cuz nothing really matters....", "timestamp_created": 1675816372, "timestamp_updated": 1675816372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132396807": {"recommendationid": "132396807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972638781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 634, "last_played": 1675814310}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

The movement is very satisfying and smooth.\n\n[*]The designers perfectly captured how to make the player feel like a terrifying, disgusting monster. The gross eating sounds, or the sounds of you breaking through the vents into a room of screaming innocents, tossing their bodies around and piercing them with spikes.. The physics, sound design and visuals of combat are all great.\n[/list]\n[b]The bad[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game gives you no opportunity to get creative. Apart from finding containment units, it is remarkably linear. I kept trying to find hidden nooks and crannies, secrets, easter eggs, alternative approach, or perhaps arriving at the result in a different manner than the game intended. Nope, you're firmly on the tracks, keep your arms and legs in the vehicle at all times. Then again it's an indie game made by a tiny team, so ofc I didn't expect an RPG with 5 endings. Just a little bit of flexibility.\n\n[*]The level design and lack of a map can turn this into a very disorienting game if you don't play it in one go. Luckily the game is very short, but the similar-looking areas don't help your sense of orientation whatsoever. I played it over one weekend and I got lost a couple of times. It wasn't a huge deal, I just don't see how not including a map made the game more enjoyable in any way, since it's not a metroidvania.\n\n[*]The actual mechanics of combat aren't amazing. The enemies are either barely a threat, or you run from them and try to fight from max distance/out of line of sight. This isn't a big issue, just wish there was some middle ground between \"haha me eat the screaming lady with a handgun\" and \"S.HIT HE HAS A FLAMETHROWER, GET THE WATAH\"\n\n[*]The mechanic of making yourself smaller to use different abilities isn't a bad idea, but the backtracking to find water to dump your biomass just makes it a pain in the mass.\n[/list]\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nOverall it's a fun game, fun idea, great art, very short, and has a couple of design shortcomings that made me wonder what could've been.", "timestamp_created": 1674955213, "timestamp_updated": 1674955257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745122015476226807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131761252": {"recommendationid": "131761252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839713730", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 344, "last_played": 1676765259}, "language": "english", "review": "The human lore segments were boring and didn't explain much.

In this build back better economy I wouldn't say it's [b][i] 20$ [/i][/b] good. But, it's def 10$ good, 15$ good if you [i]really[/i] like the genre. It's fairly easy. I made it most of the way through the game without dying once, then once the difficulty stepped up and I started dying near the end, so long as you save at the right places and times, you don't really lose much, and it's not really frustrating. The puzzles can all be solved via brute force trial and error, however, the very end was really confusing. I had no idea how to beat the game \n\nVERY MINOR SPOILER [spoiler] You basically end up with the whole facility opened up, and you can spend hours wandering around till you find out where you need to go to acquire the special upgrade that makes the game winnable [/spoiler]. \n\nBut a quick google search gave me the clue I needed and I figured it out for myself the rest of the way. \n\nOverall, I wish there were more games from this monsters perspective, a 3d action version of game for example would be legit. but the 2d metroidvania action of this game is still very good. It really reminds me of old school 8 bit and 16bit games for all the right reasons. Some would say it's too short, and I can say that it is definitely on the shorter side. My play time (5.6) hours includes the DLC. For some this is a bad thing, but I don't mind, I didn't find ALL the stuff, and I often don't have time to spend 40+ hours on a full length game these days. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game is a labyrinth, and they don't give you anything that even remotely serves as a map. But the path of destruction and bloody gore you leave in your wake does kind of serve as a trail of breadcrumbs, so you can explore and know you have been somewhere because enemies and the environment are obviously changed by the beasts passage. \n\nOne of the neatest things is the attention to detail with the little sprites of the people and their activities, their screams, and how you will see them sitting on the toilet right under an air vent where you can reach in with a death noodle tentacle and control their minds or kill them.

Anyways, here goes.\n\n[u]Gameplay/What to expect[/u]\n\nCarrion's premise is creative and refreshing; Instead of outrunning a monster in the shadows, you are that monster. \nYou can play however you want; you can be stealthy and use your abilities to control people and kill from the inside using their weapons; lurk around and wait for people to munch on from the ceiling; or even just rush in, mutilate, and crush a bunch of guys.\n\nCarrion's combat mechanics are fun and exceptionally gruesome (you can eat half a guy and vomit up his stomach acid!!!!), similar to that of BUTCHER's, a game also made by phobia game studio, (I recommend you check it out if you liked carrion.)\n\nThe artstyle is phenomenal and really allows for some great procedural animations for the monster, as well as cinematic and graphic battles against the facilities' members and their various machines that try to kill you.\n\n[u]Some issues[/u]\n\nThere are a couple issues with the game, as detailed below, but one thing that really stuck out to me was the lack of guide for the game's map. Don't get me wrong, the game looks great and is fun to explore, but I seemed to get lost quite frequently, especially when backtracking and in order to find those pesky vials. [u](This can easily be fixed by just finding some maps online though)[/u]\n\nI feel as though there were some missed opportunities with the game, such as a lack of NG+ or even re-visiting battles in the same save, as I felt murdering humans was one of the main focuses of the game, so having to restart to experience these fights was a bit of a let-down. The semi-recent integration of the workshop to the game makes up for these issues, allowing for some fun, player-made campaigns and skins for your red meatball guy. \n\nso basically eat humans as the reincarnation of the flying spaghetti monster and solve a couple of puzzles along the way", "timestamp_created": 1674388156, "timestamp_updated": 1693655045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131322828": {"recommendationid": "131322828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198979675056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1675205083}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1674375613, "timestamp_updated": 1674375613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131306097": {"recommendationid": "131306097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008149939", "num_games_owned": 1171, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 587, "last_played": 1674339834}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2611 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2611 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1674349350, "timestamp_updated": 1674349350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942358255386353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131287159": {"recommendationid": "131287159", "author": {"steamid": "76561199468478293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1699668818}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

The main gameplay conceit that being a blob brings to the table is that you grow whenever you feed and shrink whenever you take damage, and different abilities lock and unlock at different sizes.\n\nFor instance, in your small, unfed form, you only take a few hits to kill but you have access to a web-shooting ability that lets you press buttons and grab things from very far away, even on the other side of otherwise-impenetrable barriers.  At medium size, you get a bull rush that lets you knock down certain walls, but you lose the web throw.  At large size, you're too huge to properly build momentum within the cramped confines of the base (ergo: no wall bash), but you get an armor shield that lets you shrug off the automated guns that normally instakill you in certain areas, and so forth.\n\nEach form has several such abilities, all of which have environmental utility (as well as being fun to torment humans with), and so puzzles get increasingly complex and multifaceted as the game goes on.  Rarely are you just blindly tearing humans apart with reckless abandon; they're too useful as size-shifting resources for the puzzle gameplay, and even the combat encounters are frequently designed [i]as[/i] puzzles, like those above-mentioned instakill turrets.\n\nOn that point, something that may surprise players coming into the game expecting cathartic monster destruction madness is that it's almost entirely puzzle-based, with shifting in size to access different areas and unlock different options making up almost all of the gameplay.  For instance, say that there's a destructible wall in front of another, porous wall, behind which is a lever that gates progression.  You would need to eat enough people to be medium-sized, then bash down the wall, then go take some damage to shrink, then use the web shooter to hit the lever.\n\nIn short, for a game about being an evil brainless meatball, it's surprisingly cerebral, and its jarring (but [i]very[/i] \"Devolver Digital\") juxtaposition of gory ultraviolence and patient puzzle-solving won't be for everyone.  For me, though, it hit a nice sweet spot.

I'm not sure what had drawn me to it in the first place but I think I had just finished playing Bro Force and wanted another pixel based game but never got a chance to play it until now. I can easily say Carrion is 100% unique to any thing else I've played. You get to play as a tentacled bio-mutant monster who wreaks havoc on it's creators and anyone else that's in it's way. Let's jump right into the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n* As I just mentioned, it's unique to any other game I've played so far. It's fast paced like BroForce, you can both die and kill quickly, but obviously in this case you are playing as the monster. There are other games reviewers have mentioned that Carrion is similar to but I've not played them. I'm saying this game is unique more so because of the actual game play.\n* It's fun to be the villain sometimes, and in Carrion you are an escaped bio-mutant, so actually I'm not sure you are villain so much as a creature trying to pay back everyone who was involved with it's creation and exploitation. It's fun to munch on humans and rip them to pieces, after all they did deserve it!\n* As the bio mutant, you gain powers as you play however at a cost. When you gain a new power you also gain mass AND you lose access to your previous power. When you gain mass you also become much bigger, easier to shoot and to be seen. Sometimes that can spell trouble for you. But one nifty mechanic in the game is you can shed your mass in certain areas in order to regain old abilities. This is something you will do quite often to solve puzzles or avoid enemies. You also can return to the mass you shed and reabsorb it OR you can just feast on more enemies and gain your mass back. FYI, your mass is also your life gauge. \n* Puzzles are interesting and engaging and from what I've played so far, they've all been different\n* It's challenging but not too challenging to the point where in other games I've just grown frustrated and quit. Carrion I will continue to play and likely finish mostly because it's fun!\n\nCons:\n* One major draw back is, I think it's quite confusing at times what you are suppose to be doing. There isn't a tutorial and not much hand holding at all. You sort of have to wonder around aimlessly until get your bearings. Once you do, and realize where to look and how to find things it becomes a lot easier. BUT, I think that could be a turn off to people because, I'm not sure how long someone will fiddle around trying to figure out what to do before they are frustrated and quit. \n* This gripe is also tied into my previous issue, yes it's confusing to know what to do but also jeeez it's hard to see items and make distinctions between things. I don't want to give away too much information, but there are hidden entrances, doorways, pipes and also there are levers and switches and things you need to use. With Carrion being a pixelated game, it's not particularly easy to see things. They are not obvious enough in my opinion. \n* No Map, even a mini map would be nice. It would eliminate a lot of my back tracking because I can't remember where something was.\n\nAll things considered my list of complaints are negligible, I think that the average player will probably enjoy Carrion. Mostly they are quality of life complaints, would be nice to have but doesn't ruin the game. The cool mechanics and the fun atmosphere are enough to push this game easily into the thumbs up category for me. I'm not sure on the $20 USD.

The game looks really good for what it is.\nThe gameplay is smooth, and the movement feels wonderful as you whip around tight tunnels and more expansive caverns with uncountable tentacles. \nThe game is relatively short, but enjoyable all the same; after a while the puzzles start getting repetitive, but the game introduces new mechanics every so often to keep things fresh. The combat is quite interesting--despite being a monstrous abomination, you start the game rather weak, and have to rely on ambush tactics to not get shot to death. Later on, as you get more abilities, the power level of the enemies ramps up as well, so the combat stays feeling fresh the whole game.\nThe story is...somewhat anemic, but for what the game is, I think it works really well. You get bits of lore in flashback sequences where you control a human, and quite a bit remains unclear at the end of the game, but I didn't mind that--story wasn't what I was here for. And while what story there is is quite interesting, it doesn't make me feel like I missed out.\n\nAll in all, probably my third favorite game of all time. 10/10, wish there were more games where you get to play as a hungry shapeless blob of meat and terrorize the military and civilians alike.", "timestamp_created": 1673102135, "timestamp_updated": 1673102135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130335025": {"recommendationid": "130335025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335252776", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1673116268}, "language": "english", "review": "I carrioned all over them.", "timestamp_created": 1673083495, "timestamp_updated": 1673083495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130326090": {"recommendationid": "130326090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137437350", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 337, "last_played": 1673013157}, "language": "english", "review": "you can slowly open doors and scare people", "timestamp_created": 1673071675, "timestamp_updated": 1673071675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130311148": {"recommendationid": "130311148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976436609", "num_games_owned": 398, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 519, "last_played": 1672772224}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game to get on sale. It's unique, sometimes a little janky dealing with enemies, but otherwise good fun. 8/10. \n\nThe only real complaint I have is it was way too short. I would've liked to see the game get developed into a longer title, or maybe a sequel that'll be at least 2-3x in length. Once you get proficient at the mechanics and puzzle-solving, it's over in a few hours. The extra holiday mission was a welcome extension, but was only an hour long. I finished the base game and the extra mission in a Saturday evening.\n\nThe more minor complaint is the map got a little confusing after a while, and I had to find some guides for collecting some final achievements, because I had no idea how to reach the earlier zones once I was near the end. Clearing a level is relatively straightforward, and exploring the whole thing is somewhat of a requirement, because you need to hit all the \"checkpoints\" to open the door to the following zone, but the collectables were often blocked by tools/abilities you didn't have yet, in random parts of the level. So not only was it you had to go back to the previous zones after getting said ability, but you also had to navigate a majority of a level you hadn't seen for several hours to find the barred path again.\n\nMaybe this is more irritating than I thought, that I'm writing so long about it. Essentially, backtracking was a bit of a chore, and could've been done better. They had some exit signs for where the portals to next zones were, but the \"hub\" is a bit of a maze and you'll end up going in circles more often than you like. It would've been a simple thing to add more signposts or a mini-map.

Moving the carrion beast is smooth and using it's arsenal of tentacles and parasitic skills enjoyable. The game mechanics are well thought out and provide a puzzle element as gaining and losing body mass enables different abilities.\n\nThe minus bits are:\n* aiming your tentacles can be fiddly, especially when you have a huge body mass \n* the lack of a map - I know you're a monster and monsters don't use maps - but it's easy to get lost and once you do it takes time to find your way back into the game.\n* Game is a bit light in content, 6h to complete which is okay in itself but enemies are only a handful of different types and get repetitive. Also there are secret upgrades which you can only get near the endgame by revisiting older areas. When I unlocked those upgrades... they had become pointless since all enemies in the game were already dead.\n\nThose faults were fairly easy to forgive, as I enjoyed the game throughout.

This comes around Leviathan Reef Base to Leviathan Reef Base - Bridge. Just remember there is a guy on a pc in Base that you cannot kill until after HQ and to hit Tab after possession, and do not forget about the exit in Bridge like I did.
