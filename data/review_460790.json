Just going to say that right out of the gate. Mind you, it is VERY much so meant for an older audience; I felt like I wasn't old enough playing it the first time and I was 25.\n\nThe music is solid. The story is a bit much, but really, the story isn't why you'll be invested. It is really just an excuse to put Bayonetta into ridiculous action set pieces, and my goodness do those action set pieces happen. Bayonetta herself is just a really enjoyable character, she's just fun to watch do her thing. It is almost sad to think how many games these days are just miserable in tone, but this is the exact opposite, just goofy fun the whole time.\n\nThe combat is probably the main selling point, it is absolutely fantastic; it is fast paced and just over the top at all times.\n\nThere are few game series that I can so whole heartedly give my recommendation to. Personally, I like the second game the best, it is a Nintento exclusive (as weird as that is). But even still I give this game huge thumbs up. If you like fast paced gameplay and a light hearted tone this game is 100% for you.

I played on controller and on normal difficulty which would be my recommendation for others (it won't let you select a higher difficulty at the start anyways).\n\nSome tips that you might not learn without a guide:\n- The game does introduce the concept of holding down punch/kick to extend the attack. At first glance you don't realize how vital this is because it increases the amount of damage done VERY substantially. You can easily get through the game just throwing out punch-kick-punch combos and holding down the attack button.\n- Combos end (traditionally) with a wicked-weave (those giant fists/feet you see). You always want to try and end your attack sequence with these as they deal a lot of damage and knock back enemies and bosses. It can be particularly important to make sure you get one off before you exit witch time on certain bosses so that you stagger them and they don't immediately follow up and blast you.\n- Certain attacks or enemies do not trigger witch time normally when dodged, but most bosses do have an attack or two which will trigger witch time. On some bosses this can be instrumental, so try and figure out if enemies have any moments where you can get into witch time if they don't have obvious ones.\n\nThe one proper critique I can throw at the game is the PC version sometimes has weird glitches during cutscenes or climaxes where certain models are not rendered. Though if I am being perfectly honest, its really funny sometimes.\n\nThe story is nothing super fancy at the start but I really like where it went and it was actually quite interesting. The combat is superb. The characters are fun. The worldbuilding and lore is excellent and I very much enjoyed all of the flavor they injected into every aspect of the game.

However, most enemy hordes are made of three or four foes at best, which feels a little bit underwhelming.  \nVisually, the combos and attacks look amazing, however due to the lack of enemies on the screen those huge and powerful attacks feel pointless. I understand in boss and mini boss fights the foes should be limited as they're stronger, but I found it more entertaining if the regular mob phases are a little bit more crowded. \nAlso, there are a little bit too many platform and puzzle-ish stages which interrupt the fast-paced action gameplay.  \n \nThe game offers you three difficulties to start the game, and you must beat the game on normal (the highest one you're offered at the beginning) in order to unlock harder settings. The game is easily doable in normal difficulty, however if like me you're not used to hack and slash games you can expect some deaths at certain points. \n \nIn this kind of gameplay-driven games, the story should be in the background supporting the action. Bayonetta brings a decent and solid story but sometimes I felt the cutscenes are too long compared with the information and plot development they offer. \nThe good thing about those cutscenes is they give a chance for the main character to shine and to strength her personality. There are just a bunch of characters, but all of them are interesting and relatable, especially the MC. \n\nThe replayability is really good as it encourages you to pass all the levels with the best scores in the difficulties you've already beaten or replay the game with a harder difficulty. Some of the achievements and secrets can only be reached once you play in hard+ difficulty. \n \nOverall, and with the downsides I've mentioned, I think Bayonetta is an enjoyable game, especially if you're a fan of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1698002184, "timestamp_updated": 1698002184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

You may recognize the developers of this game as the people who made Nier Automata (2017) or if your annoying/on the spectrum, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance (2013). This game is very similar to other games developed by Platinum \"games\" (if you don't include wonderful 101 (2013) and vanquish (2010)), yet it has it's own identity because unlike those other games, this is a funny game. In the first level of this game you play as bayonetta (2009) and there is this fat ass joe pesci ass mother fucker and this big brolic black bald dude. Your enemy is these angels because your this evil ass witch or some shit, they play this crazy cover of Fly me to the moon (Evangelion), that pretty much gives you some idea of the \"game\" \"play\" of this \"video\" \"game\". The graphics of this game is pretty good for the 7th gen era of muddy ass garphics and what not. I'd put the garphics of this \"game\" somewhere between IRS Tax Avoiders (1982) for the Atari and the newest Call of duty game at the time of reading. You got all the combo's, the cool weapons, cool ass finishing moves, and wacky story expected in other \"platinum\" games releases but the absolute absurdity of the game is what makes me give this game the \"Ilovespreadingmisinfomation good ass g*mer good time award\". The soundtrack for this game is pretty goated (greatest of all timed, for the less intelligent readers), it has great tracks and it really helps keeps the fights entertaining. This video game has some difficultly too it, at first I kept getting those stupid ass Joe pesci trophies on the end of every level then I eventually got goated (refer to previous annotation) and got the black dude trophies and even sometimes the bayonetta (2009) platinum trophies. Overall I'd say this game is fire flamez (flames) and I'd recommend you, the reader, to pick it up, it probably costs as much as 2 packs of LD reds so thats a bonus.

"language": "english", "review": "This is basically Devil May Cry with a chick. A hyper sexualized chick.\n\nStory: There isn't much of an interesting story here, it's kinda bad, like DMC 2 bad. Like... the majority of SEGA stories bad.\n\nGameplay: This is the forte of the game. There are sections which aren't polished, where it becomes obvious they just want you to struggle on this new type of enemy, but the game still manages to be fun nonetheless since you get to craft items and can continue from the last checkpoint indefinitely. \nThere is a ridiculous amount of moves and combos, but this variety and quantity comes at the price of reliability; a lot of moves are completely useless against some enemies; they don't have any stopping power, they will barely do any dmg, have limited range, etc. While it usually is fine if you get the Witch Time timing right (it slows down time when you dodge at the right moment), you wouldn't expect to have to constantly rely on it to break through some enemies defences. DMC definitely does it better (at least for this entry). The camera can also be a bit of an issue. Sometimes it's due to the size of your enemies, sometimes it's simply because off screen enemies can smack you. Then again, maybe it's me getting rusty or the fact I'm an avid DMC fan and am used to the way that THAT game plays. Also, I gotta say some enemies were rather hard to figure out, I ended up brute forcing my way through some, which isn't something you want to end up doing in a game that emphasises on skill over force. And there is a definite lack of balance between some enemies. While some are cannon fodder, some other enemies can be harder than some bosses.\nIf I stop nitpicking... All in all, it is between good to great combat! Ad to be fair, I just played DMC 5, so it's a harsh comparison. \n\nAudio: Everything is appropriate, no blaring random SFX or crazed soundtrack. But nothing great either. Also, I'm now stuck with this girly track in my head. And I REALLY want it out. \n\nGraphics: They were probably great for at the time of release and still manage to hold up okay today. Though there seems to be an overly whitey washed off filter like thing going on.\n\nI also should point out that a good chunk of the game will be spent looking at ridiculous and over the top cinematics that, for some reason, get really boring after a while. Also, I find it pretty funny that after each enemy introduction, you're just about to get smacked in the face riiiiiight when the cinematic ends. In the end, if you are looking for some difficulty and enjoy hack and slash action like DMC, this should have you covered. Just expect a short experience with little depth.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696778664, "timestamp_updated": 1696778664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147838643": {"recommendationid": "147838643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041012431", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1648517645}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1696728954, "timestamp_updated": 1696728954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147838239": {"recommendationid": "147838239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198311106757", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1676, "last_played": 1697060756}, "language": "spanish", "review": "MUY BUENO\n", "timestamp_created": 1696728287, "timestamp_updated": 1696728287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147829565": {"recommendationid": "147829565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067878386", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1696714885}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't got the slightest clue what happened but it was enjoyable enough and definitely worth a run through.

It is basically the epitome of \"violence can be beautiful,\" and celebrates being over-the-top.  You might even be surprised to find that, especially for such a genre, the story is actually one of its biggest highlights. A feature I find very uncommon in this genre. I loved this game before it made it to PC, and I am sure that I will love it again. I haven't had much chance to really replay it, but I very much look forward to when I can get back to it. It may not be perfect - like any game -  but the faults definitely get buried deep under the mountain of wonders. If you are looking for nearly non-stop action with a neat story, this is definitely a game for you.\n\n[b]Quick note on accessibility (because this is super nice for a game of its age):[/b]\nThis game is actually also quite accessible - for anyone who might be wondering -  as its difficulty levels cater to various types of players quite nicely. Easy and very easy are perfect for button-mashers who just want to get in on the action, enjoy the animation, and delve into the story. While everything higher starts to really kick it up for those combo enthusiasts and challenge seekers. Though I will warn that anyone who wishes to play actual hard mode: it does have to be unlocked through an initial regular playthrough. So any hack and slash veterans out there who are looking to get their ass handed to them right away might be a bit disappointed initially. But it will be well worth your time and effort, and definitely has replay value. Though as a saving grace to that, there are also items that actually increase the difficulty if you would like. But you will have to figure that out yourself. \n\nJust a quick tip though... I would like to suggest playing it with a controller if you can though, as it was originally meant for one. It will save you a lot of frustration~", "timestamp_created": 1696293604, "timestamp_updated": 1696293604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count":

Playing this really made me appreciate the artistic design and difficulty of older games. \n\nNow, the Bayonetta Franchise has always been sexually suggestive or erotic in its design. And this whole theme is baked into the Hack-&-Slash combat to the point that it is ridiculously comical. Its rather difficult to put into words, one has to play and see for themselves.\n \nGoing back to it being a 2009 game, I never would have expected it to have much polish as it did. For instance, when pulling a lever the developers could have made a simple low effort animation but instead they embraced the erotic theme of the game and made animations for Bayonetta to be pulling the lever as if she's performing pole-dancing. There are a few more of these animation details scattered in simple puzzle sections, although few but this really says something about the passion that went into this game's development. \n\nDespite the aforementioned theme, the game has a surprisingly engaging story. However, I won't say its that overly amazing and my personal gripe is that it left a lot of things unanswered, but it started with us the players learning about how the world works and discovering the backstory of our protagonist... then it just maintains an air of vagueness and concludes it in a ridiculous anime fashion. Honestly, I feel like the story is one of the strongest and weakest parts of the game. But maybe that's just my take on it.\n\nSo a bit more on the gameplay, the combat has a high skill ceiling if you want it to, or you could spam the same combo over and over and tank through, you can even spam items later in the game to make certain segments easier. The point is, if you get a handle on how the game works, you can press forward in your way to a certain degree. Moving on the Game has quite a few unlockables and that I doubt most casual players will ever see them and also things most avid players might not be aware of unless they look it up. Not to confuse unlockables with collectibles, this game has a few collectibles, but not enough that they overstay their welcome. But then again, that may depend on perspective. \n\nEven though I'm at the end of my Second Run, I still feel as if I haven't seen enough. When I first started this game, I thought to myself, \"It's a 2009 game, how difficult or interesting could it possibly be?\" Needless to say I was thoroughly surprised.... or maybe I'm just getting old. \n\nLastly, I feel like I haven't credited the visuals or aesthetics enough. The \"Paradiso\" Levels stood out the most to me, I suppose it was the vibrant colors. I have more to add, but that may possibly give away what the game has to offer. \n\nUnfortunately Bayonetta 2 & 3 aren't on PC and perhaps they'll never be.\n\nPS: After playing the game enough, my honest reaction was, \"THIS IS A 2009 GAME?!\"", "timestamp_created": 1695561239, "timestamp_updated": 1695569643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146932957": {"recommendationid": "146932957", "author": {"steamid": "76561199137993258", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1696272018}, "language": "english", "review": "She calls enemies 'naughty' after beating the hell outta them.", "timestamp_created": 1695561196, "timestamp_updated": 1695561196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146915876": {"recommendationid": "146915876", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977492618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1696755222}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is both very good and very bad at the same time.\n\nThe combat is excellent and the combos and weapons are great.

Every boss is a boring cinematic affair with several phases and repeating attack patterns often also having the shitty QTE at times.\n\nThe story suffers greatly from being another bland linear affair. It feels like the story has been told countless times allready, a big bad guy needs to use you for his grand designs and you run after him/her without any reflection as if it's your calling in life falling right into a trap only to fight a grand boss battle, pathetic. Even thought the story is bland the characters are somewhat memorable and likable in their own way.

Unfortunately, of the entire series of games, only this one, the first part, has been ported to PC. But at least we can get a taste of this little piece. \n\n [b][u]Storyline [/u] [/b] \n\n[b]You play as Bayonetta, 20 years after her awakening from a 500-year sleep[/b]. She is a witch, like all characters, has dementia  [i](or amnesia, whichever you prefer)[/i] and Bayonetta also has a large piece of jewelry that holds a small red gemstone, and she believes that this gemstone is the \"Left Eye of the World\". She arrives in Vigrid [i](the main city of the game)[/i] when Enzo [i](her informant)[/i] informs her of rumors that another half exists. \n\nThen she meets another witch named Jeanne, who sides with the angels, and later a young journalist named Luca; the first one is revealed to be connected to Bayonetta's past, and the second one blames Bayonetta for the death of his father. Eventually, after going part of the way in search of answers, she...blah blah, I told you about the beginning, if you want to read the whole history of this game, check out Wikipedia.\n\n[b]In my opinion, it's a wonderful story with an interesting style and twists and turns.[/b] \n\n [b][u]Gameplay [/u] [/b] \n\n [b]So, what this game is good for[/b]. Firstly, it's a very well animated and stylish slasher with a lot of epic moments, and even the appearance of ordinary enemies looks somehow unusual and mesmerizing. Lots of different finishing animations, well-designed weapons [i](not very many types though)[/i], great combo design, good bosses and regular enemies, motorcycle segments and the game can give you a good challenge\n\nI could say a lot more about this game, but like I said, for me, it's the best slasher I've played. [b]I highly recommend playing this game.[/b] \n\n [b] [u]Style[/u] [/b] \n\n [b]As I said before, it's a very stylish game[/b], with some moments similar to DMC, but the overall picture is a bit different. The game has funny and serious moments that always alternate. It's a unique cartoonish yet serious style and I love it.\n\n [b]The characters are also original[/b], from the satanic shopkeeper to the lecherous Bayonetta. It feels like they have their own lives and personality that they sometimes show.\n\n [b][u]Conclusion[/u] [/b] \n\n [b]This is a very colorful slasher with a brilliant style[/b]  [i](for adults, of course)[/i]. Nice music, well-designed gameplay, a good plot and a sexy heroine - what else do you need? The best slasher for me, at least at the moment.\n\n\n [b] [u]Score: [i][strike]Nice boobs[/strike][/i] Awesome S [/u] [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1694721344, "timestamp_updated": 1694727959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651353120803833008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146287500": {"recommendationid": "146287500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844362874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2143, "last_played": 1679348721}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best character action game franchises, this game I\u2019d say is better than DMC4 even, and has a very unique combo system.

This port runs very well and can be played on pretty modest hardware and I\u2019m pleased to see it. I\u2019d advise people who buy this game since it\u2019s a DX9 title to get a tool called specialK it\u2019d help enable VRR and reduce latency and screen tearing while adding quality-of-life stuff like reshade. One more issue this game seems to have which isn\u2019t a huge one is the higher the resolution the fewer particle effects you see on screen (I\u2019m guessing this is tied to the engine used and can\u2019t be fixed.)

However, much to my disappointment, I walked away irritated at the whole experience. \n\n(Spoilers await)\n\nMy main gripes are:\n\n* That camera control is atrocious. Not sure why there's a camera sensitivity setting, it always moves around as it wants and sometimes it goes to angles which impair your movement or ability to fight. There's this fight in Chapter 14 where the camera decided it would zoom in Bayonetta's belly button. Thanks camera. \n\nAlso why do I need to use my mouse to click on Exit in the Item menu to go back to the game?\n\n* Them QTEs, they hit you out of nowhere and the game gives you a very small time-frame to respond. Unless you already know they are there, you'll get killed a lot. \n\n* The chapters with the motorcycle, rocket airline and turrets/cannons are some of the worst things the game has to offer. They are very long, repetitive and the last two require that you move with the mouse, which is inverted. Oh yeah, and if you are prone to motion sickness the rocket section will definitely remind you of that.\n\n* You need to spam the dodge button at the end of certain cut scenes because enemies will start up attacks during the cinematic and the next thing you know you are on the floor. \n\nUnfortunately I couldn't finish the game, for whatever reason the set of 3 Space bar QTEs that happen in the first part of the epilogue decided to bug out. I get the first QTE, but the second one fails to make an appearance and I fall to my death each time. I tried to wait, to press Space bar on my own. Nope. You died. Continue? I even restarted the whole game to no avail.\n\n-------\n\nDislikes of the personal nature. maybe:\n\nStory is nonsensical. If Cereza is an impure child who \"must be kept from the path of the dark arts forever\", how was she not exiled? Or I dunno, killed? Which doesn't also go against the whole \"left eye our (Umbra Clan) most treasured possession\". How did we jump to that? Or was it that damn stone? \nIf anyone can make sense of it and explain I'm happy to change my mind.\n\nEnzo tells you stuff you already know after the prologue. By you I mean Bayonetta, he literally says \"All you remember is that you are a witch yada yada\". Lazy way of dumping exposition on us.\n\nSpeaking of Enzo, I hate him. The stereotypical Brooklyn crook, there's nothing more to his character and if the game has not rotten my memory I believe he is the first character who gets to speak. Which is not a good first impression, he talks a lot too. Double pain.\n\nSince I started on characters, there's none really, all of them are pretty much one note. Luka is an idiot and he probably lies when he says he's a journalist. He has this hatred towards Bayonetta because he believes she killed his father (By the way, the game graces us with child Luka going \"Faaaather\" and the delivery is almost on the same level as \"Father, When Can I Leave To Be On My Own?\"). Anyway, Luka never really drills into Bayo for answers, he keeps declaring she is a monster.  Ain't you supposed to be inquisitive as a journalist? And what's worse about this, Bayo never goddamn defends herself, she just sits there looking at him as if he is a retarded puppy. Its annoying because real people don't talk like this. And no, just because it's camp fest up in here doesn't excuse it for poor character dialogue. \n\nI randomly remembered that one time Bayo walked up to Luka and he thought she was going to kill him so he says: OH YOU GONNA KILL ME IN PLAIN SIGHT. And there's not a single soul around. \n\nRodin is there to attempt coolness, but to me he comes off as a try-hard. I roll my eyes every time. \nLittle Cereza has nothing going on with her. She is just cute and goes from \"cries at monsters\" to \"I will never cry again\" in the span of one cinematic where Bayo tells her to zip it. \nBalder is not a character. \n\nAnd I find it hilarious that Bayo doesn't put 2 and 2 together when it comes to Little Cereza being her. It takes a long time and only after it was spelled out to her (For example they have the same Watch) does she have a shocked Pikachu moment. Well I did at least. Given the nature of her reality a tiny her should not be something out of the realm of possibility, but not much thought is given to it.\n\nWho else is in this game, oh yes, Jeanne. Throughout the whole game she antagonizes you, gets in your way and is confirmed to work with the Angels. Only to find out at the end of the game that she is your childhood friend and was brainwashed. Oh well, very sad. Maybe if that QTE didn't abandon me so I can complete the story, I'd care a little bit more. I can't tell you a single thing about Jeanne apart from the fact that she rides a bike. Which I hate in this game. \n\nHey, how come Luka always teleports to places where you spent hours trying to get? Not counting Angels, some areas require magic to traverse.\n\n------\n\nAnyway, I wish this game was better.", "timestamp_created": 1694187791, "timestamp_updated": 1694187868, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145897208": {"recommendationid": "145897208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119771244", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1694135260}, "language": "english", "review": "BIG ASS 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1694156174, "timestamp_updated": 1694156174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145877415": {"recommendationid": "145877415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043849223", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1492815485}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game that doesn't take itself too seriously.", "timestamp_created": 1694122992, "timestamp_updated": 1694122992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145865458": {"recommendationid": "145865458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048257149", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 775, "last_played": 1624548998}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Fly me to the moon \nLet me dance among the stars \nLet me see what spring is like \nOn Jupiter and Mars \nIn other words, hold my hand \nIn other words, darling, kiss me", "timestamp_created": 1694108848, "timestamp_updated": 1694108848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145844789": {"recommendationid": "145844789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127039196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1694216472}, "language": "english", "review": "classic game that i never played because i never had a console growing up. now i have a pc i can play all these things i only ever saw on YT let's plays/videos. if u love fast pace action like DMC then this is def it. it's fun. its got humour. its got a great looking leading lady. yeah its old school but that's the charm of it. does not take itself seriously.", "timestamp_created": 1694085237, "timestamp_updated": 1694085237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145825503": {"recommendationid": "145825503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115243825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1694178081}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it immediately!

And had even played some of the creator's other games like DMC. Now I had heard a lot about this franchise and how the character was overly sexualized. Which I believe is an unfair accusation as while Bayonetta is confidant, flirty, and extra. She never really overdoes it with the sex appeal. If anything the creators were very faithful to the source material of European witches. Especially regarding the power of their hair and how their freedom and confidence led many to condemn them to a grim fate. \n\nIn fact Bayonetta while a tease is also capable of very genuine emotional moments, platonic moments, and generally maternal moments toward a particular little girl that I will not spoil. The music is very memorable so much so that Fly Me To The Moon is now stuck in my head. The characters are very well executed and realized. The combat is fluid, fast paced, rewarding, and punishing. The humor is very solid and does not miss. I especially enjoyed the dance number at the end of the game.\n\nFor as much praise as I have for the game I would stress that despite this port being old it requires a competent laptop or desktop setup. My computer has only 128MB of VRAM. Thankfully, I never had lag during gameplay. Though more than a few cutscenes stuttered and some never played at all. There were crashes to and some getting use to the controls. In fact I died quite a bit on the QTEs as by default the UI indicator is turned off for them in the options menu.

refreshingly brilliant action gem from platinum games.\n\nThe good:\n\nAstoundingly good animation for the main character\nResponsive combat I have experienced\nMore style than a t-rex wearing a skin-tight leather jumpsuit while riding a motorcycle fighting cyborgs to electro swing\n\nThe bad:\nYou can see where the budget was limited\nGross timed sections do not fit the style of combat they made at all\n\nThe ugly:\nThe game has crashed on me\nI have run into audio bugs that kept me from hearing dialogue/sound effects\nI have run into a weird bug where the UI turns itself off, leading to you endlessly failing QTEs unless you realize what happened.\n\nThoughts:\nI had to stop playing to write a review.  This game was like a slap to the face, making me wake up and realize I have been wasting my time playing crap games.  After so many games were filled with areas without gameplay, empty worlds, and a slow pace meant to cover up a lack of storytelling, this was a breath of fresh air\n\nThis game screams old school SEGA, and has that kind of game design where it feels like the devs embraced every moment of the game as an opportunity to impress the player.  When you were young and played Genesis games like Streets of Rage, do you remember how every little bit of it was astounding?  The music was rocking, the combat was brilliant, the graphics were like an arcade, and the style was infectiously overflowing.\n\nThis tops that.\n\nI am not sure where to begin, but the first thing that struck me was probably the music.  The track in the prologue is an up-tempo club cover of \"Fly Me To The Moon.\"  I think that really sets the scene for the level of quality and style this game aims for - and achieves.  That song was so good I paused the game to listen to it.\n\nThe next thing that struck me was probably the voice acting.  This is some of the t h i c k e s t cheese you will hear in voice acting, and oh my god is it delicious.  Yes I pause buffered typing that word in real life for emphasis.  I flipping love games that lean this hard into style, and this is probably the most style I have seen since Jet Set Radio.  The voice acting sounds like every line was re-recorded until it was dripping with gravitas and an absolutely lovely amount of suave elegance.  Every character sounds like they are trying to drop your pants faster than 10 shots of whiskey, and so far everyone has nailed it.  The dialogue writing matches the ridiculously hammy delivery from the voice actors.  This is a pill of joy in a world that seems to have forgotten that video games should SOUND fun.\n\nThe next thing that hit me was certainly the combat.  How are there this many animations?  How does every button press smoothly initiate a combo into exactly what I wished would happen?  Oh my god this is so responsive it is mind boggling.  How much time did the animators spend making sure every little transition was smoother than melted butter?  This is surely where the majority of the budget went, the only game I have played with animations that were this good was Monster Hunter World - and that was far slower paced.\n\nLooking at the game you may think it looks dated - and at times, particularly in stills, it does.  Because this is from freaking 2009.  HOW IS THIS FROM 2009?  I have seen others play Bayonetta before, and while watching I always noticed the poor old school lighting engine and the ugly colors of the flashback scenes.  While actually playing the game though, all you can notice is how good it looks in motion.  Trees and grass blow in the wind, leaves gently fall from branches, Bayonetta's costume flows through the air, who puts this much effort into games anymore?  This game looks far far better while playing it than it does in screenshots, and though I have played games like that before I have never played another where the difference was so large - and the screenshots don't even look bad, they just have poor lighting.\n\nAll the gushing over the game aside (and I am really cutting the gushing short), you do notice that the game has a somewhat limited budget.  I have no idea how they could afford to animate every little detail while playing the game, but had to resort to some still cuts in cutscenes.  These stills did not bother me as they still oozed style in an almost comic-book fashion, but it was a tad jarring after the game absolutely f l o w s in motion - or at least the main character does.  The enemies have some pretty janky animations and it took me far longer than it should have to realize some of those are supposed to be \"blocking\" animations.\n\nI keep running into some really weird bugs where the game changes important settings on its own - like muting sound, or disabling the UI.  When this bug coincides with a cutscene it can be especially frustrating - my UI was working, a cutscene started so I was not concerned when the UI went away, and then I had no flipping idea a QTE was happening because the game had decided to turn the UI off.\n\nI really hate the timed sections.  The combat the devs made pairs really poorly with this.  The timed sections force you to attack multiple enemies at once, but then if any one of those enemies blocks it can literally kill your entire attempt.  Fortunately the game lets you restart at the beginning of those sections, but it would be better if they just put some more effort into the design of them.  It would also be better if they let you restart the sections from the pause menu.  As it is, you will get blocked by an enemy you didn't see do the animation, and then just have to stand still and wait for enemies to kill you.\n\nFinally, the game has straight out crashed on me.  Oof.\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives by far, but it is really weird having these large negatives existing in a polished game.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you like action games, buy this.  If you like games that ooze style, buy this.  Do not buy this for a child, you are going to get some brief booty shots and suggestive dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1692847221, "timestamp_updated": 1693760987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521072804927825928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144858632": {"recommendationid": "144858632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361741619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1693320381}, "language": "english", "review": "1", "timestamp_created": 1692799676, "timestamp_updated": 1692799676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144836266": {"recommendationid": "144836266", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029102727", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1692771543}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Combat in this game is amazing and allows for extensive replay-ability\n+ Cutscenes and voice acting are solid\n+ Challenging game, especially for me as I suck at videogames, sometimes frustrating but overall you feel positive after conquering something difficult\n\n- Camera control was a bit of a nightmare, felt like I was constantly battling it and perhaps there is some way to fix it, but not an obvious way", "timestamp_created": 1692771768, "timestamp_updated": 1692771768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144765887": {"recommendationid": "144765887", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067199116", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "playtime_at_review": 111, "last_played": 1700789399}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty well done port! The graphics look pretty impressive still for a 2009 game, even without any extra shaders installed. There is also a pretty active modding scene as well with lots of custom skins and even some ports of Bayo 2 + 3 skins. I would say out of every Bayo game, this one is my favorite story and gameplay wise. However be warned the gameplay can start out to be very challenging and you're kinda supposed to grinding the same missions as you get better and upgrade Bayonetta with more moves and weapons. Overall the medal system is very unforgiving even on the default difficulty, if you are a perfectionist kind of player. Really the only gripe I have with this game is a few of the chapters try to switch up the regular gameplay with some really crappy mini games and..certain enemies..genuinely will make you want to smash your keyboard because of their difficulty spike.

As others mention the camera is frustrating and is often nowhere near where you need it to be but that's just how the game plays. In true Bayonetta fashion you're not always going to really see when an enemy is about to hit you in the chaos so just listen to the telltale audio queue to warn you. However this is made a little more difficult than usual because:\n\nThis port is not the best way to play this game on PC. Comparatively, this version's audio sounds a bit washed out due to the way they virtualized the surround sound, there are inexplicable framerate dips and stutters during camera pans when there's no action going on. The visual quality is a bit blurry aside from the Xbox 360 era low-framerate blur effects used in this game (I wish they properly remastered these), and even though 19:10 resolutions are supported (and ultrawide appropriately applies letterboxes to the sides) some scenes are simply too zoomed in compared to other versions.\n\nOverall it's a good game but not the best version you can play. I would ask for the sequels on PC but I probably wouldn't play them for long unless they were a proper remaster and not a slightly laggy no-frills console port.", "timestamp_created": 1691809661, "timestamp_updated": 1691809661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143920604": {"recommendationid": "143920604", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203168572", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 958, "last_played": 1694302037}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good you shud totali play it but only downside is it too short i hope they will bring bayonetta 2 and 3", "timestamp_created": 1691780723, "timestamp_updated": 1691780723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143917163": {"recommendationid": "143917163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887571637", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1694779171}, "language": "english", "review": "I Forget have this game..\nBuy in 2020,  played  in 2023 \n\nSuper [h1] Boing-Boing [/h1] Bayonetta .", "timestamp_created": 1691778105, "timestamp_updated": 1691778105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60335153341293335", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143850791": {"recommendationid": "143850791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116234878", "num_games_owned": 1911, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1553478117}, "language": "english", "review": "i button mashed my whole way through and had a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1691735362, "timestamp_updated": 1691735362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143843019": {"recommendationid": "143843019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292051312", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 538, "last_played": 1691819991}, "language": "english", "review": "awsome thank you dani yell", "timestamp_created": 1691729710, "timestamp_updated": 1691729710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143818897": {"recommendationid": "143818897", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101255539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1699118379}, "language": "spanish", "review": "God obra maestra 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1691709557, "timestamp_updated": 1691709557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143779566": {"recommendationid": "143779566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813855891", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1642999374}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like DMC with softcore porn.\n\n[b] The Positives: [/b]\n+ Easier to get into than DMC3\n+ Better looking than Bayonetta 3 (Yeah I said it)\n+ Great gameplay with a deep combo system\n+ Epic boss fights\n+ Good story\n+ Awesome ending\n+ Lovely soundtrack\n+ Bayonetta herself\n\n[b] The Negatives: [/b]\n- The motocycle sequence kinda sucks\n- The camera can get in the way sometimes\n- Grace and Glory (The two most annoying enemies in the game)\n\n[b] Final Verdict: [/b] Perfect game for leg fetish people, totally worth it for everyone else.

The style of gameplay is engaging and the graphics are outstanding when taken in context with the era of gaming they were developed in.  I cannot wait to play deeper into Bayonetta and experience the full storyline.\n\n==========\n\nI have amended my review of Bayonetta after I managed to wade through the single digit FPS performance and crashes to get to the graphics settings in the game that were causing all the problems for me.\n\nTurning off the HDR and Vertical Sync in the very bottom of the graphics settings fixed the following problems that were stonewalling me from enjoying playing Bayonetta:\n\nWhen I first ran the game the first cutscene with combat ran with missing models and invisible weapons.  About halfway through the first cutscene the game crashed.  I was able to get to the first actual combat sequence after I restarted the game and completed through to the next cutscene.  After that cutscene the game showed a highway or street and would not proceed through to the next section of the game.  It did not lockup or freeze because I could bring up the game menus with no problem.  It just refused to load into the next area or play whatever the next cutscene was supposed to be.\nDoing research online regarding this game's issues shows a deluge of problems with running this game on new Windows platforms and no clear, single solution to get it to run properly or even at all.  After attempting the \"compatibility mode for Windows #\" the game refused to launch or the graphics were extremely slow (single digit FPS).  And this was after I made sure all my graphics and other hardware drivers were up to date.\nShame because it looked and played like it was going to be a fun experience.  Hopefully the developers provide some update that will allow it to run on new systems.\n\nI understand that this is now a 6 year old game, and even older console title that was ported to PC; but, having HDR and Vertical Sync enabled running on hardware designed specifically for these kind of technologies, should not result in missing models, single digit FPS or crashes.", "timestamp_created": 1691467779, "timestamp_updated": 1691471689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143593353": {"recommendationid": "143593353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374117541", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 990, "last_played": 1691420142}, "language": "english", "review": "BAYONETTA IS A VIBE I LOVE IT SO MUCH", "timestamp_created": 1691420200, "timestamp_updated": 1691420200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626032412052154541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143590439": {"recommendationid": "143590439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838933120", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1413, "last_played": 1691376997}, "language": "english", "review": "Bayonetta definitivamente \u00e9 um jogo maravilhoso, gameplay fluida, combos f\u00e1ceis de aprender, sistemas de armas e presets decente.

The voice acting is horrible and the music will make your ears bleed. The story is horrible and the bipolar nature of the characters is rather idiotic as they go from serious to cheesy before your eyes.\n\nIn Bayonetta, you play as the title character, who is an Umbran Witch. Bayonetta's story is decent, however, the presentation is horrendous. Every character, other than Bayonetta, has little to no character development. Graphically Bayonetta is an average game. There's the music: I swear that the same song gets played over and over to the point where it gets stuck in my head, and haunts me to this day. Having the same music on repeat makes you feel like you're stuck in some pseudodisco time vortex that not even Bayonetta's command of space time can help you escape from.\n\nIts just Devil May Cry

Bayonetta follows the adventures of Cereza, a member of the Umbra Witches, as she battles an ambitious order of angels using stiletto mounted guns, kinky magic, and demons summoned using her hair.\n\nThe premise is of course bonkers but Kamiya is not known for subtlety and things only escalate from there. The game is outrageous from start to finish with musical numbers, gratuitous sexualisation, torturing foes with kink equipment, and tongue in cheek flirtations throughout. Without a doubt the game ends up being far more sexploitation than representation but we're not here to discuss feminism.\n\nGameplay offers a plethora of A and B combos, weakened foes can be pulled into button mashing events that torture and execute them, and dodging attacks rewards you with 'witch time', a mode that slows everything down and multiplies your combo. Your performance is scored with a letter grade at the end of each stage so you're encouraged to experiment and engage with all the mechanics. The boss fights are the biggest shows the game has to put on with all of the usual gameplay turned up to eleven none of which bored me, but there are long slogs of angels to carve through between them. \n\nThe storyline is confusingly intricate and sets the tone with anime tropes a-plenty but the pacing can be all over the place. You start with a musical number, arena fight, a comic book intro, and then dive into the main story. It makes for a bumpy introduction but after that it starts to gain some consistency. \n\nThis is a game with spectacle at its core, it's eager to entertain but combat can get samey and beyond the sexualisation the game doesn't have much substance. Making an angel orgasm to death gets a bit tedious after the first few times. Overall you're in for quite a ride but, like your sexuality, unless you're pushing yourself to experiment you might end up stuck in tedious repetition with nothing encouraging you to try anything else.", "timestamp_created": 1690327310, "timestamp_updated": 1690327310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142779962": {"recommendationid": "142779962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198862284817", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1693760506}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1690305014, "timestamp_updated": 1690305014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142760660": {"recommendationid": "142760660", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241283846", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "playtime_at_review": 2045, "last_played": 1700026178}, "language": "english", "review": "She's iconic, she's everything, she's amazing, show-stopping, the original, never seen before, tantalizing-", "timestamp_created": 1690287552, "timestamp_updated": 1690287552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142733467": {"recommendationid": "142733467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819481028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1671293316}, "language": "english", "review": "tall lady make my brain go \"yippee\"", "timestamp_created": 1690245210, "timestamp_updated": 1690245210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142678039": {"recommendationid": "142678039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009424189", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1534563727}, "language": "english", "review": "Was not a huge fan of this game.

With its fluid gameplay, intricate combo system, and confident portrayal of its titular character, Bayonetta stands as a true masterpiece in the action genre.\n\nOne of the standout features of Bayonetta is its remarkable combat system. Controlling the agile and powerful witch herself, players are treated to an exhilarating display of acrobatic moves, devastating attacks, and seamless combos.

Bayonetta's fast-paced and responsive combat system makes every encounter a joy to experience.\n\nThe game's stylish presentation is another highlight.

The character design, with Bayonetta's iconic attire and hair-based magical attacks, is visually striking and adds a distinct flair to the combat. The visual effects and animations are beautifully rendered, creating a visually stunning spectacle that perfectly complements the gameplay.\n\nBayonetta's story, while often filled with over-the-top and nonsensical elements, adds to the game's charm and appeal. The narrative takes players on a wild ride through a world of angels, demons, and secret societies, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns along the way. The writing strikes a balance between humor, absurdity, and moments of genuine depth, creating an engaging and memorable experience.\n\nFurthermore, Bayonetta's confident portrayal as a strong and empowered female protagonist is commendable. She defies traditional gender roles, exuding charisma, and commanding respect with her skills and abilities. Bayonetta's character is more than just her sexuality; she is a capable and complex individual, and the game treats her with the respect she deserves.\n\nThe game's difficulty level may be seen as a drawback for some players. Bayonetta can be challenging, especially during boss battles, requiring precise timing and mastery of the combat system. However, for those seeking a rewarding and intense gameplay experience, the high level of difficulty only adds to the satisfaction of conquering each encounter.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayonetta is an amazing game that excels in delivering sexy and stylish combat, pushing the boundaries of the action genre.

Hay varios aspectos a tener en cuenta si te pinta comprar y pasarte o no este jueguito. Lo primero es el juego mas japones que jugue, mas japones que el anime y es mucho, la intro y algunas partes tienen el mismo sentido que tiene conectar uuna 4090 en un Dual Core. Es un juego exclusivamente enfocado en el gameplay y en el culo de Bayonneta. No vengas buscando una historia super profunda porque tiene de profundo lo mismo que un charco. Juego muy muy random pero divertido es esa clase de juego que te jugas si estas mas al pedo que bocina de avion y en 2 o 3 noches de vicio te lo das vuelta. Ni hablemos de platinar estos juegos porque tenes que estar demasiado al pedo o ser cristo en la tierra y probablemente seas el  primer caso . Cosas negativas a descartar es la falta absoluta y total de un hilo argumental coherente o dicho en espa\u00f1ol que todo tiene el mismo sentido que apagar fuego con kerozen y hay alguna que otra stage que te da cancer auditivo y visual.

I was interested in the story and the enemy design, so that worked out.\nThen there is the combat. Let's start out with the inputs, why am I asked to hadouken? You end up preforming special attacks randomly in hectic fights. \nWhile we're in the realm of random, you can control the camera...sometimes. Often it snaps back to a \"view\" of it's own choosing completely disorienting in the middle of crowded combat scenes. There is a lock on option but it requires you to hold down the R2 (on 'X' controllers) making an awkward hold just to see what you are fighting without the camera deciding that the real action is half way up a flight of stairs you didn't even knew existed. That doesn't matter though, because R2 is also a hot key for making those shoryukens simpler, making both uses cancel each other out. \nMario Party analog stick destroyer special attack, moving on.\nThere is both combat trophy's and no way to restart a fight without either dying, which kills the trophy reward, or restart the entire chapter over again, irregardless of chapter progress. That combined with surprise mechanics that I can only assume you were either expected to already know what new quick-times, movement, and special attacks specific to that one instance and never seen again, or, memorize the game and play it over again with that knowledge. The latter of those two assumes you would want to play it a second time, making the dev team hold the game in a higher regard then anyone who has played it.\nTrophy's a secondary challenge to have fun with? No. The bonus currency you obtain can be used at the shop for items, (which the game penalizes you for using), new attacks, and most importantly accessories that give access to special buffs and/or abilities. Fresh play though? Yea, good luck with that. Being unable to reset the encounter means you only have one chance to get it right. If you die at any point in a chapter you've lost the end of chapter award. If you've used any item at all in a chapter you will also be heavily penalized. \nYou cannot remap controllers in game. \nLeft stick click drops picked up weapons. In a fast paced fight where you are dodging and moving frantically, guess which activation you are constantly accidentally inputting. I had to turn off the function in the controller software.\nAs I progressed I kept noticing that the community achievements getting lower and lower percentages. I should have put the pieces together much sooner than I did.\nYou leave with two possible emotions, frustrated anger, or a better understanding of the feeling of apathy.

The game rewards players for chaining together combos and dodging attacks with well-timed moves, creating a fluid and satisfying experience.

The dialogue is well-written and often humorous, adding to the game's charm.\n\nVisually, Bayonetta is stunning, with detailed environments and character models. The game's art style is unique and memorable, with a mix of Gothic and futuristic elements that give it a distinct personality.\n\nHowever, the game's difficulty can be a turnoff for some players. Bayonetta can be punishingly difficult, with challenging boss fights and a steep learning curve. The game's checkpoints can also be frustratingly far apart, forcing players to repeat large sections of the game after dying.\n\nOverall, Bayonetta is a fantastic action game that offers a thrilling combat system, engaging story, and unique visuals.

Rather than mashing buttons, Bayonetta really rewards proper input timings.This pushes the skill levels required to beat the game by a significant margin. With skilled play being an absolute sight to behold. \n\nCombat in general is not as fast as DMC as I mentioned before its far more metered and paced. Bayonetta dances across the battlefield and uses the tempo of her strikes in a performative manner. It must be stated again, button mashing will not get you very far. The vareity of weapons allow you to choose how she controls with the ability to strap weapons to each limb allowing you to customize how she moves and fights. Varying from Skating around the battlefield and harrying foes with a whip. Standing tall and slicing foes with a Longsword or just going whole hog and strapping a rocket launcher to each limb. Needless to say its a blast to experiment and find what you really click with.\n\nThe enemies are all super cool, each one has a custom intro and as Bayonetta damages she literally smashes them apart causing chunks of the enemies to tumble off and expose a raw fleshy body beneath the marble like skin of the angelic enemies.\n\nBoss fights are the highlight of any action game and Bayonetta puts on a damn clinic. Initial bosses are big stompy enemies that surprise you with their scale and yet as the game goes on it starts throwing in whole bosses as basic enemies in later levels. Fighting 3 copies of the first boss at the same time and absolutely crushing the lot of them really lends to the player feeling like a hurricane with heels on. Proper boss encounters are rare but man are they good. The game will dedicate whole levels to just the boss fight, and they have to be seen to believed.\n\nThe story in this game is kinda bad. In fact at certain points its kinda nonsensical but whatever, we are here for Bayonetta to smash angels and demons and mug at the camera. But yea the story is whatever. Characters are all fun but the story they occupy isn't very well told.(also the production value of the cut-scenes is kinda embarrassing) But again not of that matters honestly the games good points really outshine this little flaw.\n\nThe music is absolutely cash. Its perfect.\n\nIts possible you may get tired of the main theme. but I never did. I always felt my excitement rise when it started playing. The entire soundtrack fits with the epic heaven and hell themes quite well but for me its the few jazz tunes that help fill the OST with such personality.\n\nThe Scoring and medal systems gives the game a great arcade feel, and the variety of moves, weapons, outfits, and additional difficulties makes the game a great value.\n\n\nOverall its a must play, with only the story being the real kinda \"downside\" but as I stated before. The character action on display here is positively insane. And so much fun.\n\nTL:DR Quite possibly the greatest character action game ever made.\n", "timestamp_created": 1687403466, "timestamp_updated": 1687403466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140471768": {"recommendationid": "140471768", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260314599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1698701232}, "language": "english", "review": "yay", "timestamp_created": 1687398067, "timestamp_updated": 1687398067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140464739": {"recommendationid": "140464739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406158953", "num_games_owned": 591, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1687397353}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego, bastante dif\u00edcil tener que jugar con una sola mano 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1687385437, "timestamp_updated": 1687385437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140464395": {"recommendationid": "140464395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158793828", "num_games_owned": 822, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1651236618}, "language": "english", "review": "SLAAAAAAAYYYYYY QUEEN", "timestamp_created": 1687384865, "timestamp_updated": 1687384865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942358255386353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140448535": {"recommendationid": "140448535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260671211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1643331946}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1687363845, "timestamp_updated": 1687363845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140407965": {"recommendationid": "140407965", "author": {"steamid": "76561199039642905", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 667, "last_played": 1687293708}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my go to games.", "timestamp_created": 1687293745, "timestamp_updated": 1687293745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140375829": {"recommendationid": "140375829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024279441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1687306769}, "language": "english", "review": "My comments echo much of what has been said here. Camera makes things more difficult than they need to be, performance on my system was poor in spots, quick time events can be frustrating (I know this was a big thing in gaming when Bayonetta was made and it hasn't aged well). I'd like to add that much of what you'll do in this game is in cutscenes. A cut scene will start, Bayonetta will do all kinds of cool stuff, and then, after a few minutes, gameplay resumes. It feels like being led by the hand through much of the game (quick time events don't help that).\n\nPersonally (and I don't expect this to apply to younger gamers), my impression of combat was that it was fast-paced but confusing. I spent most of the game dodging and spamming the same combos that I knew I could perform reliably. Your mileage may vary on this one.

Mommy? sorry. [/h1]\n\nThe 2010 release of Bayonetta was a shockingly good entry by Platinum Games.   Hideki Kamiya\u2019s vision for an action hack and slash title starring the titular character, Bayonetta, was praised as the game offered exquisite combat and fantastic presentation in terms of visuals and sound design.  While the game was originally launched on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Nintendo picked up the baton with a sequel for their ailing Wii U console.  PC gamers have been the only ones left out in the cold when it comes to Bayonetta, but it got released on pc later on and it\u2019s the absolute definitive version of this game, as this is no shoddy port.\n\nThe original console versions of the game weren\u2019t perfect when it came to performance, but Bayonetta on PC just might be. It\u2019s plainly obvious that some care was given to this port, giving PC gamers plenty of options to tweak in terms of visual settings like Shadow Quality, Texture Quality, Anti-Aliasing, HDR Support, 4K Resolution, and more. For most modern PC gamers, you\u2019re going to be able to experience an incredible looking version of this game, when compared to the original 720p release. The original Bayonetta, from an art design standpoint, was incredible.  Ramping up the visual capabilities and options with the PC version of the game only accentuate this aspect of Bayonetta. For those that are Mouse and Keyboard faithful, you\u2019ll also be happy to know that Bayonetta supports that as well.  SEGA and Platinum definitely get some points here for being so attentive to the things that PC gamers demand with this port.\n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t perfect in the regards mentioned above, Bayonetta is still an incredible game on its own.  Jumping back into it for the first time in a while, Bayonetta is a joy to play.  The story is over-the-top crazy, the combat is fantastic, and the presentation is second to none.  If you\u2019ve never played Bayonetta before, and have even a relatively capable PC this is the way to experience one of the best hack and slash titles of all time.  Even a better part of a decade later, the combat holds up to anything that\u2019s come after it.  Bayonetta simply is a must play for fans of the genre.\n\nMost of the praise above is for those that have played the game in some form over the years.  What about for those who haven\u2019t yet played Bayonetta?  Bayonetta is basically Devil May Cry at the lofty heights of the series with a layer of style added to that.  It features an easy to learn, hard to master, combat system that allows players to stylishly battle through a story of angels and demons. Players can peform complex combo strings, using melee attacks, guns, and shape-shifting special powers that the heroine learns throughout the course of the game.  Bayonetta\u2019s combat flow is remarkable through all of the options available to players.  Most importantly is how dynamic it is, and coupled with a scoring system that rewards you with medals for each level, it provides good replay value in that regard.\n\nThe story of Bayonetta is certainly unconventional if not downright weird.  You could say the same about some of the gameplay mechanics as well.  It\u2019s really a story better left to be experienced by the player, but the gist of it is that Bayonetta is a witch who awakens from a 500-year slumber who has no recollection of who she is and what role she plays in a battle between Lumen Sages and Umbra Witches.  She encounters numerous colorful characters along the way as the plot of the game unfolds over its 10-12 hour run time.  You quickly start to learn that Bayonetta has some pretty incredible powers, even if they are somewhat strange.

If you plan to quickly run through the story, the game might not be bad for you.

Nothing makes sense, and nothing is explained.\n- The design of most locations appears colorless and boring.\n- Repetitive fights with the same enemies again and again. [spoiler] You have to defeat Jeanne four times for each difficulty, resulting in a total of [b]twenty[/b] fights with Jeanne if you plan to unlock all content. [/spoiler]\n- Reusage of locations. The game is not big by itself, but you still need to go through the same locations, just changed a little bit.\n- To unlock all weapons, you need to beat [b]each[/b] difficulty. Beating a higher difficulty does not unlock the weapons from lower difficulties.\n- Poor currency balance. Even after completing the game on all difficulties, you won't have enough currency to buy everything from the shop.\n- Almost no healing through each level.\n- The game lacks a crafting tutorial. It only mentions in text that you can craft items from materials. The crafting system is essential for higher difficulties, and it is not obvious how to use it if you skipped the text.\n\nIf your main goal is to experience the story and get to know the characters, I highly recommend you to start with the easiest difficulty level, playing through it quickly, and not spending too much time on it.", "timestamp_created": 1685973786, "timestamp_updated": 1685973786, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455172419548034668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139576361": {"recommendationid": "139576361", "author": {"steamid": "76561199469792518", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1271, "playtime_at_review": 1600, "last_played": 1700774303}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Mi juego favorito y con diferencia", "timestamp_created": 1685942066, "timestamp_updated": 1685942066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139567244": {"recommendationid": "139567244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994988988", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1695422811}, "language": "english", "review": "A hot witch with no memory literally", "timestamp_created": 1685923167, "timestamp_updated": 1685923167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139561956": {"recommendationid": "139561956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216253655", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2078, "last_played": 1673286073}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing for a decent amount of hours and getting all the achievements i can confidently say that everyone should give Bayonetta a try. \n\nBad ass witch awaken from a slumber, confused about everything but decides to go with the idea of smacking angels in the face with style and all the charm in the world, using her witch techniques with glamour to summon mad demons to fight alongside her, but don't worry she can deal some heavy punching too, equipped with amazing weapons from guns, swords, whips and more she slays the battlefield with style.

I didn't feel like I was having that Video game fatigue anymore. The  music, the Art, THE GAMEPLAY  is genuinely so so fun. The game has everything from a brilliantly written story with heart and mystique to excellently made cinematics and characters. The game also has great replayability options. The game may feel quite old in the graphics department, but this game is without a doubt probably the best game i have ever played yet. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU LOVE GAMING!

Literally can't even relax during the final boss's Sephiroth Supernova Galaxy journey because if I don't pull up on the controller like I'm Sully landing his airplane in the Hudson River, I'm going to clip the last pixel of Saturn's rings and have to restart. Maybe if you pressed X while I was talking, you wouldn't be trash.\n\nBullet Time, you trash. Not when you work, I mean the game's balanced around Bullet Time!  But developing the game around Bullet Time and Dodge Offsets, then taking it away unannounced in late game boss fights and *then* for the entirety of the Infinite Climax difficulty in the most arbitrary, artificial form of 'making the game harder' I have seen in quite some time. \n\nMainstream reviews, if I ever read \"Bayonetta is one of the only games with both a 40/40 in Famitsu and 10/10 in Edge\" again I'm gonna lose my mind. I never want to see Bayonetta mentioned with The Legend of Zelda ever again, or I'm gonna lose my mind. Not in the same sentence, not in the same paragraph, not in the same essay. Unless of course, that's followed up with \"and we regret that decision every single day, because Bayonetta is trash.\"\n\nNow I deserve to be copypasta, I'm not disagreeing with the decision the internet's about to make, because I played you for nearly thirty hours. But this game was not my fault. So, I'll be reposted and then go to a different game in this genre. Maybe Devil May Cry 5, maybe Hi-Fi Rush, something, anything that isn't this! But for now I'm out, cause Bayonetta, y'all trash.", "timestamp_created": 1684675433, "timestamp_updated": 1684675433, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499710053205490112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138673428": {"recommendationid": "138673428", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121068204", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 636, "last_played": 1687354028}, "language": "english", "review": "mommy", "timestamp_created": 1684660432, "timestamp_updated": 1684660432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138673282": {"recommendationid": "138673282", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044153792", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1683332191}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll admit that I bought this because Bayonetta is hot, but it's actually really fun and I love some of the mechanics here.", "timestamp_created": 1684660254, "timestamp_updated": 1684660254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138669854": {"recommendationid": "138669854", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073004813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1687855980}, "language": "english", "review": "PC port is poorly optimized.

The one thing that killed my enjoyment at many points however was the gameplay. I'm not new to brawler style beat-em up style games, but the amount of times this game would throw the one variety of enemy that is extremely agile and blocked most attacks unless in witch time, and had some of the most erratic and unstable attack patterns I have seen in a game like this. Granted, a lot of those encounters were in optional areas but even still, the difficulty should be based on a players ability to learn and improve, but a lot of this challenge was more based on luck of attack pattern since there was no good indicator as to whether they would attack once or do their chain combo. I understand this is an older game but having just finished on normal and now seeing the inclusion of even more of this one enemy type on hard mode, I just cant be bothered to keep going. If you want to really enjoy this game just play on easy even if you are better at beat-em ups with how janky some of the dodges feel and sometimes wont even trigger the dodge mechanic about 90% of the time.

Developed by PlatinumGames and published by Sega, the game is a hack-and-slash action game that combines fast-paced combat with a captivating story and stunning visuals.\n\nOne of the things that immediately struck me about Bayonetta was its visual style. The game's character designs are absolutely breathtaking, with Bayonetta herself being one of the most iconic and memorable characters in gaming history. Her sleek, black outfit and flowing, magical hair are instantly recognizable, and her confidence and sassiness are unmatched.\n\nBut the game's visuals go far beyond just its character designs. The environments are detailed and intricate, with a mix of gothic and futuristic elements that create a unique and unforgettable world. The game's use of color and lighting is also excellent, with vibrant colors and dynamic lighting effects that add depth and atmosphere to each level.\n\nOf course, visuals alone do not make a great game. Thankfully, Bayonetta also excels in its gameplay. The combat is fast-paced, fluid, and incredibly satisfying. Bayonetta has a vast array of moves and abilities at her disposal, from shooting enemies with her guns to using her hair as a weapon. The game's combo system is deep and rewarding, allowing players to chain together moves in creative and stylish ways.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate about Bayonetta's combat system is its accessibility. While the game can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, the combat is always intuitive and easy to pick up. This allows players of all skill levels to enjoy the game and feel like they are in control of the action.\n\nBut Bayonetta isn't just a mindless hack-and-slash game. The game's story is complex and intriguing, with a mix of religious and supernatural elements that create a fascinating world. The game's characters are all well-written and memorable, with Bayonetta herself being a standout. Her confidence and sassiness are matched by her vulnerability and depth, making her a truly unforgettable character.\n\nIn addition to its single-player campaign, Bayonetta also features a variety of extra modes and challenges that add to the game's replayability. The game's online leaderboards allow players to compete against each other for high scores, while the game's various difficulty modes offer a true challenge for even the most experienced players.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayonetta is an exceptional game that deserves all the praise and admiration it has received. The game's stunning visuals, engaging combat, and captivating story all combine to create a truly unforgettable experience.

Everyone always talks about Dark Souls being hard but this is definitely much more difficult, and the game is much more unfair. Dodging feels much worse and the enemies don't telegraph their attacks well enough, especially when there's a lot going on screen and you can't really see what is going on. The boss fights are also super long so you are definitely going to die or burn through all of your items getting to the next phase and trying to learn. So after the super long fights were you've died a bunch of times you then get rewarded with a stone award for dying a couple of times, maybe even to quick time events that are one hit deaths.

I can tell you that it's a 6/10 when played \"normally\" (not looking for portals and secrets) and less than a 3/10 when doing that.\n\nThe amount of mechanics that gets thrown in this game and never gets fully fleshed out or balanced is astounding. Lots of the times you just wanna feel the combat loop that this game has to offer, which is pretty decent, and you get constantly interrupted by:\nQTE\nCutscenes\nUNSKIPPABLE Cutscenes\nEntire levels that are extremely tedious and don't bring any value to the game.\n\nAnd by the end of the game it's gonna feel more like a chore than anything else.\nAfter that, if we consider the fact that:\n\nPortals are also EXTREMELY TEDIOUS to find(constant backtracking and having to go back at the start just before some cutscenes that will not allow you to backtrack.\n\nInfinite Climax, the hardest mode, is NOT BALANCED IN THE SLIGHTEST with the gameplay loop, forcing costant fire enemies, which can only be killed with ONE specific weapon, enemies that will spam THE LIVING SHIT out of attacks because you have no access to witch time, and the last fight being more of an absolute Chore/Pain in the ass again, without witch time, really makes you realize that Kamiya never wanted to learn from his mistakes and will constantly try to make the same game without even playing it.\n\nIn short, I'm sad to say it but I don't recommend this game, especially full price.

Buy it NOWW.\n\nI may be a little biased towards this game, but don't let that change your mind. This was my first ever hack and slash game I ever picked up, and i did it on a whim while it was on a sale, and may i say it was the best 5$ i have ever spent in my entire life. \n\nWhile I love this Bayonetta and her franchise, it isn't exactly perfect, and this game isn't no exception.\nThese are my only complaints from a gameplay standpoint:\n1. The QTEs are fun, but some require the most diabolical finger cramping spam to even reach close to the max bonus\n2. The alfhiem portals shouldn't count towards your final score\n3. Fuck Isla Del Sol\nAnd as for complaints that's about it. At no point did these ever suck the fun out of the game, they're just small hurtles to jump over.\n\nI hear people complain about the camera a lot, and I can only think of a very small handful of times the camera was slightly against my favor. Never did the camera ruin my experience or enjoyment i had with this game.\nAnother complaint i saw was the combat was too tricky or basic for people, and if you've never played a hack and slash game I can see how. I truly didn't know what I was doing when I first played this game, but it was one of those things that the more i played and got fluent in the combat, it became more and more amusing and satisfying and kept me coming back again and again for that sweet platinum trophy! I highly recommend playing this game again and again if you want the true Bayonetta experience and understanding of the story.\n\nI had a very hard time understanding the story and the plot of this game, which made it a million times worth it playing the chapters over and over again. Each time I started the game over again from the very first chapter I would pick up more and more details about the story, and to me, that's a very satisfying way to play a game, to piece a story together myself with new clues each time I go back to it. It went hand in hand with the combat, and while I got to piece the story little by little, I also got to experience the true blast of Bayonetta combat, it was a gameplay loop I found myself stuck in and not wanting out. It was about the third/fourth time playing that everything made crystal clear sense, and if spending 30+ hours to piece together the story like i did isn't worth your trouble, then this might not be your cup of tea.\n\nI couldn't recommend you anything more than to get into this series! it indeed has its flaws and it always will, But I love this game for what it is and what it has brought to me and the community. This game has opened my eyes to a genre I never knew i needed.\n\nI fell in love with Bayonetta and her story, I finished Bayonetta 2 and started 3 within the same week. the Bayonetta franchise are more than just games to me at this point in my life. Bayonetta has taken the words out of my mouth that I couldn't find in myself, Bayonetta has left me inspired in my writing and art direction, Bayonetta has helped me bring my friends together to show them something I'm truly passionate about, and Bayonetta herself taught me once I find something I love, I need to keep it safe, close to my heart.\n\nWhile I can't say this game will change your life like it did mine, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot.\n\nIn Bayonetta's words \"As long as there's music, I'll keep on dancing\" \nHope this review helped you!

My answer: How about that uninstall button? I've got better things to do than go back on Mister Kamiya's wild ride.\n\nThis is an amazing game covered in the fecal matter and grime of terrible, awful late 00s games. If all the combat worked like fighting normal enemies does, there weren't a billion QTE prompts in every boss, witch time was consistent, and the camera didn't suck, this would be an easy recommend. As it stands, I would advise basically anyone against buying this game purely because every moment of enjoyment in it is contrast with at least two moments that make you wonder if the people who made the game even played it before releasing it.\n\nEvery DMC is better than this game except 2, for the simple reason that even at their most annoying, they don't crowbar as much gimmick crap into their gameplay as Bayonetta does. Also they don't require you to mash so hard your thumb feels like falling off, or do split-second QTEs with no warning that instakill you and tank your rating if you fail.\n\nI had actually played this game before way, way back in the day after its release and I liked the gameplay a lot, but I noticed that the friend I knew who had it hadn't gotten past around the halfway point in the story. I know why he gave up now, because I would have too.\n\nThis game isn't hard, I never died in regular combat and the only boss I ever died on was the last one, but it is [i]INCREDIBLY ANNOYING[/i] and

Unless you're like me, who likes to try to Platinum every game you play.\n\nThe Gameplay is fantastic and has a good variety of weapons, techniques, and accessories to customize the way you play; while some are trash and some are broken, they all have a place somewhere. The game feels amazing to master, the grind for halos is a bit annoying but nothing catastrophic, and there's no way you haven't heard Bayonetta music before; it slaps. This game is an 8/10.\n\nIf you are a completionist like me, however, this game can be a pain; when you play a game like 8 times when it's this short, you start to see the cracks, which is fine; this game came out in like 2009 can't hold it against em, but it's just minor things like the QTEs being annoyingly sudden, all the bosses besides like two of them being nothing but set pieces for the climax attacks or how much it sucks that verses auto-save after you complete them, Most of my actual issue with this game I won't bore you with in a Steam Review. Still, most of my problems come with the fact that modern-day QoL spoils us, and this game has none.\n\nTLDR: This game is like an 8/10 unless you're going for 100% beyond just the achievements, in which case it's like a 6/10. Play the game; it's excellent, and if you're going to complete it all the way, wait to do it over a long stretch of time instead of a week, don't be like me", "timestamp_created": 1679609459, "timestamp_updated": 1679609493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135248049": {"recommendationid": "135248049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198958798608", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 363, "last_played": 1687585105}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, un Hack&Slash suuuper divertido!\n", "timestamp_created": 1679592907, "timestamp_updated": 1679592907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135235398": {"recommendationid": "135235398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198905989031", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 659, "last_played": 1679581608}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bayonetta es Bayonetta, nada mas que decir.", "timestamp_created": 1679581667, "timestamp_updated": 1679581667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135215284": {"recommendationid": "135215284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043783455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 467, "last_played": 1646112840}, "language": "english", "review": "HOT WITCH LADY KILLS HEAVENLY CREATURES WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?\n\nAlso the soundtrack is amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1679557830, "timestamp_updated": 1679557830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135213670": {"recommendationid": "135213670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138131071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 709, "last_played": 1680765995}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una joya del hack and slash", "timestamp_created": 1679555194, "timestamp_updated": 1679555194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135204802": {"recommendationid": "135204802", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059217120", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 155, "last_played": 1679884277}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bueno.", "timestamp_created": 1679540571, "timestamp_updated": 1679540571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135182056": {"recommendationid": "135182056", "author": {"steamid": "76561199239860319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1679943957}, "language": "spanish", "review": "pro", "timestamp_created": 1679516402, "timestamp_updated": 1679516402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135155894": {"recommendationid": "135155894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237558010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 499, "last_played": 1681275707}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played Bayonetta back in the early 2010s when I was a wee lass with an XBox.

No pod\u00eda esperar a experimentar con cada uno y ver cu\u00e1l era el m\u00e1s efectivo en cada situaci\u00f3n.\n\nEl frenetismo del juego es incre\u00edble, cada combate es intenso y emocionante, nunca hay un momento aburrido.

Segu\u00ed la trama con facilidad y me sent\u00ed muy conectado con Bayonetta a medida que descubr\u00eda m\u00e1s sobre su pasado y se enfrentaba a su presente.\n\nLo que realmente hizo que Bayonetta fuera una experiencia \u00fanica para m\u00ed fue la combinaci\u00f3n de seriedad y comedia.

the first place. The characters however are pretty fun to watch as all of them have this over the top performance that makes this experience a lot more enjoyable. Another thing with the story is that while there may be cut-scenes, there are \"moving stills\" that take place throughout the whole game that kinda didn't make that much sense. I am kinda nit picking this but i would have prefered this game to have more cut-scenes rather than stills. \nThe Setting of Vigrid is pretty good with each area offering a nice backdrop for any combat taking place. The colour pallet can be a bit washed out at times but mostly everything has a unique look to it and fits the tone of the game really well.\nVisually, its surprisingly great with it being a 2009 game. Performance was really solid apart from one instance where a character model hadn't loaded in, but apart from that everything was smooth sailing. Art direction is really impressive with the looks of character models, weapons and even some of the outlandish environments looking really nice. \nSound and Audio hold up really well with the soundtrack being as enjoyable as the last listen especially its rendition of \"Fly me to the moon\" and the audio is pretty great and fits with everything really well. \nIn terms of gameplay, there are a lot of great and not so great moments. Bayonetta feels great to control in terms of movement and her combat style is so much fun to play around with. Combos, moves and weapons feel fantastic to play with and is easily one of the best things about this game. Enemies are also pretty challenging with each of them having their own unique move sets, however the telegraphing on them can be a bit weird which can be frustrating at times even to the point where some stuff may seem unfair. The items in the game can be quite useful and the gates of hell shop offers a lot for the player whether that be learning new moves, grabbing items of purchasing new weapons, outfits. The angel shootout is a nice rewarding system for players to enjoy and grant them some items to aid in the rest of the game. Some sections of this game can be a bit weird and frustrating such as the QTE's that can cause an insta death if not done which is pretty unfair. There are motorcycle sections are pretty out of nowhere but still enjoyable. The rocket fight is fine but i much rather prefer avoiding this section on a different playthrough. Finally, the boss fights in this game are really great. If there's one thing i can praise Bayonetta for is its spectacle as everything is over the top insane-ness when it comes to cut-scenes and gameplay and it is no different from the boss fights. I would definitely say though that my favourite fight would be with Jeann as hers is really well done. \nOverall, Bayonetta is a cult classic for obvious reasons. While there may be some issues with the game here and there, its over the top spectacle and brilliant combat system are the perfect reasons as to give this game a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1677612351, "timestamp_updated": 1677612351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133808067": {"recommendationid": "133808067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847077805", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1677600399}, "language": "english", "review": "Mommy?", "timestamp_created": 1677600505, "timestamp_updated": 1677600505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133797692": {"recommendationid": "133797692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251827000", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2194, "last_played": 1677515622}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank God for the Lt.

Never expected to Like Bayonetta this much, I mean I hardly ever sink in 90+ hours on a linear story game, well worth the money in my opinion.\n\nNow to the actual review:\n\nStory:\nThe story is straight forward but has a hint of complexity as there are certain, albeit, small things that make you wonder of the full story. It isn't a complex story but it is interesting to say the least. Even for it's age, it hasn't aged poorly, I played Bayonetta 2 and 3 and I'd still pick 1 over the sequels. Cutscenes have this weird, but enjoyable, stop-frame affect. It's not always the case and I think it adds to the aesthetic of the game.\n\nGameplay:\nI played this with an xbox controller and I had a blast. it has so many different mechanics that feel fleshed out. After my first play through you'd expect that you've found all there is mechanic-wise, then you find even more on your second run. Also there are certain mechanics that are hard to master, for me it was dodge offensive but then again you could probably categories me as a 'button-masher' when it comes to hack-n-slash games. There is also a bunch of different types of weapons that you can unlock that have their own playstyle that you'll need to master. I only ever use one type but there were multiple other options and some I still haven't unlocked. Again, I played this on controller, can't speak for keyboard and mouse.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nI grew to love it, the soundtrack perfectly complements almost any situation and it will start to grow on you too. My favorite soundtrack is One of a kind, the games starts with this and one my first run I neglected it but now I absolutely love it when it comes on in a cutscene.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good hack-n-slash game because this is just it. One thing I will say is that I'm absolutely furious that Bayonetta 2 and 3 haven't come to PC yet. GIVE IT TO ME NINTENDO!\n\nCan't believe I haven't played this game sooner.", "timestamp_created": 1677033402, "timestamp_updated": 1677034094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133335167": {"recommendationid": "133335167", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072820214", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 995, "last_played": 1677414764}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, the one that started the franchise we know and love.

Well since this is not Rockstar we're talking about, this is definitely one of the best PC ports out there, so with that said, PlatinumGames and Sega have not missed the beat on porting the game from the Wii U to Steam.\n\nThe problem I have with this game is that, say if you get Pure Platinum in one verse from your previous save in a chapter, but then get anything else than Pure Platinum in that same verse and ended up getting Pure Platinum in another verse you left with a very tough compromise as the save of the latest gameplay for that chapter overwrites whatever medal you got regardless, making this a seemingly never-ending mission to a Pure Platinum trophy for that chapter.

And let's hope that once Nintendo loosens their licensing exclusivity or drops it entirely, Sega then gets to release the other 2 titles on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1675578523, "timestamp_updated": 1675578523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132216644": {"recommendationid": "132216644", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260914194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1675603774}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me declaro un SIMPatico", "timestamp_created": 1675546224, "timestamp_updated": 1675546224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132206037": {"recommendationid": "132206037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871950981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1677421007}, "language": "spanish", "review": "besto juego", "timestamp_created": 1675534986, "timestamp_updated": 1675534986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132205803": {"recommendationid": "132205803", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078330516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1229, "last_played": 1697487114}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta tremendo", "timestamp_created": 1675534750, "timestamp_updated": 1675534750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132198208": {"recommendationid": "132198208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198864437890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 719, "last_played": 1686023405}, "language": "english", "review": "elegant and sexy", "timestamp_created": 1675527440, "timestamp_updated": 1675527440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132195730": {"recommendationid": "132195730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967888189", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 162, "playtime_forever": 1630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1630, "last_played": 1674148284}, "language": "english", "review": "Bayonetta, whose real name is Cereza, is a powerful witch, but she doesn't fly on a broomstick. The bespectacled titmouse wields up to four weapons at once, with which she attacks with all her limbs. Yeah, I mean her legs too. But don't ask me how he shoots with them in high-heeled shoes. He combines all kinds of weapons for incredible attacks. He can transform into a panther for speed running or moving on water. Like a crow, she can fly and transforming into a flock of bats will ensure her escape from being attacked by her opponents.\nBayonetta amazes not only with its appearance, performance, but also with its abilities and own mythology of its series. The style of the game is also added by video sequences with wire-fu fights, during which Bayonetta cuts with monsters in the air, throws rolls and defies the laws of gravity of common sense.\n\nBayonetta is not shy, she likes to shake her ass, stick out her breasts and even spread her legs lasciviously. However, each time, of course, so that nothing can be seen. Her magical hair is more accurate than the censor's stars. Just not porn, but erotica. The sorceress is also funny and makes one joke after another. She flirts with men about sex, but she doesn't lose her cool.\n\nIn addition, Cereza's heart is in the right place. Even if he occasionally slaps some troublemaker, he cares about the children, and even if he uses dark powers, he never does evil. The realities of Bayonetta's world are very similar to those of the comic book Spawn. It also pits heaven against hell, and the bastards are on both sides. Good and evil do not have clear faces.\n\nPro tip - Get a joystick before buying the game.

In this title the story follows kind of the opposite direction of DMC, instead of cleansing hell from evil rulers and other creatures, it focuses on the umbral witches cleansing the angelic side from beings that attempt to cause harm to the world as well as some people related to her own family, and Bayonetta herself also has a transformation similar to the devil trigger called demon masquerade, after making contact with the butterfly demon, Madama Butterfly who is also highly majestic in appearance. The fight mechanics and such have a great combination of ranged and close combat action which align with various acrobatics, Bayonetta herself uses primarly the Scarborough Fair which is a set of four guns on her arms and heels, and together with the heaven and hell visuals in the various areas in the narrative it has created a very well made and iconic overall environment.", "timestamp_created": 1675269114, "timestamp_updated": 1675573588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669910550117492676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132008451": {"recommendationid": "132008451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002787121", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1675263520}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I am not a fan of action genre, but this game is so stylish and creative, it's literally a visual spectacle.

personal este es el mejor videojuego en cuanto a la categoria Hack N Slash y mi favorito.\n\nEl juego te desenvuelve en una historia de brujas y angeles en la cual controlas a Bayonetta la cual es una bruja con una excelente historia y ambientacion.\n\nLos soundtracks son hermosos y buenos en todo momento y sin mencionar a la belleza de \"Fly Me To The Moon\" Que desde la primera vez que escuche esta cancion en eso de hace varios a\u00f1os en Evangelion me encanto y que lo agregaran a este juego me parece una flipada.\n\nPara ser un juego del a\u00f1o 2010 me parece espectacular las mecanicas, historia y graficos de este juego y al dia de hoy en 2023 sigo opinando lo mismo.\n\nEste es el primero de la saga (Son 3 en total al dia de hoy) y si estas leyendo esto y te preguntas porque no estan los demas aca en Steam, La razon es porque lamentablemente el 2 y el 3 solo estan disponibles en Nintendo Wii U y Nintendo Switch pero los puedes jugar aca en PC desde emuladores.\n\nEn lo personal solo he jugado este Bayonetta y el 2, me gusta un poco mas el 2 pero sin duda los dos son unos juegos\n\nLo unico que no me gusto de este Bayonetta ha sido que aveces la camara tiene problemas.\n\nEste juego lo jugue al 100% con mando, con teclado nose que opinar pero esta mas claro que decir que estos juegos se disfrutan mas con mando, En mi caso use un mando de PS4

I show this game to everyone because it's such dumb fun. \n\nAs I've gotten older I've realized the plot... Has good bones? (All the in-game books are nice and it was my introduction to storytelling via item + character descriptions) it's just a little basic and predictable. That's about my only complaint though. Edit: It is not LMAO I forgot some other grievances; \n\n1. The majority of unlockables cost an obscene amount of halo's. [spoiler] You also can't get costumes until you clear hard mode, the perfume's and 4 of 7 LP's are available at any difficulty but most people will walk right past them their first play-though anyway so no one actually playing on easy/very easy is going to find them all.[/spoiler] I always get [spoiler] the weapons [/spoiler] from memory and point them out while watching my friends (without telling them what it is ofc) so I completely forgot that first time/blind/casual players are extremely unlikely to even see what the game has to offer in terms of character customization unless they know to search/ask for it. Even then grinding for [spoiler] couture bullets [/spoiler] would make any semi-casual gaff. [spoiler] This isn't even mentioning Jeanne, King of the little devils, Pillow talk and the bazillions. How many halo's just to get the cheat code to work?? YEESH no wonder I grew up mentally ill with a sigma grindset god DAMN [/spoiler]\n\n1.5 You also can't customize most costumes beyond a few that have re-colors so a lot of people who want customization will just reach for mods. I've never personally done this (As of writing, I've only previously played Xbox 360 and WiiU versions. Didn't know how to mod those as a kid and still don't lmao.) so unfortunately I can't personally attest to any changes in game-play experience these mods bring. I can only say Kerminetta looks hilarious and \"Creative Handle\" (yes real username) does a lot of magic with mods in general so I recommend watching them to just see what's available. \n\n2. Alfheim portals are a bitch. End of. XD. Ok but seriously, if the combat mechanics seem hard to grasp or you don't absolutely love this game don't waste a second on them. They are made for people in my camp who are returning to replay this game after beating it several times on the hardest difficulty. Casuals will have the worst time trying to do them on their first playthrough so just hold off on them unless you want to 100% the game.\n \n2.5 As an extension, Do not feel bad if you can't beat the secret boss. For serious, he's an absolute menace to society and the mental health of the entire fandom. If you can even get as far as unlocking it? You have a right to feel proud of yourself in my book <3 .\n\n3. So many cutscenes are unskippable and as a returning player who has played the story over 10x... yes some of them are very short but You can skip the kiss animation after clearing a verse so I don't understand why some things are skippable and some aren't.        \n\nI love the art-style, I think it's one of my favorite aesthetics and the game still has my favorite take on \"biblically accurate\" angel designs because they convey the same types of horror but they're all unique (Except maybe affinity and applaud but you gotta have a few angels that look more traditional for the opening stages. Show don't tell.) More often than not, when people make art of \"biblically accurate angels\" 90% chance it's just the one covered in eyes. I also have to say, I appreciate the later installments for actually coming up with more angel designs as well! I know I have a LOT to say about the designs of the game but I spent hours combing through the concept art (another first for me) after I beat the game the first time and even after ten years? I still remember tons of tiny details! [spoiler] like the sketch of the lipstick with Balder and Rosa's name on it, that was such a cool Easter egg and great environmental/item desc. storytelling! [/spoiler] \n\nI also deeply appreciate that the written languages are completely translate-able in English so if you wanted to you could read every poster and every summoning circle. It just shows that the art and design team cared (and continues to care) so much about the game I think it's beautiful.\n\nIn terms of game-play, a lot of people say this is hard the first time they pick it up and they either drop it around chapter 3 or that the entire game feels like a learning curve. To which I'll only say; \"Bayonetta is a fast paced button masher/controller breaker. The only skill needed is to press buttons very fast.\" \n\nThe only thing I ever had a problem with the first time was the precise timing of witch-time but the really easy solution for anyone struggling with that is to try to use [spoiler] the *bat within, had it mixed up when I initially type this oops haha. [/spoiler] ability and you'll automatically dodge if you mash Y (Yes, this even works on the hardest difficulty.) The marionette is also a pretty big life saver if you're struggling to dodge or activate said ability.\n\nI'm not the type of runner to use glitches but I can still break the game with my aggressive use of the moon XD Pro-tip: if you can do it fast enough that item WILL deflect EVERYTHING. The game really stutters but if you use it three times in rapid succession you can block lasers. Really useful in the endgame tower level when you reach the turrets. So, when you get more comfortable making those rapid inputs playing with the moon is the absolute best way to experience the game and complete the harder difficulties if you're a 100% type.\n\nI could talk (and have talked lol) about this game for days, but if you're thinking about getting into this series even as a passing thought about how sexy Bayonetta is. Give it a try! The less you know about the plot walking in the better.

It is a well-balanced game with emphasis on both gameplay and story. Its execution is near flawless.\n\n[b]The gameplay[/b] is just astonishingly good. It extremely satisfying to hit combos, special abilities and overall, the combat is uniquely fluid. There so many mechanics which just enhance the combat experience. It is shown very well on the weapons system, where there is plethora of weapons with detailed and unique combo patterns. Not to mention the Witch time, which is a ability slows down time during a heated fight if dodged correctly.  It is obvious that the combat system has been developed with great effort and for me it is the most fluid combat out of all the games that I\u2019ve played. The only other game which had at least a similar fluid combat system was Yakuza 0 (which is another SEGA game). What is also surprising is the difficulty of the combat in general, even though my difficulty mode was on normal I died many, many times. Combined with the well-designed bosses and the difficulty it reminded me a bit of a Dark Souls. The camera is sometimes a struggle (it is a ported game after all), but aside from that the Combat is astounding. The actively changing fighting environment at some boss fights makes it very interesting, and I never expected it from a game that is from 2009.\n\n[b]The story[/b] is also something to behold. The \u201calluring\u201d Bayonetta acting as the main character of the story is trying to discover her past, but along the way she is met with great hurdles. I feel like everybody has heard about Bayonetta in a clip where she ehm\u2026 acts a bit naughty. Although she acts alluring and is certainly very attractive, but the story isn\u2019t all about her bust and top, in fact Bayonetta as a character has plenty of depth (no inuendo intended) and the story goes to great lengths to show that. Also, the voice acting for Bayonetta is to die for. Along the way you will meet plenty of characters some appear more on screen some less, but there\u2019s never too many characters flooding the story and making it convoluted. I will keep using this a lot: it is simply \u201cwell balanced\u201d in terms of fan service, humor, drama, action, you name it!\n\n[b]The Soundtrack[/b] is amazing. The Soundtrack consists of jazz and upbeat classic songs. It\u2019s so elegant yet so energetic, it\u2019s just a perfect description of Bayonetta. The remixed \u201cFly me to the moon\u201d song is crazy, with Bayonettas dance moves it feels like the song is an extension of herself. If it sounds familiar than you probably have watched Evangelion :-).\n\n[b]The visuals[/b] are pretty good albeit the cutscenes not so much. For some weird reason the cutscenes look worse than the gameplay itself. The gameplay looks smooth and sharp even during combat. The visuals are really impressive for a game that has ported from a console and comes from 2009.\n\n[h1]Summary: 10/10 Buy it whenever[/h1]\n\nIt is an extremely well-balanced game in almost every term. The only things that have aged a lot are the cutscenes. It\u2019s amazing both in terms of Gameplay and story, you have nothing to lose.\n\nI have some [b]bad news[/b] if you would like to play Bayonetta 2,3. The first game is owned and financed by SEGA themselves which means they distribute it to wherever they want to, but Bayonetta 2 and 3 is financed by Nintendo which means we probably won\u2019t see Bayonetta again on PC. So even if SEGA wanted it to port to PC, they can\u2019t, which is really sad. I know it\u2019s possible to play it through CEMU, but that\u2019s just too much of a hassle to go through. \n", "timestamp_created": 1673460998, "timestamp_updated": 1673460998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130650020": {"recommendationid": "130650020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298571219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 897, "last_played": 1673459503}, "language": "english", "review": "sexy God of War.

The story is complete garbage but no one plays Bayonetta for the story, just the music and the explosions of blood and gore as you carve, blast, and bash your way through every enemy on the screen.

switch, but i played it on PC first and everything i have to say holds true)\n\nthe number one thing it takes for an action game to be good is the controls. the content of the game around doesn't [i]really[/i] matter, if it controls like shit then you have a bad action game. it wouldn't matter that bayonetta is a badass femme fatale witch if she didn't feel amazing to control, and thankfully the controls in this game are almost beyond reproach.\n\nimpeccable.\n\nperfection.\n\nthe two things that really set this game apart from others are (1) the ability to shoot through combos and (2) the ability to dodge mid combo. if you hold the punch/kick button after attacking, bayonetta will fire her guns in the directions her limbs were extended, allowing you to rack up combo points and pump damage into enemies, giving you immense flexibility in how you handle combat situations. you can shoot through most or all attacks in a combo, keeping enemies stunned and suppressed under a barrage of bullets or you can quickly fire attacks to turbo your way to explosive combo finishers to stub bigger enemies shrugging off smaller attacks. this ties into the dodge mechanic which is just... revolutionary.\n\nif you dodge mid combo while holding down the attack button you just pressed to strike, your combo will resume where you left off after the dodge, and this works through as many dodges as you need to do to get yourself out of danger. for example, if you fire a punch and a kick and then hold the kick button while dodging, if you punch after the dodge you'll finish the combo as if you had never dodged at all! this spreads some flexibility butter on your flexibility toast, making long and difficult combos actually usable on higher difficulties, letting you dance through battles in a flurry of bullets, only limited by your ability to make snap second decisions, and it just feels\n\nso\n\nfucking\n\ngood.\n\nthis is my favorite game. it kicked my ass on normal, and then i learned it. then on hard, it kicked my ass relentlessly until i learned more. then i beat it on nonstop infinity climax, and i have no idea how i pulled it off but i did it. play this fucking

bat, I have a confession to make: I\u2019m not a huge fan of hack and slash games, but there are a few exceptions I really enjoyed, most notably (surprise, surprise) the [i]Devil May Cry[/i] series. I felt it was about time I gave [i]Bayonetta[/i] a chance, too, because I kept reading about the many similarities it has with Dante\u2019s adventures. And, wow, what a great decision this was \u2013 I got hooked almost immediately!\n\nThis is, by all means, a first-class action game, even all these years after its original release. There\u2019s so much creativity poured into every second of it that I still can\u2019t wrap my head around it. The cutscenes and the boss fights are insane, the combat system is fluid and quite easy to master even if you\u2019re not very familiar with this genre, the number and variety of weapons are truly impressive, and the countless swarms of enemies will never get monotonous or predictable \u2013 my only complaint here is that they re-used some bosses a few times, but that\u2019s all, not a huge issue all in all, especially because beating them might require a different approach the second time you meet them. The graphics are gorgeous (and one of the main reasons why I, eventually, chose the PC version), the soundtrack is brilliant (I have to admit, [i]Fly Me To The Moon[/i] is a big favorite of mine), and the story and characters (although there aren\u2019t many) were fun, as well \u2013 especially the mysterious, mischievous and super cool protagonist, of course. There\u2019s also some replay value with all the collectibles and different, more challenging difficulty settings.\n\nI can only recommend this to everyone, even if you\u2019re like me and not very into these types of titles. Even though it\u2019s a bit short, and, unfortunately, we\u2019ll probably never see the sequels on PC, you won\u2019t be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1672323521, "timestamp_updated": 1672323521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129599207": {"recommendationid": "129599207", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022519783", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1672986956}, "language": "english", "review": "MOMMY", "timestamp_created": 1672316656, "timestamp_updated": 1672316656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809845805168151855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129579004": {"recommendationid": "129579004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047614361", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 972, "last_played": 1671967500}, "language": "english", "review": "A fucking classic.

challenging but very rewarding game play. it has a large amount of weapons that all offer a unique style of fighting and a very intricate combo system that heavily rewards stylishness. bayonetta as a protag as well is amazing. her personaility and humor shines whenever shes on screen and the story she goes through is very powerful. there are a couple parts of the game i didnt enjoy but those were few and farbetween. and one of them focused on platforming which the game almost never does. the shoot em up section also dragged a little even if it was fun. but those are very small complaints compared to my exteme love for this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1671657463, "timestamp_updated": 1671657463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1,

It's unfortunate that the trilogy is unlikely to be released on PC but what's here is still a wildly entertaining rollercoaster.\n\nWhere Vanquish was about speed and Revengeance was about blocking, Bayonetta homes in on dodging and timing. Being aggressive while triggering witch time at just the right moment is the key to victory and the game is a real challenge on normal difficulty. The game also throws in a few tributes to classic arcade shooters and the typical technique and weapon upgrades are there and accounted for.

It is an overall great experience that I would recommend to everyone but beware: There are some really frustrating things in it as well that hold it back from being a true masterpiece imo.\n\nThe quicktime events are way too inconsistent and there are a lot of them; some give you a very large window to act while some ask for very precise timing, and some just cause you to get damaged while some outright kill you. It doesn't help that the ones with the most brutal response window are usually also the most punishing, and dying even once greatly affects your end of the level rewards. So it really is frustrating when you die because you missed a button prompt after fighting through an onslaught of tough enemies.\n\nBesides that, there is also a lot of button mashing. I'm not talking about the combat in general; like I said it's pretty great. I'm talking about the actual button prompts telling you to mash during torture attacks, finishers and counters. There is a lot of hard mashing that is cool for the spectacle for the first couple of times but quickly gets old and very tiring. I'd rather see bayo's hair dragon chomping on the boss as a quick cutscene rather than chomping on the boss myself if all I'm going to do is mash a button.\n\nThere are also loooong gameplay sections filled with tedious bullethell sections and minigames here and there. Chapter 14 for instance starts with one of these and lasts for like 20 minutes, and then you're thrown into a really good boss fight with your actual combat mechanics that I really love. I would love to replay that boss fight, but I don't want to go through that horrible earlier section for 20 minutes beforehand if I pick chapter 14 from chapter select.\n\nThere is more to go over like those numerous sections when you're running away from something like rising lava or a rolling boulder where you can also die immediately due to the smallest mistake and ruin your end of the level rewards, but the bottomline is that while the game is great, it could've been a straight up masterpiece if they replaced all this fodder with more encounters and more time spent on bettering the combat even further rather than constructing entirely separate gameplay systems for the shitty motorcycle and missile riding sections.\n\nTL;DR: The game is really fantastic most of the time (during cutscenes and during regular combat) but there are a few sections (frustrating and/or tedious bullethell, minigame and turret sections) and frustrating design choices (needlessly many and sometimes brutal quick-time events and button mashing) here and there that really make the quality dip from time to time.", "timestamp_created": 1670807437, "timestamp_updated": 1670807528, "voted_up": true,

On early 2015 on a Nintendo Wii U with the Bayonetta 2 disc bundle after having released not too long on mid-late 2014, my teen little mind was BLOW TO BITS with just the first 30 minutes of playing this game, the glamour, the [i]class[/i] oh god specially the [i]Class~[/i]... The class and flex on every bit of violence, the amount of detail... it's hard to believe it was a game released on 2010 that was a few years in development prior to that launch date... Because the game is god damn LONG, so hell-ish hard no navigate and etc etc but of course that is if you don't caught up quick in your creativity and options... like simply mobility and combo flexibility... it is one hell of a hack n' slash game and you're only rewarded by literally teaching yourself to push your limits quite literally by keeping track of your every action at all times whenever there are hostiles around you, you either learn to eat and break apart enemy health bars regardless of size...distance... hazards and quantities FAST or else you'll be showered in Silver and Gold trophies in your chapter results, get good and you'll get Platinum and Pure Platinum if you're fast, take no damage and keep your combos alive by not stopping your fire power... and you have a large variety of options to do that even with your first stock temporary weapons. Weapons ? You get too maby if you grind to find them and buy them if you meet the requirements to be able to see them at all, perks and tools ? Also grinding and capitalism within the game.\nI love the sequel because its significantly faster and feels more vastly flexible besides the brutal new toys, demons and Climax mode to just hyper power up yourself to turn yourself into a walking hazard to everyone and everything around you, the third and final game has this properties and much more DIFFERENT but similar concept options (mostly) with few old weapons/tools but slightly different qualities changed/improved to them though it's harder to keep the combo's alive in terms of heavy slow weapons (which is a skill issue to most, but with practice... you can quick versatile combos and advanced use of the demons while keeping your combos alive, is just proper management at this point).\nDespite the sequels being better in terms of modern changes... this first debut, the original to say... It's the most to heart out of the trilogy. Though I still recomend you gettina Switch and playing the 2nd then the 3rd titles... the only reason the sequels are not available on other consoles or even PC is because many companies and sponsors didn't sit well with Bayonetta's 1 over risque look and content... Weirdly enough, Nintendo let them have freedom for the 2nd game but still a few limitations, hell... Bayonetta 1 and 2 on Wii U and Switch are the only versions in which the games give you on Rodin's store a selection of Nintendo themed flirty skimpy outfits... (some of these came free already from the get-go i think) Say.. Princess Peach or Daisy but the dress is a mini skirt and you can see her ass at any time and many other outfits too besides the ones that already were in the base game... Nintendo truly gave us the confusion of the decade back then. Eitherway, the sequels are stuck and WILL stay on the Nintendo family, though I do wish they would get a re-release on a PS5 or Steam release to better up those graphics, the 3rd game seriously needs that one upgrade despite how good it looks for a Switch game that released on October 28 on 2022. Yes I know the 3 first titles re-relased AGAIN for the Nintendo Switch on 2017 for said HD versions, but at the same year, Bayonetta 1 for Steam... this game page here right on Steam, is the actual ultimate HD-able version, HDR and 4k, 60 FPS at all times and etc etc if your system is well packed, on 2020 a PS4 re-release again happened with Bayonetta 1 and Vanquish (an equally scifi third person third person shooter time game that wasn't as memorable but just as cool and edgy for the PS3) as a singular disc even with a steel book, a bundle given it was the 10 anniversary of both games... despite having these releases and you can boot up these games still on a PS5 if you own them digitally on you PS account... The Steam PC version of the Bayonetta 1 still is the highest possible HD version ever of all versions.\nIf it was for me... I'd buy me a PS3 Dualshock 3 controller and try to pair it my computer and play the game out of nostalgia with these better graphics and fps, but I got a Logitech F310 Wired gamepad (that I have since 2014 but oh god it has never drifted or had input issues ever so far, it's perfect like wtf) but it isn't exactly the most ideal for Bayonetta 1 or any third person game if I'm gonna be pulling 100% combos or complex stuff like that, though it has that Xbox 360 feeling to it... just a little by the literally looks of it and layout.\n\nBut like mentioned earlier... as much as I love the sequels, I love the first original title... for it has the original concept and complexities and high demand gameplay if you are to expect to get finer results by personal skill performance. The story events and amount of detail added even to said particular moments are so well done that you feel, see and resonate with it for how damn ridiculously good it displays itself it almost makes you feel like a damn uncultured philistine even if you acknowledge it, even an old experienced player of each game of the franchise still looks back Bayonetta 1 and go there because it's hard and rewarding for how you get the freedom to express your combos on a game that at first glance you think it's less able because it's the first game of the franchise...when it literally has significantly more content than the actual sequel. The 2nd game has less chapters, and Bayo1 has few but ridiculously LONG chapters even the extra ones like \"Angle Slayer\", given it was too hard for people, devs recognized this and made the extra levels \"Witch Trials\" be split in many sorter more balanced gradually hardening levels unlike the first game that just crammed it all together in one gigantic long level... because devs originally intended to do the same again in terms of many few extra levels but each would be overly long and difficult to complete regardless of difficulty. The 2nd game also has a coop mode that are practically boss rooms. you and one other player, you get to choose what character to be, what weapons and tools, whoever beats more enemies and has more points (done doing combos and such by hogging them to yourself)...wins ! But of course also are forced to not your friendly opponent die completely or else you also die... basically having to risk your own life to revive said weakened friend before a timer goes off and the whole matchs ends in failure for both (obviously the match ends if both get weakened and down'ed), you can even unlock one and only Rodin and the Lumen Sage as playable characters besides Jeanne and Bayo, good experience...\nYet people STILL come for Bayonetta 1, it has some charm to it that won't go away, it's just that good~\nGame has a lot of lore, even with the 3rd game out there's still too many questions and unanswered plots, knowledgeable players get always in cultured slanders about the Bayo universe and multi-verse in the most respectable or petty ways possible.\nAlthough I love this game to death... I dont feel like playing the whole game again twice over through Hard mode along unlocking everything and pulling Gold, Platinum or Pure Platinum trophies per chapter... after having done so on the Wii U, a PS3, played it on a Xbox One having done so by using a Bayonetta 1 Xbox 360 dic that found on a Gamestop(yes, the Xbox One can read just SOME eligible 360 game discs, couldnt play Sonic Unleashed 360 disc ;-;), then done so again on the Nintendo Switch... But Bayonetta 1 Steam version, I can do it again, but I might get an aneurysm at this rate if I do it again...

It has it's flaws, such as the QTE's, a few annoying to fight enemies, and at times difficult to understand story. Even with these faults it still stands above the rest of its genre. \n\nVery few games can make a player feel as powerful as Bayonetta does when you master it. Don't be discouraged when on your first play through you die constantly and maybe aren't even able to get above a silver medal. This game is hard, excruciatingly hard at times, accepting this will make your first play through a lot more tolerable. \n\nIf you have a desire to actually learn the game then take the time to practice, learn all your combos in the practice mode (pressing select/TAB/minus) on the loading screen, watch your enemies moves (most angels and some bosses only have a handful of moves) knowing what attack does what and when to dodge them is the most important part of this game. Knowing your combos is meaningless if your still getting hit by every attack, learn the visual and audio queues, it will help dramatically. \n\nWhen you have those fundamentals down you can really start learning the advanced tactics such as Dodge Offset, this allows you do keep combos going while dodging. This one system will make many other action games seem like baby toys in comparison. Getting good at Bayonetta is a fantastic experience, and when you do get good, obtaining Pure Platinum medals one after another, demolishing the bosses, and just utterly dominating the game will feel like pure dopamine. \n\nIt took me 4 tries over 3 years to get into Bayonetta, to be honest most games that are known to be extremely difficult such as titles like Dark Souls or SIFU, games such as those will just make me rage quit and uninstall. This happened to me 3 separate times over the span of 3 years with this game, but on my 4th try in 2021 I bought the game on Switch and accepted that it is a hard ass game, then by the end of the game I was in love with Bayonetta. \n\nBayonetta is a one of a kind game, very few action games can even compare to it. The game will kick your ass and do so with a smile on its face but if you have the willpower to learn its systems and understand the game, it will reward you immensely. \n\nNow for the PC port. I have beaten the game 3 times on Switch and now 1 time on PC. It's definitely the best way to play Bayonetta. It does have a few issues though. I will list them below:\n\u2022Slight FPS drops in specific areas (Also present on all other systems)\n\u2022Crashes in specific areas (Example: Chap 5 Verse 4, with an angel weapon equipped if you go to title screen and continue at the checkpoint or die during the fight, after the loading screen the game will CTD every time. You can prevent this by dropping your angel weapon during the loading screen. Similar issue with Chap 12 Verse 4, to be safe I would just drop your angel weapon every time you can when loading. \n\u2022Occasionally pressing pause when hit will cause a CTD, possibly only during specific fights. \n\u2022Music sometimes doesn't start when loading the game, starts again when a different track starts (i.e. verse or cutscene begins)\n\u2022Loading screens are incredibly fast (a good thing), makes retrying chapters even easier, ironically makes getting into practice mode harder, only have a maybe 1 second window to press the button. This is more so an issue with Bayonetta and not the Port, this issue was fixed in Bayonetta 2. \n\nBesides those issues with the PC Port it's the best way to play Bayonetta. The visuals, audio, and convenience given by Steam through it's controller settings make it the best version by far. \n", "timestamp_created": 1669500840, "timestamp_updated": 1682646790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127098143": {"recommendationid": "127098143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090485712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1690575628}, "language": "english", "review": "I simply enjoyed it", "timestamp_created": 1669496002, "timestamp_updated": 1669496002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127082120": {"recommendationid": "127082120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151888941", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1682113590}, "language": "english", "review": "My laptop is ass and couldn\u2019t run it but I have it on the switch.

"review": "This game makes DMC 2 look like a masterpiece : )\n\nThe only saving grace for this piss-poor game is Bayonetta herself and the boss designs, which look pretty unique.\nLiterally, every other character, except for maybe Rodin and Enzo, are just flat and poorly voice-acted, which makes it harder to care for what they have to say in cutscenes and be able to follow up on that nonsensical \"story\".\n\nLevel designs were inspired by Michael Fekin Bay, with constant explosions so that you can't see where ya are or what hit ya.\n\nBoss battles are a fekin joke, Bayonetta is tiny and is up against giants so 99% of the time is just you trying to do aerial attacks that don't land bc the target system is also a fekin joke. not to mention yer gonna be too busy fighting the camera to be fighting the bosses, which is always fun.\n\nEven regular enemies are made to be as irritating as humanly possible, for some unholy reason the devs had the brilliant idea to have the enemy attack you within milliseconds of their introduction cutscene. so basically, just keep spamming RT whenever they introduce an enemy just in case. \n\nAnd by far the worst implementation of the boss gauntlet troupe I've ever seen. normally, whenever there is a boss gauntlet they let ya have a breather between these re-used enemies. here, however, it's one after the other of these bullshit bosses that are huge and can also fly so they're harder to hit. by the time I got there, I was so done with boss fights and their janky camera and their shitty target system that would've rathered just boot up DMC2 instead.\n\nNo fekin wonder this game barely managed to get 2 sequels that had to be financed by the fekin devil himself, nintendo.", "timestamp_created": 1669416884,

El control de la camara es horrible y marea bastante, sobretodo porque constantemente se destrozan los escenarios, y tienes que pelear con la c\u00e1mara para que no vaya donde ella quiere sino donde tu quieres. Cuando tienes que subir por paredes es facil desorientarse. Los personajes son excesivamente estilizados, chulescos e histri\u00f3nicos. Los combates son dif\u00edciles en modo normal, y la narrativa es muy rara. Parece que el juego entero quiere marearte con cont\u00ednuos cambios de perspectiva.\nOtra cosa que no me gusta nada es que est\u00e1s mirando una escena y de repente te sale un evento quick-time, y como est\u00e1s distra\u00eddo y te pilla por sorpresa, pues est\u00e1s muerto. Esto fue una moda antigua en juegos de consolas que nunca me gust\u00f3, y aqu\u00ed vuelve a hacer presencia.\n\nAun con todo es entretenido y si te gustan los retos y los supercombos en combate puedes pasar un buen rato, aunque personalmente prefiero infinitamente la saga \"Devil may cry\". \nSi el juego no hubiera salido originalmente en Switch supongo que la calidad ser\u00eda mucho mayor.\nAhora entiendo porque no sacar\u00e1n la segunda ni tercera parte en PC.

I was never one to really get into games through SSB like others might have been, but this was one game I held onto playing for some time... and boy am I glad I played it. (I would have been hung if I played it when she first released in SSB. I was like 14 LOL)\n\nPros:\n- everything except for two problems.\n\nCons:\n- needing to finish the game for costumes. (minor complaint)\n- the Jeanne fights.\n\nOther than that this game is borderline perfect in my eyes. The characters, the voice acting, the writing, the combat, the way cutscenes are done, the music all of it I simply adored. 'Fly Me To The Moon' is my favorite song out of the entire game, I had that shit on repeat for like 3 days in a row. \n\nOnce I finished Bayo I IMMEDIATELY bought the 2nd game and am waiting for it to arrive. Once it does, I am going to grind the fuck out of it and then buy Bayo 3. I genuinely felt empty after finishing it so I went back to play more.\n\nMy hours are a lie too. I'm supposed to have more achievements and time played, but Steam Offline moment.\n\nI recommend this game. Seriously 9.5/10. I also suggest playing with a controller. It made it a lot easier.\n\n\n\nHere's the summary if you're too lazy to read btw:\n\nOoga booga thick witch mommy game good fun. Buy and play. Will awaken you to new things. \n\nEDIT FOR BAYONETTA 2:\nI did not think this game could get any better... but oh my god it does. 10/10. Gorgeous game.\n\nEDIT FOR BAYONETTA 3:\nI came back to edit this after completing 3. I do not recommend 3. It is a mess.

difficult. I didn't know how to review this for the longest time, but I think I've finally found the words. I've gone through the whole thing once and done some repeat playthroughs of levels on different difficulties. I think I can give an informed opinion from my standpoint as someone who got drawn in by the style and aesthetics.\n\nI love Bayonetta as a character. She's vivacious, determined and confident in a way modern gaming seems to have lost in many of its brooding or broken characters. She's also part of a crazy world that's fun to explore, with beautiful world design and great music. Story's a bit bonkers, but in the context of Bayonetta it kind of fits. But...the gameplay...\n\nI won't lie, I'm not the best at action games. I'd seen footage of the game, seen tutorials, and...got utterly destroyed except by luck. It's a nice battle system, but it's horrific on anyone who hasn't played God Hand and Devil May Cry to absolute perfection. Yes, I said it, God Hand. From what I've heard, I think Bayonetta serves more as a successor to the extremely beginner-unfriendly God Hand, with its obscure combos and odd progression. Plus the game penalizes you for using items of any kind, even remotely taking damage even if it wasn't your fault, and pulls the two very unfair tricks of cutscene attacks leading directly into gameplay without any pause to get yourself ready and out-of-nowhere quick time events.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties, ones above normal unlocked once you've completed the game on normal. I wouldn't mind the scoring system and difficulty so much if the game didn't lock a good chunk of its extra content behind 'gettin' good'. I've gone through and really enjoyed Scarlet Nexus, which has similar stuff to this, but Bayonetta...\n\nShould you play the game? Only if you're a veteran at action games. I heard one review saying the gameplay \"moves like a revelation\". Well, I guess I wasn't on the rollcall for that revelation, because to me the game is difficult and random to the point of being almost maliciously unfair. Anyone who isn't an action veteran will be totally trounced. This is the one time I'd actively recommend that those used to a more relaxed style but still drawn to the game's craziness should watch a playthrough on YouTube. You'll enjoy it more.\n\n(PS: The Alfheim portals can go die in a hole.)", "timestamp_created": 1667988009, "timestamp_updated": 1670875698, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125191792": {"recommendationid": "125191792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142087846", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 815, "last_played": 1633476137}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Before she knows it, Bayonetta is plunged back into a war between Heaven and Hell, and the Umbra Witches and Lumen Sages.\n\nThe game progresses along one path with little deviation. I have to admit, for a ten-plus year-old game, the renders and animations hold up pretty well. The graphics and cut scenes are not earthshattering but they're more than acceptable. A light jazzy soundtrack plays when the character enters combat and it seems to match the mood pretty well. Character voice work is good, if often over-the-top hammy. The game is rife with suggestive, teasing dialogue. I mean, what would you expect of a game where the most difficult setting is called, \"Infinite Climax?\" Bayonetta herself is rendered and voiced as quite the sex kitten.  There are camera shots aplenty focusing on Bayonetta's body in its skintight suit. It's not even subtle, but that's okay. The entire game is utterly unapologetic about embracing its sexy, violent themes. If that kind of thing bothers you, now you know. I found it amusing more than anything. But in terms of atmospherics, Bayonetta does an excellent job of setting the mood and painting a beautiful scene.\n\nAfter the game opens with some significant cut scenes (there are a lot of long cut scenes throughout), the player will be plunged into combat against the angels. The tutorials are decent and will give the player a good idea of what to do. Initial attacks can be punches and kicks up close, or shooting with wrist and ankle-mounted pistols at a distance. Attacks can be combo'd into \"wicked weaves\" which hit very hard. There might be several dozen combos, so I recommend working out a few that feel natural to execute and match with whatever weaponry you're employing at the time. Develop a rhythm and dodge as necessary; button-mashing will work on Easy but on Normal and beyond, if you don't attack smartly, you'll find yourself taking a lot of hits.\n\nMost enemy attacks can be dodged; executing a perfect dodge will put Bayonetta in \"witch time\" for several seconds, during which foes will slow down and the player can unload on them. The angels provide a diverse array of challenges. Many of them are quite fast, so stay on your toes. Bosses present their own difficulties and sequences of attacks and a rather disappointing number of QTE-style events, so be ready. When the strongest angelic opponents and bosses have been beat down, Bayonetta can execute a climax move (I am sure the double entendre was completely intentional) in which her hair will swirl off her body and rope together to summon a powerful demon to devour or crush the angel (or in cases of a boss fight, tear off parts). Defeated foes drop halos (currency), weapons (which you can pick up and momentarily wield against other foes, to crushing effect) or parts of golden records. Overall, the combat is a lot of fun and it's very satisfying to defeat several powerful foes without taking a scratch.\n\nAs Bayonetta progresses, the player will encounter portals that either lead to levels of the mysterious Alfheim (bonus level content) or the Gates of Hell, a jazz bar where she can purchase consumables, new combat techniques, accessories with various effects, and cosmetics. Rodin, the sarcastic bartender, will also forge the golden LPs into powerful new permanent weapons. There are various collectibles and notes to pick up along the way, along with broken witch hearts which raise maximum health, Legend-of-Zelda style.\n\nIf that all sounds easy, it's not. On Normal difficulty, combat can still be quite tough until the player learns enemy moves and gets a good feeling for the controls. Casual players are going to find it challenging. Against the bosses, there is little margin for error, and difficulty only ramps up the deeper one gets.\n\nEven with its positives, Bayonetta is not flawless. For one, the camera (as is so often the case in these games) can be a hindrance and sometimes refuses to orient in the best spot. There are a couple of vehicle sequences--on a motorcycle and riding a rocket (no innuendo there, right?)--where controls are clunky and cameras are again not ideal. All of these segments last way too long and were easily my least favorite parts of the game. There are also a lot of crappy platforming sequences; you know the type, where you have to make long jumps several times in a row and if you miss, you either fall to the bottom and start over ... or fall to your death, get a score penalty for the chapter, and still start over. I wouldn't have minded a few but there are a LOT of jumps to be made in this game. Okay in a 2D side-scroller but here, it felt repetitive and annoying.\n\nI had no stability issues or crashes. Saves are accomplished through a checkpoint save system. There are fifty Steam achievements, which will be rough for most players, as going 100% requires playing through the game on mounting levels of difficulty. This is one I wouldn't recommend for cheevo farmers.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time in Bayonetta but it was like cotton candy: light and fluffy, tasty, and not very filling. Still, if you like fighting games and/or spicy humorous content, give this one a whirl.\n\nPros\n- Fun combat\n- Excellent sound and ambiance, and decent animations\n\nCons\n- Frequent bad camera angles, especially during vehicle sections\n- Will challenge casual players\n\nFinal Score: 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1667100463, "timestamp_updated": 1667100463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124632228": {"recommendationid": "124632228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145967299", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "playtime_at_review": 2408, "last_played": 1699681247}, "language": "english", "review": "I love femdom and advanced combo systems", "timestamp_created": 1667100392, "timestamp_updated": 1667100392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124632100": {"recommendationid": "124632100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216751185", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 590, "last_played": 1667099881}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!
