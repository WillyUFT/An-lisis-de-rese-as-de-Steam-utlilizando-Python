This game is essentially Dishonored in space, which makes sense, considering Prey is made by the same studio as Dishonored. The combat is clean and incredibly satisfying and at some points can be very challenging. The challenge forces the player to uses the plethora of weapon options and abilities at their disposal. \nThe world/environment is where this game shines. It all takes place in and around a single space station and this space station is huge. There are tons of hidden rooms and compartments, locked areas containing gear and bits of lore. It really feels like this was a functioning space station at one point. You spend a lot of time chasing storylines that took place before the disaster and learning about the people who lived on this space station. \nThe story is decent and has a somewhat predictable twist but the path to get to that twist is enjoyable. \n\nThe only negative I can think of is that a few sections are a bit tedious to get through. Extended areas where you are forced to use zero gravity can become annoying. Most of these sections come at the end of the game where the player should be powered up enough to blast through them but if not, it can turn into a slog. The first 15 hours of gameplay are phenomenal though.

Must buy for those who love Alien Isolation or immersive sim in general. Flawed but ultimately enjoyable. Warrants a sequel.\n\nPros:\n1. Hours of exploration\n2. Eerie atmosphere, though admittedly not as scary as Alien Isolation\n3. Easier to progress compared to Alien Isolation where you have lots of petrifying moments\n4. Personally not a fan of art deco, but the art direction here really grows on me\n5. Clever crafting mechanic and skill tree\n6. Lots of different enemy types with unique features and weaknesses, keeping you busy and challenged\n\nCons:\n1. Audio is too loud even after reducing by 50%\n2. Sound design is not as good as the award winning Alien Isolation, gauging enemy's proximity is especially tougher here\n3. Secondary attack and Exit UI are merged into one key, resulting in accidental firing at Fabricators (see #4)\n4. Inconsistent UX for Fabricators where you don't have to exit the UI after pressing Create, with the rest (Recyclers, Workstations) where you need to right click to exit the UI\n5. Map and objective tracker are confusing especially when you have many objectives tracked at once, but you can just explore and eventually you'll get to where you're supposed to\n6. Some weapons are powerful enough for you to lose the fear factor\n7. Inconsistent mechanics on some weapons and secondary attacks, some require you to aim first, some don't\n8. Surprise enemies that spot you right after the loading screen when traveling to particular levels\n9. Hacking can be frustrating\n10.

When you're finished, you'll think \"there was so much potential here for greatness.\" Wasted in the end by some bad circumstances, I think. \n\nWhat is good: \n\n1) Bioshock was touted as a spiritual successor to System Shock 2, well that notion can GTFOOH- if you've played SS2 you'll understand Prey's mechanics instantly, \n\n2} there's a rather detailed and interesting backstory going on, with an alternative timeline Earth that split off somewhere in the late 1950's Cold War Era...and took a very different path going forward.\n\n3) you can progress as a Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil, or in-between character. Surviving crew are killable, you can do some really depraved stuff if you're inclined. Sorta refreshing.\n\n4) Practically everything can be achieved with at least 3 options. Creativity can be rewarded. Exploring yeild treasures, clues, and interesting finds. You can literally skip chunks of progression via clever/ unconventional thinking. If you're a \"cut to the chase\" person, about 40% of the map requires no exploration, and has no impact on progression.\n\n5) All the humans have names or identifiers. About 90% of them have distinct faces. Nice to see a departure from a limited cookie cutter appearance pool.\n\n6) Play your way upgrades-be a thief, a soldier, an assassin, a science nerd, or a wizard. You have options!\n\n7) Recycle Grenades-I cannot stress how FREAKING FUN these things are! You can set them as traps, use them as weapons, breach obstacles, and most importantly, you get resources for you trouble. You can reduce chairs, tools...and dead crew members into useful materials. One of the neatest gadgets ever!\n\nAnd the not so good:\n\n1) Hacking-one of the highest cost skills to obtain, and the only one  that has one of the worst minigames attached to it. I'd best describe it as \"Maze Pong from Hell\"- it is difficult to work if you keyboard play, and it repeats on higher difficulties. It's on a timer, there are no \"modifiers\" to gain time, reduce the challenge, etc. You time out, you get shocked. This would have worked if you were hacking unskilled (or under skilled) but otherwise it's butt stupid and annoying as hell. Thankfully there are at least 3 mods that reduce the difficulty or eliminate the game altogether. I recommend them highly.\n\n2) This game has a wack ass spawning system. It's non-existent at first, then starts, progresses, intensifies, to the point where it's near constant at the end. Not my favorite thing.\n\n3) If you are a explorer with a \"see the sights\" approach, you will not like the switch near the 3rd quarter mark. let's just say, the pace changes, and while you can still take it slow, there's gonna be pain involved for that choice.\n\n4) The end-I thought it was cool for 60 seconds, then I hated it intensely. A terrible ending in my opinion, it's enough of a finale to deter you from replaying the game. It's that bad...they could have chosen several other outcomes, would have had close to the same results...and would have kept you playing.\n\nOther musings:\n\nLow gravity conditions are fun! There's a lot of pretty scenery. Difficulty in my opinion scales \"one level higher\" than the listing. I play on normal, it feels like the hard setting on mot other games I've played. For complete masochists, there are optional traumas you can engage, weapon and suit degrading that will make your life miserable. Be warned...there were last minute additions and went through little play-testing prior to the release, and it shows. You can get whacked and have several of your \"idiot lights\" appear at once, and you will really be in it deep.\n\nPick it up on sale and give it a whirl.

I will say however that navigating the space station is a little bit confusing and I had to look up a few times how I was supposed to get to certain areas because I had forgotten the layout of Talos I. Another thing I liked about the game was the skill trees and how you can manufacture the skill points (neuromods) instead of gaining them purely through something like exp. points so if you haven't been exploring everything and you feel under leveled you aren't S.O.L. and can fabricate some skill points assuming you have the right materials. It's pretty neat being able to use the same abilities as the alien species too it's kind of like prop hunt lol. All in all it was a VERY good game and had a lot of interesting concepts in it sparking thoughts like [b] \"Are we the only planet in space with sentient life?\" [/b] or [b] \"Does extraterrestrial life have emotion like us?\" [/b] also, very important note, upgrade your G.L.O.O.

Points for making an interesting game. Truly. But just no. No to game development. No to woke storyline.\n\nYou have lots of powers to kill things with. But you can't use them at all, because its a survival thing. Gotta save those upgrade points for plot skills (like upgrading your psychonaut helmet thing).\n\nYou have psychic abilities dangling at the forefront, to lift objects, to shoot energy beams, but you won't use them. Too expensive to use. Maybe next playthrough (new game +) And if you do get them, be prepared to use them like one time. This is due to your psychic abilities being limited. It probably will do a decent amount of damage though, should you choose to use them anyway. Probably.\n\nWant to go Rambo style? Maybe skip the whole telepath thing for guns? Well that's gonna cost you lots of upgrade points. And if you want to simply upgrade your guns, well you can do a barebones upgrade, but then after that you have to invest in even more upgrade points to upgrade the guns even further. And simply upgrading the guns costs precious resources, of which you have few.\n\nAlright fine. How about just melee mode. Use the wrench. Sorry can't upgrade that till way later. Want to upgrade your melee skills? Also that will cost a significant amount of neuromods (upgrade points). \nWe need health to cover your melee, right? Lots of neuromods as well.\n\nOkay, so let's just stick to the story then and not focus on combat. Well, you will get forcefed woke sjw nonsense the entirety of the time. Not kidding. It's not a sidequest thing. It's not something in the background. It's up in the forefront. In your face. Lots of Chayna is awesome references too (yeesh). \n\nThis game was made in Austin, Texas. One of the cesspools of wokeness in Texas. (Albeit limited). I find it odd that there is so much (Chayna this, Chayna that).\n\nIn light of the fact that deathloop, and pretty much every other game from Arkane studios, during and after Prey is woke af (and suffering a severe quality famine), one must has to ask, is Arkane even a studio anymore?

For a game released in 2017, it looks like a student project. And I've seen student projects better than this. Textures are lazily done, lighting doesn't look realistic, some plants literally have stems that just float in mid air like the model wasn't finished. Holy hell. I'm sure some people will say that \"it's stylized, it's not meant to look realistic!\" but no. There's no consistency here. Sometimes they go for realistic, and other times it just looks goofy. Imagine TF2 characters in Modern Warfare. That's how this game looks.\n\n- Movement feels bad. You're slow when walking and only marginally faster when sprinting. If you sprint backwards you can barely even see yourself speeding up. It's that bad\n\n- Audio balancing is the worst I've seen in a AAA title. Sounds play like they're right next to your ear, even if the NPC is at the end of the corridor. This is the only game I've ever played where I had Speech volume set to half of Effects volume.\n\n- Performance spikes wildly. Sometimes I get like 150fps, and other times I'm at 90fps. No idea why, maybe it's the location I was in\n\n- The game feels incredibly unresponsive. Some actions are super fast, like crouching or opening your radial menu. Then there's weapon swapping. If I press 1 and immediately follow it with 2, I expect the first weapon swap to be cancelled prematurely so I can get to slot 2 faster. In this game however, they play the full animation out, and if you swap fast enough, they completely [b]IGNORE[/b] your second weapon swap. Piss poor controls\n\n- Doors don't slide into gaps in the wall. They just clip through solid walls with solid \"gaps\" drawn onto them. Cheap and amateurish\n\n- Skill tree is bland and uninteresting. It's just stat boosts, even creatively bankrupt games like Fallout 4 have more variety of perks and unlockable abilities. I'm not concerned with whether it gets better later in the game. It sucked, so I'm not interested in the rest.\n\n- Throwing items in the game was both hilarious and terrible at the same time. When you take Leverage (I), you're supposed to throw stuff hard enough to damage enemies. The game [i]attempts[/i] to give you this feeling by animating a freaking shockwave behind the item you just threw. But then it falls like 3 feet away from you and the illusion is shattered to pieces, unlike the enemy I just threw the table at. It is also HILARIOUSLY difficult to hit enemies with thrown items. If I throw a god damn table, which is bigger than the mimic itself, it's laughable that it only does like 9 damage, which is barely a quarter of its health. I had to hit it with a thrown table at supersonic speed 4 times to kill it.\n\n- The framerate of the inventory UI is really low for some reason? The rest of my game is moving at 90fps minimum, whereas the squares of my inventory animate at like 20-30fps max. I have no idea how this is a thing.\n\n- All the budget for this game clearly went to Benedict Wong. Shame, because I didn't think his performance was that great, kinda like Keanu Reeves in Cyberpunk 2077. What a waste of development money.\n\n- The funniest thing I experienced was having the poor quality of the game itself spoil the twist in the introduction. Looking out the window of my apartment, everything looked so crappy I instantly thought \"this had better be a simulation\". Turns out, yep it was a simulation. And the game looked terrible even after that fact was made known to me.\n\n[h1]Overall: 2/10[/h1]\nThere is a game here, and that's all I can say about it. It is not a good game, nor one that you should invest time into. There are much better games out there that are actually worthy of your time. I cannot overstate this enough, but no love was put into this game.

Released in 2017, Prey swiftly captured the attention of gamers with its engrossing story, unique gameplay mechanics, and the freedom it offers in exploration.\n\n[h3]Storytelling and Exploration[/h3]\nPrey shines brilliantly in its narrative and explorative aspects. The game is set aboard the Talos I space station, where you are thrown into a world overrun by an alien species known as the Typhon. The storytelling is masterfully woven into the environment. As you navigate through the labyrinthine corridors of the space station, you uncover the plot not just through traditional cutscenes or dialogues, but also via environmental storytelling. Every nook of the station, from the sprawling exteriors to the cramped offices, is filled with lore. Emails, audio logs, and scattered notes create a rich tapestry of stories that tell the tale of Talos I and its inhabitants. This approach to narrative ensures that the more you explore, the deeper your understanding of the game's lore becomes.\n\n[h3]Jump Scares and Atmosphere[/h3]\nThe game brilliantly intersperses its exploration and narrative with well-timed jump scares and a consistently eerie atmosphere. These elements keep you on edge, making the exploration of Talos I both thrilling and unnerving. The unpredictable nature of the Typhon, especially the Mimics which can disguise themselves as almost any inanimate object, adds a layer of suspense and paranoia to the gameplay. This tension is further amplified by the game's sound design, where the hums and groans of the space station blend with the eerie sounds of the alien creatures lurking around.\n\n[h3]Combat and Gameplay Mechanics[/h3]\nCombat in Prey is where the game truly differentiates itself. The range of weapons and gadgets at your disposal is impressive. From conventional firearms to more exotic gear like the GLOO Cannon, which can immobilize enemies and create pathways, the arsenal is diverse and encourages creative combat strategies. The game also introduces neuromods, which allow you to gain alien abilities, adding another layer of depth to combat and exploration. This aspect of the game not only provides a robust combat experience but also impacts how you interact with the environment, solve puzzles, and navigate obstacles.\n\n[h3]Awards and Recognition[/h3]\nThe game's excellence did not go unnoticed. It was nominated for several awards and notably won for Best Narrative. This accolade is a testament to the compelling story and the immersive world the developers crafted. The way the game merges its narrative, environment, and gameplay into a cohesive and engaging experience is truly commendable.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nPrey is more than just a game; it's an experience. It challenges conventional game design with its unique approach to storytelling and exploration. The blend of horror elements, innovative combat, and a deep, engaging story results in a game that is not just entertaining but also intellectually stimulating. Whether you're unraveling the mysteries of Talos I, outsmarting the Typhon, or simply soaking in the atmosphere, Prey offers a rich, fulfilling experience. It's a game that appeals to a wide range of players, from those who enjoy a good story to those who crave strategic combat and exploration. The game stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when innovative game design meets compelling storytelling.\n\n[h3]Playtime Explanation[/h3]\nI finished and played this game for an unknown amount of weeks back in 2017/2018 on a platform other than Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1700027433, "timestamp_updated": 1700107077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518285095691680908", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150152391": {"recommendationid": "150152391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016806922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1365, "last_played": 1577383132}, "language": "english", "review": "Arkane really used to put out bangers", "timestamp_created": 1700024151, "timestamp_updated": 1700024151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150149189": {"recommendationid": "150149189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043913250", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1700017688}, "language": "english", "review": "bought the game for 3 dollars because it was labeled great on deck, couldn't even play it past the buggy intro", "timestamp_created": 1700017861, "timestamp_updated": 1700017861, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475956141948699951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150143201": {"recommendationid": "150143201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060506025", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2488, "last_played": 1643334469}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest games ever, its inarguable.", "timestamp_created": 1700007101, "timestamp_updated": 1700007101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478178024291992188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150142980": {"recommendationid": "150142980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116225618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 799, "playtime_at_review": 822, "last_played": 1700003662}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\ud83e\udde0Great inmersive sim\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f[/h1]\n\nI played the original Prey from 2006 version of 2K but it never ended, a good and forgotten FPS. This game was different because the original was about Indian-American fighting aliens in the 2000s but this game is about neuroscience and space.\n\n[h2]\ud83c\udfaeGameplay[/h2]\n\nThis is an immersive sim FPS similar to Bioshock, Deus Ex, etc... So the gameplay has all the RPG elements of those similar games but does it uniquely. You have elements like having Mimic powers, and weapons similar to the Half-Life series while having to make decisions historywise. There isn't much to say, those elements function very well.\n\n[h2]\ud83d\udcd5History[/h2]\n\nNeuroscience, experiments, low morality? Heck yeah! , you are in a scientific facility that is researching Typhon or Mimics. Something happens and everything goes wrong horribly. Your character, Alex needs to survive and fix this mess.\n\n[h2]\ud83c\udfa8Art[/h2] \n\nThis game is still very pleasing to see, it aged very well. The ambience will scare the shit out of you or feel uneasy because of the Mimics so they did a great effort with the environment, sound design and SFX.

Character animations are noticeably clunky, for example. Not bad by any means, but I've played games from the same period that have held up a little better\n- I particularly liked the setting and overall look of Talos 1. Arkane has a knack for theming environments well\n- The sound design is god-tier. The great thematic soundtrack and the terrifying enemy screeching/roaring/chittering/etc really draw you in. Definitely a game to play with headphones\n- The voice acting is also well done. Good performances all around\n\n[b]Story & Vibes[/b]\n- The story is a high point but contained more twists and turns than it honestly probably needed. I appreciate the writers' efforts to keep things interesting, though. I just wish they'd let the atmosphere do a little more of the talking and focused less on tossing you from plot point to plot point. I did, however, appreciate the post-credit twist despite my complaints\n- Prey isn't really a horror game in the traditional sense. It feels more like a 1st person stealth action game, likely a byproduct of the fact that you'll often have tools or abilities that can conquer or capably evade most threats. Though I do like the little scripted sequences (the elevator one in particular--you'll know what I'm talking about when you experience it) that hammer home that you are, indeed, still playing a game with some scares\n- The overall vibes are ominous, imposing, and mysterious. Paired with the sci-fi setting, it feels very Ridley Scott\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- If you've played Dishonored (another Arkane property), then you'll have a decent sense of how Prey plays. Given that you're on a space base, though, you won't be zipping between rooftops and scrambling up walls all parkour style\n- That doesn't mean that the environment is an unimportant element, however. There's still plenty of branching paths that can take you to your objective. You really can avoid a good deal of combat if you're resourceful or observant enough. As I noted before, the level design is quite good, and that goes beyond appearances and factors meaningfully into gameplay\n- Depending on the difficulty you're playing on, the game can feel very different. Easier difficulties play more like an FPS, but stealth and resource management start becoming increasingly important even on normal difficulty\n- Gear and abilities also play a big part in how your playthrough will go. I did a full human run (no Typhon skills) for this playthough, which resulted in sneak attack, hit-and-run style gameplay that I found kinda fun. Sure, the psychic alien powers may have been more powerful and made me feel like a superhero, but I enjoyed how I had to plan out encounters, ration ammo, and switch weapons to get by with just the human skill trees\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- There just aren't a lot of games like Prey. Alien: Isolation and Dead Space come close to matching the tone and certainly match the setting (while also being stellar games), but those titles are far more straightforward in their respective approaches to gameplay. The immersive sim elements combined with the first-person perspective are simply better at drawing you into the experience and really make Prey stand out in my opinion\n- If you're running modern hardware, you shouldn't experience too many performance issues outside of the rare stutter.

Dahl, es que tienes que dejar todo lo que quisieras hacer porque tienes tiempo y ya una misi\u00f3n de encadena con la siguiente y no puedes terminar lo que te quedaba, no era tan complicado dejar el ritmo como lo estaba durante todo el juego.[/spoiler]\nPero vamos que no es algo que estropee el juego y encima tiene new game+ que viene muy bien si quieres volver a pas\u00e1rtelo en un futuro, lo

Talos I is one of the best designed video game levels ever, a place that feels extremely satisfying and rewarding to explore. Every crewmember has a name whether they are alive or dead, many of them with interesting stories told through audio logs and terminals. It feels great to look around a new area, noting the stories and secrets and the large amount of options you have for how to navigate it and get into locked rooms.\n\nThe GLOO Cannon is an ingenious weapon, serving as both a way to incapacitate enemies in combat and as an aid in exploration, allowing you to create what are effectively bridges and staircases to access areas. The rest of the weapon roster is not as inventive, but is nonetheless still satisfying to use.\n\nThe upgrade system comes with the usual options for a game of this type (like hacking and increased inventory space, for example), but also contains some fun powers to unlock, like the ability to transform into a mug to fit through a small gap. These abilities are unlocked with Neuromods which are found through exploration and can be created with resources through the game's crafting system. There are enough interesting options to choose from that finding Neuromods always feels like a worthwhile reward, even towards the end of the game.\n\nWhile the game has elements of survival horror, resources are fairly easy to come by if you explore thoroughly and the game's difficulty is not too high, at least after the very start of the game. Mimics, enemies that can disguise themselves as objects in the environment, are exciting and tense to deal with at the start, although they become more of a nuisance as the game progresses.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game lies towards the end of it. The enemy variety is severely lacking, with all enemy types appearing long before you have explored the whole station. This is not helped by the game's insistence of new enemies spawning in previously cleared areas, making backtracking somewhat arduous. By the time the game resorts to frequently having to go back through repopulated old areas in its final act, my interest was beginning to wane and I found myself simply sprinting past everything rather than engaging with it. It's not a major flaw, but it is a shame that the game fails to keep up the exceptionally high level of quality it begins with for the entire story.", "timestamp_created": 1697735352, "timestamp_updated": 1697735352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148473955": {"recommendationid": "148473955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829486534", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1979, "last_played": 1698019415}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1697697916, "timestamp_updated": 1697697916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148472817": {"recommendationid": "148472817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108932028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1697695056}, "language": "english", "review": "Can not disable motion blur I am physically unable to play this", "timestamp_created": 1697695098, "timestamp_updated": 1697695098, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 208, "votes_funny": 69, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701431751251220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148466299": {"recommendationid": "148466299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064589211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3752, "last_played": 1698274805}, "language": "english", "review": "Without Argument the best game Arkane Studios ever made!", "timestamp_created": 1697681198, "timestamp_updated": 1697681198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148460421": {"recommendationid": "148460421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126776857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 188, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1594582034}, "language": "english", "review": "I think i never explored it deeply enough and it still was quite a unique and fun experience", "timestamp_created": 1697669911, "timestamp_updated": 1697669911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148425980": {"recommendationid": "148425980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045350746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12584, "last_played": 1696577416}, "language": "english", "review": "Ouch!

The first plot twist sets the tone for the rest of the game and is hard to explain, but I remember being amazed. I wholeheartedly recommend to go blind into this one, so that you don't spoil anything. Don't even watch the trailers. I knew nothing and it was worth it.\nThe core gameplay is full of nice little details and original ideas, and was enjoyable even though I dislike horror genre (but sci-fi is more prevalent here anyway). But the atmosphere is spot on. I also like how it allows you to go from scared as fuck from a single enemy to cautiously but metodically cleaning up.\nThe ending is pretty well executed in my opinion, and also makes you go \"ooooh, so that's why\" and \"now I kinda want to try a different approach\".\nUnderrated game for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1697250213, "timestamp_updated": 1697250317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148162024": {"recommendationid": "148162024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062690074", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1453, "last_played": 1697222255}, "language": "english", "review": "Prey (2017) is good; very *very* good.\n\nI remember also liking the newest Deus Ex games for their clever level designs, where there is always going to be more than one way to skin a cat (for example: getting into a specific room or ambushing an enemy in your favor).\n\nThis game has all of that, except dialed up to eleven! The weapons, the human and alien skills, and more importantly the tools that you get early on, allow you to exploit the vertical heights of interior rooms in the game, and rewards intuitive thinking for how to solve a problem with the tools you have. Keycards, versus hacking, versus brute strength, for example. There is almost always another way.\n\nThe way they have utilized level design in this game alone deserves a thumb up, but there are also other things I want to praise.\n\ni like the consequential nature of the game, and how you as the main character can choose whether to be empathetic and kind or an absolute menace to other characters you meet in the game. Named characters aren't just immortal for story consistency sake, so you get to carve your effect on it as you want.\n\nThe environments have a very interesting look to them which remind me of Bioshock in a way. The game is pretty, and each area is memorable in a different way, barring maybe a couple of zones that don't get used as much in the main story.\n\nThe alien enemy designs are fluidly animated and spectacular, and at the start of the game you are off feeling vulnerable and curious of what enemies do. After \"researching\" and repeated encounters you also promptly get more confident over time, which admittedly can pivot to the game becoming too easy.\n\nEven so, this is why the early hours of the game are precious because they makes you plan your encounters and think about how to approach them cleanly and efficiently. This is where I have to give stealth some credit, even if it becomes a bit outrageous with skill points.\n\nIt's not a horror game per-say, but the immersive experience contributed a lot to me going into a pitch black room and feeling eerie. That's another thing I think should be whole-y embraced early on when you feel weaker in the game.\n\nRegarding performance, I ran into a couple of crashing issues of various kinds when running the game at the highest graphics settings. Setting it from \"Very High\" to \"High\" however was a lot more stable, and I did not run into any other crashes after that until my first play-through was finished.\n\nI can't comment on the DLCs as of yet, though I've heard the feedback is mixed given the focus on a time limit. This game I don't think has that problem very much, which is at least nice.\n\nOverall through, the base game of Prey (2017) I can absolutely recommend buying, even in 2023.\nI can't wait to retry this game on the Steam Deck as well, which I've heard is also a great experience plugged in.", "timestamp_created": 1697234518, "timestamp_updated": 1697235373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148132456": {"recommendationid": "148132456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028431488", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6048, "last_played": 1696722466}, "language": "english", "review": "Prey is an exceptional game!\n\nIt is [b]not a straightforward shooter or pure action game with a story told fully through cutscenes[/b], though! If you want that, look elsewhere, Prey is not it.\n\nPrey is about exploration and creative problem solving with a varied tool set.\nThere are a lot of well planned out interactions between enemies, weapons (shoot glue at a flying enemy, it falls down, takes damage from the fall), electronics and so on. You might not be used to that from other games, because there are few like it, even within the category of immersive sims, so it could take a while to get used to that. But once you do get into it, it's really great!\n\nAlso, I feel like I need to talk about Mooncrash here.\nThe Mooncrash DLC is awesome and amplifies a lot of the exploration and creative problem solving aspects that are so great about the main game. But Mooncrash does an awful job of explaining how it works and how it is meant to be played. The problem is, that it has a complicated structure with roguelike elements and is fully aware of this complexity. So to not overwhelm players, it barely explains anything in the beginning, which makes the game feel relatively pointless in the first few missions/runs (I was disappointed and uninstalled it on my first try). Do stick around and read the explanations after you escape from the base a couple of times. Don't get annoyed by the time limit stuff, it's actually a sensible game design choice here, even if I usually hate time limits. You can counter act the timer fairly well by killing big enemies and collecting loot but it does give you some urgency to get stuff done and lessens the incentives to play the game in an overly cautious and boring way. If you stick around, you'll be rewarded with really satisfying gameplay where you coordinate and plan out your runs with your characters to take advantage of their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe other DLCs are not worth buying.

I'm not sure how to classify it, but its reminiscent of bioshock/systemshock and Deus Ex but with a lot of freedom.  You fight abroad the Talos I, a space station with shape shifting and psionic aliens called Typhon on board that are wreaking havoc.  During your stay, you have access to special powers called neuromods that give you an edge and help augment your abilities.  You can choose to help with objectives around the station and use technology, stealth, or anything in between to get it done.  \n\nOverall, I give it a 5/5!  It is Arkane Studios' best.  I would say that I was expecting something a little more survival-horror oriented, but once you get full control of the reins you don't feel so helpless and the game starts ramping up.  I liked the absolute freedom and how you never \"leveled up\" based on getting points for objectives or if you used stealth or did a pacifist run (I'm looking at you Mankind Divided). This game did not get boggled down by too much crafting or too many side quests, the side quests were not necessary other than to get some extra ammo or neuromod, and the crafting came down to making something out of the existing sandbox rather than customizing a weapon. I liked how every advantage was had by what stash you found while exploring or items you got as a reward and what augments you chose.  It was also great how there were no godlike powers or weapons in this game (again, looking you at Mankind divided), but that being said there were some fun ways to defeat your enemies and weapons that you don't find in other games!

Aunque este juego ha sido calificado con un 6/10, ofrece una experiencia \u00fanica que mezcla elementos de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, horror y exploraci\u00f3n. Aqu\u00ed tienes una revisi\u00f3n detallada del juego:\n\nAmbiente e Inmersi\u00f3n (8/10):\nLa estaci\u00f3n espacial Talos I es un entorno meticulosamente detallado y bien dise\u00f1ado. Desde las \u00e1reas de investigaci\u00f3n hasta los rincones m\u00e1s oscuros y secretos, el juego logra sumergir al jugador en un mundo oscuro y misterioso. La atenci\u00f3n al detalle y la atm\u00f3sfera son puntos destacados, lo que contribuye significativamente a la inmersi\u00f3n del jugador.\n\nJugabilidad y Libertad (7/10):\nPrey ofrece una amplia variedad de habilidades y enfoques para resolver problemas, desde el uso de poderes alien\u00edgenas hasta la modificaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica. Sin embargo, algunas mec\u00e1nicas de juego pueden sentirse desequilibradas y frustrantes en ciertos momentos, lo que puede afectar la experiencia general. La libertad para explorar la estaci\u00f3n espacial y decidir c\u00f3mo enfrentar las situaciones es un punto fuerte, aunque las ejecuciones podr\u00edan haber sido m\u00e1s pulidas.\n\nNarrativa y Personajes (6/10):\nLa historia de Prey comienza intrigante, pero se convierte en un enigma complejo y a menudo confuso a medida que avanza. Los personajes tienen profundidad, pero a veces sus interacciones se sienten forzadas o poco naturales. La trama tiene giros impactantes, pero a veces la ejecuci\u00f3n puede dejar a los jugadores sinti\u00e9ndose desconectados.\n\nRejugabilidad (8/10):\nLa rejugabilidad es un punto fuerte en Prey. La variedad de enfoques y decisiones que puedes tomar tiene un impacto significativo en la experiencia del juego y en el final. Adem\u00e1s, hay numerosos secretos y rutas alternativas que animan a los jugadores a volver y descubrir todo lo que Talos I tiene para ofrecer.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nPrey es un juego ambicioso con una gran cantidad de ideas innovadoras. Aunque no todas estas ideas est\u00e1n completamente pulidas y la narrativa puede volverse confusa, el juego ofrece una experiencia \u00fanica para aquellos que disfrutan de la exploraci\u00f3n y la experimentaci\u00f3n. La libertad que brinda para abordar desaf\u00edos y el mundo detallado en el que se desarrolla hacen que valga la pena explorar Talos I.\n\nCalificaci\u00f3n: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1696715945, "timestamp_updated": 1696715945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147825806": {"recommendationid": "147825806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063941528", "num_games_owned": 768, "num_reviews": 308, "playtime_forever": 1703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1703, "last_played": 1677274300}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece.

Initially there's a lot to unpack, everything is moveable and the Typhon Aliens are intimidating yet this all falls through once you obtain equipment and progress. Despite Prey having an average length of ~16 hours it feels as though it SHOULD have been much shorter to reduce the overall bloat as the enemy-types are lacking alongside an equally small amount of ways to approach them. Free shout-out to the Opening. Most interesting way I've seen credits performed.\n\n\nGameplay:\nThe amount of Typhon enemies are surprisingly few. I won't discuss the alternatives and instead put these in parentheses around the enemy type: Mimic (4), Phantom (3), Nightmare, Poltergeists, Telepath/Technopath, and Cystoids. If that seems like a lot, the Cystoids simply detonate when close to the Player, which is more of a trap. The Nightmare is more of a scripted 'event' type, and the Poltergeists and Weavers are rather rare. I only saw around 4 Poltergeists in my playthrough.\n\nI won't speak much to the Typhon mods but in general those are somewhat lacking (Psychic, Fire, Lightning, Lift, Summons). The main weapons are of two camps, Lethal and Non-Lethal. Non-Lethal are the GLOO Gun and Disruptor. The Lethal are the Pistol, Shotgun, and Beam Emitter. There are Sentries you can use- you can hack to make them friendly if you have Typhon Mods installed or if you have no Typhon Mods they stay friendly. However Sentries are generally useless as it's hard to stage them against enemies (as you need to set them up and in a good location), they always get blasted sideways or backwards preventing them from shooting, and when you return to them from other areas the game will blow up all of your Sentries. Just because. And that's why we recycle Sentries in this household.\n\nA major issue is that once you obtain a decent amount of NeuroMods/Upgrades there's no longer a need to ever engage the Typhon in combat. The Fabricator allows Players to craft more rewards than necessary which speeds this process along, especially with the handy Recycling Grenades that turn objects into Materials. This led to me sprinting past nearly every Typhon except those required, which made combat feel more of a chore than something with potential rewards. \n\nCombat is lacking as the Devs focused on allowing a no-NeuroMod playthrough as an optional choice. This results in Players dealing less damage, having less options and upgrades, having less loot as you cannot access more areas, and so on and so forth. Instead of balancing the game around the upgrades Arkane yet again said 'No you don't WANT that'. Which results in any upgrades feeling cheap as there was no balance centered around them.\n\nThe exploration in the game is fantastic, and I enjoyed how interconnected everything was. I liked being able to eject out of one airlock and zooooooom my way to the other side of the station. It's actually crazy cool. So Combat kinda blows but exploring can be fun- especially because I crawl over every cranny looking for scraps. There are TONS of details to this game and tons of logs to read through, programming such fine detail must've been an ordeal. I can give that level of detail nothing but praise with the Achilles heel being the combat.\n\n\nInventory:\nThe game tries to do the grid-based inventory similar to Resident Evil but utterly fails. There's too much trash to pick up which requires much larger inventories and there's no storage which means Players will be hefting around every single Weapon anyways. Combine that with grenades, ammo, and healing- it's just far too much clutter to even be trying to say there needs to be inventory management. I love games that DO actual inventory management but this was half-heartedly done and just gets to be an annoyance rather than a part of the game system. \n\n\n[spoiler] \nStory Progression:\nThe game is a whole lot of go here BUT WAIT, go here first and then come back! It first happens when you hit Morgan Yu's Office. Play the video, it gets interrupted, go into hardware and recover the video to return to the office to finish viewing. So we head to Deep Inventory BUT WAIT, go to Crew Quarters and then you can return to Deep Inventory. Okay we go through that and then go back to the Arboretum to speak with Alex BUT WAIT, you need to scan the Typhon. Okay we do that and return to the Arboretum BUT WAIT, Dahl is trying to supermurder everyone okay we go deal with that and head back to the Arboretum BUT WAIT, the Typhon Alpha appeared and now we need to scramble to do either the EMP or Self-Destruct sequence... THAT WE WERE ALREADY GOING TO DO WITHOUT IT APPEARING. \n\nThe main issue here is that too much stuff is set up right at the start. You immediately are told about doing the Self-Destruct sequence so when you get to the Arboretum it's like the game is nearly finished because Morgan's Arming Key is half the process. The game keeps dangling keys trying to delay the Player. It could have been written to be more engaging rather than show all of it's cards at the start and TRY to figure out ways for why it doesn't all just come together. Alex could've shown you the Arboretum video the second you hit Morgan's Office. That changes a lot considering you spend the first half of the game getting your Arming Key only for Alex to show this video to convince you otherwise. Alex is acting far more weird than Morgan the entire time. There was a point I thought that Alex was dead because I'd never seen him in person and it was someone else using me through his voice. Guess that would've been too clever.\n\n\nThe Ending:\nThe entire time the game was a simulation of what Morgan Yu COULD HAVE experienced during the Typhon Outbreak which means any of the choices you make have no impact as it has already happened. Earth was infected by the Typhon no matter what you chose. Now this isn't to say that everything was pointless- as the point is to influence you as the Player to become a Typhon who is capable of emoting with Humans. The Ending choice of Kill or Save can ONLY be chosen if the Player acted with empathy. The Kill choice is giving in to the Typhon Nature which seems to be what the Devs were aiming at but fails because of the way it's presented.\n\nThe reasoning is that it removes Player agency which causes MOST players to behave in a positive way. I do not believe Players that go out of their way to be Empathetic would then turn around and act like a Typhon but similarly Players who are 'evil' get turned away entirely with the 'restart' ending. And how do you fix it while keeping the intent intact? You simply repeat the Lab Simulations again. It's here you can break the window and attack your captors or choose to obey. Because of this format I believe players would choose to attack and fulfill the purpose of a Typhon simply mimicking empathy without comprehension.

Even spacewalking across the [b] entire station [/b] is a great option for getting from one side to the other quickly. You'll need to open doors, fix elevators and clear debris to access the entire station, but how and when you do those things is given a surprising amount of freedom. You will get familiar with the enemies you face, the weapons and tools at your disposal, what upgrades you choose and how they help you, and the Talos I space station itself, and all of it connects beautifully. \n\nWhen I finished Prey I [i] immediately [/i] started a new run because I wanted to try using different upgrades on my character and make different decisions in the story, and I've been returning to it periodically ever since.

When you start out you'll be slowly hitting every inanimate object you come across to check if its a mimic waiting to kill you. By the end you'll be bunny jumping across rooms destroying anyone and anything that DARES gets in your way. If you spec too many ability points into alien majek the human friendly defense turrets will start targeting you unless you crafted it or hacked it yourself. \n\nEnding twist blew my mind tbh. Its one thing to read about it online but to actually experience it, its just not the same. You won't be able to grab every ability upgrade in your first play through and exploring everything is rewarding because thats how you get new and upgraded abilities. I kinda like this system it feels both restrictive and liberating at the same time. I think the reason this game didn't do as well as it hoped was because people gave up half way through because it was annoying to be constantly paranoid of every single object potentially being a mimic. And this paranoia doesn't really go away until later in the game when you've explored all the maps. The mimics eventually become a mild inconvenience but then its role is taken up by some new freaky alien ready to kill with harry potter majek. \n\nAnd this annoying fear and paranoia only continues when you meet more nasty aliens. Imagine walking past someone's office desk and you have to wonder if any books, staplers, trash cans, coffee mugs, pencils, anything is actually an enemy just waiting for you to let your guard down to jump you. But you get access to ways to detect them midway through the game. One tip mimics can only replicate items in their very immediate vicinity. So if you see a lunch table with an unusual amount of chairs pulled up to it, one of them could be a mimic or maybe a group of friends decided to pull up chairs for a conversation huddle before everything went to shit. Who knows better safe than sorry smack the chairs and hope you don't run into one while u run out of stamina. There are so many locked doors with key cards, sticky notes and audio logs with codes left on dead people, hidden under a book on a near by table, but I spend an abnormal amount of time using the toy cross bow to ricochet the harmless foam projectile trying to perfectly hit the manual open button on the side of the door that I couldn't get access to. Or you could spec into alien skills and turn into a clipboard small enough to fit through the broken window you just smashed with your wrench. Up to you but if you try to spec into everything melee, tech, stealth, aliens, etc. you won't have enough skill points to grab everything especially if you aren't doing every side objective. Because to upgrade skills in this game you find them in secrets, private safes, on the floor, crafted etc. but you will never have enough resources to do everything in a single play through. \n\nYou can fly around in space or zones with broken zero gravity this is when you are the most vulnerable, slowest and the objective way points get fucked up the most. All of us are used to having two Axis of movement (1) front back, (2) up down but in space you have a 3rd Axis of rotation (3) clockwise counter clockwise. Its confusing and the mini map is the least useful because trying to program a way point system for this would have been incredibly difficult and time consuming (time affects cost of production because of employee salaries). As an employer skipping the implementation, costs less money for me and as a programmer it is less complicated work for me. So skipping that is just a win win for everyone except players trying to navigate themselves which isn't impossible but difficult to get used to. Speaking of programming I need to get started on my python assignment. I have no idea what I'm doing and all the syntax resources are from different places because of how broad python is. Welp fuck me.  \n\nThis is one of those games where completing it to the end is actually a sort of commendation similar to completing dark souls 3. Proving your resilience and tenacity as a gamer without it feeling like complete horse shit. Dark souls 1 and 2 had a fair amount of horse shit that just felt unfair. Dark souls 3 and this game it feels reasonable and problems can be solved creatively using the tools you spec'd into. But given the nature of this game and the twist at the end I can see why they canceled the sequel it just wouldn't feel right and the game dynamics wouldn't feel the same given the twist at the end. \n\ntldr; \nSemi spooky scary game with constant tension, resource management and creative freedom to solve problems based on what abilities and available resources you have on you. Going through the game can be rough as this tension and fear is fairly constant throughout the entire play through up until the end when you know the maps like the back of your hand. \n\n\nTo get the max experience from your first play though I recommend specing into alien majek. The consequences are daunting but this is how the devs envisioned players playing the game even if players can choose not to. Like 2 or 3 rooms out of the hundreds can't be accessed at all without the alien morph ability that mimics have. These are inconsequential but annoying if you don't have the skill. As thorough as I like to be (100% map completion in an Assassins Creed or far cry game) there are still a few nooks and crannies I didn't bother with.

Just thought it was paced a bit slow and while the premise and the intro was extremely cool, the spectacle of that wears off fast and you're just left with not much gameplay.\n\nPrey feels like someone decided they wanted to mod Bioshock to make it fun for me personally.  I found the plot a little more compelling, the gameplay a little more interesting, the resource management a little more interesting, there's good crafting elements, the skill upgrades feel better done, the exploring feels more interesting, and you can actually go outside the space station and do things and find things.\n\nThat being said the game does feel just a little bit meh after long enough and the ending is weak, a complaint I've heard from multiple people.  The game very intentionally is set up so that you always feel outmatched, hence the name 'Prey', but I do feel like after awhile having no sense of progress or victory just wears on you.  You're very often gaining some new ability right about one step behind when it would have been useful.  You might have some really intense fight trying to take out a tough boss in a room, setting up all kinds of clever traps and ploys and along with some good luck you kill it, only to go out of the airlock to grab something and you come back in and now there are two.  I understand the feeling they are trying to evoke, but it's just a bit too often that the only viable strategy is pretty boring or even cheesy.  Even if you're trying to create a sense of being overwhelmed, you gotta give me a little space to occasionally feel a victory.

It's fine at first, but by the end you just want people to shut the fuck up and stop giving you pointless side missions. It doesn't help that most of the main story missions also feel like nonsense busy work. \n\nDo you like side quests in games? Hey, me too, dude. But the side quests in this game have you running all over the entire GIANT map to press 'F' and loot a body or chest. None of the things you will find feel like it was worth your time to search an entire warehouse full of shit for one hidden corpse with a crafting recipe for foam darts. Yes. There's no real reward other than making the quest markers go away. \n\nNear end game and I have no ammo, materials to create ammo, or desire to continue.

These power mechanics offer diverse and creative ways to achieve certain objectives which really makes for a more immersive gaming experience, and which in my view, is unparalleled within this FPS action genre.\n\nAdditionally, the way the Steam achievement system works with this game really added to the game's appeal too, as it motivated me to replay the game three times (consecutively) in order to unlock every achievement.

There is everything fans of the genre could expect of, all done with high production standards. Talos I isn't as dreadful and desolated as Citadel Station or the Von Braun, but good part of this is because it really looks and feels like a real place, where people live and work, and all the stuff is happening while you play (in short, it's not supposed to be a derelict station).\n\nThere is a lot to discover, and my second playthough was way longer than the first one, when I followed the main story more straighforwardly. And all of that without even installing a single typhon neuromod, which I'm saving for a third run. The game's difficulty is on the low side overall, so if you are a System Shock 2 veteran you may go for Nightmare difficulty in your first playthrough without problem (and with all survival settings on, for sure). Enemies will be really tough and dangerous, but you'll end up swimming in resources in short time. There are mods that \"survival up\" the game, although I still didn't try them.\n\nI just modded one gameplay thing because it was more annoying than challenging, and that was [spoiler] the Nightmare appearances. They boiled down to simply running, hunkering down under a table and staring at the screen for three minutes until the timer went off. The game's AI should be much better than it is to really give you a feeling of being hunted, so I just removed it completely. [/spoiler]\n\n\nThe graphics are good in general, but anti-aliasing is abysmal, to the point of actually harming the experience. I highly recommend to download a graphics improvement mod to get rid of that. \"Real Lights plus Ultra Graphics\" available in Nexusmods solve the issue and give you many other improvements. I had a few glitches in Talos Exterior and FPS drops in Arboretum that may be related to it, but they were minor things compared to the huge improvement.

However, seeing it on sale, I came back to it again recently on steam. Unlike my much younger self, I would say I have a far greater appreciation for certain atmospheres of games, especially in the Sci-Fi setting, and I am enthralled by this game setting, and I am very close to finishing the game.\n\nI'd like to say that the atmosphere of this game is incredible, the start of the game starts mysterious, and the more you explore this empty station you get more and more questions. The names of crew members can be hard to follow at times and the plot, but if you stay focused it really follows up on itself. You become ingrained in the plot the more you explore, wondering what happened to everyone and what WILL happen the more you explore. If you play on HARD (my personal recommendation) you really have to choose between sneaking at first or killing everything, sometimes not having a choice. Every room feels unique, the atmosphere constantly Regal yet Scientifically focused. This game's design is unlike every other, recently Starfield has been able to come close but the NASA-esqueness it has just doesn't fill the same hole. The sheer amount of science it has dumped into it and the \"lore\" is incredible (even history with the USSR and US is fun too).\n\nThe combat for the game is thrilling because at any random moment I could have just exploded and get jump scared by an enemy (such as the Nightmare, such a unique experience). The aesthetic is everywhere from the music (lovely) to the environmental design (perfection), to even just the weapons (simple but enjoyable).\n\nOne of the little things I do in the game is just walk around, exploring the wonderful areas it has, even admiring the way it changes the further you go along with the Coral spreading everywhere and the Typhon themselves are such a unique enemy, especially playing what is essentially Prop Hunt with the mimics. The frustration / fear that I would get at seeing certain enemies and playing peek-a-boo or destroying them. There is no part of this game (other than the faces of crew mates) that wasn't lovingly detailed and has REAL work put into it.\n\nThe inclusion of the lesbian relationship was quite nice because there was work put into it that made it part of the story, even going so far as to help murder the man who killed the one girlfriend. I feel a major part of why people dislike modern gaming is the inclusion of LGBT at every given opportunity but it is put into Prey so casually it felt fitting, like sure why wouldn't there be some lesbians there when they are dedicated scientists trying to help better things with lore and backstory and everything.\n\nI love this game, I have very little negative to say in anything about it. It may get annoying at times, but never BAD.

The first time I played it, I got to the main lobby, looked at all the different exits and options and thought \"this is System Shock. I'm not mentally in the right place. I need to come back to this so if it does turn out good, I can appreciate it better.\" I did that, putting it off for the rare reason of appreciation, instead of disgust. Normally when I quit a game to come back later, it's because I can tell from the Tutorial, Prologue and Intro of a game that I won't like it. I come back purely to finish it for the mental checklist.\n\nI came back to play it in 2020. I enjoyed it a lot, with the game living up to the expectations I had. It continues the post-Bioshock tradition of simplified stats, but I enjoyed this so much more. It doesn't get trapped in the easy antagonism that Bioshock uses for all it's games. I found myself thinking of Star Trek while playing. Star Trek had villains, but it also had characters that were antagonists. These are characters who are opposed to our protagonists on a cultural or ideological level. They're not killing for fun and they're not attempting to gain domination over all they survey. Despite what the writers of Bioshock might think, people aren't evil based on an On/Off switch inside their brain. It's not a binary. It also uses the unreliable narrator trope, or a variant thereof, a lot better than Bioshock Infinite tried to do with their terrible ending. I would also argue it's a more subtle critique of capitalism, as opposed to Bioshock's pseudo-Libertarian world.\n\nThemes and comparison's aside, the game looks good, runs well, plays well.\nMy usual pre-flight checks of raw mouse input and higher FOV went off without a hitch, no text editing required. I very rarely had the game drop below 60fps, with it generally running around 100fps. I experienced the most lag during two points. The first being the coral sections in general, but especially the G.U.T.S. and when multiple Military drones were active firing lasers at once. It was still above 60fps, but there would be small freezing sometimes. There was one crash I had for unknown reasons. I had just exited Psyotronics and when I attempted to load back in  the game froze and I had to end the process. Besides this, it ran fine.\n\nJump scares are normally something I despise in general. It's a surprise and you flinch, but you're not scared. It's a reflex. It's on the same emotional level as a fly in your face or a ball coming towards you. They're a tool to be used, but a bad creator will make it their only tool, for evidence see the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise or the Paranormal Activity horror movies. This game earns the moments where it surprises you, although I wouldn't call it a horror game. The mimic enemies fooled me several times even with the detection addons. There is one very notable jump-scare. [spoiler]There's a screen that requires calibration and when you press the final dot for calibration a phantom enemy appears on the screen and attacks you. Once you calm down and realise it was just a recording, a real phantom spawns somewhere out of your field of vision and attacks you. It didn't really affect me that much, not because I'm not a wimp, but because the moment the false phantom showed up I hit it with a wrench, breaking the screen. I then heard the phantom making noise, so I hid until it was visible. In researching this room and the onscreen video, I found out that most people had been scared by this and I can see why.[/spoiler] It's very effective at lowering your guard in a comfortable environment doing mundane things. It's essentially an in-game version of that Maze Game prank from 2005 or so. Beyond that I think that you have a good chance of working out what objects are mimics even without an add-on, so it's a fair fight for an observant player and the jump scares from a missed mimic are earned.\n\nThe sound design is great. A lot of games struggle with what to do with sound in space. They tend to either accept the rule of cool and give it noises or be simplistic and make it completely silent. Both are unrealistic, but the pedants get more angry at the first case because they hate fun and they read a children's fact book once that explained the concept of a vaccuum. Prey uses it as an opportunity. The outside is silent, but inside your suit you hear breathing, your fired weaponry creates vibrations, you hear escaping or jettisoned gases from your suit or thrusters. It changes the way you interpret a fight when you lose the advantage of hearing and it's fun. All the voice actors do great. Alex Yu's voice actor Benedict Wong gets a lot of dialogue and he does great, although sometimes I thought of Zoidberg from Futurama with some of his line deliveries. He's a fun casting choice too because he was in two great Sci-Fi films, 2007's Sunshine and 2009's Moon. He was also in Prometheus, which wasn't a good movie, but the mimics are influenced by the facehuggers a little, so there's a tenuous link. Morgan Yu's voice actors get stuck with the majority of the lines in game, either through recordings of themself or through January. This most recent playthrough I played as a Male Morgan Yu, however on my first two playthroughs I chose the Female Morgan Yu. I can't remember much about it, but I remember liking her work. She's voiced by Sumalee Montano and has apparently done a whole bunch of games. I can't comment on her specifically because of how long ago it was, but I wouldn't want to forget about her work. Tim Kang is the voice actor for the male Morgan and does great. The only thing I've heard him in was Mirror's Edge Catalyst as Dogen, a crime lord. He was fine from memory but I think that's all anyone could be with that game. Anyway, he was very believable as a character, regardless of whether he was portraying the original version of Morgan, [spoiler]Morgan after he gradually changes personality[/spoiler] and January. The rest of the cast were all good in their roles as well, I don't recall a line delivery I would call unrealistic for the situation.\n\n[spoiler]One other voice actor related gag I wanted to note. In Psyotronics, a prisoner with a long rap sheet is asking to be released. You can release him, leave him trapped or kill him via Typhon. While the voice acting itself wasn't anything special, I have to note that the character is portrayed by Walton Goggins, who I think I've only ever see play villains before. If I had recognised him I probably would have thought twice before letting him out, but luckily my shotgun helped comfort me during my time of mistrust. For the record, the character ended up being true to his word.[/spoiler]\n\nI think the story was logical. I never felt blind-sided or that things weren't explained to me. I had questions and I think they were all answered or kept ambiguous.\n\nPrior to this game, there was another game released as Prey. I want to mention it because of the name mostly. This game is very appropriate for the title Prey. The original game seemed unrelated to the title. I was never a big fan of the original title in general, the only part that I found notable was for having the main character and a few others be Native American, specifically Cherokee, for not making said characters into horrible stereotypes or Turok ripoffs and for actually hiring Native Americans to voice those characters. A very respectful thing to do that some major film studios don't even bother with. I think the series should have continued, but the series should have been retitled. The original Prey hasn't been available on Steam for years and never available on other storefronts, so it's a moot point from a buyer's standpoint, but it annoys me when I want to talk about one or the other and have to clarify which one I'm talking about. Prey is a great title for a game, but was a lousy title for the 2006 game.", "timestamp_created": 1694302899, "timestamp_updated": 1694302899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146011888": {"recommendationid": "146011888", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060817481", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1694301467}, "language": "english", "review": "mimic was scary\nmade me alt f4", "timestamp_created": 1694295952, "timestamp_updated": 1694295952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145999780": {"recommendationid": "145999780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074870847", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1195, "last_played": 1695645568}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a 10/10, don't google anything, don't look for spoilers", "timestamp_created": 1694283066, "timestamp_updated": 1694283066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145994672": {"recommendationid": "145994672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024970436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 843, "last_played": 1694603752}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and game play are quite good.

I've tried to play it multiple times, each time getting a little bit further but inevitably giving up on it and then restarting from the beginning the next time I picked it up.\n\nPrey is... very unapproachable to most people, at first anyway. It's very, very overwhelming right from the get-go. The space station is massive, like absolutely huge. Even now with 49 hours of playtime, I still haven't seen every area in this game. What makes the game feel even bigger though is that it's PACKED with stuff. I'm talking items, audio logs, secret passageways, locked doors, secret side quests and more. I really can't express how much of a learning curve there is here, and if you decide to give this game a go I highly recommend trying to stick with it and keep in mind it's a very slow-paced game and gets better as it goes on.\n\nWhen I say this game is slow-paced, I mean that there's an emphasis on avoiding combat if you can, especially in the early game. Bioshock this is not, your weapons do very little damage at first and the enemies you go up against do SO much damage to you so generally you are better off trying to get the drop on enemies or just outright avoiding them until you get your hands on better upgrades. You'll die in 3-4 hits from starter enemies and they move very rambunctiously, it's hard to get a grasp on when they attack because their telegraphs are hard to read. I found the difficulty to be pretty frustrating for the longest time, until I learned how to deal with enemies and build my character around it.\n\nThe reason I just wrote three paragraphs talking about how dang hard this game is to get into at first is because I want you to understand what you're getting into, and that it's worth it if you can get past that steep learning curve. After a while of playing I eventually hit a point where everything just... clicked. I understood what I was supposed to do, I managed my resources right and maximized recycling and explored every nook and cranny I could for neuro-mods and ammo. And this is when the game turns incredible. Like, modern masterpiece level of good.\n\nThe game suddenly turns from a frustrating chore into one of the best immersive sims I've ever played. With the annoyances out of the way I started to notice and appreciate the amount of detail and effort that's gone into this world and the different ways you can play and build your character.  It feels very 90's in the best way possible, like a modern version of System Shock 2 but with it's own twist. \n\nI don't think the game is perfect or anything, but the enjoyment I got out of this thing once I learned what it was trying to do was really surprising and tons of fun. It's a very technical and almost hardcore game but extremely rewarding if you can take the time to learn it and I definitely recommend Prey if you have the patience for it.", "timestamp_created": 1694113211, "timestamp_updated": 1694113710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772917687892913818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145866953": {"recommendationid": "145866953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307359938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2792, "last_played": 1691721750}, "language": "english", "review": "From back when Arcane used to make good games", "timestamp_created": 1694110377, "timestamp_updated": 1694110377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145847532": {"recommendationid": "145847532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059043650", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1967, "last_played": 1693929701}, "language": "english", "review": "Suit feedback:\nTHIRD DEGREE BURNS\nSKELETAL TRAUMA\nCONCUSSION\nWEAPON OFFLINE\nRADIATION SICKNESS\nSUIT INTEGRITY DAMAGED\nWEAPON MALFUNCTION\nHEMORRHAGING\n\n10/10 would survival mode again", "timestamp_created": 1694089125, "timestamp_updated": 1694089125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145820304": {"recommendationid": "145820304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078883932", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3616, "last_played": 1637617761}, "language": "english", "review": "My personal Favorite Arkane Studios game.

But from the beginning I got the feeling that i set the wrong difficulty level and after a while I got more and more frustrated and annoyed by the insolubility of so many problems and situations. Many times the only way to progress is by trying multiple times (with getting killed inbetween), which I find stupid and old-fashioned. It brings one to quick save every two minutes for which of course there is no hotkey so you need to interrupt the game flow every time. \n\nAs with many games it is too much about collecting and looting and thinking about what skill to acquire next, only in this case collecting materials has the extra frustration of never being enough to really be able to acquire something useful. I guess it was meant that way, surviving with constant shortage of everything, but somehow in this game this aspect was only frustrating to me. Furthermore the games was advertised as shooter and the one thing you can never do in this game without considering every bullet is shoot.\n\nI played and loved Dishonored 2, thats why I bought this game. I completed Dishonored 2 with 0 kills and never got that frustrated as with Prey.\n\nLast but not least: the game is bugged, I got stuck inbetween objects and glitched several times, also a few crashes while loading a new level.

Only in this game can you kill every single person on this station, using the most obtuse ways ranging from stealthy take-downs and well placed traps, to psychotic run-and-gun methods and propelling furniture at lethal velocities, only to then choose to LEAVE the station and have the person that you just killed break the 4th wall and pull the plug. I should clarify and say that this wasn't how my first play through went (this was my 2nd) and that the story is a genuine mindfuck start to finish. Despite it not having any connection whatsoever to the previous Prey game, it still remains as a captivating story that tests the empathetic nature of the player rather than the character you play as, with subtle hints along the story's path that things may not seem what they really seem to be (i.e. All in Le Head of Le Head???). I find the combat to be really fun and intense, trying to figure out what is a mimic and where other typhons are attacking from, or whether or not I'm going insane and smashing an assortment of fine china when there's no enemy in the room I'm in (shotgun is REALLY op). I think Arkane's take on New Game+ for this is neat, letting you keep neuromods, but I feel it makes things WAY too easy, even on Nightmare difficulties with weapon deterioration and health effects selected. So, I advise staying away from NG+ if you still want a challenging experience, but if you want to have it on for fast runs, go for it! It's a shame that this game didn't get as much traction back in 2017, this truly is an underrated gem, and I have yet to play the Mooncrash dlc.

The story and the curiosity it created was enough for a Yes on my end, but I don't think you'd be missing all that much if you didn't play Prey.\n\nPrey essentially tells a story that grabs your interest quickly, but it does so in quite a tedious way. Halfway through the game, the novelty of the enemies had vanished and I was disillusioned of the complexity of the tasks. It eventually becomes \"go from point A to point B\" and has close to no challenge. There are a lot of side quests that pile up on that same logic, making things even more tedious if you choose to do them. Halfway through the game pretty much every challenge had become trivial as enemies are overused turning mimics into something gimmicky and the bigger foes into a matter of how much ammo you have. This basically means the horror aspect of the game dies pretty quickly.\n\nThis could have been a more immersive and balanced out game if there were more stages to the story. As it is, you're playing the stretched out ending of the game from about the initial hour or 2 of the game.  You're also given a ton of tools and skills. It was fun to experiment with them but a majority of them became redundant very quickly.\n\nI believe this game could have used another 15 hours or so of story.

The story starts very intriguing, to put it mildly. I doubt many people can witness Prey\u2019s mind-bending opening and not want to get to the bottom of the mystery. In terms of interesting situations, level design, player agency and all that jazz this game is so ahead of the competition that it\u2019s not even funny. Enemy variety could use some work, I guess, but action is not the star of the show here so it\u2019s forgivable. \n\nSo, you explore the station top to bottom, finish all the loose ends there and you are ready for it to be over. Game overstays its welcome a little by this point, but nothing too outrageous. It\u2019s all well and good. \n\nAnd then game slaps you with overtime. \n\nAnd oh boy is this most boring, tedious and unnecessary overtime ever. There is nothing new to explore, there is no one interesting to meet, and you just do a lot of \u00abgo there, slap the button\u00bb busy work all over the station while fighting generic flying pew-pew robots. It\u2019s absolutely mind-numbing stuff. \n\nAnd then Prey ends. \n\nIt has the twist ending and it\u2019s insulting. This kind of ending was old and tired ages ago, it invalidates every player decision up to this point, and it even fails at being unexpected. Seriously, they outright spoiled it to every imsim player worth their salt in the middle of the game. There is DO NOT GO THERE moment around midpoint and of course everyone will save the game and freaking go there. It\u2019s imsim, it\u2019s in DNA of the genre. Everyone will go there and everyone will be slapped with the biggest spoiler in the game way too early. Who does that? Screw it, if you for whatever reasons want to experience the ending as it should be \u2013 DO NOT try to escape the station early. \n\nThis game has problems. The core of it is still way too amazing to give it the negative review, but it could\u2019ve been solid 10/10 experience if devs practiced some restraint.

There's a lot to like, but there's enough bad to make me want to stop playing. And that's a shame, because it's clear the developers sincerely care about this genre.\n\nFirst, the good. The visual design and atmosphere is unparalleled. It really does feel like you're floating adrift a dying space station. If you're an immersive sim purist who loves scouring every inch of the map for notes, keycards, codes, and random tidbits, then this game will likely satisfy your itch. A lot of effort went into designing the maps to allow players with multiple options to traverse the space station by investigating every nook and cranny. The talent system via neuromods is exciting. I loved being able to build my character in a ton of different ways including some abilities which make you superpowered in some regards. Picking up items and throwing them at enemies with leverage was genuinely fun. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. \n\nWhile there's plenty to explore and investigate, it ultimately feels quite pointless when there's nothing truly compelling to push you forward. Game design which revolves around picking up random objects around the map isn't anything new. Previous games like Thief, Deus Ex, and System Shock locked that up decades ago. Prey doesn't bring much new to the table in that regard. That's a problem because while those previously mentioned games had interesting stories and characters, Prey doesn't. There isn't an established singular antagonist until well into the game. Sure, there's Typhon creatures wandering the station, but they're just mindless blobs without an established motive. That wouldn't be a problem if the mysterious elements of the game were enough to keep you going, but the story pacing makes the mystery fade away. About 8 hours in, I found myself forgetting what I was really trying to accomplish in the main story and then realized that I just didn't care. I was exploring for the sake of exploring and to make sure I had enough \"materials\" to keep my inventory going.\n\nWhich leads to the next problem: inventory management. The recycler and fabricator is an interesting concept, but I found it to be more tedious than fun. You have to spend a lot of time picking up trash around the map to recycle and ultimately fabricate items to use. I think I would have preferred less trash and more items without the need to fabricate anything. It felt like an unfun intermediate step.\n\nThe audio also really bothered me. At first, it was fun to be spooked by a mimic and its accompanying audio twang, but eventually it grated on me and became annoying. And what's with the audio cue radius in this game? I swear it would make the screeching spooky noises for creatures multiple rooms away from me. Or when you're wandering around and an operator suddenly screams HELLO MR. YU even though you're no where near it. It breaks the \"immersion\" part of the genre when the audio is so off.\n\nThe combat and enemy system has a lot to be desired. The enemy design started off interesting but never proceeded beyond various forms of black goo. Mimics were fun until they weren't. Phantoms and poltergeists were never fun. The two enemies you're introduced to in the first 15 minutes are the only two you see for most of the game (including their variations). Yes, you'll run into bigger baddies but they're few and far between. You better enjoy dealing with mimics and phantoms.\n\nWhile this game emphasizes that running, hiding, and sneaking is a valid tactic, I found that they aren't in reality. If you want to explore and investigate every room like this genre encourages you to do, then you're going to run into a lot of combat sequences. That's a problem because the combat is clunky. I'm not expecting this game to be a Doom-like action shooter, but I do expect gunplay to feel satisfying. Enemies are sometimes bullet sponges, which requires you to fabricate more bullets, which requires you to explore for more junk, which causes you to end up in more combat. Your weapon choice consists of far too many non-lethal options, most of which appear to be various forms of grenades.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game. It's polished and had a lot of potential, but ultimately felt a little flat without a compelling reason to continue immersing myself in the sim.", "timestamp_created": 1692537501, "timestamp_updated": 1692537501, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616757392883300781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144636840": {"recommendationid": "144636840", "author": {"steamid": "76561199143498787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 711, "last_played": 1692632660}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1692532722, "timestamp_updated": 1692532722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144621457": {"recommendationid": "144621457", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990220515", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 122, "playtime_forever": 2448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2448, "last_played": 1692514732}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good shooter/rpg game with Deus Ex & System Shock vibes.

It ran its course, but I wish there was more to this\n[*]The vignette when you crouch is annoying and lame\n[*]Some areas have dialog triggers right next to encounters with enemies, and most live conversations aren't saved as audio logs, which is really lame. I missed a few pieces of dialogue due to this\n[*]The Nightmare is a fantastic concept but ends up being really poorly done. Nearly every time I interacted with the Nightmare it somehow glitched out in a very noticeable way. It also doesn't hunt well enough. It also just straight up disappears when the timer ends.\n[*]There's a bug with a golden gun you can obtain via a sidequest where it shows the wrong damage numbers, which makes it look worse than the default pistol.\n[*]Another bug where the fire in the shuttle bay was invisible, with only the light surrounding it informing you where the fire is generally\n[*]Some side quests are just lame (DnD one; it ends with you guessing passcode combinations (there are 24))\n[*]PONR without directly spelling it out to the player which locks you out of sidequests is lame and no amount of muh immersion cope will ever fix it\n[*]Sometimes objective complete notifications or calls will interrupt serious or scary moments, breaking the tension\n[*]Hacking is far too simple and overstays its welcome. It's not horrible, it's just not fun the 80th time you do it. Also the time allotted for level 3 and 4 hacking is too much. Level 2 is actually the hardest, so poor balancing as well\n[*]Notification system is lame and overbearing at times. Sometimes it needlessly holds your hand as well, but that's an incredibly difficult thing to balance. I personally would wait before entering combat or entering a zone for notifications and story beats to fully play out so I didn't miss anything.

You get to explore a derelict space station, play literal hide and seek with aliens and make decisions that impact the rest of the game and the ending, like choosing who to trust or who to kill. There are a lot of secrets path and many different ways to approach objectives - you can learn skills like hacking or repairing to open up paths, and eventually even learn alien abilities if you so choose.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, the atmosphere is great and the game feels downright scary and claustrophobic at times, with aliens disguising as objects so you always have to be cautious - at least up to a certain point, if you distribute your skill points right; you'll become pretty powerful eventually. My only complaint is that, towards the end of the game, enemy spawns can become very oppressive, forcing you to either run away from everything or use your very limited resources more than you may like. I guess it does force you to pick your battles.\n\nAnyway, Prey is a very immersive, fun FPS with many secrets, different ways to approach objectives and choices you can make to shape your playthrough.

However, I've justabouts one thing to say that holds it back for me:\n\nThe difficulty is non-existent, specifically I'm not convinced the current save system was a good decision for the game's balance.\n\nThe combat, the resource management, basically anything that would offer some form of challenge to those looking for it is trivialized by the fact you can quick load a quick save basically whenever you want. There's no real consequence to doing it beyond your own pride (and since dying force requires loading a save anyway, who even cares?), results are near instant so the ease practically encourages it, and it's not a system I can really tell players NOT to use because who wants to spend ten minutes looting a bunch of rooms and then run into an electrical grid out the corner of your eye and get all your busy-work progress reset? In acknowledgement of the more tedious alternative it's better that it exists, but only because the game is already designed with it in mind and removing it is like removing objective markers in a generic open world game.\n\nWhat that means in practice though, is that in my complete Prey run on nightmare + survival mode, I never had to worry about the serious statuses (they go away when I die, I don't want to waste resources cleansing them), I never took combat seriously (even less so when I did get good at it), and I used 4 medkits, crafted 0. and recycled 20 - 40 suit repairs because it never mattered how low my health/integrity got cause the only health point that matters is your last one. I might as well have been playing on easy.\n\nOtherwise, if you can look past that I think there's a pretty solid game here (just not the fucking hacking mini-game, I would've easily spent 20 neoromods to delete them from my run).", "timestamp_created": 1691865317, "timestamp_updated": 1691865317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144019585": {"recommendationid": "144019585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022232386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2873, "last_played": 1585452262}, "language": "english", "review": "Tbh,  I have no idea why the game is not a big hit.\nGreat setting, great story, well written, good sound/voice and god what a blast to play.\nIt does not take long to get started.\n\nI really loved the resource mangement and little puzzles to solve to get around.\nThe combat is fun and creative with a lot of variance and pacing of the story is just solid.

Otherwise, it's a pretty good game.\n\nThis is Prey, not to be confused with Prey (2006) which shares absolutely nothing with Prey other than the name, and the vague setting of being in space with aliens. Ironically you will be constantly reading e-mails from desk stations to get passwords for hidden stashes like it's the Doom 3 engine which Prey(2006) is based on.\n\nIt's somewhat System shock, but not really. Haven't played System Shock extensively but most of the inspiration is in the inventory system, immersion and dialogue found in deskstations and audio logs. But the result is you will have to press 24 different buttons to access different menus.\n\nIt's somewhat a metroidvania, but not really. Your map progress is not limited by an item, it is limited by which skill you pick in the RPG tree. It seldom matters anyway because there are usually 2 to 3 ways to get somewhere which doesn't use a skill you have no points in.\n\nIt's somewhat a horror game, but not really. It's not that the enemy design looks bad, it's just bland, and it takes a lot from the fear factor other horror games would give.\n\nIt's somewhat a FPS, but not really. You can go in guns blazing, especially if you pick the security tree nodes, but all the ressources in game are limited, so you will eventually run out of bullets even if you craft a ton of them.\n\nIt's somewhat a stealth game, but not really. You can use stealth but once in a while you will have to fight creatures. Either because it's a forced fight, or just because Typhons give precious ressources you need. Heck, sometimes stealth is pointless cause you can just run to an exit even if every enemy spotted you. What's the point ?\n\nEverything has been slightly diluted and as such it feels like it succeeds at neither.\n\nAnd then it hit me : I'm in space, on a spaceship, being somewhat of a lone survivor, fighting alien creatures and talking to two AIs.

Is this really because immersive sim is a niche genre?  It looks like after this game, Arkane is trying to combine other elements such as multiplayer with immersive sim and failed catastrophically.

(except for the outside bits, which is a small portion of the game), for most games where doing this is recommended, I have found it to be more trouble than it's worth. Prey does it better than most by having relatively intuitive environmental design, I was rarely lost, and the other aspects of the game that boost immersion, like well implemented audio logs  added to this. (seriously, technically the best I've seen, I wish their were more of them, they blended perfectly with the gameplay)\n\nI start there because immersion was what impressed me most about the game. coinciding with this is the atmosphere, especially early on, the main location of the game is a well interconnected metroidvania style area that has an effective tension to it, without ever feeling overly horrific. Some games like this never make sense of why any reasonable person would ever want to live/work in the place the disaster happened, like the police station in Resident Evil 2. If not for the monsters running around, this would be a very pleasant place!\n\nSpeaking to the horror, this is one of the missteps of the game, mainly fumbled by the enemy design, light spoilers,\n\nThe main enemy of the game can transform into various environmental objects, chairs, cups, etc. Early on, this was terrifying, and had me nervously bashing practically everything I could see as I slowly worked my way through this place. Eventually, I took a couple hits from these things and realized that they don't really do enough damage to be a threat, and are pretty easy to stunlock once you hit them with your wrench once, so it was pretty rare for me to get hit more than once by the same monster. This completely killed the tension for me, and any reason I had to be cautious about what I was picking up (so long as I waited long enough for my health to regenerate to a safe level after an encounter, which doesn't take long), I think this would be alright if they were harder to hit once you engaged with them, but they often try and run away and transform into an object to hide right in front of you, making them even easier to take out. \n\nOn the other hand, the other main type of enemy (which has various subtypes), is a little harder to deal with than it should be, it's a large humanoid blob (with various powers depending on the type). Early on, it requires excess caution to safely defeat these things, slowing the game to a crawl, and it's impractical to avoid them since you want to explore and you need their stuff for upgrades. You CAN avoid them, but it's not ideal. This might be a me problem, but these things made me a little to itchy with the quicksave trigger, because I wasn't really interested in recklessly losing to them and having to go back more than a minute. I think I would like these things if they were just larger versions of the other enemy, and transformed into larger objects like vending machines, or maybe fake doors for you to try and go through that could catch you off guard. Once you get a gun, especially a shotgun, these monsters becomes jokes, so there's not really a point in the game where they are both challenging and fun to fight. As is, I would drop these enemies from the game entirely, except for the fire version, which was scary and cool enough to make up for the other aspects. \n\nThere are other enemies in the game, none of which really have great designs (and a few can be damage spongey), but I don't have strong feelings about them either way. \n\nThe characters are mostly fine, they did the job they needed to but I couldn't say any of them were all that memorable. The story was pretty solid I thought.  Voice acting is S tier. \n\nThe gunplay and movement is really fun once you get the hang of it, it would be better with better enemies but it's still very enjoyable. The character upgrades you can get mostly make either exploration or combat easier, I didn't put a lot of upgrades into the superpower stuff, so I don't really know how most of that would have been. \n\nOverall a definite recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1691617834, "timestamp_updated": 1691617834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143741338": {"recommendationid": "143741338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359583827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1691614581}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Veo mucho comentario  poniendo el juego en un pedestal   pero yo no acabo de verle la gracia ...", "timestamp_created": 1691615400, "timestamp_updated": 1691615400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418926715850830078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143732930": {"recommendationid": "143732930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198993668644", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1406, "last_played": 1691604976}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.\n\nAs for plot: better than you expect it to be, worse than you want it to be.

Though, I have to say that (in my opinion)  these games are played best without to much prior knowledge about it. Hence I will try to conceal any spoilers below the 'Read more' part, while staying 'vague' before. \n\nI have to admit, unlike my first impression (and ability to read properly, since it is stated very clearly), this game contains horror-elements. And personally, I'm not really a big fan of that, since unlike the adrenaline-response it may have for others, I usually fall into a pit of existential dread, which I try to avoid.\n\nI only played for a small time (around 15/16 hours) but I did get a good impression of the game. (Maybe this changes if one plays longer, but for now, this is my opinion on the matter).\n\nStill, what drew me into the game in the first place was the ability to explore somewhat freely, as in, while there are things blocking the way, it is possible to somewhat get around of certain problems, when looked at from a creative point. It feels 'metroidvania' to me and I liked that and the game actually makes good on that part. \n\n* Warning, some spoilers ahead *\n\nSince I don't play many of these games, I'm not going to comment on how buttons are assigned etc. though I was happy with that selecting weapons/inventory pauses the game, which gave you a chance to heal/eat etc.\n\nI also liked the atmosphere, but as stated before, I'm not really a fan of horror and that *is* present, both jumpscares as well as psychological stuff. For example, there's an area where you discover that some scientists were (as a side project) were trying to make a foam dart shooter (which you actually get) and you can read there mail and listen to conversations about how they made it etc. and this reminded me (as a scientist myself) about things I did with my classmates. And then you realise all (or atleast most of them) are dead. And that actually hit me, hence the existential dread part.\n\nOne thing I did was change the audio settings after meeting the first person, since that person talked so loudly. Only to reset it later since all the other spoken text/talks were not as loud.\n\nWhen first playing the game, you start in a room to look around, read some stuff etc. And the game also allows you to pick up stuff and either drop it or  throw it. So I saw a coffee machine and a cup. And as a coffee drinker myself, I thought I just put the cup under the coffee machine. First time dropped it on the counter, second time smashed it at the coffee machine. Well, no coffee for Morgan Yu...\n\nUpgrades and Skills: In the game you can aqcuire upgrades (quite a lot actually). For Morgan, you use Neuromods, which allow skills, like hacking (minigame), lifting heavy stuff, upgrade your suit, upgrade some weapon stats, fixing stuff etc. Later on, you also get some extra (psychic) skills, which are based on the enemies, bot attacking as well as defending. And the best one, change into an object (you can still move and jump etc.) while being a cup/book for example.\n\nThen there are 'weapon upgrade packs', used to upgrade weapons , but upgrading these further, requires some extra skills.\n\nYou also have a map (which you sometimes have to download from a pc), and actually a lot of stats and data. For example, you can re-read any email you've seen and when getting a code, it shows you when you need it. (I liked that!) \n\nAlso, later on, you can change materials (from you inventory) into material-blocks, which can then be used to craft other stuff. Crafting requires you to have the building/design plan (from pc's). My (only) issue with this was that both neuromods and weapons/ammo require a specific (same) one, which I ran out of quickly despite looting the place like a desperate kleptomaniac. And since this was a case of survival, I would have had no problem shoving everthing else (like bookcases/bags/carts and anything else) into the machine, if it gave me more material-blocks, because I always felt like having not enough ammo... \n\nAnnoying to switch between the treasure hunt maps and real map, since the email-viewer always resets to the top one.\n\nDislike: respawning enemies. And not just the same enemies, no, they become harded each time. However, they only respawn when transitioning from one area into another (which is clearly stated), which atleast makes it better. But it made me want to do as much as possible in one area before going to another one. This is probably, beacuse after a while, there's no more loot to find lying around and the enemies do drop stuff, even ammo...\n\nPsy-helmet (which obscures view and sound): allows you to detect (upgrade) and scan enemies to unlock extra (psy) powers (and more info on them).\n\nThe game is composed out of several maps, with a central 'hub' (lobby). And while the first 2/3 maps are rather short, requiring you to go back to the hub afterwards, the one after that (psychotronics/something) just goes on and on. And when I finally, had the option to go back to the lobby (using a now fixed elevator), since I gotten some upgrades, which I wanted to explore the rest of the lobby with, I came down only to see the lobby infested with enemies. And they all saw me coming down the elevator. (I have to explain that I was playing on the second easiest option) and these enemies were not just the smaller ones. No, they were one of the hardest ones. So I went back up, since I had some objectives left I could do there first. \n\nI also liked that you could go outside of the spacestation. \n\nThere are several weapons and I only used a few of them. Some only for solving 'puzzles' and some for combat. \n-Wrench: Used to hit things with, which I did to preserve ammo.\n-GLOO cannon: Despite it not saying this, it worked wonders against some of the more difficult enemies (like the telepath) despite not stating this.\n-Shotgun: I was granted the Margrave shotgun (as part of my bonus stuff) and this worked well against the earlier enemies. Short distance is a problem for later ones. \n- Silenced/golden gun: Nice to pick health of an enemy at medium distance.\n- Shock/taser gun: To me, worthless due to short range, the enemies stated to be weak to electricity, mostly also shoot ranged.\n- Foam-dart gun: Does no damage, puzzles only.\n- Q-Beam: Effective when having enough ammo, overlays the enemies healthbar and kills the enemy if health is reached. \n- Some bombs: Different bombtypes with different effects. Small amount, not sure when to use them.\n- Don't remember others. (Throwing stuff also does damage)\n\nI liked that the GLOO cannon allows you to build 'block' which you can stand on, though you can't make a block on a previous block (probably because this would render a lot of obstacles useless). Still, it would allow you to make a stairway on the side of a wall to climb up that wall etc.\n\nSecond dislike: Weapons can be upgraded, but I used N-Mods more for the practical stuff (lifting, hacking) and not weapons. I also didn't use the psy-skills, since turrets will fire on you if you have to much and, because the game tells you that this might be 'bad' for you, so I only used 'morph' since some rooms are inaccessable without it. However, it seems the weapons don't seem to scale with the later, more difficult enemies (on the second easiest dificulty level!), nevermind the 'lock' on N-Mods which temporarily stops you from crafting them, while I could really use them and actually had enough materials to make them.\n\nNow, some enemies are weak to fire, if only there was a flame-thrower... *in ear whispering* Yes, but that psy-skill could be bad for me, game, you told me yourself... Besides, I had set up turrets in the lobby at strategical locations...\n\nI still recommend this game, but I myself would love a game with these mechanics set in a less horror environment (maybe action focused), because I really liked figuring out where I could go using my skills and weapons.

This is definitely for fans of Bioshock, Deus Ex, Half Life, and more classic FPS/Im Sim games. Surprisingly longer than expected. Lots of lore if you want it. Plenty of optional things to check out if you feel like it. Only gripes up until this point are there is some slightly wonky melee combat, some weapons seem easy to just not need for your playthrough on normal. There's  plenty of backtracking in a sort of Metroidvania way as a completionist which is a bit of a shame as it ends up stretching the game length out a bit.

Well there it is!\n\nThis is a very much fantastic example of imersive simulator subgenre - there's tons of ways to approach a problem, like you can just shoot or sneak around enemies, but you can also use distractions, or use friendly defensive systems, or just find an alternate route which may require yet another set of tools to reach. This game in particular got a pretty modest selection of traditional weapons and offensive powers, only pistol and shotgun and they're costly to use often at that, but there's a load of fascinating utility devices, like grenades that recycle any surrounding objects into base matter to use with crafting stations or sealant cannons that can freeze-trap enemies AND negate hazards AND offer walkable platforms! On other hand the supernatural powers you can unlock are actually pretty generic in many regards, there's some interesting applications but you don't grant the mobility nor offer the excitement of say Arkane's Dishonored ones - apart from one, that is. See, one of enemy types in this game are what's essentially Half-Life headcrabs if they could shapeshift into coffee cups or other props - and you can receive and use similar power too, playing prophunt with space predators and robots!\n\nThe art style is neat too, the space station action takes place on is varied in styles, there's some decadent art deco areas and old utilitarian areas, and all the details and side plot exposition is neat.

It's no doubt what the game does best, exploring new places was always a joy. Despite that, backtracking was a massive pain, the map system isn't the best and what's meant to be the game's version of fast travel does not fulfill that purpose. Plenty of loading screens, having it on SSD is crucial.\n\nThe weakest part of the game has to be the combat, I found the enemies dull and their attacks annoying, often impossible to dodge. It usually just came down to bringing the right tool for the job, therefore it's hard to get much enjoyment out of it if you prefer to rely on fast reactions and combat skills. It was also never the right difficulty, was too punishing early on and not enough of a challenge towards mid and late game.\n\nThe story was pretty interesting, the opening will be forever memorable for me, along with the really difficult choices and moral dilemmas the game sometimes throws at the player. There is, however, a noticeable slump in the mid-game, and the ending felt very abrupt.[spoiler]The ending itself is an interesting twist, but to not get any info on what happened to the real Talos I in the end is a crime. It takes the player's investment in the story and throws it out the window.[/spoiler]\n\nThere were some bugs, nothing game-breaking or anything that couldn't be resolved by reloading and such, but they could still be very annoying. Audio mixing was all over the place, and it was common for voice lines to overlap. That covers my main complaints.\n\nWhether you'd enjoy the game depends heavily on how important combat is to you, how much you enjoy exploration and piecing together stories and how much patience you can muster when the game's being a pain in the ass.\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1689867274, "timestamp_updated": 1689867501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142459061": {"recommendationid": "142459061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047794661", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5114, "last_played": 1690031721}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the great rpg games without a massive world to trudge through, narrative and decision driven game with sublety and intrigue all the way. highly recommended if you like single player experiences like myself. in the current world we have a lot of games that are huge for the sake of being huge with little substance, this is just the correct size for depth but also being realistic for gamers who have a life to live IRL. 5 stars.", "timestamp_created": 1689848143, "timestamp_updated": 1689848143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142457977": {"recommendationid": "142457977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098137249", "num_games_owned": 1597, "num_reviews": 217, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 946, "last_played": 1689847653}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Very Positive\"  i do not understand this rating.\nthe story is nonsense, told very poorly.\nmonsters suck., are silly.\nthe material system is so unnecessary, JUST PLAIN NEEDLESS.\nthe combat is basic and whatever.\nthe gimmicks are very surface level.\nthe amount of searching is so stupid and adds nothing. \nWAIST MY TIME", "timestamp_created": 1689846338, "timestamp_updated": 1689846338, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475532978773117065", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142449018": {"recommendationid": "142449018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169586471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1683256858}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

And I [i]hated[/i] playing Prey (the demo). I hated it [i]so much[/i] that I completely wrote it off. The enemies being way strong, your pistol being garbage, your movement being so slow, and all the inventory stuff being dumbed down -- I hated it all, except the story was pretty good. I was never going to play Prey myself.\n\nAnd then.\n\nEpic made Prey free, a good while ago, and I got it, but with no real intent to ever play it.\n\nEventually, I got COVID, and I thought, I'm stuck here in quarantine, and I can't go back to work for another week, and I played it straight through, all the way to the end. Because, it turns out, the [i]key[/i] to playing Prey is the combos. It's [b][i]ALL[/i][/b] about the combos, the sneak attack bonus damage, the make-the-enemies-infight plans, the juice-yourself-with-so-many-neuromods-the-enemies-can't-run-fast-enough-to-catch-you strats -- anything but straightforward gunplay. And once I accepted that to interact with the story, I had to interact with the gameplay loop of enhancing damage output by roleplaying with the tools that Prey gives you, I had an absolute blast.\n\nNow, I'm not a huge fan of the procedural randomness in Mooncrash, because wow I forsee that making every future Shock-style game being worse by being used as a crutch to avoid investing in the density of the in-game lore and environment, but alternatively wow the base game has so much density of in-game lore and stark environmental beauty. Nearly every room has lore and environmental story-telling, if you pause to search around, and the sheer mass of Prey's tools mean once you finally understand where things are and how they interact, it's a wonderful playground for messing about with the game itself, and for experiencing the game from multiple angles and routes.\n\nReally, that's the key -- Prey isn't so much a shooter as it is an interactive playground with the story being integrated so tightly into each map's layout that you organically experience different stories every time you play differently, [b]but[/b] you first must understand and then master the tools Prey gives you to do it enjoyably. The first time I played Prey through, I was very skeptical of doing Typhon neuromods, even having researched them all, so I accidentally ended up with a pure human playthrough. Later, I played through again with both neuromod trees, and then a newgame plus run where I ended up about 1/4 of the way through with all neuromods installed, and just ran around completely abusing my sweet, sweet powers and my maxed out weaponry. This time around, I'm doing a pure Typhon run, and the experience is shockingly different, not so much from being Nightmare with all survival difficulty settings on, but from being weak, slow, unable to hack or repair anything at all. I'm reduced to slowly creeping about, avoiding hazards instead of repairing or powering through them, fighting encounters half a dozen times or more until I understand the best way to whittle down a tough enemy with barely any tools (and no neuromods until much of the way through the game), and making errand runs repeatedly to recycle the loot I've found so I can upgrade each weapon until it inevitably breaks. I still have plenty of psi hypos and medkits, and I know how to use operators to my advantage, but wow, it's really challenging in such a fun way, even though it's my [i]fourth[/i] playthrough. It's so special to play a game and be rewarded for my choices, finding new lore each run through, even though I thought I was super thorough! and seeing the cleverness in the design choices of the environment so I [i]can[/i] ignore an area, but if I wrack my brain, I can use a well-placed recycler charge, or a Mimic power, or try to blow things up with a Kinetic Blast, and then I'm into an area that before I'd have just used hacking or repair like all the other times, and the new route and the new access method makes the same story line and same environment and same weapons feel fresh all over.\n\nAll that said, the GLOO gun breaks it all so much it's hilarious. And the mantling is pretty sketch, even without GLOO -- a default mantling is the only time I've ever fallen out of the map in Prey -- but you get used to it. And if you find the microgravity movement and orientation really hard like I did at first, try to adjust the FOV wider (unfortunately, in a config file, but at least you can do it) until you can orient yourself comfortably, and then it's not nearly so bad.\n\nIn short, I played this game for two hundred hours, and then I bought the Steam version and played eleven more, and then I redeemed a GOG key so I could play with the golden shotgun, and you can, too.

There is no point in the game at which you start to feel that your abilities are snowballing into a powerful build, even on the lower difficulties. It's very hard to keep your firearm ammo topped up because the enemies are bullet sponges, making a guns-blazing approach impractical. There is always some level of danger, and most of your ability points will go into avoidance, not combat. Now, take this with a grain of salt as I haven't actually finished the game - but after 15 hours, I still haven't gotten a comfortable build and the grind to find/make effective ammo has gotten tiring.\n\nThe game takes place on a space station, so there's a good bit of level recycling and backtracking through areas. Sometimes I'll clear an area of enemies, finish a mission, then encounter more enemies as I pass back through the area I just cleared. This is particularly annoying because enemies disguise themselves as common objects.\n\nNow, the pros:\n\nPrey is pretty believable. The space station has an art deco vibe which is an interesting combination and very much Arkane's distinct style. Similar to Dishonored, there are usually multiple ways to approach a level, whether it be firepower, stealth, or something else entirely.\n\nThere are a few missions where you'll need to space walk un-tethered, and it is creepy. The scale of the space station from the outside is really impressive. Combined with debris and corpses floating around in a huge void rife with enemies, the spacewalk levels are my favorite part of the game.\n\nThe whole game entails unraveling a series of central mysteries, and finding the pieces of the puzzle does feel pretty cool. This is the biggest selling point in my personal opinion.\n\nOverall if you like mild sci-fi horror, it's a decent game. The premise, environment, and technology are all pretty believable. I think it's at least worth a play through.\n", "timestamp_created": 1689219130, "timestamp_updated": 1689219130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141957297": {"recommendationid": "141957297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880606497", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2723, "last_played": 1689645084}, "language": "english", "review": "Prey is an excellent Immersive Sim.

This is an extremely well crafted and polished experience, fine tuned in just about every aspect. The game is a mix of action, puzzle solving and RPG elements like the aforementioned titles driven by a strong story, quests and player choices. Player agency is a major factor in why I loved this game so much, your choices aren't limited to just choosing skill points and weapons upgrade, but rather everything in the game. Every situation and challenge can legitimately be accomplished through a multitude of ways utilizing the game's well crafted systems (combat, hacking, stealth) or a combination of any of the three. Prey allows the player to get creative to accomplish their goals and progress in the game, you are never herded into any specific play style. \nEvery system in the game seem extremely well tuned, as if the makers carefully distilled everything that worked great in System Shock or Deus Ex and added it to Prey. Quests, inventory, data and voice logs are easily organized and accesible through the game's well crafted interface. \nPerhaps the greatest character in the game is the space station itself, it feels like a lived in place that underwent a disaster without it feeling forced or like a prop.\nThe only negatives I have to say about Prey is that the game is on the longer side and tends to drag a bit during the middle of the title but the story was engaging enough to make you push onwards. \nIt is a huge shame that Prey got almost no publicity, was marred by using a name of an older and fairly mediocre shooter and was effectively ignored - it should have been at least as well known as Bioshock, a title that is often called a spiritual successor to system shock but that title fits Prey much better. \nIf you're a fan of the aforementioned titles or even a survival horror fan in general, you're bound to have a good time.", "timestamp_created": 1689214980, "timestamp_updated": 1689214980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141951833": {"recommendationid": "141951833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151293814", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2722, "last_played": 1689647311}, "language": "english", "review": "very noice\n", "timestamp_created": 1689209730, "timestamp_updated": 1689209730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141950673": {"recommendationid": "141950673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997751287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1793, "last_played": 1597523212}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Immersive Sim games I've played.", "timestamp_created": 1689208164, "timestamp_updated": 1689208164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141948891": {"recommendationid": "141948891", "author": {"steamid": "76561199496201524", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 446, "last_played": 1690062413}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing\n", "timestamp_created": 1689205670, "timestamp_updated": 1689205670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141931808": {"recommendationid": "141931808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973419733", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1492, "last_played": 1564870497}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply one of the best games ever created", "timestamp_created": 1689194639, "timestamp_updated": 1689194639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141930921": {"recommendationid": "141930921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981959463", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2553, "last_played": 1689284340}, "language": "english", "review": "Peak Arkane", "timestamp_created": 1689193749, "timestamp_updated": 1689193749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141926694": {"recommendationid": "141926694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153325724", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1690587084}, "language": "english", "review": "prop hunt if it was singleplayer", "timestamp_created": 1689189619, "timestamp_updated": 1689189619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141925606": {"recommendationid": "141925606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256301178", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1689187986}, "language": "english", "review": "Prey creates unpleasant frustrating impression at the very beginning. \n\nFor some mysterious reason crosshair is not centered and slightly lowered on the screen, you can't turn off that annoying motion blur, game's audio is basically FUCKED UP.

The writing complements the environmental storytelling in such an organic and compelling way that the player\u2019s experience transcends into complete immersion. For some reason, the game gives me the impression of a compassionate mentor. In writing, it is reflected in lessons and perspectives the game tries to tackle, always questioning your level of understanding and subsequently giving you even more food for thought. It very often reaches towards your \u201cinner humanity\u201d and sympathy, while constantly emphasizing the problem of decision-making. Split personality, various points of view, human factor, personal motivations and the sense of duty are just a couple of those lessons and perspectives, and it all perfectly connects into one beautiful whole. Overall, the game communicates with the player on so many levels that playing it absentmindedly is a disservice to your own intelligence. \n\nThe [u][b]atmosphere[/b][/u] feels like\u2026it has always been there. At first, it doesn\u2019t seem to be anything out of the ordinary, but then the realization comes that it\u2019s crafted in such a thorough and permeating way that everything appears to align in perfect harmony and once the first notes of the soundtrack start playing, it fills you with such an overwhelming sense of belonging that you can\u2019t help but keep traversing this fateful space station. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s [u][b]map design[/b][/u]. The visual aspect is absolutely stunning, no doubt about that, but the technical part is what makes you really admire its beauty. The overall design, the layout of singular locations and specific passages are so well-done that my inner perfectionist was high all the time. It takes a master of their craft to create something that complex and intuitive at the same time. Not only do you actually get to traverse the whole space station, the locations at no point feel overwhelming or incomplete. It\u2019s so obvious that map designers approached their task critically and thoughtfully that I can\u2019t help but marvel at their dedication and ingenuity.\n\nWhen it comes to [u][b]gameplay[/b][/u]\u2026I\u2019ll start by saying that you won't feel the whole depth of the gameplay until you play the game on Nightmare. On Normal and Hard mode, you can just shotgun your way through the whole game and not feel a thing. On Nightmare, the head-on approach is most certainly a failure. It will make you strategize, explore the map for resources, calculate risks and look for various solutions. You won't be running straight towards the enemy and spreading lead like a maniac. It will require you to allocate at least two brain cells and think of a plan. Ultimately, Nightmare mode provides the most enjoyable experience, where your actions mirror your resourcefulness. Gameplay here does wonders when you actually start feeling it.\n\t\nOn the whole, Prey wants you to experience the very content it has to deliver. It might appear short but it\u2019s only if you carelessly speedrun it. I\u2019d say its duration is perfect when it comes to action games. It actually gives you a fat, juicy, flavorful and digestible chunk of content with little to no nonsense. It is a masterfully crafted piece no matter how you look at it. \n\nP.S.

To start off my dislikes, the game is incredibly slow to get started (about an actual hour just for the introductory stuff) and only really serves to introduce the rather uninteresting mimic enemy who eventually becomes quite tedious to deal with when there's a few. They're quite weak, but don't turn your back on them; especially if there are multiple.\n\nThis game also released with Denuvo despite it being a single-player game, which was definitely pushed through by Bethesda because of their lack of understanding on what is necessary for development. I feel sorry for Arkane in how much of their decision making was overshadowed by poor publisher mandates, which likely hurt their development freedom.\n\nThe graphics are great for terminals, but the controls surrounding them seem a bit clunky where you can use the mouse to navigate but need to press F to confirm the selection. Fortunately you can't break them, because I would have done it by accident a few times lol. Outside of the terminal graphics, this is a pretty decent looking 2017 game. I wouldn't say the people look particularly good, but they don't have the clay-person feeling either. The animations are relatively fluid, but there's weight lacking on weapons that make them feel good to use.\n\nThe story however is kind of ass, even from peeking into the wiki. It didn't really have any strong motivators to do anything, and I didn't feel attachment to any of the characters. I'd say save the cash and just watch someone play it on YouTube, it'll give you about the same experience.", "timestamp_created": 1688827539, "timestamp_updated": 1688827539, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429967433214187622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141598480": {"recommendationid": "141598480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040132848", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3186, "last_played": 1607859689}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal game.\nImmersive Sim through and through.", "timestamp_created": 1688821223, "timestamp_updated": 1688821223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141597317": {"recommendationid": "141597317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039953398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1999, "last_played": 1688819627}, "language": "english", "review": "tis pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1688820040, "timestamp_updated": 1688820040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141593993": {"recommendationid": "141593993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991930550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1691875176}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 best game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1688816502, "timestamp_updated": 1688816502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141587707": {"recommendationid": "141587707", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113363710", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1113, "last_played": 1686747627}, "language": "english", "review": ">Start new game\n>Rush Necropsy skill\n>Get Neuromod fabrication plan\n>Ascend", "timestamp_created": 1688809252, "timestamp_updated": 1688809252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141582641": {"recommendationid": "141582641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369260801", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 4015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3326, "last_played": 1689503467}, "language": "english", "review": "I love prey", "timestamp_created": 1688803217, "timestamp_updated": 1688803217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141576940": {"recommendationid": "141576940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019872229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1569, "last_played": 1697384544}, "language": "english", "review": "meow", "timestamp_created": 1688795470, "timestamp_updated": 1688795470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141571410": {"recommendationid": "141571410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007276225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1973, "last_played": 1688626501}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It's a good game, and one I'd recommend on sale.\n\nThe environment design is by far the game's strongest selling point. The space station Talos I really feels like it had been lived in, and the environmental storytelling is probably the best in any game I've played. Moving between low gravity and normal gravity areas is also a neat gimmick, and the low gravity sections are often enough that it feels like a welcome change, but don't overstay their welcome. \n\nThe story as well is well written, and toys about with philosophical notions such as identity and the self, with the game opening in a way that makes you question the reality of the game's world in what is a pretty believable setting (again, helped the environment design). The ending(s) are divisive. I won't explain them, obviously. I thought they were pretty good, but there is a fairly glaring plothole. That's one for the comments, I guess,\n\nFor reference, I played the game on the second hardest difficult without hardcore enabled and the totally optional decision to (minor spoiler that you can read in achievement descriptions) \n[spoiler] not use any upgrades that give you enemy abilities.[/spoiler] . The gameplay starts well but peaks early. The game touts that there are many ways to solve a problem, but as you progress and start collecting upgrades, you don't end up needing to think too much about it.\n\nMy main gripe however, is with the enemy design. Most enemies are made of this plasma-like flowing substance, making them seem slightly formless. It's great design for an alien creature, but hitting anything other than a mimic didn't seem satisfying. You can knock enemies down with a sneak attack from your wrench or stun them with your stungun, but there never feels like there's much \"weight\" when you hit an enemy, for lack of a better term. It's like hitting a particularly sturdy bubble that just goes *pop* and spits out loot. Some of the other enemies are just bullet sponges that are a chore to fight. That said, you should experiment with your approach to each enemy. It can be a lot of fun.\n\nAll in all, it's a game that's a bit weak at its core, but what kept me playing was the promise of something interesting to look at or read as I wandered through its amazingly crafted world. There were loads of neat moments like recognising email trails across different computers, climbing around a barricade to find a corpse with a name I'd read or finding a diary that explained why the hell there were so many autographed baseball gloves everywhere.\n\nCouple quick tips to close off, although you might want to figure things out yourself:\n*[spoiler]The little enemies that spawn from nests will chase anything that's moving at speed. Just chuck something in their direction and they'll explode on it, rather than wasting your ammo.[/spoiler]\n*[spoiler] Recycler charges can be used to clear barricades you can't lift. Throwing something that's heavy but you are strong enough to lift can also topple heavier things[/spoiler]\n*[spoiler]Don't spend too many upgrade kits on the silenced pistol. It's the only gun in the game you can get a better version of.[/spoiler]\n*[spoiler]If you're after the achievement for not killing any humans, the stungun can knock them out. If they're killed by an enemy, it doesn't count.[/spoiler]\n*[spoiler]Check the ceilings of every room you get into. You might find something interesting in the rafters, or a way around a locked door.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1688298816, "timestamp_updated": 1688298952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59096139669418335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141108289": {"recommendationid": "141108289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003423756", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 3405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2254, "last_played": 1688795914}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been harder for me to get into than most, but ultimately is a masterpiece. \n\nTo me the closest popular game I can compare this too is Bioshock. Both games feature an Art Deco style and the feeling of abandonment in an isolated place gone bad where you have to use powers and guns to survive, but it stops there because Prey is more evolved than Bioshock.\n\nThe story of Prey is shockingly deep and nuanced and the gameplay makes you think because there's a lot to discover and a lot of ways to do it with the game dynamically evolving around your choices. You can be a sneaky hacker, a bold gunslinger, or an astronaut Macgyver. While a lot of games sell themselves on being choice driven not many do it even half as well as Prey does.\n\nIn conclusion I think this game is criminally underrated and unpopular. It deserves more love, more attention, and a sequel. It is one of the most intriguing FPS games out there and deserves a place among other great singleplayer fps games such as Half Life 2, Bioshock, Titanfall 2, Outer Wilds, and more. A game above other games.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688278619, "timestamp_updated": 1688278721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141101682": {"recommendationid": "141101682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000764944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1633245495}, "language": "english", "review": "you basically cannot fight anything and must play extremely stealthily.

As a fan of science fiction and immersive gameplay, I was instantly drawn to this title, and boy, did it deliver!\n\nPrey takes place in a near-future setting aboard the Talos I, a space station orbiting the moon. You play as Morgan Yu, a protagonist whose memory has been tampered with, forcing you to unravel the mysteries surrounding your own identity while battling an alien threat known as the Typhon. From the very beginning, the game had me hooked with its intriguing premise.\n\nOne of the standout features of Prey is its immersive atmosphere. The space station is meticulously designed, showcasing intricate details and a sense of realism that truly brings the environment to life. From the flickering lights and ominous shadows to the eerie echoes of your own footsteps, every corner of the station is filled with tension and suspense. The developers did an excellent job of creating a sense of isolation and constant unease, making me constantly on edge throughout my playthrough.\n\nThe gameplay in Prey is a delightful blend of action, exploration, and problem-solving. The game offers a wide range of abilities and tools that allow for diverse playstyles. Whether you prefer a stealthy approach, using your powers to become a ghost-like figure, or a more aggressive playstyle, relying on powerful weapons to blast through enemies, the choice is yours. I particularly enjoyed the freedom to experiment and find creative solutions to the various challenges presented throughout the game.\n\nThe Typhon, the alien antagonists of Prey, are both fascinating and terrifying. Their shapeshifting abilities and relentless pursuit kept me constantly on my toes. The encounters with these creatures are intense and require strategic thinking to overcome. Additionally, the game's narrative is expertly woven into the gameplay, revealing secrets and twists at just the right moments to keep me engaged and eager to uncover the truth.\n\nThe level design in Prey is top-notch. The space station is a labyrinth of interconnected areas, each with its own unique challenges and secrets waiting to be discovered. Navigating through the intricate web of corridors, vents, and hidden passages was a joy in itself. The non-linear structure of the game encourages exploration and rewards players with hidden treasures, upgrades, and valuable resources. It truly feels like an open playground, allowing you to approach objectives in your own way.\n\nGraphically, Prey is stunning. The attention to detail in the environment, character models, and special effects is impressive. The lighting and sound design further enhance the immersive experience, effectively building tension and creating an atmosphere that kept me fully engrossed in the game world.\n\nI must also commend Prey for its thought-provoking narrative. The game delves into themes such as identity, morality, and the nature of consciousness, adding depth and complexity to the overall experience. The story unfolds in a non-linear fashion, with multiple paths and choices that directly impact the outcome. This element of player agency adds an extra layer of replayability and makes each playthrough feel unique.\n\nIn conclusion, Prey is a masterpiece of science fiction gaming. Its immersive atmosphere, engaging gameplay, and thought-provoking narrative come together to create an unforgettable experience. If you're a fan of gripping storytelling, thrilling gameplay, and a touch of the unknown, Prey is an absolute must-play.

I tried to look at steam forum and internet wiki and its well known bug which developers never repaired. I was before 15 minutes so angry about it because it was pretty hard to save everyone, even the civils not just the researches and security personal, then in just 10 minutes i went on the other side of the station  right straight to the rector room, used both arming keys and launch autodestruction sequence with everyone in shutle bay sector. In the blink of the eye i just dont care that i kill everyone whose i tried so hard to save and just run straight to director personal drop pod to which i stole the key and just run off and behind me big nuclear explosion, THE END.

And depending on which route you take with the game, kill all or save them, it can change the whole outlook of the story!  \nI've wanted to play this game for years, before I got my PC I settled for watching play-through's on YouTube and it always looked so fun.

You wake up. You put on your suit. You get in the helicopter on the roof. You meet your brother in the laboratory. You take some tests. Something goes wrong.\nI don't fully understand the term \"immersive sim\", so I describe \"Prey\" as an action game at its core that can be approached in multiple ways, altering how the in-game world will react to you. Your path might have guns, stealth, or space magic.\nThe game has a lot of fun systems: GLOO cannons can disable an enemy or bypass it by forming a climbable path; Q-Beams can disintegrate anyone with enough particles; mimics can turn into any object in sight, so get ready for ambushes; the physics allow the player to experiment in unexpected ways\u2026 The list goes on and on, trust me.\nThe game doesn't have a great variety of enemies, mostly spreading between fire/electric/enhanced variants. Fighting mechanics might be engaging for 2/3 of the game, but it gets a little tedious by the end. And in general, you will have to traverse a lot in the second half of the game. However, the most annoying thing is the never-ending necessity of clearing your inventory from junk in order to produce useful resources; it helps that \"Prey\" has pleasantly fast controls and some perks to skip a trip to a recycler, but it just feels like a waste of time.\nDespite some abstractness of in-game models, the game occasionally suffers from framedrops in dense segments. Still, \"Prey\" shines in its presentation, both in dynamic situations and still moments. You have to see it.\nYou will need to make some decisions that can impact the story, but it could've been more significant. Still, multiple playthroughs can add to the experience.\n\nThis game is cool, intriguing, innovative\u2026 and a little too much to spoil the impression.

In most aspects a game that is really good, even after a few years holds up really well.\n\nOverall I would give it a 9/10 - really good, I enjoyed it a lot. Feels like the game is somewhat underrated (or just wasn't marketed enough?) in my opinion. I recommend it to most people. And here are my thoughts:\n\nStory and lore are well made and presented. There's lots of side content that will influence your journey. You'll probably see things from different perspectives as they're revealed to you.\nEven though personally I believe that combat is the weakest point of Prey, it's still pretty decent. Regular melee just feels very clunky. Eventually you will make your own way to fight (or avoid doing so as much as you can) - most ways to play are valid, but i would avoid melee. There's a large variance of weapons and utilities that specialise in doing certain things. The combat abilites seems to mostly do the same thing (but are pretty good at it).\nWhat this game does best is give you a lot of freedom - freedom to choose YOUR playstyle, freedom to make YOUR version of the story, freedom to choose things that aren't just *Dialog option A* and *Dialog option B* which feels pretty refreshing, also gives you multiple reasons to replay the game - if you're into that kind of thing.\nExploration is rewarded and certain skills or creativity let you get into many places (most have more than 1 way in) that you wouldn't otherwise see (hence the perspectives).\nLevel design seems really good to me. It feels like workstations are used and places are lived in with details that make you think about characters or locations in a certain way.\nEnemy design is interesting - with some enemies being pretty similar to things we know and others being very otherworldly.", "timestamp_created": 1687855215, "timestamp_updated": 1687855215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140762171": {"recommendationid": "140762171", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043711228", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1913, "last_played": 1688042791}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game enough.\nA must-play for fans of Bioshock and System Shock", "timestamp_created": 1687823395, "timestamp_updated": 1687823395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140724421": {"recommendationid": "140724421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999775495", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2395, "last_played": 1687772490}, "language": "english", "review": "Sound design and mixing are REALLY bad.

In the last years I tried a lot of games that I ended giving up because they didn't hit me, but Prey is not one of this. With this game I feel the same I felt as when I played Half Life, System Shock 2 or Deus Ex for the first time.

If you take a traditional RPG, downtime might be spent bartering with local merchants, conversating with NPCs, crafting items and reading tales of lusty Argonian maids. However, downtime is just as important in deeply action orientated games. Take Half-Life 2 for example, once you finish a combat sequence, you\u2019ll typically have to solve a puzzle \u2013 a formula which trends further back than DOOM 1 where you\u2019d backtrack to unlock previously closed doors using keycards. For all the explosions, breakneck pace and actions set pieces you can fill in a game, you need effective and satisfying downtime.\n\nThis is one area where Prey truly excels. The hum of small, complex machinery whirs in the background, contrasted by the deep and heavy pulls of a ship \u2013 the Talos I \u2013 spinning slowly and aimlessly through space. Perusing Audio Director Matthew Piersall\u2019s CV, I notice Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and it all begins to make sense now.\n\nThe lack of any earthly sounds creates a cold and unfamiliar soundscape. Nothing sounds familiar, and having your memory wiped at the beginning of the game, it isn\u2019t meant to be either. Everything feels new and it can be difficult to read what the game throws at you. Even Prey\u2019s legendary intro is based upon taking a familiar, upbeat scenario of a first day of work and flips it into something broken and distorted. \n\nPrey\u2019s main enemy is the mimic: an alien which can take the shape of objects within the environment, before springing into life to attack the character. On the one hand, this creates beautifully tense gameplay where nothing is as it seems, and the player must be attuned to every small twitch in the room. Was the vase over there, [i] always there? [/i] One excellent moment see\u2019s you discover an abandoned lab and trace the footsteps of its previous occupants, who have put sticky notes on every piece of equipment that which are definitively not mimics. On the other hand, it\u2019s also absolute bull****. Difficulty feels artificial as concealed mimics lead to cheap deaths throughout, especially on the harder difficulties. It\u2019s an area that, while a defining theme of Prey, feels like a small but significance sacrifice of gameplay for narrative tension.\n\nIt's a hell of a lot of fun the other way around though. As you progress through Prey, you\u2019ll acquire \u2018Neuromods\u2019 which let you use the mimic ability. This instantly creates a vast, diverging pathway of options when exploring the Talos I. For example, one section featured a locked door with no keycard in sight. My hacking skill certainly wasn\u2019t high enough to break the lock either, and so I backtracked and found a science textbook laying on a table. From there, I threw the book above the room I was trying to access, leapt above and briefly morphed into the book, slipping through a very slight crack in the ventilation and into the room, before returning to my human self. This moment was absolutely thrilling and represents what makes Immersive Sims the incredible genre they are.\n\nI did stumble across a few technical difficulties however, likely due to the game\u2019s immense amount of interlocking mechanics throttling my CPU. Stutters were frustratingly common until I figured out a goldilocks combination of in-game and Nvidia control panel settings. From there, it was smooth sailing but did factor to a month-long period break from the game.\n\nAll in all, Prey represents Arkane Studio\u2019s magnum opus and stands as a superb call back to the likes of System Shock 2 and Bioshock. The dramatic tension grips you from the moment you begin and never fails to let go, yet a succinct 20 hour runtime prevents significant player fatigue.

The story and lore are incredibly interesting and offer a lot to think about, so much so that I can't get it out of my mind. From the gameplay side, the amount of freedom the game gives you to make choices is greater than any other game I've played by far, and it feels so good to for once play a game that respects your creativity this much. To me, those are the strongest aspects the game has to offer.\n\nThe game expects a careful and cunning approach from the player, particularly in the part of the game when you're still underpowered. I very much enjoy this, but for some it may feel tedious and overly punishing. Still, personally I count this as a total plus because I look for games that can challenge me like that. You can adjust the difficulty at any time anyway, if needed. But as you progress and toward the end of the game, you can become an absolute monster and rip through the enemies that dominated you in the early game, which is just so satisfying. The combat abilities available to you become quite varied too, and it's very fun to play around with different strategies.\n\nAll that said, I will acknowledge two of the criticisms that felt most salient to me here, first of which is the enemy design. There isn't a ton of enemy variety for the most part, and the majority of enemies you come across are variants of two basic designs (one of which is iconic and amazing, and the other of which is closer to just being serviceable). There are a handful more enemy types, but they are much less common. This doesn't bother me personally and I like all the enemy types, but some people have found it repetitive, which is understandable. I think if you're invested in the other aspects of the game like I was, this won't impact your experience negatively.\n\nThe second criticism has to do with the materials and crafting system of the game. Throughout the game, you can find junk items littered around which exist solely to be recycled and repurposed as raw materials for crafting things like ammunition. Some have said that the process of collecting trash and recycling it is too tedious because you need to collect a lot of it to accrue any substantial amount of material, and this plays into an inventory space issue. This also doesn't bother me too much personally because I really enjoy item collecting, but it's a very fair complaint for those who do not, or who dislike inventory management.\n\nOverall though, Prey is a fantastic game with few flaws, and it has been criminally underappreciated. It deserves to be seen by more people and to be played through unspoiled.

Huge mistake. One of my favorite AAA games of the last 5 - 10 years. Great atmosphere, rock solid game play, graphics still hold up well(Max settings, 4k) engaging story, lots and lots of lore to go through if you are interested, great exploration, I could go on and on. If Prey is your first immersive sim like it was mine, ask yourself: Does having freedom and a plethora of ways to solve problems interest you? For example, lets say you come across a locked door. You could find the pass code for it, or you could hack it if your hacking skill is high enough, or there might be a maintenance tunnel you could find to get in(and sometimes the maintenance tunnel is blocked and there are multiple ways to deal with that), or you might be able to shoot the unlock button on the inside with a toy gun, or if you have a certain power, you could turn into a coffee cup and get through a small opening. That's Prey. By the way, this also applies to combat. On the outside prey is a run-of-the-mill FPS, but it's so much more then that. You can kill your enemies with conventional weapons, or you could throw gas canisters at them(you can throw them more accurately or farther based on a certain skill) or maybe you found some portable turrets and you set them up to kill your enemies. Maybe you came across some broken turrets? If you invested in repair, you can repair them and then use them to kill enemies. If you maxed repair, you can fortify them to double their HP which makes them much better at taking out the more tougher enemies. Came across some enemies robots? you could sneak up and hack into them and have them fight for you. This game is really engaging because usually when I come across something like a locked door in a game I think \"Okay I'm supposed to find the key or something later and comeback\" but in Prey I immediately start examining my options.

Holy, a lot to unpack. I'll avoid going too deep in this one because it's a rabbit hole. I love the setting of the game, it's basically a bioshock meets Dishonored kind of thing but more the former. I love how this game plays, all the approaches you can have to a situation. Locked Door? You wanna slip through this small crack? Force it Open with your strength? Traverse through the roofing and into a maintence hatch? Hack the electronics? Hey, that keypad there? Yeah, the code is actually on the computer in this employees email. Need to find them? Look up the location with their wristband tracker.  I was constantly finding more and more hidden things, new ways to solve every situation I was in. There is so much lore built into the game through nuance. The place feels lived and every NPC has a story. I got really invested in the DnD game a few of the players were in. Upon learning more and more of their emails the DM revealed treasure maps that by acquiring all of them gave me a blueprint for a pretty strong chip for my suit. You are rewarded for your exploration. Combat wasn't always required, which is good because it's hard. Took so much of my valuable resources to fight normal enemies, and that only multiplied as I went deeper into the game. The maps are intricate, layered. Detailed. Beautiful looking. And it only evolves the more you play and get further into the game. There isn't a fast travel in the traditional sense. The map itself isn't gigantic, but it can feel like it is at times with how much you can explore. You can exit the space station and use your suit to travel between docking points of the various areas. The story was awesome, it starts off so tame and slowly spirals into a grander puzzle that doesn't make any sense until the ending.

As one might expect, something goes horribly wrong.\n\nThe set-up of this game will be familiar to anyone who has played space survival horror. Indeed, the DNA of games like System Shock is all over this one. As alien forms infest the station and more and more is revealed to a mind-wiped Morgan, the player must gather resources and evade or kill their foes while trying to decipher what's happening.\n\nPlayer controls are pretty standard, though I found the jumping controls a little less responsive than many similar games. Part of the game will see the player in zero-g gravity and having to control themselves with thrusters, where momentum continues movement after letting up the keys. That was a neat change-up and added its own challenges. There are several skill trees with multiple skills, with standbys such as weapons proficiency, hacking, repair, stealth, increased health, and a variety of  boosts that will feel familiar to anyone who has played a game like this. Weapons are a mix of standard and boring, and interesting, like the GLOO gun, which fires blobs of rapidly-hardening polymer. It can be used to block doorways, immobilize enemies, secure sparking electrical connections, or to create makeshift staircases on walls to reach inaccessible areas. I love multi-concept weapons like this.\n\nSkills also include powers derived from the alien Typhon organisms. There are chipsets for the player's suit and helmet, which give additional benefits, and more slots can be unlocked through gameplay. There seem to be multiple viable skill builds for whatever playstyle the player wants, and that's a plus. Skills are added via neural implants (neuromods) injected right into the eye and the brief animation the first time this happens made me wince.\n\nIn fact, the entire narrative framework in this game is quite good. The opening and first few story beats, before the player really embarks on their \"main\" journey were very tense and, to me, the best parts of the tale.\n\nI will also say the environments in Prey are gorgeous and rendered well. Talos Station feels like a space station should, with different areas devoted to crew quarters, life support, engineering, storage, research, etc. The levels are varied in design, if not necessarily in appearance, and all feel very organic and flow together well. As the Typhon slowly assume control of the station, filaments of their psychic energy end up strewn around the staion like glowing party streamers. I also thought the sound design was excellent. The Typhon sounds are distinctive and distance from the enemy can be easily gauged by sound volume alone. Other characters radio the player, audio logs can be gathered around the station, and in general, the voice acting is very well done.\n\nPlayers will quickly encounter the Typhon enemies and they are no slouches. Superficially, the enemies are varied and weird, starting with the crab-like mimics, who copy objects in the environment and hide in plain sight before leaping to the attack ... to the ghost-like phantoms, corrupted robots, giant telepathic blobs, and the nightmare, a swirling ball of evil specifically summoned to attack Morgan.\n\nAppearances aside, however, most of the enemies are pretty blah. Until the player upgrades weapons and skills, even the lowest level mobs are all bullet sponges, and all hit really hard (even on easier difficulty modes, the highest level ones will drop you in a few attacks). None of them act that bright; they see the player and attack, even when you're unloading rounds into them. The one type that flees when under attack usually runs around a corner, lets its shield regenerate, and then returns to life as normal. There are enemies that are cheap, including invisible ones that can literally kill you by just psychically throwing you into the ceiling--doing so in one occasion from across an electrified floor you can't cross. Minor spoiler: at one point late in the game, the player will have to deal with a lot of rapidly (and endless) spawning enemies. The spawn points can be blocked and the enemies defeated but it didn't make sense in context (as in, if the story was logical, it should have happened much earlier) and it was an annoying mechanic that just served to slow down the story at a point where it was accelerating to the finish. A lot of fights can be snuck past, either via stealth or alternate pathing, but certainly not all, and some difficult ones were just unavoidable. It all just felt ... low-effort. I didn't find the combat impossible but it was annoying and always present.\n\nAside from the main story, there are other quests and requests from surviving crew members and while some offered tangible rewards, I found many kind of useless at such a late point. To advance the story, one needs to make a full circuit of Talos station, during which many of these quests will rack up, and unless the player backtracks a lot, these side requests will not be filled until the latter stages of the game--again, when the story is picking up speed toward conclusion. I get it, it's not an RPG and not a quest game, but I really prefer to have my optional content spread more evenly over the game and easy movement around the station (to not spend a long time retracing your route) doesn't come until late in the game.\n\nIn terms of stability, it was pretty good, though I crashed to desktop on almost every exit, rather than shutting down cleanly. I did have a few instances with the game simply going into a fugue state when loading a new zone, and refusing to respond. Aside from that, I also had a few odd bugs, such as objects staying suspended in air when the object beneath them was moved. It's an acceptable level of buginess, but there were a few.\n\nSteam achievements will take a while, since it requires multiple runs through the game. As with most games like this, players who love it won't see that as daunting ... but overall, this isn't a game to buff up your completion percentage (if that matters to you).\n\nMy personal enjoyment in Prey was middling; I logged a total of thirty hours but in the end, just kind of shrugged. Some games get better or develop new aspects with time but this isn't one of them, as I enjoyed the first half more than the second. Having said that, I agree that overall, Prey is an excellently-constructed game, with a lot going for it. I think it is going to hit the sweet spot for many players. Even if it wasn't for me, I recommend players give it a try, especially anyone who likes survival horror games. \n\nPros:\n- Multiple avenues to success, both in approach and in character builds\n- Excellent story, graphics, and sound\n\nCons:\n- Combat was more annoying than difficult\n- Side quest progression delayed to late game\n\n\nFinal Score: 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1686397625, "timestamp_updated": 1686397625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139829137": {"recommendationid": "139829137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060146383", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2260, "last_played": 1678759678}, "language": "english", "review": "Prey is a first person immersive sim.

More than that though, it's the atmosphere which I find to be Prey's strongest aspect. However, I sadly had to lean a bit more towards giving it a negative review.\n\nIn terms of enemy design, the Typhon all look and sound the same to me. They all just blend together into the same black wobbly blobs with tendrils. Some enemies are basically even carbon copies of another, just with a different ability duct-taped to them. The Phantom's 4 versions are prime examples of this. As a side note, character designs (the humans) frankly also look quite unappealing. To be blunt, this all comes across as a bit boring and unimaginative to me.\n\nIn terms of balance, most Typhon are so overtuned it's not even funny. I get that Prey isn't your typical 'guns blazing' type of FPS, but that doesn't excuse the enemies from being [i]this[/i] obnoxious to fight. From teleporting/dashing all over the place, to being really tanky, to attacks that chunk your Health in an instant, to abilities that can nearly stun-lock you, and more. The iconic 'Mimic' ability is one of only a few abilities that I think is interesting, which admittedly does give Prey a uniquely creepy/fun aspect to it.\n\nIt's also mandatory to scour the map for trash to feed the crafting cycle, seeing as items and ammo can be rather scarce otherwise. Now I personally don't mind that too much since I'm a big looter, but I can imagine that this can be quite annoying for others. Finally, constantly respawning enemies are also a big frustration. A once-cleared area can just repopulate with enemies again upon hitting certain story points, undoing a lot of your efforts and feelings of accomplishment there.\n\nAs a side note: some bugs also happened during my playthrough, mostly consisting of weird corpse spawning, and the behavior of both fire and off-screen enemies, but luckily nothing too gamebreaking.", "timestamp_created": 1685840789, "timestamp_updated": 1693831825, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480078130960464478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139509963": {"recommendationid": "139509963", "author": {"steamid": "76561199054598966", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1686170654}, "language": "english", "review": "prop hunt", "timestamp_created": 1685838163, "timestamp_updated": 1685838163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501259446144104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139509135": {"recommendationid": "139509135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178903762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2353, "last_played": 1531287487}, "language": "english", "review": "it is soooo goood!", "timestamp_created": 1685836662, "timestamp_updated": 1685836662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501259446144104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139506428": {"recommendationid": "139506428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026806052", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1493, "last_played": 1642974102}, "language": "english", "review": "i am immersed in a sim", "timestamp_created": 1685832147, "timestamp_updated": 1685832147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501259446144104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139497954": {"recommendationid": "139497954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011014396", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2472, "last_played": 1686832030}, "language": "english", "review": "I very much enjoyed it, very immersive and loved the story and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1685820591, "timestamp_updated": 1685820591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501259446144104004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139494650": {"recommendationid": "139494650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069513316", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 212, "playtime_forever": 5478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4026, "last_played": 1686418604}, "language": "english", "review": "8/10 Excellent homage to System Shock with a solid story and good premise.", "timestamp_created": 1685816692, "timestamp_updated": 1685816692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139490227": {"recommendationid": "139490227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066142230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1955, "last_played": 1685804470}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant Single Player FPS, Immersive story, unique Typhon powers. 8/10 Game thoroughly recommended", "timestamp_created": 1685811383, "timestamp_updated": 1685811383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139483577": {"recommendationid": "139483577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005941183", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3411, "last_played": 1686738752}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily the best thing Arkane has put out, raising the bar for immersive-sims.

Morgan loses his memories and needs to find out what happened to the Talos I, defeat the Typhon, and recover his memories.

The crafting materials are divided in such a way that collecting and carrying them is very simple and easy. I do like games with specific components that work together in overwhelmingly varied recipe variants, but this system works well for this game.\n\nMy only complaint is the Audio balancing.

Like, it's very difficult to predict the ending, even if you do pay attention to all the little things throughout the game.  Not to mention there's more than one way to complete the game and more than one outcome.\n\nThere are several weapons and usable offensive items.  All weapons can be upgrade multiple times.  Your character uses \"neuromods\" in order to learn various new abilities, either present from the start, or unlocked later on.  Depending on what difficulty settings are used, there are different forms of \"trauma\" the player can experience, such as broken bones, concussions, etc., all of which negatively affect your character until addressed.\n\nThere's an inventory system similar to the Deus Ex style.  You have slots for items, weapons, ammo, consumables and junk that can be recycled for materials, which are then used to fabricate useful stuff, or even plot-specific items.\n\nAll of this made for a very fun game.  An achievement hunt is not stupidly difficult, like in a lot of games, but does still indeed challenge the player.\n\nIf you liked Dishonored, you'll like this.

Prey is a gem of the immersive sim genre and I am really sad that I haven't played it until now. \n\nThe story is simple but engaging. You're Morgan Yu, scientist in a space station called Talos I. After a terrible accident, all hell breaks loose in the station and you're left to a) figure out what happened and b) escape the station. The characters are a bit flat, but the quests you are actually engaging with them are top-tier. As in all immersive sims, I found a contradiction between the main story that focuses on me and the side missions that focuses on the world. Talos I is an incredible place with lots of opportunities to discover.\n\nThe gameplay is like other immersive sims, most notably Deus Ex. You have the skill trees, the upgrades and the different weapons that can and will make you approach each situation differently and challenge you to find the most suitable solution to the problems. The mimics are brilliant and they will keep you on your toes but other enemies are just engage or avoid, without further thinking.\n\nPrey is the game, I would like to make. A variety of tools, clever situations, and a world/space station that feels immersive and is there to explore and exploit.

Hasta cierto punto me relaja ver que no soy nada. La relatividad m\u00e1s pura es que nuestra existencia no supone ni supondr\u00e1 nada que haga cambiar el proceso de esto en lo que demonios vivimos, tiempo, espacio o lo que sea. La relatividad de no ser nada a veces tranquiliza y te hacer verlo todo desde la perspectiva m\u00e1s as\u00e9ptica. Sin embargo, los humanos como especie nos hemos afanado en creer que lo que hacemos tiene significaci\u00f3n, tanto lo individual como lo colectivo, hasta el punto de olvidarnos de la inmensidad que nos rodea que creemos intuir pero que nos abruma de tal forma que preferimos ignorarla, tomar su belleza exterior como las galaxias o las nebulosas, y quedarnos en esas simples luces que brillan, o brillaron, ah\u00ed arriba.\n\nBas\u00e1ndonos en las apreciaciones que nosotros hacemos de nosotros mismos, llegamos a considerarnos una especie \"viva\" inteligente, argumentando para ello la capacidad de modificaci\u00f3n del entorno, de fabricaci\u00f3n de herramientas y de b\u00fasqueda de respuestas. Nuestro egocentrismo individual y grupal es tan abrumador que nos consideramos por encima de otras especies del planeta no mecanizadoras y las miramos con superioridad, y en el mejor de los casos, con condescendencia. Sin embargo estamos completamente perdidos a la hora de entender lo que estamos viviendo, limit\u00e1ndonos a modificar nuestra realidad con obstinaci\u00f3n y, normalmente, sin prestar demasiada importancia a las consecuencias de nuestras acciones. Hacer y, si cabe, luego intentar parchear. Es la historia del ser humano, autoconsiderado inteligente, a\u00fan no certificado externamente por alguna otra especie \"inteligente\", ah vale, es verdad, que nosotros somos los que damos el carnet de inteligente.\n\nFruto de la inteligencia humana est\u00e1 el haber otorgado a las corporaciones privadas la capacidad de explo(t/r)ar el espacio: uso, disfrute y beneficio. Y ah\u00ed tenemos a \"fil\u00e1ntropos\" de s\u00ed mismos lanzando coches el\u00e9ctricos al espacio, y aqu\u00ed abajo aplaudiendo. De eso va \"Prey\" precisamente, de decisiones que se toman basadas en alegatos al \"bien com\u00fan\", al \"progreso de la ciencia\" y que no son m\u00e1s que temeridades que se hacen sin pensar en las verdaderas consecuencias, solo pensando en el r\u00e9dito econ\u00f3mico y el reconocimiento p\u00fablico. Pasear por la Talos y escuchar los audios de los tripulantes es tan adictivo como inquietante, sobre todo al principio, consiguiendo rodearte de una atm\u00f3sfera opresiva y cargada de peligros. Casi cincuenta horas despu\u00e9s puedo decir que recorrerme la base espacial de arriba a abajo varias veces ha sido de las experiencias m\u00e1s terribles que he tenido en videojuegos, sobre todo por la escasez de munici\u00f3n y lo complejo que es, al principio, entender c\u00f3mo acabar con cada alien\u00edgena que sale a tu paso. Hace media hora v\u00ed el final, o los finales, porque los prob\u00e9 todos. El primero fue el que m\u00e1s me satisfizo, no porque empatice con los hermanos Yu. Para nada. M\u00e1s bien porque cre\u00eda que era lo correcto. Otra vez. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo correcto? \u00bfExiste realmente como algo absoluto? Otra vez los humanos con nuestra moralidad, nuestros conceptos, nuestros principios, los cuales llevan con nosotros miles de a\u00f1os para precisamente salt\u00e1rnoslos a diario. Digamos que, en t\u00e9rminos relativos, hice lo que me gener\u00f3 m\u00e1s confort. Supongo que es lo que hacemos continuamente y, por eso, me cuesta entender que seamos inteligentes, tomando la inteligencia como algo un poco menos relativo. No somos inteligentes porque tomamos decisiones (incluso a nivel cient\u00edfico) basadas en suposiciones, teor\u00edas, ideas, recuerdos, fantas\u00edas...\n\nPodr\u00edamos seguir as\u00ed infinitamente, hasta que nos hayamos separado tanto de Andr\u00f3meda M31 que ya no haya apenas estrellas en el cielo visibles, dentro de miles de millones de millones de a\u00f1os. El ser humano no habr\u00e1 sido para el Universo ni lo que dura una inspiraci\u00f3n en la vida de una persona de 100 a\u00f1os. Quiz\u00e1 existamos simplemente para maravillarnos y admirar lo que parece esta inmensidad que nos rodea, para cuidar del planeta donde surgimos y de las criaturas que lo habitan. Quiz\u00e1 nuestro desempe\u00f1o deber\u00eda ser solo ese y no aspirar a ir m\u00e1s all\u00e1, continuamente. Pero no somos capaces de ver que mientras no seamos capaces de manejar con soltura los problemas planetarios dom\u00e9sticos no estaremos preparados para dar el salto a ning\u00fan otro lado. La Talos es el ejemplo de que nuestra existencia no deja de ser algo rid\u00edculo y anecd\u00f3tico, incluso en la historia natural de nuestro peque\u00f1o planeta no somos nada. Sentarnos y observar el cielo, eso ser\u00eda m\u00e1s \u00fatil para entender lo que somos y lo que, afortunadamente, nunca jam\u00e1s seremos, conseguiremos ni entenderemos. Es duro asumirlo pero en el medio de la noche despertarse, mirar hacia la ventana y darse cuenta de que todo esto es un min\u00fasculo microinstante de algo que es imposible que lleguemos a entender, es de las cosas m\u00e1s maravillosas y gratificantes que uno puede vivir.

Benedict Wong kicks ass.\n- Visually clean (after tweaks) and usually stylized in a pleasing way.\n- Long, giving you plenty of bang for your buck.\n- Full of memorable moments.\n- Performance seemed good, but my computer is ridiculous, so YMMV.\n- What little music there seemed to be was decent.\n- Recycler charges are super satisfying.\n- The enemies are really interesting, though the variety often feels lacking.\n\n- SPACE!\n\nBad:\n- * The game looks like a muddy mess until you tweak it. Disable motion blur and add Reshade for sharpening to correct this. Once you do, the game is exceptionally clean, with no aliasing. It's not the most graphically impressive game out there, but it looks good. It just requires some work to get there.\n- The most baffling thing... they decided to put the default crosshair on the lower portion of the screen, rather than centered. You know, like every first person game ever made? This can also be corrected, but gun models will still point at the lower screen. Once you learn to ignore it, you're golden, but seriously, how do you mess this up???\n- The game suffers from a mid-late lull, as a lot of games with non-linear objectives do. If you care about side quests, you are going to backtrack a lot, and you will get to a point in the game where you spend hours doing this.\n- The difficulty can seem unfair until you get used to the game and learn what you should and should not be fighting at your current level of progression.\n- The endings feel rushed. I won't spoil anything, but they aren't very satisfying. Separately from that, the after credits scene may be divisive. It didn't make me feel much, but some people may find it cool.\n- As with most games that offer this level of customization depth, you can trivialize most of the game with the right unlocks.\n- While some of the environments are unique, a lot of them get samey. There is a lot less visual appeal and unique design than something like a BioShock. It's a space station with more subtle art deco design, with a few cool interior sets. The exterior is really cool though.\n- There are a few sections where you spend a bit too much time in zero G. The 6DOF movement is cool, but it gets cumbersome after a while.\n- Zero oxygen environments put you in a helmet that can be a bit obstructive at times.\n- The feeling of the opening of the game is never quite matched later on. To compare it to BioShock again, imagine if the Andrew Ryan office scene was the start of the game, then there was nothing quite as impactful for the remainder.\n- Weapon variety is limited. Only two standard firearms, a couple of utility weapons, a wrench, and a beam weapon I found less than useful.\n- Grenade weapons vary from next to useless to vital, depending on how you're playing. Overall, I find them lacking.\n- Recycler charges should yield more materials for large objects.", "timestamp_created": 1684374590, "timestamp_updated": 1684374590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138453645": {"recommendationid": "138453645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120257365", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 3800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2637, "last_played": 1685120105}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the most \"easy to get into\" kind of game.

It's definitely worth buying, and the DLC is worth it too!\n\nI've never been too keen on Arkane Studios other game series (Dishonored), but I have to say Prey is something special and probably the best game they've done thus far imo, one of the best games to come out in the 2010s decade. Prey is a proper immersive sim through and through, having a big area-zone for you to take on any way you see fit with a multitude of weapons and items to get through areas, multiple ways to complete quests, save all NPCs, kill all NPCs, multiple endings, and finishing the game early.\n\nYou approach a locked, coded door that may have you stumped at first, but then you realise Prey has more than one answer for your problems, giving you a handful of solutions for your obstacles. How about using the glue gun to climb up the wall and jump over it? or climb into the vents Deus Ex style,or hack all the computers to find the code for the door. Or even better, use one of the multiple alien powers to mimic a coffee cup and slide through the gap in the window to get through the locked room. Prey truly feels like a 90s game that escaped and silently showed up in 2017 right under the radar. It's already becoming a cult classic game, not leaving much of an impression sales wise or with mainstream appeal; sadly, that's the nature of games like this and Deus Ex. It's a shame that the sales were pretty bad for Bethesda standards; the possibility of a sequel may be nonexistent, but damn, was this an amazing entry to the immersive sim genre.\n", "timestamp_created": 1684175104, "timestamp_updated": 1684175104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138346871": {"recommendationid": "138346871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074835050", "num_games_owned": 821, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1659, "last_played": 1684591615}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game", "timestamp_created": 1684171455, "timestamp_updated": 1684171455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138328083": {"recommendationid": "138328083", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970712242", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 1972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1685166022}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good game with a beautiful science fiction environment.

Whether it's by simply having the correct hacking level, or finding the keycard, or looking for an alternative route, or making an interesting platforming contraption with your GLOO gun to get beyond it. \n\nThe other thing is that there are only a couple of different endings, but it can end about 19 different ways. Every single little thing you do in this game is reflected on later on, for something you didn't think a game designer would have even thought about. Luckily I got the best ending, but I feel like it was my choice for the games events to turn out the way it did. You don't \"pick\" the good ending. It is merely the result of all your actions along the way. I really wish Arkane could make a sequel.

It's story-heavy with a vast network of characters (mostly deceased) who's agendas and interconnections are revealed as you gather intel and put the pieces together. Progression is mostly linear with a few karma-based choices yielding slightly divergent endings. \n\nGameplay mainly takes place inside a space station, but also takes you out from its relative comfort and into the very uncomfortably disorienting experience of navigating between airlocks. Enemies remain threatening until pretty late in the game and are creepy enough to want to generally avoid. This isn't really a horror game, but it definitely has its moments. \n\nThe game uses a somewhat unconventional crafting system where just about every object can be \"disassembled\" into its elementary components, which are then used to fabricate weapons and upgrades. There are a lot of \"junk\" items that can thankfully be converted into something immediately useful as well. \n\nMuch of the weapon kit is familiar with heavy resemblance to that of Half-Life 2. The exceptions are a surprisingly reliable stun gun and the GLOO cannon, which functions as both tool and weapon. \n\n[i]Neuromods[/i] (See: Bioshock's [i]plasmids[/i]) add a great deal to the combat experience giving the character superhuman stat and movement bonuses and unlocking powerful elemental and paranormal abilities.\n\nGreat game with little to complain about. Hope to see a sequel in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1683686699, "timestamp_updated": 1683693505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543575584888458252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138074950": {"recommendationid": "138074950", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961824261", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 8419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7652, "last_played": 1683941272}, "language": "english", "review": "I adore this game. It's like if you took Half-Life, Bioshock, & System Shock and a bit of Fallout and blended them all together. The gameplay loop is addictive. There are plenty of little side quests along the way to keep you interested in exploring. The looting and crafting is very unique and interesting in this game. You can recycle loot and items and turn them into 4 base crafting materials, which can then be used to fabricate different items you may need; such as ammo, weapons, upgrade kits, etc. This makes it very rewarding to hunt around for loot. \n\nThe atmosphere and setting are incredible. Replay value is high since there are multiple ways to approach any given obstacle or quest. Different endings based on your actions and decisions also ensure repeat playthroughs. Although I found getting the \"good\" ending to be much more satisfying than the \"bad\" ending. Still, it's fun to have the option to play the game as a total monster, killing indiscriminately. \n\nThe human weapons are not very varied, but your Typhon abilities later on makes up for the slight lack of gun variety. I found using a mix of guns and abilities to be a good balance. You do get a cool original weapon/tool that can be used to help in combat, or help you get around the level. However towards the end of the game, if you leveled up your abilities just right, you tend to be a bit too OP. But this is mainly a repeat playthrough issue, as you'll have figured out which upgrades and abilities are best suited for your play style. I recommend playing on Hard or Nightmare for a second or third playthrough to help mitigate this. \n\nThe story is interesting enough to keep you going, with exposition and information delivered via audio logs, hacking into people's computer terminals, finding notes, and running into other survivors, etc. The game also has quite the ending. Not going to spoil anything here, but it threw me for a loop. It certainly makes for interesting repeat playthroughs. \n\nSome of the enemies will mimic objects, such as coffee mugs, or chairs, and can pop out and attack you and give you quite a scare. This can be suspenseful and frightening at first, but later in the game this is mitigated when you get an item that can actively scan for these hidden creatures, thus reducing the jump scare factor. The observant players will learn how to spot these enemies before they attack. I wouldn't call Prey a \"horror\" game, but it certainly has a suspenseful and tense atmosphere at times. I absolutely love the setting of the game: a retro-futuristic 1970's styled space station orbiting the Moon in the year 2035 in an alternate timeline. As a space nerd, I absolutely loved being on this station. Some of the views and areas are incredible. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Prey if you like atmospheric sci-fi shooters with some extra abilities thrown in, and a dash of suspense.

You play as Morgan Yu, a scientist stranded on Talos I who must survive and uncover the mysteries of the station.\n\nThe gameplay of Prey is a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat. The game encourages players to use their creativity and problem-solving skills to overcome obstacles, as there are multiple ways to approach a given situation. The game's atmosphere is immersive, with a detailed and believable world, engaging characters, and a haunting soundtrack.\n\nThe combat in Prey is intense and challenging, with a variety of weapons and abilities to choose from. Players can upgrade their character with neuromods, which grant them new skills and powers, such as the ability to mimic objects, move objects with their mind, and even become invisible. The game's difficulty is well-balanced, making it challenging without feeling unfair.\n\nOne of the standout features of Prey is its story, which is full of twists and turns. The game's plot explores themes of identity, morality, and the consequences of scientific advancement. The characters are well-developed, with believable motivations and personalities.\n\nThe Mooncrash DLC adds a roguelike twist to the game, with randomized levels and permadeath. Players must survive five simulated environments, each with its own unique challenges and hazards. The DLC offers a fresh take on the game's mechanics, encouraging players to experiment with different strategies and playstyles.\n\nOverall, Prey is a fantastic game that offers a unique and immersive experience.

Not very complex, but still an entertaining and engaging game where exploring and returning to parts of the space station with new abilities and more and more door codes or passwords piling up in your inventory to access new rooms feels rewarding. It's also a welcome and okay-ish filler to plug the cavity that's left by the Deus Ex series for me that I should've played way earlier than I did, even though it lingered in my library for almost six years.\n\nA little bit more polish to the presentation of the story would've been nice as it feels a bit rushed at the end and some more levels of complexity like dialogue options or weapon customization (in addition to upgrading the weapons' stats, which you actually can do) wouldn't have hurt either, if you ask me. Psychic abilities, skill tree and weapons/tools are fun. There's an office nerf gun with foam darts to activate buttons you can't reach otherwise and the gloo canon let's you incapacitate enemies, temporarily fix hazards or build platforms to climb high places with. Playing around and experimenting is rewarded, too. \n\nDespite some lacking depth here and there, it still works perfectly fine and is nicely balanced - maybe a bit too easy in the normal difficulty, especially if the optional survival elements are not enabled. My tip would be to activate oxygen consumption, weapon degredation and traumas if you like some more depth and challenge. \n\nI'd like a sequel, even more than a continuation of Dishonored or games like the recent one by Arkane Austin.

I think Talos 1 was one of my favorite worlds that I have been in in some time.

The different areas of the ship all had their cool touches and it didn't feel like I was doing the same thing over and over again. \n\nAll the Typhon and mimic types had me on the edge of my seat going \"what the hell is THAT\" every time I came across a new one.

It takes a lot for a new game to topple the Fallouts, Tomb Raiders, Far Crys, or Metros from my list of favorite games, but Prey did it. Despite taking around 30 hours, I didn't want the game to end because I was having so much fun playing it. Just the sheer amount of different ways to approach each area was amazing. You could sneak past the typhons, you could glue gun a bridge to the catwalks above and walk past, or you could go guns blazing and take them all on. Despite not having that many characters, the ones it did have were great and I kept guessing on what the game would throw at me next. Nothing in the game felt tedious and even the crafting was something I wasn't expecting to be enthralled by. Looking back I honestly can't think of something I didn't enjoy about the game.

Marked as horror, but if anything, it is probably directed at the player, as your character becomes much scarier as the game progresses (perhaps it was intended as such). \nUse a gargantuan yet fun variety of combat strategies to take down different foes. All strategies can apply to all enemies with enough time, but obviously, some are better than others (like shooting a fire enemy instead of slapping him). \nEvery detail in the game is well-thought out, from combat and exploration to the layout and usage of the HUD and inventory menu. Graphics and sounds are both immersive, and the BGM lends a great hand with this.\nYou can definitely tell that there was actual effort put into the game and game-play. \n \nAs stated, your character becomes disgustingly strong as the game progresses, slapping the definition of 'power-creep' across their face as you beat down aliens with only a wrench. This can be taken as a pro or con, depending on your personal play-styles. \nWOW is this game long (if you're doing the side quests). A game guide is highly recommended, as there is a ton of content that is missable if you're only speeding through the main story.

I can confidently say this is is the best haunted house you can experience (out of the games i've played (no i haven't played alien isolation, i will change that soon). \n\nTalos 1 is A very memorable setting, other than it's layout, you'll forget how to reach an area quickly, although luckily the actual rooms are memorable. The Arcane art style works with this game extremely well, and the first time you actually go to space and look at the station, It looks amazing. You can't think of Talos 1 without thinking of the Typhon, and the state of the station. It's clearly in a bad state, with the Typhon infesting each corner. You get a feeling that you're not being told something. And not just one thing. It feels like there are two layers you're missing out on. \n\nThe worst and best part of the game is definitely the third act. It's bad because there are a few forgettable events and everything is just preparing for the fourth act. The reason it's The best part is because you're exploring and completing side quests which mostly have satisfying endings, and also will enhance the ending, even if you don't do them.\n\nNow let's talk about Mooncrash, AKA the best DLC of 2018 with no exception. It's a Roguelite where you have to figure out what happened to a moonbase which is slightly related to Talos 1.  I would recommend playing Prey, then play Mooncrash as you can get used to the mechanics in prey, so you can use your skills more effectively in mooncrash.\n\nThere are 5 characters, who each start with a base kit and have access different parts of the base game's skill tree which you have to unlock. for example, the Volunteer (the first one you gain access to) is kinda the sorcerer of the bunch, he has a lot of typhon abilities in trade for having little health. It admittedly has an easy final objective if you don't limit the amount of delay time loops you use, or don't use any at all. If you get prey (which, by reading this review, you've signed a contract saying you will), you MUST get Mooncrash. It would be a game of the year contender in itself if it were released separately.\n\nPrey is an incredible experience that everyone should play. It undersold, but most of those who did get it, love it. I strongly recommend getting and playing this at your earliest convenience.", "timestamp_created": 1682818701, "timestamp_updated": 1693647816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

Sound and music are solid, and I have no complaints about the graphics or gunplay. The advancement skill tree seems like there are many different and truly viable ways to play through the game, which I just love. Tons of puzzles/locked doors can be overcome in multiple ways.\n\nCons to consider, but not stop you from enjoying this game: a few pretty big bugs that take research on the internet to solve (but all were solvable). One bug had a key story objective item despawn, and took some deep finagling with save files to fix. If I hadn't been able to fix it, this would have been a negative review, because I was that invested. Also a little underwhelming is the enemy design, it just doesn't feel particularly well thought out. Humanoid, bug, and floaty thing is pretty much it. \n\nLast, the difficulty scaling is a bit off.

Twice. \n\nThis time though, i persisted. And boy oh boy was i surprised. \n\nAfter the first 15 hours, as i was upgrading my skills and weaponry, the immersion started to kick in. The plot got thicker. And as it did, i started to invest even more brain matter into it. And then i realized that i was playing an underrated gem, worthy of being up there with Bioshock, Dead space and Dishonored. \n\nAlthough the story/gameplay/mechanics are great, the game still managed to piss me off, big time. So many side missions. I understand now that the choices i made throughout those side missions had a defining role towards the end, but still, it had me running around an entire space station like an damn errant boy. SO effing annoying.

It is not a settings issues. You will experience the entire game like this.\n***WARNING***\n\nSo this game reminded me a bit of Deus Ex. You have quite a bit of freedom, there's side quests and storylines you can follow (usually with no great finale, but nice rewards for them), and you can do things in whichever order you want. Therefore, it's one of those games that allows you to become very powerful before proceeding with the main quest line. You also start out very underpowered, so there is very satisfying progression to be had.\n\nThe above is pretty much it. It was enough to keep me going. You're free to do your thing, and the enemies won't become incomprehensibly stronger as you power up. I finished it in 54 hours-ish.\n\nOn the flipside, the game pretty much has zero polish. Animations are meh for such a title, audio is 0/10 need subtitles, and there's just quite a bit of overall jank. If you enjoy Deus Ex-esque games, and don't get the audio bug (or can look past it), you will probably enjoy this.

People might compare it to System Shock 2, but I haven't played that, so the best I can say is \u2013 it's a mix of Bioshock and Dishonored, but more open-ended than either. Took me around 45 hours to complete on my first run, though I did get most of the achievements (42 of 48, non-DLC) in doing so.\n\nI ran into a few minor bugs, but none of them game-breaking. Characters tend to talk over each other, the first Operator you encounter has once voice-line without the proper sound effects. Operators in Deep Storage tend to float up to the high ceiling and stay there indefinitely. Etc. The worst one was when I phased through the ceiling, though that was fixed by loading a quicksave.\n\nThere is an attempt to make realistic directional sound. If an enemy is in an other room, you will not hear its noises coming from the walls, but from the nearest entrance. Unfortunately, it doesn't decrease in loudness as it should, so a Phantom will always sound like it's about to enter your room.\n\nI found the helicopter intro quite clever, with the credits being billboards on buildings. After that intro, I found the end credits to be lackluster. They could've done so much more: have the dust of the final boss turn into words as the shuttle flies off into the distance, or have the words projected onto the station as the camera orbits around it, or have the camera fly through the station's interior with the words being shown on screens and in reflections. Just a simple name-scroll was disappointing after all that the game was. The post-credits scene, however, is a stroke of genius. That made me want to replay the game a few more times, and not just to grind out the remaining achievements.\n\nAfter I was completely done with the base game, Mooncrash was what fifteen years ago we would have called an expansion pack, rather than a DLC. On its own, it adds a new roguelite campaign with a new map. and some new weapons, abilities and enemies unique to it. I wouldn't price it at 20 \u20ac due to its small size, but it's an easy pick during a sale.\n\n[b]Story spoilers below[/b]\n[spoiler] The game really seems to have a pessimistic view of humanity's chances against the Typhon, even though Talos I was doing quite well against the alien threat. Aside from the player, the security chief was, seemingly, an other super-human figure that emerged in the race for survival. In my view \u2013 that is a very promising result. That bot's idea that a single Mimic would destroy the world seems especially laughable. If one station has two, then an entire planet will have countless. Things will only get better from there due to the forced evolution of humanity \u2013 we've gotten quite good at the whole 'species war' thing over the course of a few million years. Of course, the reason for that pessimism is made clear in the end, though I found that in itself to be quite perplexing.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1681151845, "timestamp_updated": 1681151845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136481333": {"recommendationid": "136481333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075636309", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1383, "last_played": 1684726397}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game.

Every inch of the station feels lived-in and believable, and the game's attention to detail is truly impressive. From the flickering lights to the ominous whispers in the dark, the game's atmosphere is second to none.\n\nWhile the game's AI can be a bit flawed at times, and the challenge can start to wane after a while, the sheer joy of exploration and discovery keeps the game engaging throughout. There are always new secrets to uncover, new areas to explore, and new weapons and abilities to discover.\n\nBut what really sets Prey 2017 apart is its sense of freedom. You're free to explore the space station at your own pace, tackling challenges in any order you choose and approaching each encounter in your own unique way. This freedom, combined with the game's immersive atmosphere, makes for a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a first-person shooter that offers something truly different, then Prey 2017 is the game for you.

I really did. But there is far too much I didn't enjoy. \nThe main difficulty you'll face is not knowing where to go, how to get most items, what items are best used, and similar \"guide damn it\" moments. Once you realise how overpowered shotgun is, how to get the stun gun after entering the second room, and that you can abuse operator stations for large amounts of crafting resources, a lot of the difficulty drops off a cliff. \n\nHowever, there are still a large number of ridiculous design choices. Why do enemies respawn when you have a finite amount of any given resources in a level? Why bother having Bioshock-styled powers when they're on a cooldown resulting in about several dozen Psihypos in my inventory (even before the quest that gives infinite Psi energy)? Why bother punishing the player for taking \"Mutant\" powers by making turrets hostile when pretty much every turrent after the Lobby is either broken or folded up? Just so many questions and that's before even getting to the enemies.\n\nThe enemies are about as interesting as they diverse and that's not a compliment. Mimics are your run-of-the-mill ROUS' and the game can't even hold itself back as it gives you the ability to reveal them about 30 minutes after you get the Scope. Phantoms are basically humanoids that may have one of two elements but are still easy to defeat with a single Typhon power. Weavers don't do much beyond give you motion sickness through screen shake. Cystoid are easily dealt with through throwing a garbage can at them. Telepath show up 2 times that I can recall and both in the same level. Technopath can be stun gunned to death. Poltergeist are likely to kill you out of sheer luck. And the Nightmare...\n\nThe Nightmare is where the entire game just falls apart and makes all the gameplay issues obvious. A massive bullet sponge that just shows how unsatisfying the combat is since you're largely limited to dumping numbers into a body and hoping that maybe your tissue paper turrets do any damage. No, the best option is literally to stick yourself in a locked security booth, a vent tunnel, or literally just wait in a previous level for 2.5 minutes for it to despawn because the concept of a door is too much for it to handle. \n\nAs for the story, there's not much to share. It pretends to be complex when it's just convoluted, trying to made some statement on The Human Condition\u2122\ufe0f before ending with \"Empathy Am Good\". Between that is a bunch of moments where you're being led by the nose to do menial tasks. The sidequests don't do much more than the main story of \"go to a place and get a thing\". \"Go to my room and get a medal\". \"Go to my room and get a recording\". \"Go find some turrets and place them here, wagie!\" The reward for this is little more than a firm pat on the butt and a \"thanks\".\n\nAs for the visuals, they're honestly pretty basic. High quality, for sure, but basic nonetheless. Even thought it seems like the developers did their best to make it 'lived in', they kept making the same room of \"a fenced off area under a platform with a recliner and table\" about three times. \n\nIs the game worth it? Maybe on a steep discount and you intend to play it more than once, I guess.

IMO Arkane's best game to date and probably the best immersive sim I have ever played.\n---\n\nSo I ignored this game back when it came out; the buzz around it was mostly about Bethesda ruining a sequel/reboot to a cool IP (though one I'd not heard of beforehand), and then reviews were pretty meh. But I've been binging YT game reviews and Prey keeps coming up as a hidden gem, so I decided to try it.\n\nMan am I annoyed at how badly Bethesda screwed Arkane by refusing to drop the Prey name or market this game correctly. I had no idea it was one of my favorite genre of games (immersive sim). It's essentially Mildly-Spooky Deus Ex Lite, In Space.\n\nThe first 20 minutes is probably the most memorable of any game I've played in recent memory.

It gives you the feel of freedom thoughout the game. Like, for example, there was this area blocked by hevy object and you've got 2 level less that it requires to move it yet I managed to simply hit that larger object with a smaller one and eventually move it away. And that just a small example. With a glue-gun you can improvise even more.\n- Also the game might end in few different ways so it looks that your choices throughout the game metter. But I just don't feel like finishing it so not sure.\n\nNot so much:\n- The backtracking. The station is basiacally a big hub that is interesting to explore at first but once you've visited most of the areas twice or more (since you're exploring) - you'd wish this to end asap. That's funny, since pretty much the same thing in DE did not bother me at all. The station, btw, allows you to travel in the space around it - but that experience I did not enjoy from the start so tried to avoid as much as possible.\n- The mimicks. Again, that is fun at first but then those fellas respawning out of nowhere just annoy the sh*t out of me\n- The story. It is just a generic  OK unfortunately. The first part when you just getting familiar with what's going on is captivating but then it just meh. So if you as myself value a good story as one of the main components in the game - Prey might not be the best for you\n\nSo, as mentioned in the beginning, at first it was fun and all but then - became more like a burden and felt like I'm forcing myself to continue. But maybe it is just me and given the game's strenghts I'd still encourage you to give it a chance", "timestamp_created": 1680292214, "timestamp_updated": 1680292214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135803235": {"recommendationid": "135803235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208781208", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2798, "last_played": 1680299201}, "language": "english", "review": "W", "timestamp_created": 1680271814, "timestamp_updated": 1680271814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135796000": {"recommendationid": "135796000", "author": {"steamid": "76561199238960456", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4785, "last_played": 1698527370}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed playing this game on my steam deck and highly recommend it.

This game is a culmination of so many mechanics and details they have developed and made into a unique experience that recognizes EVERYTHING you do. Even the small things, for instance the game recognized my attempt to not kill any of the mind controlled humans. This wasn't a tracked number while I was playing I didn't even know it was being tracked until I beat the game and was rewarded for doing so! This game rewards you for playing your own way, whether that means you kill everything mercilessly, save everyone and be the hero, or a little of both. I did what I believed Morgan would do given the info I could find about him in the game, which was already kinda what I wanted to do anyway.\nNow to mention the story/setting, There is so much detail and so much variance based entirely on what your actions are. This goes beyond just who you kill or don't kill too, it's decisions it's planning. Going out of the way to do as much as possible for people or yourself, I didn't even find everything in my first run and I was quite thorough (my run was 32 hours, I took my time.).\nWhen you are playing this, think deeply about your decisions and what they could mean for you and the future scenarios to come. There is a lot more consequences and rewards for every action you make.\nOne thing to take into account when playing this, DO NOT think it is a basic shooter that is centered around killing everything and shooting like you have infinite ammo, not to say you couldn't do it but it is gonna be a lot harder than you think. If you are familiar or have played the Dishonored series I recommend you play it like that game. Take your time exploring all your options and tackling challenges with as many options available to you as possible, find smarter ways to defeat enemies that require less resources, set traps or avoid conflict all together. It is ultimately up to you to quote the game and the games before it made by this team \"Play your way\".\nIn my play-through I chose to play on hard with the survival settings on, it was very rewarding and not overly difficult. \nIf you are familiar with their other games I recommend playing as I have if not the next difficulty higher.\nI can imagine that the lower difficulties would have made my play-through less entertaining, I quite like a challenge and feel like I need to keep challenging myself or things may grow stale.\nIf you are not familiar with their other games and just want to get the story I recommend a lower difficulty maybe still use the survival settings though, they don't make the game super hard they just make it more interesting and logistics based. You will want to be more frugal with your resources and may want to avoid combat a bit more often since it adds status effects that need specific things to fix them (example, when taking fire damage you may receive burns if the damage is significant enough and that will cut a chunk of your health out until you fix it with a burn remedy)\nIn conclusion to one of the longest reviews I have ever made.\nThis game is another fine example of what games should be, here's hoping we will eventually see this kind of quality, love, and effort put into the games yet to be made by anyone in our future.\n\noh and PS: Don't trust the chef.", "timestamp_created": 1679996776, "timestamp_updated": 1680031075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751356661319732666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135587115": {"recommendationid": "135587115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066952727", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 474, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 893, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1700573138}, "language": "english", "review": "mixed feeling about this. maybe i dont like the theme and setting, but this feels kinda boring to me.

It's a beautiful game, it sounds great, it ran well for me, and I love the aesthetic of the whole thing. As fars as the gameplay goes it was pretty standard, so while not bringing anything new to the table in terms of being an Immersive Sim, it made up for it by doing what was expected well enough. The music and sound design were a highlight, both weaving together to create an incredibly thick atmosphere. The story is intriguing and horrifying and mysterious in all the ways that I like, but I have mixed feelings on how it all wraps up and the framing of the whole thing. Prey's a weird one, that's for sure, but the mixed feelings I have on it is evidence of it doing something bold. I'd say it's worth a playthrough for that alone.

Whoa...\n\nPrey asks a lot of interesting questions about memory, identity, self-image, mental and physical wellness, interpersonal relationships, workplace culture, scientific advancement, human folly, violence, and the morality of survival at all costs. These primarily come through in the dialogue, which is largely in the form of audio logs found throughout the game world, a 60s-chic space station where hostile alien lifeforms have already killed your coworkers. The space station is a piece of art in itself, and serves as a (quite convincing) mega corporation's cutting-edge research facility, and a clever representation of the human brain. This place is your mind, and your mind is a battleground and a mystery; warm and welcoming; cold and mechanistic; dark and eerie; layered and deep.\n\nThis first-person-action-thriller-RPG is in every sense a competent and heartfelt homage to several massively influential titles: System Shock 2, Thief, Half-Life, Deus Ex, and Dishonoured. It also draws clear inspiration from the Alien film franchise. If you enjoyed any or all of these titles then you will probably love this exceptionally well-paced, well-written, beautifully-rendered mind game.\n\nPrey's biggest fault is its name. With enough patience and skill you will go from being the hunted to the hunter, but this game is so much more than that. It really should've been called \"Mind Game\" or something akin to this, but I can appreciate that there perhaps was a good reason to deceive the player, as after all, deception (self-deception) is a core theme. This is not to say that Prey has any unpleasant surprises. Everything is deliberate and subtle and smartly woven into a coherent experience that is engrossing and deeply emotional. It could've been a bit more confident in itself, though.\n\nAll said, this game deserves your time, and you deserve the immensely validating chance for self-reflection that it offers.", "timestamp_created": 1679885410, "timestamp_updated": 1679885685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135514198": {"recommendationid": "135514198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078910075", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1239, "last_played": 1679837965}, "language": "english", "review": "\nPrey is the best game you never played. \nArkane's masterpiece has one of the best game worlds and environmental design I have ever seen.\nEvery inch of the station is carefully and masterfully designed just as if it was a real place. \nTalos-1 makes sense as a whole. Every person, every room is thoroughly thought, and every email you read, every diary you listen to connect as a whole. It is so detailed that you can list what happened to each person during the disaster, probably. \nFinished it 3 times on Xbox; finishing it once more on PC; Prey still managed to enjoy me with new content, which is why I love Prey in a nutshell. I found new ways of solving an existing obstacle, missions I haven't seen before stashes I never found, and secrets that I wasn't able to find my way before.\nPrey is often compared with the Bioshock series but the statement is simply wrong: Bioshock games are both narratively and level design-wise merely linear (Bioshock series has many semi-open levels -Fort Fraulic, Minerva's Den-but there is always one way to deal with the problems in Prey game is all about sheer amount of solutions to any given problem).\nPrey should be compared to System Shock and basically is a spiritual successor. \nThe atmosphere of Talos-1 is spot on; the exterior feels big, loose, and tense (just as it should be), the sound design is horrifying and high-quality (I agree it can become exhausting later ), OST made by Mick Gordon is one of a kind.\n I also like the art style, architecture revolves mainly around Art Deco, Industrialism, and constructivism (game explains why). Different levels of the station have different styles, as you go down to Power Plant it is more industrial and brutal almost Soviet-like but as you go higher up the station places feel more luxurious and decorated, the art-deco style being dominant; it is kinda like Bioshock 1 (although I must agree Bioshock 1 was superior in showing it; and it leaned even more towards art-deco and neon lightning) mixed with Half Life. \nThe power plant level reminded me of the one from Bioshock 1 and, Arboretum felt to me just like Arcadia (not an expert these are merely my observations on architecture). And many other places seemed to me like they were out of Half Life.\nPrey is the most underrated game I've ever played, a perfect blend of Half Life, Bioshock, and System Shock in my mind. This was the Half Life 3, I was dreaming of as a kid. \nA masterfully thought Semi-open world, with many ways to solve any problem, with Metroidvania elements and a breathtaking atmosphere.

I don't mind a little complexity, but Prey is like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. It's frustrating, and I just ended up feeling lost and disconnected from the game's world.\n\nThen there's the combat, which is clunky and unsatisfying. I mean, sure, you get some cool alien powers, but using them feels like trying to juggle wet noodles. The enemies are also repetitive and uninteresting, and the game's difficulty is all over the place.\n\nOverall, Prey is good- but still a disappointment.

The game offers a unique blend of action, exploration, and horror elements, making it an exciting and immersive experience.\n\nThe game's story revolves around Morgan Yu, a scientist who wakes up aboard the Talos I with no memory of the events that led to their current situation. As Morgan, you must explore the station, gather resources, and fight against the alien Typhon threat to uncover the truth about your past and save humanity from extinction.\n\nPrey's gameplay is a mix of combat, stealth, and exploration. The game offers a wide range of weapons and abilities that can be used to take down enemies or avoid them altogether. You can also use the game's crafting system to create new items and weapons, which adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay.\n\n[spoiler]One of the most impressive aspects of Prey is its opening sequence, which is reminiscent of the opening scene of Mission Impossible. In that scene, the bad guy is in a fake hospital, and the audience is not sure what is real and what is not. Similarly, in Prey, the player wakes up in a simulation that appears to be real but is later revealed to be a simulation.[/spoiler] This opening sequence sets the tone for the game, leaving the player with a sense of unease and uncertainty.\n\nThe graphics and sound design in Prey are also top-notch, adding to the overall immersion and atmosphere of the game. The game's soundtrack, composed by Mick Gordon, is especially impressive, with its haunting and atmospheric tunes perfectly complementing the game's sci-fi setting.\n\nOverall, Prey is an excellent game that offers a unique and thrilling sci-fi adventure. Its gameplay, story, and atmosphere all come together to create an immersive and unforgettable experience. If you're a fan of sci-fi, first-person shooters, or just good storytelling, then Prey is definitely worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1679359586, "timestamp_updated": 1679359586, "voted_up":

Native ultrawide support. Very annoying decision is to have your weapon POV right up in your face. There a fix for that though.\n\nPlot is very interesting and benefits from the player taking the time to read emails/audio logs to get the full picture. Multiple endings. You are also given a wide array of freedom in helping/killing NPCs\n\nVery minor woke elements.\n\nOnly legitimate criticism is a noticeable amount of bugs in the later part of the game. A few quests can bug out and require reloading from an earlier save to complete.

The song \"Everything is Going to Be OK\" from the Prey OST is one of my all time favourites of game songs. Not much to say about the soundtrack other than Yes Yes Yes.\n\n-The story is excellent. Everyone is comparing it to System Shock but I've never played that, so to me it felt like Bioshock mixed with Dead Space. You are aboard Talos I, a space station that orbits the moon with Earth's Best and Brightest aboard to push humanity further than it thought possible. Of course, Everything goes wrong and you are left fighting for your life. \n\n-Great gameplay. A great slew of open-ended puzzles that almost ALWAYS have more than one way to solve them. Exciting combat with different ways to defeat your enemies, or just sneak past them if you want. Replayability due to the extensive Neuromod skill trees. Fun powers to mess around with and master as you discover more and more enemies. And who didn't love the Recycler charges? God what isn't there to love?\n\n-Overall design of the game is just A+. The UI is awesome and makes using the terminals in the game pretty fun, the game is immersive and mysterious and makes you want to learn more about Talos I and what happened aboard it, enemies have cool variations, there is tons of side missions, and a pretty compelling, if sometimes a little bland, antagonist as well. \n\nSolid 9/10 I'd say.

It's really a spiritual successor to the Bioshock 1 and 2, and other immersive sims that preceded it, like Deus Ex. However, I think expectations are easily my biggest issue with PREY.\n\n\nThe game looks great, it has a great voice cast, and it has fantastic opening premise, with a very strong setting/worldbuilding identity. It's more akin to a first-person resource management/puzzle game than a Shooter/RPG like its clear inspirations. Perhaps you'll enjoy it more than me, but there's still some problems I can't look past, mostly stemming from the overall unfinished feeling the game has.\n\nThe UI is terrible, possibly even worse than Skyrim. It was clearly designed for a Gamepad rather than Mouse and Keyboard. On top of that, the Quest pings and objective markers and very intrusive, as they're often accompanied by sounds and effects.\n\nMovement is very sluggish but also feels weirdly weightless, like you're a bowling ball sliding around.\n\nThe combat is ok, but rendered entirely moot by the strength of enemies, who can 1 shot you before you have the chance to identify them, let alone react. You can't just run and gun like its DOOM, you do have to be slow and methodical, using the right tool to dispose of enemies efficiently - hence the puzzle game comparison.\n\nAs much as PREY tries to emphasise multiple solutions for the same problem, the only way to succeed is to scrounge every nook and cranny for supplies (which is much more tedious than Bioshock), and then die in one shot to an elite enemy that was dumped in the starting area.\n\nI know difficulty is a controversial topic in games, but PREY is very inconsistent. On one hand, it holds your hand so tightly it hurts your fingers, only to then not even tell you important information like how to charge a power attack with the Wrench.\n\nIf PREY had a few more months, I think it could be something amazing. While I see the appeal, I personally found it a frustrating experience. It was telling me 'play your way, there's many solutions to each problem', only to then tell you 'no, not like that'.", "timestamp_created": 1678664663, "timestamp_updated": 1678664663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489030510187149048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134572335": {"recommendationid": "134572335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210216777", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 635, "last_played": 1679299240}, "language": "english", "review": "PRETTY COOL", "timestamp_created": 1678663973, "timestamp_updated": 1678663973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134568461": {"recommendationid": "134568461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390440732", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1678658252}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1678658333, "timestamp_updated": 1678658333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134533356": {"recommendationid": "134533356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805494536", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7958, "last_played": 1678453268}, "language": "english", "review": "P.S. I had to shorten some of this review's content, due to it surpassing Steam's allowed amount of symbols, therefore some game's aspects will be discussed briefly. I wish i didn't have to do this, but it can't be helped.\n\nAt first, i tried this game on 16th June of 2019, earned one specific achievement purely by messing around, which in result left me cheered up and with a realization that devs have a good sense of humor. Nevertheless, back then - i dropped the project, since at the moment i was looking for a different type of entertainment. But then, on 13th February of 2023, this game's time has finally came, and it was worth it.\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2610 The only one of its kind\n\u2611\ufe0f Land of opportunities\n\u2610 Has a couple of tricks up in its sleeve\n\u2610 Simple, yet operational\n\u2610 Will do, if in a small doses\n\u2610 Do something else while playing\n\u2610 It was not supposed to be a game\n\n- This is a first immersive sim i ever played in my life, so i don't know if it's the weakest, the strongest, or the average one among the genre. But no matter where it's going to end up - this is an amazingly impactful game overall. This is exactly a case when the game is a centimeter-wide and a kilometer-deep. All mechanics are fun, meaningful, consistent till the very end. Some of their branches are not polished to a finished state, but they will not prevent you from enjoying the game.\n\n--{Story}---\n\u2610 Do you feel like a hero yet?\n\u2611\ufe0f You will wish to experience it like the very first time\n\u2610 You will have something to discuss about\n\u2610 It's just good enough to keep you going\n\u2610 It feels forced, and the game could've lived without it\n\u2610 Laughable, broken, pitiful\n\u2610 There is none\n\n- Narration reacts to your actions - you can play the game as if it is totally linear, or you can slow down, take your time, an treat it like in an RPG. You kill every character in the game, ignore everyone's quest, serve only yourself and cowardly escape from problems - It's fine! The game still has a place for your kind. In fact it has so many endings - one of them actually covers this behavior specifically.\n\n---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 Style is immortal\n\u2610 This is the real reality\n\u2610 Commendable\n\u2611\ufe0f Decent\n\u2610 Meh\n\u2610 Disgusting\n\u2610 Call an ambulance, your eyes are bleeding\n\n- While this game shares Arkane's own art style, developed during creation of first Dishonored, it feels drastically watered down, as if Studio never had enough time to ponder it out fully: ingame drawn pictures, half of props and human anatomy does look polished, but usable equipment, enviroment and the other half of props - does not. Overall it still manages to create an appropriate representation even by 2023 standards, but it lost its chance to stand out.\n\n---{Sound Effects}---\n\u2610 ASMR\n\u2610 It could even carry your feelings without OST\n\u2610 Juicy, might even drive your wish for more\n\u2611\ufe0f Sounds pleasantly, while it lasts\n\u2610 Original, but forgettable\n\u2610 They took everything from a free library\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n- Aside from recycling noises of (obviously) the recycling grenade, typhons' whispers and Gloo Gun's firing sounds, in my opinion, everything else sounds just okeyish. I think it's imperative for Prey's OST to accompany its SFX, and vice versa, because otherwise, by turning music off you'll contribute to the most unwelcome boredom's magnification.\n\n---{Music}---\n\u2610 This sentinel being just became my favorite composer\n\u2610 You will download a significant amount of album's tracks to listen on a daily basis\n\u2610 You will find yourself relistening to a lot of tracks\n\u2611\ufe0f You are going to find some tracks to be memorable\n\u2610 It's alright, but fails to bring any emotions\n\u2610 It struggles to fit in\n\u2610 It's so horrible that I wish it didn't exist\n\n- From my perspective, the game has 2 very good tracks, while the rest of the album reminds narrowly-specialized, difficult-to-listen-separately ambient. Which is actually your most-common situation in games, or probably just a little bit better, since i remember a lot of decent games where i couldn't remember anything related to music.\n\n--{Replayability}---\n\u2611\ufe0f Either this piece of art has a specific amount of possible walkthroughs too huge to be counted here, or this game shares philosophy of infinite replay value, like Terraria, f.e.\n\u2610 The game can still handle fun even on a 5th run\n\u2610 This game will manage to suck you back into it 4 times\n\u2610 You're gonna be stuck with this game for 3 walkthroughs\n\u2610 It has some alternatives paths, enough to motivate you to go for it twice\n\u2610 There is enough content here, but only for one single playthrough\n\u2610 It barely has enough content even for one run\n\n- Game has so many alternative paths that if you liked it - you will be replaying it many times again. I actually think this game will have more patience with player, rather than player with it:)\n\n---{Difficulty}---\n\u2610 It's too pathetic to be called a difficulty\n\u2610 I am too young to die\n\u2611\ufe0f Hey, not too rough\n\u2610 Hurt me plenty\n\u2610 Ultra-Violence\n\u2610 Nightmare!\n\u2610 Doom Slayer is dead\n\n- If you're experienced with survival-based games - you will find this one's a little easy. If not - it will be just about average.\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Too linear to grind\n\u2611\ufe0f Only if you care about competitive / achievements' aspects\n\u2610 Isn't necessary for a main progress\n\u2610 It's here, but it won't change your opinion over a game\n\u2610 They've crossed the line where they should've stopped\n\u2610 FUCKING HELL, THAT'S ENOUGH!\n\u2610 You are the only one who can bring me 10 wolf skins\n\n- That's a simple one, to be honest. This game's just better than that, therefore it won't force you to fall for that, not even a single time, and no matter how good you're in combat and inventory management.\n\n---{Length}---\n\u2610 You can live here, if you want to\n\u2610 100 hours ~ 500 hours\n\u2610 51 ~ 100 hours\n\u2611\ufe0f 26 ~ 50 hours\n\u2610 11 ~ 25 hours\n\u2610 1 ~ 10 hours\n\u2610 You will finish it before the refund policy expiration\n\n- Please, note that replayability value is not taken into consideration here. That check mark means hours needed for one fresh walkthrough on average. If you wish for more - you can bravely multiply that number.\n\n---{Optimization}---\n\u2610 Outstandingly polished product\n\u2611\ufe0f Impressively stable, but not perfect\n\u2610 Minor problems, you'll forget about them\n\u2610 Has some design issues, but you can make it\n\u2610 So unfair, that it's barely manageble\n\u2610 Not walkthroughable without cheap workarounds\n\u2610 This was released to lie and rob you.\n\n- Game crashed 3 times during my 132 hours of playing, and all of the cases were random, and did not break my enjoyment beyond reopening the game and continuing whatever i was doing without any further consequences.\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611\ufe0f It's worth every cent\n\u2610 Pricey, but it deserves your saved money\n\u2610 Wait for a discount\n\u2610 Take it only if you if you're SURE it's better than the rest of candidates.\n\u2610 Better check your wishlist again, i bet there are more worthy games over there\n\u2610 Greedy fuckers got insane\n\n- You're basically robbing Arkane Studios with such price tag, especially if you're waiting for a discount. This game deserves to be 60$.\n\nSo, to sum up: Game possesses an amazing story, tremendous gameplay, high replay value, it's optimized, and it's comparatively cheap. The rest of the game's discussed qualities are average, none of them any close to being bad.\n\nI say it's a yes.", "timestamp_created": 1678621153, "timestamp_updated": 1678621153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760645389556884766", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134516445": {"recommendationid": "134516445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993520785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 983, "last_played": 1680488962}, "language": "english", "review": "Very engrossing.

As a casual fan of sci-fi genre and science in general + lover of transhumanism theme in media I can highly recommend Prey. I won't tell the known story about \"unfair lack of attention on the release\", at that point it's just a fate for such cult games I guess. The design and art of Prey is remarkable, weapons, atmosphere, the idea and look behind different divisions and Talos-1 in general, it is very gorgeous. I personally believe that after gravity gun in half life, gloo gun in Prey is the next major step in creative weapon design (also lol, gravity gun and crowbar in half life and gloo gun and wrench in prey, you see?). Controls in open space are very natural and just right, giving the feeling as if I would really be in space. The view of Earth, Moon and cosmic void when you first go out into open space and feeling of it thanks to size of Talos, impressive distances between different objects and places outside the station, are really breathtaking and making you believe that you here are stranded; when I tried to fly away towards the Moon I was very horrified by loneliness and isolation that was pressing harder with every meter separating me from Talos, where, yeah, [b] typhons [/b] and stuff, but not this unimaginably sized emptiness. Story is intriguing and especially its final. Questions that will be raised here and decisions you make will test [b] yu [/b] as a person, as a [i] human being[/i]. Also side stories, lore and overall atmosphere of every crew member, their work before the incident, their relationships, everyday life here is very [b] human[/b]. You can really see how even the brightest [i] minds [/i] liked to play DnD or have a musical concert and other grounded stuff. Ofc there are some little bugs, that I even met in different walkthroughs at the same place, but as I said they are minor and don't break the game or your immersion. If you are not familiar with immersive sims (otherwise you know about Prey without this review lol) give it a try and especially try Prey if you just like good and unconventional sci-fi, it won't disappoint you and mby it will become your favorite game as [b] it [/b] has become for me", "timestamp_created": 1678548266, "timestamp_updated": 1678548984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134458855": {"recommendationid": "134458855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012833822", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 3705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3260, "last_played": 1678630175}, "language": "english", "review": "Early game - why there 2 chairs in front of 1 table in small room?\nMid game - hitting and shooting everything suspicious!\nEnd game - tossing recycle charges in room with a lot of props and killed mimic is just a bonus!\n\nAmazing sim with alot of freedom of what you can do!

The story for this game is great, it just does a good job of making you feel for these characters, once I started this game I had in my head made a decision for how I wanted to go with the story, but by the end of it, the world building and characters had convinced me to go down a different route.

The psi powers are solid, and they all have their uses (though some tend to be better than others). You can use them for the entire game, if you choose, which is great. Speaking of choices, there's a lot. You can choose how you want to enter a room, if you want to save someone, and what kind of skills you want to have. Freedom to enter a room guns blazing or sneak around the enemy. Your choices also directly affect the narrative. The gunplay is smooth, with unique options like the recycle charge (grenade but it gives you items when you use it), stun gun (best gun in the game after the shotgun), and the q-beam. The characters are fleshed out. There are all kinds of people on the space station and they all have real relationships with each other; the audio logs are well done and the world building is great too. The aliens are decently challenging, but you can always up the difficulty if you feel its lacking.

The station's purpose is to research an alien race called the Typhon and develop technologies to defend against them. You play as Morgan Yu, a scientist who wakes up with no memory of what's going on, and must unravel the mystery of what happened aboard Talos I.\n\nNow, let me tell you folks, this game's story is a real nail-biter. The plot twists and turns like a snake on roller skates, and it keeps you guessing until the very end. The characters are well-developed, and the voice acting is top-notch. The pacing is just right, and there's never a dull moment. The story is the highlight of this game, and it's worth playing just for that.\n\nNow, let's talk about the gameplay. Prey 2018 is a first-person shooter, but it's also an RPG and a survival horror game. You have to scavenge for resources and manage your inventory carefully, or you'll find yourself in a world of hurt. The enemies in this game, the Typhon, are no joke. They come in a variety of forms, from the small and squishy Mimics to the massive and terrifying Nightmare. Each Typhon has its own weaknesses and strengths, so you'll have to adapt your playstyle to take them down.\n\nThe game's level design is also top-notch. Talos I is a massive, interconnected space station with multiple routes and hidden areas. You can go just about anywhere you want, and there are plenty of secrets to discover. The puzzles in this game are challenging but fair, and they make you feel like a genius when you solve them.\n\nNow, I do have a minor gripe with this game like the loading times that are a bit on the long side. However, these issues are minor and don't detract from the overall experience.\nIn conclusion, Prey 2018 is a must-play for fans of sci-fi, horror, and RPGs. The story is gripping, the gameplay is challenging, and the level design is excellent.

First off I will say I did go into the game in the wrong way, when I found out Arkane made it I let myself expect Dishonored in Space, I didn't look at any trailers or pictures, I saw it was on sale so I bought it. So when I first got into the game, besides being blown away by the visuals I started to realize that this was gonna be more like System Shock and less like Dishonored, so once I got past that little mental hurdle I started to enjoy the game, all the interactions you can do are really impressive and it leads to a lot of \"A ha!\" moments when you finally figure out what to do, but to me that's all the game feels like it has to offer, it drags on and on and on and gets old once you've already discovered the intricacies of Talos 1 and even when you get past all the boring bits the ending just sorta drops on you, you are given a bunch of options to end the game at once that will impact the ending and it almost makes it feel like your choices throughout the game didn't really matter besides some dialogue, my favorite immersive sim, Deus Ex: Human Revolution does this kinda as well, but the over all enjoyment of that game makes up for it and also Human Revolution's endings are all more emotional in my eyes. Prey's twist was kinda lame too in my opinion, but what really gets me is it's just not memorable outside of the sticky note section or the Gloo Gun, when I think back to playing it, what mostly comes to mind is boring, dragging on sections and repetitiveness.
