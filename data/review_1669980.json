To echo the actual store page description, the player assumes the role of the father of the lovely little angel Rose (I went with the default given name in my first playthrough) and by his actions [spoiler](and her own later on in life)[/spoiler], will shape what kind of woman she grows into come adulthood. There are actually a fair number of endings present, which I will gloss on slightly a bit later.\n\n[h3]PROS:[/h3]\n+ The simplicity of [i]starting[/i]. The game begins fairly easily, with mechanics being easy to understand - it\u2019s mostly point-and-click throughout. However, the depth of Volcano Princess lies with all the various ways of growing Basic and Core attributes, developing Natural Skills and relationships with the various townspeople, and even acquiring hidden conditions (called \u201cDarkness\u201d) when nurturing Rose. Essentially, every action taken is factored into how the ending will turn out. Because of how free the player is in deciding their virtual daughter\u2019s future, Rose can actually become either a very good, or very bad person. Though, why would you ever want the latter, goodness gracious.\n\n+ There is a simple combat system in place which is only available when one chooses the Explore option while at the Forgotten Valley. Fairly straightforward and not tedious. Though maybe too simple for some. Successfully completing quests will advance Rose\u2019s Knight Career, something which gets introduced pretty early in the story.\n\n+ The gorgeous artwork is one of the game\u2019s biggest draws. Very adorable and lovely, and the various scenes spaced throughout the main and relationship stories are nicely done too.\n\n+ At the start of each day, the player is able to interact with Rose, with the frequency increasing as she matures. She is actually fully voiced for all these interactions. As of writing this, there are choices for Japanese or Chinese voices.\n\n+ The music is sweet. As expected of a game of this genre, it is calming, with fantasy tones befitting the setting. The various ambience presented is fairly soothing and relaxing to listen to on loop, in some areas.\n\n+ Developing relationships will influence the end game. Not simply who her future spouse(s) will be, but if I\u2019m not mistaken, it is also factored into what sort of career Rose will have. There exists a decent range of characters whom Rose can interact with and befriend. Some offer her jobs, others sell her clothing or equipment, and of course there are also those who can be recruited to join her party for explorations.\n\n+ The English translation is fairly good, with only minor inaccuracies in certain dialogues. And it\u2019s not all incorrect per se either, just, not the most suitable to use at times.\n\n[h3]NEUTRALS:[/h3]\n+/- There isn\u2019t much explanation of an overall, overarching story currently, despite it being sort of hinted at in the prologue, and here and there throughout the game\u2019s progress. While there are pieces of lore fillers, it currently lacks a cohesive structure. This could be a feature expanded upon by the developers, on a later date. Or even be the premise for a second title in the series? I hope so, either way.\n\n[h3]CONS:[/h3]\n- If you are a completionist, then you will be playing this game for a long, long while, considering the multitude of endings. However, if you\u2019re the sort to enjoy that, or just adore the simple fact of raising a child like Rose, then I suppose this is actually a big [b]PRO[/b] instead.\n\n[h2]VERDICT:[/h2]\nA very wholesome take on the life sim genre, Volcano Princess will charm you with its lovely main character and delightful setting. You\u2019ll be spending quite a bit of time exploring the various ways to go about parenting darling Rose. And at the end, you might even shed some genuine tears.", "timestamp_created": 1700706015, "timestamp_updated": 1700706015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151196437": {"recommendationid": "151196437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086540071", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1700697520}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, great story. \nRecommended if u want to spend a lot of time and have a hearthwarming experience while you do.", "timestamp_created": 1700697475, "timestamp_updated": 1700697475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151193711": {"recommendationid": "151193711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837843141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3120, "last_played": 1700696693}, "language": "english", "review": "a very cute game", "timestamp_created": 1700696549, "timestamp_updated": 1700696549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151181588": {"recommendationid": "151181588", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230981054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1689810875}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego, pase horas jugando.

I played PM 2, 3 and 5 for the most part, with PM3 being my most favorite and PM2 not far behind.\n\nYou played as \"Wood\" the father. The end game is to raise your daughter \"Rose\", guide her to various decision and watch her as she slowly transition from child to adulthood. You raising your daughter by balancing the resource, mostly Money and Action Point, to allocate your daughter stats, relationship with NPC, romancing marriage candidates both boys and girls, juggling your daughter moods, choosing which class she goes, horse racing, cooking, fight street thug, fight monster, fight demon, fight your friend, fight god, play dress up, meet important people, play dice, went acting, do alchemy, do math, and etc.... \n\nWith these much variety ways (side gameplay) of raising your daughter, the good news here is you won't have to deal with these all at once. The game did a pretty good job introducing and getting used to them as the time goes.\n\nAt it's core, Volcano Princess is a visual novel with a couple of mini games littered in between. Whatever decision you pick will slow affect your virtual daughter over the course of 8-12 hrs and where she will ended up. The game has many replayability. Many endings and loads of save slot at your disposal. RNG does influence the result from time to time. Save scumming can be an option for completionist. But I would recommend to go blind and try many mechanic this tiny game has to offer for the first run, then you can start doing min-maxing later.\n\nVoice acting is great, with both original Chinese and recently Japanese. Despite mostly limited to important sentence and your daughter. I'm not proficient at both language so I might be wrong, but I can feels the character well. The music well suited the game theme, usually clam and serene with an alright action music when things get heated in fight. The art is real good and consistence through most game some really beg to have a thumbnail or wallpaper. The mugshot and chibi icon really cute. Although, I kinda do wish all the NPC, beside Nina, can have an art or sprite as a children to growing along with the daughter, otherwise everyone just look either teenager and adult through out the whole game.\n\nUnlike Princess Maker, however, Volcano Princess is safe for all devoted christian and all age which ever decision you may choose. :)\n\nTo end the review, I overall gave this game 8/10. The only complain is that I felt the \"True Ending\" is a bit overwhelming, coming from me a PM fans, the way of achieving wise. And with 8-12 hrs per game is about OK, I do prefer a more arcade feels 3-5 hrs of PM 2 and 3 of a full play through (I'm looking at you PM5... I'm not a very save scummy person when it comes to this kind of game, but with a realistic pacing of 40+ hrs per playthough with many many possible ending!!? I know you would love to be the most comprehensive raising daughter game ever but come on now!). \n\nSome may complain about the english translation quality. While, yes, it does have some issues, mostly to do with conveying the emotion (lost in translation?). The text clipped off the textbox from time to time. I personally found the English does it job for the most part. They honestly did a much better job than CFK's Princess Maker half-arse translation, which sometimes do affect the game play in significant way. But here what we have is perfectly fine for the most part.\n\nOther than that, this game is a blast to go through. It makes you care and anticipate whatever in game NPC interaction can makes you overall feels good and real relax game. I'm happy for what I'm getting and a kind of game I can casually come back from time to time. :)", "timestamp_created": 1696918067, "timestamp_updated": 1697013803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567567586898803711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147953168": {"recommendationid": "147953168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047344707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1696899726}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and cute raising simulator.

She can romance anyone, even from the same sex, as well as have polygamous relationships. The game is full of choices, content, and heart.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some significant flaws in the game. The biggest of these (and the cause of a lot of issues) is the not-so-good translation of the game. It can cause misunderstandings about the gameplay instructions, make the dialogue feel uninteresting (which can make the game feel a bit draggy), and it makes the game feel very rough around the edges. Due to a lot of mistranslated text, some mechanics (like the dice game) are impossible to understand. \n\nIf you want to play a wholesome game with a lot of great content, art, mechanics, and choices (and dialogue), this will fit perfectly.

A franchise of games where a father (you) obtains a daughter in some way and has to do his best to keep her safe and so that she grows up into a wonderful woman that will find her way through life.\n\nI am not gonna go into too much detail about the mechanics and such as I feel figuring them out is half of the experience here but yes, this is basically Princess Maker 6.\n\nSadly similarly to Princess Maker series, it has a pretty bad English translation. If you cannot deal with that, then this might not be a game for you. It also has a rather strange saving system where you can only save at the start of the month. There is also a lot of RNG to combat, especially in the final dungeon where your daughter and her companions can just get stunned to death or instantly gibbed by certain enemies.\n\nBut, everything else is basically positive. When I played the game I have truly felt not just for my daughter Sylvie, but also for her father Fin (me) and all of the people of the Volcano Country. Where Princess Maker games kinda fail is secondary NPCs and Volcano Princess truly shines here.

I like this.  It's really kind good!  I'm also not sure exactly where to start.\n\nCons:  The English translation isn't the greatest and can lead to some mistakes when choosing dialogue lines.  The mini-games don't feel fully explained or were just awkward with no muscle memory to apply, and I whiiffed on most of them.  \n\nPros:  I usually play adult games and this came up on my feed and it is NOT an adult game (No I didn't expect it to be, but it was recommended based on my games played, which I thought was weird).  It's a cute child-raising game where you essentially level up the daughter and prepare her for life.   The artwork is great and the story was fairly engaging and cute.  There is a game + where you can buff up your stats to replay and get additional endings.\n\nWord of warning, it's possible to achieve endless action points (the ability to do things in your turn), and when you purchased from the blacksmith dude... you build a relationship with him that ends up with the daughter marrying the son, at least in some scenarios, so word of warning.  I was disappointed when I discovered it and had no way to cut it off.\n\nA key thing for ending are the attributes of stamina, mind, and charisma.   Lessons and a few other things help to build.  You also have other stats like strength, imagination, Emotional intelligence (I assume), and something else.   These determine how easy your lessons will be and are also gating elements for jobs and maybe other things every time you level those states, you get to upgrade your skills which makes the game easier.\n\nI'd say a second play-through is required because I'll be surprised if someone plays with zero errors due to the translation.  Still, it is mostly understandable and enjoyable.\n\ntime played:  21 hours first play through although about three-four hours was building up cash/action points and massively building up stats as much as I could.  I still have a few more endings to do before my play-through, \n\nValue?:   I'd say yes either on sale or not.  I think it went on sale and that's why I pulled the trigger, but I'm not 100%.   Either way it is worth it.\n\nSo, do I recommend it?  Yes.   I purchased it on a whim because I wanted something different, and this worked well.

Your goal in the game is to raise/guide your daughter until she is an adult. Making her study/engage in different activities will influence her attributes. A different combination of attributes or level of these attributes will determine her adult life. Every day make sure you plan what you want to do to make her the happiest (or not)! There seems to be not only many different endings but also different romance pairing endings depending on how your daughter\u2019s attributes are built(can romance both boy and girl and poly ending). There are also many items you can unlock after beating the game. There is a gallery with a collection just 100% this game will take a lot of hours. This leaves you with many hours of enjoyment getting your money back. However this can lead to burnt out. The relative structure of each playthrough and some events are fixed, what will be different is the different way you want to guide your daughter. Do you want her to be more combat focused? Or maybe guide her to be a lady? Do this by choosing different knight paths at the beginning of her school years and choosing different activities. Players who play VNs, or other life sim type games or games with life sims aspects (persona, fire emblem three houses) are familiar with this repetition but can get tiring if played for too long. I often felt myself going onto autopilot when playing for a long session forgetting that even though I was focused on trying to complete one goal I was ignoring the other important stats. I would advise you to take a break. (also thank God for the skip button for multiple playthroughs!!) \n   The translation from chinese to english is really not the best but playable. You can definitely tell it was translated literally from chinese at some places. You can get the general idea of the main story and what the characters are saying. Lore from NPC or friendship candidates events will give more background into the setting. The events are nice and some are cuter/have a more romantic undertone than the others. You do feel bad when high friendship characters send you a sad letter when you pick another person over them to marry. Even though it took a lot to process what was happening in the true story due to the unclear translation I can get the idea but I am still a little confused by it but I do not think this game is played for the main story anyways.  Before when you start there is little tutorial text you can read and after there are little question marks you can mouse over if you do not understand some parts of the gameplay or stats but this game does not handhold you. I liked being able to play the game/figure out how the game works for me.\nYou might also need a walkthrough to get all the endings or if you beat the game once the archive will tell you what stats are needed to unlock that career path. I would advise you to use the note feature on the steam overlay and write down which career path you are aiming for and the requirements.\n\n[b]CREEPY DAD SECTION?[/b]\nThose who are wary about playing as a Dad well once your daughter turns to a teen I believe you are playing as both characters the Dad and the daughter. Especially during the in town segments you are playing as the daughter. (I think we are the daughter because the Dad does not know the daughter\u2019s friends even if we give her pocket money it disappears from the UI\u2026). So I like the idea that we are guiding the daughter now instead of raising her. She is free to choose her own path, the Dad is not forcing her. I did not feel creepy at all at being a Dad character and felt the daughter was more self insert than the Dad. Secondly, the Dad really loves the Mom from what I can understand from the true ending and the home part of the end game bonuses section. The game did not influence me at all to be a real Dad except maybe at the end a little at the end XI JINPING SORRY!\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b] \nVolcano Princess is a good game that is worth the price for the time you can play. While this game can have a lot of repetition there is a lot of replay value with the different career paths and knight path you can choose and different stat routes. If the English translation was professionally proficient (this is something that can change, hopefully fixed in the future!), I could see this game becoming bigger in the West with streamers.

You might regret it if you named her as \"xKhaleesix\"\n\nOk, Volcano Princess. Before I bought it, I don't have any clue about this game, but this game kept appearing on my recommendation so I gave it a try. My first impression on playing this game was \"oh, maybe this is some kind of otome game that I read in novel/manga/manhwa, I'll just try for below 2 hours before sleep and then refund it laa\". At that time I don't have high expectation for this game, then I stopped playing not because it's near 2 hours threshold, I stopped because sunlight already appears on my window.\n\nFrom the very first minutes, the game's beautiful music instantly drew me in, creating a captivating ambiance. The interaction between the daughter and the father is very sweet, the progression is reinforcing. I really like how I, as a father in this game try to min max my daughter but still keeping her happy because there is a penalty if the daughter's mood is below 50. By playing this game, you could watch the progression of your daughter from childhood to adult, and most of your decision in nurturing her would affect the ending. \n\nThe romanceable characters in this game is a lot, from typical otome game male lead to Mark the regular guard. Even there is a yuri ending here, so there are many options that you could choose. \n\nThe negative aspect of this game is, the save system. It only save your data at the beginning of the month, even if you save your data in the middle of your activities. So it's frustrating if you want to stop playing, but you still in the middle of your activities. \n\nIn conclusion, Volcano Princess delivers an emotionally satisfying journey alongside a developing daughter . It's a game that surprises and delights, with a variety of choices and outcomes that will keep players coming back for more. Whether you're a fan of otome games or just looking for an engaging and heartwarming experience, this game is well worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1690368981, "timestamp_updated": 1690368981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775860249996185303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142801798": {"recommendationid": "142801798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045057436", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1690338062}, "language": "english", "review": "I had refunded this game at launch, though at this point I couldn't remember why.

According to it, this is a parenting simulation, where you play the father, and your actions only indirectly influence daughter's life. And this is true - for a first chapter of a game. But then it quickly switches to directly controlling daughter, who essentially became the PC, with father mostly doing the side jobs on a backstage. This throws down the immersion, and kinda takes the most interesting part from the promise.\n-This is a translated game, and it shows. It handles simple conversations and descriptions pretty fine, but even after careful re-reading I still have only a vague understanding of what was the truth behind the main plot mystery. \n-Gameplay, while not difficult, is quite... esotheric. There are multiple sub-systems which are related in a non-intuitive way, like Strength and Endurance belonging to two entirely different systems of stats. This can (and will) be quite hard to comprehend. For example despite heavily focusing on Combat path, winning Royal Tournament, finishing all the adventures numerous times, having great martial stats and completing hell of a lot of combat-orientated courses, I wasn't offered any half-descent military career in the ending. Which might be realistic, but is still frustrating.\n...but in the end, all of it doesn't matter. \nWhat does matter is that this game made me care. Made me worry.

With about 6 turns to go (June), I realised that I'm 20 points short in Science and there's no more Science course to take. I rolled back to an earlier save (February) but no matter what I did, I still came up 20 points short. I'd already exhausted all the aforementioned ways to unlock more Courses. Reading discussions online, it seems that I should've bought a Science master class. But they're only available to buy 3 times a year and I'd already bought the 'wrong' classes in January.\n\nSo I had unwittingly locked myself out of the Queen ending with 12 turns to spare. All because I didn't work out which subjects needed to be supplemented by master classes. Too bad. Return to square one.

I played that game to death back in the day, and I'm so happy to find a game that is worthy not of just being a successor but even better than it. In the game, you raise your daughter. It sounds simple, but the game is a complex fabric of planning your daughter's interactions, which kind of interactions she should have, the skills she should develop, her mood, her fame, her 'darkness', your wealth, and how many action points you have for the day. There are numerous possible endings and a New Game+ mode in which you can increase your daughter's starting stats. See how your actions affect her future and her future selves as you raise ... well, whomever you want.\n\nI can't praise this game enough. The gameplay is fantastic, with six mini-games to play as well (combat, mathematics game, two different dice games, horse racing, and a 'painting' game). The audio is adorable, although only available in Chinese and Japanese. The art is charming, memorable, and consistently high quality. My single complaint would be that the English localization is slightly rough around the edges in some places, e.g. \"don' t\" instead of \"don't\" and some NPC name spelling inconsistencies. You'll be too busy farming, stuffing your daughter's face with bread, racing horses, keeping her from being evil, and battling monsters in the forest to notice. You'll get a sense of fulfillment out of seeing your plans succeed and your daughter reach your goals all the while developing relationships with more than a dozen NPCs.\n\nThis game is worth your time.

If it was in early acess.\n\nTh entire game feels like it's an Alpha. A very playable alpha mind you, but an Alpha. Like, most of the game's content feel shallow, one way or another, or straight up unfinished. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem if this wasn't the type of game that you're expected to have multiple playthoughs, making the cracks be more apparent the more and more you play. Sometimes you'll see it early in the game, with some game mechanics presented differently than they are currently, almost as if the dev changed how it worked but forgot to change the tutorial text.\n\nAlso a big unfinished thing: The translation. It's technically finished, but good lord, it's bad. Like, it's really bad. google translator/literal translation bad. And given that this is a game that was originally chinese... Yeah. The translation sometime get's weird. And given that this is a story driven game, it really hurts your ability appreciate the characters dialogue and their story. For example, there is a character that has difficult speaking. It took my second playthrough to realize that was on purpose and not the translation being bad. \n\nThe translation is also very confusing for the gameplay itself. The same mechancs will be given two different names, sometimes three, making you have to guess what you're even doing.\n\nWhich is not to say the game is bad in everything, the art is absolutely gorgeous, there is hundreds of different of beautiful drawn images, there's dozens of endings, dozens of marriage ending, and the game feels engaging enough for the first playthrough, and you get a good attachment to your daughter as she grows up.\n\nSo... Yeah. a 6.5/10.\n\nPs: The dev team is like, 2 people for most of the stuff in it. Which is absolutely insane given the amount of things this game has, as shallow as they may feel. Hopefully with the amount of copies the game sold they can afford to hire a full time dev team, either for a sequel, or to make the current content feel more cohesive and replayable.\n\nAlso, for the love of god.

This game is a cutesy daughter raising simulator where you raise a kid to become the best that she can be or some degenerate bandit and a menace to society. That doesn't necessarily make this game bad as a simulator as that kinda makes this realistic. However, that's not why I am putting this on a not recommended list as this is a really good daughter raising simulator. I kinda am putting this on a thumbs down list, because there is no middle, eh or idk list. I like daughter raising simulator games, its just that sometimes they go too far in the simulator category that makes you want to go into incognito mode cause you don't want people to know what you are playing.\n\nThe problem I have with this game is a bit hard to put bluntly, but I must say that if you are a parent, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE NOTE OF THIS ------> there are child-adult relationships in this game.\n\nNow of course, in a medieval fantasy setting a younger girl marrying an older man would not be uncommon, and both in this game and in an actual medieval kingdom, most people wait until both marriage candidates are adults(unless they are royalty, in which case you could be a 4 year old princess getting married to a middle aged man). putting that out of the way, a lot of romanceable characters in this game are older than the said daughter you are raising from okay 3 to 4 years to questionable 6 to 10(which at the time your daughter goes to an academy makes all these older people legally adults). all the romanceable character close to the same age seemingly are girls.  there is even close to the start of the game a declaration that if anyone defeats a said named enemy, to marry the princess. a woman who is probably 6 to 10 years older than the daughter being raised(yes gay relationships are allowed in this game, you can have a gay daughter if you want).  the only plus side in this is that the game seems to wait a little bit until that daughter becomes an adult, but that's no better than grooming a kid.\n\nit seems like a lot of these daughter raising simulators allow you to have the daughter marry people much older than them. I remember playing some of the older daughter raising simulator games where your daughter can marry an elderly king who is probably 70 years old in that game(much like modern 20 year old hot women try to marry rich 80 year old men, yes this is a thing). Either way, just keep in mind that these type of games can have seriously adult topics that I would not allow anyone at least at and below the age of 12 or anyone with the mental age of a 12 year old to play this game.\n\nThat being said, if you understand that child adult relationships are not okay or decide to larp as a bad parent. then go right ahead. its a simulation game at the end of the day these characters are not real I just don't want people to think this kind of thing is normal.\n\n\n\n\nThis might be a bit of a spoiler as well so:\n\n\n\n\nOne of the love interests is your possessed? sister who you didn't know about. it get's revealed on one of the playthroughs so I guess an incest warning should be included as well.

Ending the first time yet I still want to replay this game again to see other branching paths, possibilities and romantic connections that could be had among the characters of the game.\n\nAlso despite my near neurotic Tiger Parenting to eek out the best possible stats I could to see Rose rise as high as possible the first time, I didn't quite make it due to inexperience, mistakes  and the cruelty of random numbers so I was surprised by New Game+ mechanic, which coupled with your experience the first time, should allow for a more fun and exploratory second playthrough.\n\nThe lure to Aim for the Stars, Again, and Again, until you hit all in the night sky is a great treat.\n\nBe warned though, this game is not just cute tooth rot fodder.

While Volcano Princess is a small game in literal storage size, it's a huge feast of wholesomeness and enjoyment.  The game is all about min-maxing your daughter as her sole parent and watching her progress as she grows up.  It's such a simple concept done [i]so well[/i].  Egg Hatcher (devs) should be proud of this outstanding game.\n\nAs for pros and cons\n+ A bit of everything; combat, intellect, romance, sorcery...\n+ The art is pleasing to the eye, and there's no shortage of art to discover.\n+ A generally like-able character set.  I couldn't bring myself to dislike any of the characters. [spoiler]Hacket and Ze have their issues, but still likeable[/spoiler]\n+ Significant, widespread depth: Volcano Princess isn't the best at anything it does, but it's the best at combining all of them into a single game.\n+ Quality of Life controls, so you aren't trapped reading the same dialogue over and over.\n+ Each of the three main paths for the game do actually feel different when replaying.  Going for a charisma build is quite a bit different than brute forcing via a strength build.\n+ Entertaining minigames and interesting \"challenge-sequences\", with a lot of flavor text to help flesh out what are essentially stat-checks.\n+++ Incredibly wholesome father-daughter moments.  Many parts genuinely had me smiling out of happiness.\n- The English Translation could use some proofreading by a native English-speaker.  Not really that bad.\n- Some mechanics could use better explanation, such as \"fame\", which can be freely spent at the church without damaging ending potentials (not 100% on this, please comment if I am incorrect).\n- Horse crash.  The first time you open the menu to catch a horse, the game crashes.  This should be an easily preventable issue, and had me stay away from the game for a while after... before coming back.\n- Exploitable/missing mechanics.  Magic materials are pointless, sell them to the smith for extra cash.  [spoiler]Food and fertilizer are stupid powerful, need a cooldown on purchases[/spoiler]\n-? Not much in terms of negative outcomes, only a handful that can really be called bad... granted, a few of them are [i]really[/i] bad.\n-? Age gap... Depending on who you are and what you think of the setting, the age gap can be an issue for some romance paths (worst case is like 24 to 18, not outrageous but certainly questionable for modern standards).\n+? Saves begin at the beginning of each turn only, essentially preventing save-scumming.\n+? Japanese translation is decent, though that's coming from a non-native Japanese speaker.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9.5/10, with it very likely reaching 10/10 with updates to the localization and tooltips.

It is a visual novel based on a management simulation gameplay. The English translation is tolerable (especially after the early game) and the story is expansive and emotional. There are various characters to romance and interact at several places. And the artwork\u2026 so beautiful and so cute at times.\n\nStory:\nYou follow the story of the father (you) and the daughter. You get the ability to customize the father and daughter\u2019s name, and change the daughter\u2019s outfits. Although viewing the game from the perspective of the father, at a certain point in the early game, the daughter is frequently able to travel alone without the father. Her interactions and adventures outside are within her perspective. Only at home or story events do you return to the father\u2019s perspective.\n\nThere is a lot of lore to explore (the war, the spouse, the characters, etc) and you have about 40+ weeks to interact with the story and characters as much as possible. By the end of the game, you will understand what it feels like to be a father of a child. I never thought I would be so proud of a digital daughter.\n\nCharacters:\nThere are 16 romance-able and 2 non-romance-able characters. As you interact, gift, consult, challenge, or hangout with these characters, you will further develop a relationship with them. All of them have 3 unlock-able events with a cute cg artwork. Some are interesting, some clich\u00e9, and others are something else. \n\nGameplay:\nThere is quite a bit of mechanics in play that must be covered so here is the simplified general overview.\nThe game will give you general goals to choose. For example, the kind of father you want to be (doting, strict, mentor, etc) and the progress toward said goals. As you play, the actions or choices you make may advance or hinder your progress to achieving said goal.\n\nFrom character interactions, weekly class selections, party adventure, and more; there are a lot to do in the game. However, you do not need to go everywhere or do everything. I personally never unlocked the horse racing but still progressed easily. Just do as much or a little as you want to progress through the game.\n\nThe game is replay-able, especially if you want to see the 58 potential endings (with amazing cg art) that your daughter will grow up to be, see all three cg events of the interactable characters, or understand the lore behind the war and/or your spouse. It will, however, feel repetitive over time with some gameplay, especially with the weekly class selections.\nThe one game took about 10 hours for me, probably a few hours shorter if you avoid doing everything or understand the mechanics. \n\nThe English translation, while clearly not the best, is quite do-able. I only really noticed significant translation errors in the early game, with the mid to late game occurring less. The errors themselves are not too difficult to understand the real meaning of the sentence. If grammar is such an issue for you, you may be daunted to play this game but I assured you that its worth the minor trouble to enjoy the game.\n\nPrice:\nFor $14 CDN, its set at a great price. This game became one of my most memorable games (give or take that most games nowadays are expensive for lacklustre gameplay), and with the numerous amounts of endings and replay-ability, it is worth every looney. \n\nOverall:\nIf the game pique your interest, purchase it. You always have 2 hours of gameplay before refunding anyway. This game was a renaissance for me as I never had any other similar game that I could compare to \u201cLong Live the Queen.\u201d Thanks to ShocTrooper for recommending the game to me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1688988440, "timestamp_updated": 1688988440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141749943": {"recommendationid": "141749943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162291468", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1689209562}, "language": "english", "review": "very cute, will play again\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688985959, "timestamp_updated": 1688985959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141749671": {"recommendationid": "141749671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397900987", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1303, "last_played": 1695361491}, "language": "english", "review": "A genuinely good game with punch to the gut story.\nPlus, it's got a fishing mini-game.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688985642, "timestamp_updated": 1689139655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141746518": {"recommendationid": "141746518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198873279951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 675, "last_played": 1690814465}, "language": "english", "review": "The game creators thought process was pretty much - let her be anything and date anyone.\nAnd honestly I'm here for it.", "timestamp_created": 1688981376, "timestamp_updated": 1688981376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141745514": {"recommendationid": "141745514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070844265", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1556, "last_played": 1690881051}, "language": "english", "review": "I started this three days ago and I'm already 25 hours in.

Has a lot of NPCs, most of which are romanceable by your daughter. NPCs are generally interesting and open up to you as you raise their favourability. As you play, locations are slowly added for you to explore. There's plenty of career paths for your daughter and events and locations. A few mini-games here and there (they're a bit of a mixed bag I guess).\n\n\nNow for some negatives. First of all, there is absolutely zero challenge at all! The game is ridiculously easy, like game journalists would find it stupidly easy, that's how easy it is. There's no real stakes, your daughter cannot die, get sick and no real bad ending, etc. Also, even stumbling around on your first playthrough doing random stuff, it's far too easy to level up your stats to unlock the higher end career endings. This is before you start exploiting AP gains to do even more activities. Finishing achievements gives you points to make things even easier for new game+ as well. So if you're looking for a bit of challenge you will likely find yourself really disappointed.\n\nFYI, I unlocked the 'true' ending on my first run, it's stupidly easy to complete. I went for a physical build and near the end of the game I got a prompt to follow my lord in fighting in the forest. So I did so, cleared the final forest level with the lord, then killed the couple of simple boss fights and boom true ending unlocked. Haven't played Princess Maker or some of it's other copycats but the general feel I got from them was that their 'true' endings generally were difficult to complete, requiring lots of exploring in other runs to learn more of secrets, not something everybody can stumble randomly into. I got the general gist of the ending but it was still a bit confusing given that this was my first run through the game. It made more sense after I did a run with the Princess as my lord and I finished this again along with the best career ending.\n\nAll the career and romance options make it sound like the game would be good for replayability but the game itself is really linear. Generally you'd want to just grind as many of these out by simply reloading last day save and choosing other career option. There's potions you can get that reduce your stats just for this reason lol. Romance can be swapped by keeping everybody below 140 and then just boosting the person you want with a date + gift.\n\n\nFYI, game crashed when trying to catch a horse for the first time. This seems to be a known issue and resolved after restarting following the crash. Didn't notice any of bugs of note so overall game was stable for me.

The age ranges for most of the love interests are concerning, especially when playing in the 13 year old stage. I know that the idea is she is friends with people for a while before developing feelings but still, being able to pursue someone 20 years older is a bit icky.

With her mother missing, it is up to you to care and raise your daughter until she leaves the nest at the age of 18. During a playthrough you will decide which classes she takes, which jobs she works, who will she engage in a relationship with and so on. Depending on your choices your virtual daughter will choose a different career path at the end, and she could become everything from a simple waiter or actress to even a queen of the kingdom itself.\n\nLike in all raising sims, the core gameplay loop of VP is raising your child's stats by interacting with people in a nearby town, enrolling her in classes, and managing her mood/stress level. You only have a limited number of actions you can spend each turn, and you have to think carefully where do you want to put your focus in. You can take part in various festivals, go on banquets, bet on horse races, grow crops on the field, go on expeditions to vanquish monsters in the wilderness, and even gamble through a dice mini-game.\n\nIn some ways VP is also kinda a dating sim. The Volcano Kingdom is populated with various people who your daughter can befriend and even romance. And yes, lesbian and even polyamorous relationships are very much possible, if someone wants to guide their daughter that way. It's heartwarming to see diverse love stories unfold, showcasing the developers' commitment to inclusivity and embracing different orientations and relationship dynamics. Each character has their own personality, backstory and preferred topics for conversations, and you can easily keep track of their relationship status with a handy and detailed menu screen. I feel there is something for everybody, from simple tavern girl and childhood friend, to inspired poet, and then a classic womanizer or a timid prince. All this is greatly enhanced by a charming art style. And before somebody asks: no, you can't marry your daughter.\n\nVP has significant replay potential, with over 50 job endings you can earn, not to mention various romance options. For minmaxers, that want their daughter to become a wunderkind that is a world-class actress AND a crime boss AND a legendary warrior AND a prolific writer, there are numerous post-game bonuses. Earning achievements give you points that unlock huge advantages in future playthroughs such as stat boosting, additional dresses (for even more stat boosting) and even improved social status.\n\nVolcano Princess is an ambitious indie title, and it still has a few bugs and exploits, but devs are actively patching them up. The English translation is pretty rough, and it often suffers from awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, and occasional inconsistencies, which can detract from the overall experience.\n\nDespite this shortcoming, Volcano Princess remains a captivating daughter-raising simulator that offers hours of engaging gameplay. The game strikes a delicate balance between managing resources, fostering relationships, and exploring a rich world filled with intriguing characters. The narrative is filled with emotional moments, challenging decisions, and unexpected twists that keep players invested in their role as a caretaker.\n\nThis game enchanted me. I thought I would refund it, but then I spent 10+ hours utterly absorbed by my virtual daughters life, and then immediately starting a new game once the first had been finished. Whether you're a fan of simulation games or simply appreciate a heartfelt narrative, Volcano Princess is a journey worth embarking on.\n\nRecommended\n\n8+/10", "timestamp_created": 1688880611, "timestamp_updated": 1688888048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485294133424758911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141645013": {"recommendationid": "141645013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087939916", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1333, "last_played": 1688931931}, "language": "english", "review": "My daughter married both the prince and princess and become Queen 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688867603, "timestamp_updated": 1688868179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528500914573669434", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141639758": {"recommendationid": "141639758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879378321", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 826, "last_played": 1695010278}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting plot, great characters, & fun gameplay!

Rose is designed to make you proud, just to put the panic in your heart when the game asks you: But yo dude, do you even make HER proud?\n\nRose's day will occasionally be disrupted with problems that you - that is, the father - need to talk her through. What you say to her determines how she sees you. If you neglect her, Rose will still go out and make you proud - but she will see you as terrible. For the most part though, it's hard to do wrong by Rose. Most folks grew up with parents who, even though they fumbled from time to time, loved them dearly. So long as you love your daughter, she will encourage you just as you encouraged her.\n\nIn a way, Volcano Princess feels like a celebration of parenthood and the bond that a father has with his daughter.

There's like 3 or 4 career endings that have you not ending up with anyone for Reasons(tm). But I have gotten the most evil ending while still marrying the Princess. Its SO nice to be able to have the romance interests separate from the career endings.\n\nThe only slight con I have with this game is that the English translation is not the greatest. You can still understand the story and dialogue, so I was still invested in the True Ending when I got it. But there are moments where you have to stop and go \"...oh THAT'S what they meant\". Its not terrible, but it is noticeable\n\nYou will accidentally become a min-maxer and be too addicted to getting every endings but its okay because your daughter is so cute and you wanna do everything to make her happy.

I saw it multiple times on steam and always ignored it because from the images it didn't tell me much. But then I decided to try it, and boy if I regret not playing it earlier...\nThe images literally transmit NOTHING of the whole essence of the game.\n\nI wasn't really expecting much from the start, nonchalantly opening it and putting my friend's name as my Daugher's name for some laugh, then the game hits you with \"What kind of Father do you want to be?\", giving you three choices.\nFrom those three choices you understand that there's way more in this game than just a cute chilly game with cute arts.\nIt's a whole constructed RPG.\nThere's everything: fighting, duels, entertainment, games with dices, race with horses, taming, relationships, bonds, houses (as in royalty, or take Harry Potter), customization both of clothes and the room, routes, skill trees, the \"darkness\" ([i]when you walk away[/i], literally), multiple endings and secret endings (that's what the game tells you about the darkness).\nIt's so damn full of stuff that I really was. not. expecting at all.\n\nLike I said I started this game as a joke, it was around 11pm, after a bit of playing, without noticing it was already 3am. \"A little bit more and then I'll go to sleep\"; two hours later at 5am+ my homie reaching for me \"Please go to sleep\"\n\"Soon\u2122\".\n\nThe first playthrough is gonna be a bit confusing, for me at least it was. Might it be the late hours or the overload of some informations, but I didn't understand some things at first, and I've failed the father's goal TWICE, but it's fine because the replayability of this game is definitely high and I'm gonna go for it again; like I said there's multiple endings and routes and decisions to take, and it doesn't seem like doable doing both the fighter and the royalty route together for obvious reasons.\n\nThe story of the game may seems pretty blant at first but I think it's deeper than what it feels like. Playing the role of the Father and watching your Daughter growing, learning how life can be harsh; in fact almost everytime you're doing something for the first time, you're going to fail. You're sad about that, but that's just life, and in the end, just like the Daughter do, think about the food and move on, because it's going to get better and you're gonna improve. This is definitely what this game shows and it does it pretty well. \nThere's more in the whole story itself but I still don't know because I'm writing my first impression after my first ending, but there is and it does sound interesting.\nThe OSTs are good, very comfy and chill. The art is really cute and good at the same time.\n\nI feel like this game will receive many more patch notes; I've seen people saying the english translation is bad, and sometimes it is indeed a bit strange. But they're definitely improving it because it doesn't sound as bad as people make it sound.\n\nIn the end I would say this game it's definitely worth its price, if you see it and you're not convinced by it from the images on steam (like I was), try it. If you're scared you can always refund it and two hours are enough to understand if you like it or not; if you notice them go by.", "timestamp_created": 1688310304, "timestamp_updated": 1691190664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 108, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900138258934020996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141134258": {"recommendationid": "141134258", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482655712", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 423, "last_played": 1689174941}, "language": "english", "review": "SO SO GOOD THIS GAME IS SO WORTH IT T_T its so addicting to play", "timestamp_created": 1688305673, "timestamp_updated": 1689175004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141134034": {"recommendationid": "141134034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136925385", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1688588939}, "language": "english", "review": "Married the crazy masked knight and became a hunter after killing a god.\n\nAbout standard fare for an anime.", "timestamp_created": 1688305501, "timestamp_updated": 1688305501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141127024": {"recommendationid": "141127024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062233888", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1082, "last_played": 1688845521}, "language": "english", "review": "The core gameplay is so goooodddd! with lot of endings available.

Grammar. (In English at least)\nThe grammar could use some work which is understandable since the game is originally Chinese. The names of the characters are inconsistent and changes from time to time in the story and even in the achievements which leads to confusion. Most of these are negligible and very minor but you'll have to connect the dots yourself sometimes.\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Possible spoilers below[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n\n2. Endings/Achievements*\nMy biggest gripe of the game as of writing this review. The way this game checks for some endings (and some achievements) is via tiers which means that you'll some endings have that have 2 or more versions of that ending and whichever the highest tier depending of its conditions is the ONLY ending you can select. Heres a very simplified example of what.\n\n[table]\n[tr][th]Ending[/th][th]Requirement[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Scholar[/td][td]MND > 50[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]Great Scholar[/td][td]MND > 100[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\nHere you can see 2 endings split in 2 different tier and this is where the problem starts. If by the end of the game lets say your MND is around 120, that would mean that you will unlock the Great Scholar ending and [b]ONLY[/b] the Great Scholar ending so even if you technically cleared the requirements for the lower tier ending, it will not be unlocked unless you play the game again from the start and [b]PURPOSELY[/b] limit your characters abilities. Leading to multiple \"speedrun\"s of the game just to unlock an ending.\n\nAs much as I like the game, I dont have it in me to play extra fast multiple times just to unlock endings and I hope we get to have a patch in the future to just unlock all tiers of endings as a choice if we did meet its criteria.

[u][b]if[/b][/u] it wasn't for a few major problems with the game. As soon as these are fixed I can confidently give it my seal of approval. I would still recommend it if you can snag it on a good steam-sale deal\n\n1.\nCurrently the English translation is riddled grammatical mistakes and other problems such as;\n-Spelling errors \n-Capitalization problems\n-Incorrect Syntaxing\n-Weird/stiff sounding English or \"Chinese word for word translations\" occasionally\n              -This causes some NPC dialogue, which I assume in Chinese would characterize the NPC's better, to feel very samey\n-The tutorial text and \"system mechanic\" names are written in really bizarre English.\n\n2. \nThere are a surprisingly large amount of bugs for what is a glorified visual novel. Some of these will freeze your game forcing you to close the application and start the day over and some causes text dialogue to skip at seemingly random\n\nBeyond these 2 massive problems that keep me from recommending this game I do have a fair bit of other criticisms just the same way I have things that I would praise the game for.\n\n[u]Cons:[/u] \n0. All of the bugs/English translation problems that I noted above.\n1. The gameplay gets very stale very quickly because of it's repetitive nature. The game tries to remedy this by giving the players minigames and access to an turn-based RPG combat area but it does not in anyway push you towards that with a very few exceptions.\n2. The soundtrack is fairly poor and the Audio mixing is none existent. At best it's a atmospheric piece that gets abruptly cut off because you left the area. At worst it's a very recognizable copyright free ost that clearly stands out and does not fit the vibe of the area at all.\n3. You will need to discover most of the game by yourself. It gives occasional tutorials but they're written in bizarre English and are mostly front-loaded when you start playing the game. It can be a struggle to find the tutorials after you've clicked past them.\nYou could argue that the last point is kind of fitting as it's a game about growing up and having to find your own way in this world\n\n[u]Pros:[/u] \n1. A very wholesome and comfy story about growing up. At times the characters can seem a bit unrealistic for their age in terms of how they act but that's a minor nitpick on my end.\n2. Overall very good looking artwork.\n3. A lot of endings with a build in newgame+ to speed things up..\n4. The game does not lock your daughter into just dating \"canonical characters\" as many games use as an excuse. If they're an NPC that you can build rapport with, they're romanceable.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1688125363, "timestamp_updated": 1688125363, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.64584583044052124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140964389": {"recommendationid": "140964389", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013261858", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 110, "last_played": 1688739708}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a cute game pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1688121570, "timestamp_updated": 1688121570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140957511": {"recommendationid": "140957511", "author": {"steamid": "76561199142144966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1006, "last_played": 1694346766}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game so much.

There are many different characters you can befriend or marry, this game allows you to marry both men and women and if you want you can have a romantic ending with 2 people at the same time! \n\nLike any other game you have skills you should raise to get the outcome you want, depending on what skill you focus on you get a different career endings, and some romantic endings. Unlike other games you choose the ending, meaning it gives you multiple options in the end if you focused on multiple skills or if that skill has multiple careers tied to it.

Hardly any tutorials - you'd get randomly thrown in many of the events and by the time you figure out what to do you've lost action points and gold\nSoundtrack: Ambient audio doesn't fit with the setting e.g. sirens can be heard in the background and its very repetitive\n* English translation: C for effort, but there are a lot of words with grammar issues, random spaces, some sentences are all lowercase. You eventually get used to it, but it harms immersion. I could fix the issues for free, don't have much to do anyways\n* Bugs: Quite a few, but might just be me, I'll do a NG+ run and re-check. Autosave and manual save do the same thing, which is putting you back at the start of the month, not where you left off\n\n\nOverall, I give it a score of 7 with the hope that future patches will fix any translation issues.", "timestamp_created": 1688100506, "timestamp_updated": 1688101152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140949356": {"recommendationid": "140949356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109210800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1254, "last_played": 1694857162}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun but get bored after 30 hours", "timestamp_created": 1688099699, "timestamp_updated": 1688099699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140946886": {"recommendationid": "140946886", "author": {"steamid": "76561199043286239", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1700078892}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't need to even finish the game to call this a 10/10.

The art is cute, the chibi are cute.\nIf anything lack is probably the lewd aspect of the Princess Maker (they had more revealing outfit). But i'm not complaining, outfits in this game are top notch design wise.\nMy complaint is, i feel this could be expanded further...\nPerhaps at later DLC.\nThe child's job for example, is a bit lacking compared to PM.\nNo church job, work at home options (housekeeping, stable keeping for example).\nAlso more dungeon variety, other than the forest and the dark alley.\nMore costume, i liked the gears at the ending.\nFull plate armor, Hunter outfit, etc.\nOr even go to r18 if you want to be thorough with some of the endings.\n\nFor who don't understand Princess Maker.\nIt is a kid raising game. From a little 8-10 y/o kid to 17 or 18th.\nDoing actions will increase or decrease the kid's stat. The actions are such, taking a lesson, doing work, battling monsters, fishing, farming, painting, participating contests, festival, etc. How you manage your daughter will trigger a specific ending. You might be a doting father, caring father, etc. Also it will decide with whom she will marry later. It is quite an arduous process, especially at the original Princess Maker. And the ending is supposedly the fruition of your hard work. It is a management game with RPG element, have multiple story, and ending. Collecting the harder ending is also why it has a lot of replay-ability value.\n\nDo i recommend the game? Oh yes.

Hay menos estad\u00edsticas que tomar en cuenta y son relativamente f\u00e1ciles de manejar, lo que evita quebraderos de cabeza cuando estas buscando un final especifico. Ademas, la mayor\u00eda de los finales (que por cierto son bastantes) son relativamente f\u00e1ciles de alcanzar en los 40 turnos que nos dan, evitando que un ciclo se acabe sinti\u00e9ndose demasiado largo (problema que tuve con, por ejemplo, Ciel Fledge). Incluso los finales mas complicados pueden volverse muy f\u00e1ciles si optas por aplicar las bonificaciones de NG+, por no hablar de que  puedes obtener f\u00e1cilmente 8-10 finales en cada ciclo, ya que no te encierran en uno en particular en base a tus estad\u00edsticas (e incluso te marcan los que ya has conseguido antes, ademas de permitirte reducir tus estad\u00edsticas para sacar versiones inferiores del mismo tipo de final)\n\nAdemas de la habitual pantalla de distribuci\u00f3n del tiempo para cada mes tambi\u00e9n tienes el control de la hija durante su d\u00eda a d\u00eda, que supone buena parte del ciclo de juego.

I can understand wanting to make sure the player doesn't do too much, but there's enough course options I think the chance to have more time there, like choosing the courses week by week then only getting the days with the daughter every month as it is currently, would improve the experience, allowing more of a chance to round out the daughter or to utterly focus on all the courses in their main area of expertise.", "timestamp_created": 1687051695, "timestamp_updated": 1687051695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140237863": {"recommendationid": "140237863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339335894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1689044537}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like Princess Maker, so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.

Best compliment I can give is the sheer effort on display - so many little bits and pieces that really show the devs poured their hearts into the project.\n\nIf I had a main criticism though, it's the English translation. I appreciate that the devs are based in Beijing and it doesn't seem like China has the best access to translators but it is really noticeably stiff at times, to the point I wonder if they just used an AI or something to run over the script. That being said though it is perfectly readable, just some awkward lines. The other text translations are Simplified Chinese and I think Japanese (sorry I'm quite bad at discerning other languages, steam only lists Chinese and English so might be wrong) and from what I understand those are way better.\n\nUltimately a game I'd highly recommend, really want to see more from the developers because the talent on display is staggering.", "timestamp_created": 1686174036, "timestamp_updated": 1686174036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139691580": {"recommendationid": "139691580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063533625", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1686150638}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece!", "timestamp_created": 1686150651, "timestamp_updated": 1686150651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139680834": {"recommendationid": "139680834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101156080", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1480, "last_played": 1687715698}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the BEST raising simulation games i have ever played!

No matter what you're doing, they have specific art for it. Cooking? small animation, each class subject has it's own art too. Without spoiling too much, every one of the numerous endings has their own CG and dialogue to truly show how she's faring.\n\nThe game play is nice and simple, you as a dad manage what classes your daughter takes, and what she does until she grows old enough and ascertains her own autonomy. When she gets there, you control her instead but the dialogue and stuff still talks about you being the dad and all. These activities give you stats which will be instrumental in helping get any ending\n\nWhen it comes to getting those aforementioned endings, volcano princess makes the trips to these endings much easier and you'll need it since you aren't accomplishing s**t on your first playthrough. It's not an insult, its a fact but eventually you'll get the good endings. \n\nNo game is without flaw, thankfully there aren't too many. The translation is still bad, but no where near as bad as before this last update. Now you can understand what every character is getting at when they're speaking rather than disjointed thoughts you have to scrape together.\n\nNow that i know what every character is actually saying, without spoiling anything once again, they're all mostly unique. I can't say i found any of them outright annoying, and each of the associated events are quite sweet, with even the edgier characters having nice wholesome moments (mostly).\n\nBeing able to skip dialogue with CTRL is a godsend after your first couple loops. If you want to see most of this game, one go around will be no-where near enough giving the game immense replayability.\n\nNow I know i'm a stranger, but i'm handing out unsolicited advice and you can't stop yourself from reading this review now anyway.\nIf you do decide to play this game, Go in as blind as possible. Don't worry too much about any of the stats, what ending you may get, or whatever. The wiki can and should wait. Just focus on being a parent first. Cherish that time as a parent watching her grow up and remain blissfully ignorant of the inevitable numbers game to get the cool endings. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1686084069, "timestamp_updated": 1686084069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139649292": {"recommendationid": "139649292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198956461470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1686509369}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game!!

It's pretty similar to the original princesses maker games with needed to upgrade your child's states until she turns the age of 18, but it is far more easier to play then what you can get from princess maker 2 that came out in 1993. Since in Volcano Princess it's basically impossible for your child to fail in life due to your child having FAR less needs or even wants, she dose what you tell her to do no matter what. The only way you could fail is if you SEEK out frailer which in my option makes the game a bit bland, I feel like the game would benefit if it was some how harder to keep her darkness level down and added more random events effected by her darkness level. So it can keep players on their toes while playing the game.\n\nI have more to say but this is more of what I WANT and WISH was in the game more then what SHOULD be in the game.\n---\nI due hope that in future updates the game will add more interactions with the characters, more \"bad\" ending depending on what you consider bad, more random events with all the characters based on states and relationship level, more job options, and more dialogue from your child when she speaks to you \n---\nThe game is really well made and I'm willing to play 100% of it though, but I do believe their can be MORE added to it.

So glad i did! So much love and passion has been put into this hidden gem. 19 hours of gameplay in 2 days hehe.\n\nThe gameplay: Is very simple yet still has depth to it with management. Interacting with other people in the world and befriending them by talking, gifting and going on friendly dates with them. Each character has there own story and are fleshed out very well. There are horse riding events to do, Theatre, Bathhouse and a dice mini game. There is a dungeon/adventure part of the game that involves combat which has a bit of strategy involved to survive and get the best rewards/fame. There is kind of a NG+ feature once you complete it for the 1st time. So when starting a new game (fresh run) you can boost some of your stats for that run.\n\nThe Graphics: The artstyle is very beautiful and well coloured. Lots of CG's to unlock and view (Once you complete the game once) Not many animated scenes but not really necessary imo. \n\nVerdict: This game was quite amazing. Nice slice of life sim that will put a smile on your face. 19 hours for my 1st playthrough and looking forward to starting another for more achievements.

It's one of the best of the genre I've played so far! I wouldn't say that it does anything particularly special, but it just does everything right. Sometimes getting all the basics of the game smooth and polished all you need to make a fantastic game.\nThe game loop is a fair length, about 7 hours per run (and longer for your first go of course), but it's somehow not tedious. I've only played it through about 6 times and I haven't even discovered everything that the game has to offer yet. I personally don't really like the minigames, but it doesn't take away from the main mechanics of the game. The stat system sits somewhere between unforgivably challenging and easy, which is part of why it didn't feel tedious.\nThere are quite a few characters, and they are lovely to talk with. Even with the idle chatter, they don't repeat dialogue, which is honestly incredible. Amazing job by the game's writers! Each character is also really unique, well developed, and ties beautifully within Volcano. It's selfish of me but I do wish there were more special romance scenes per character, because there are only three per character, and I want to know more about them! I was surprised on two counts, firstly that you could 'romance' pretty much every character, and secondly that there were even polyamory options. I haven't tried the poly options yet, but man it's nice to see they're there!\nArt was flawless, your daughter always looks adorable no matter which outfit you pick! There are so many beautifully drawn little scenes in the game too, it really was a feast for the eyes.\nA definitely must play if you're a fan of the genre, it's just done too well to miss out on it! The price is more than fair if you're really going to go collect all the endings, which definitely will take you a hundred hours or more.

But, unlike normal Chinese parenting which is about trapping your child in a pain box and forcing the to learn the piano by the age of four, this is more of a visual novel where you raise your virtual daughter in arguably the most easy simulation game I have ever seen.\n\nSo, let's start with the good and the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n1. It's super cute. Like insanely cute. The NPCs are all charming enough and the writing makes you want to say \"awwhhhh\" while force feeding your dog taco bell. I mean, it's so absurdly adorable that it almost makes me feel sick in some kinda strange gut feel.\n\n2. There is like a million different endings and all of them are pretty entertaining.\n\n3. It has enough variety in day to day activities to not get boring.\n\nThe Bad:\n1. It's far too easy. Like, absurdly easy. You will power max each stat with ease on your first play. It'a almost impressive how much hand holding the game has with action point recovery which is the resource used for the limited actions you have in each day in game.\n\n2. The Combat system is really dumb. I mean, once again, it's easy, but it's very boring. \n\n3. Translation. There is various little translation errors and while I don't blame Chinese dev's for having these issues, there is a few times in game where you will just be baffled by the translation job and it's meager attempts to keep everything inline. \n\n4. The devs I believe have been trying to figure out the steam cloud save options for like six months now and are still trying to battle it, which, while funny, seems kind of odd. \n\nSo, is Volcano Princess good?

Some games in this genre offer little to no guidance, so Volcano Princess does that remarkably well. Also, there is a legitimate plot and story arc going on here that is meatier than the generalities of lore you might see in Princess Maker 2.  I really love that. \n\nThe content, visuals, and gameplay loop are all here, frankly. But with the amount of content and character dialogue there is for building relationships, and other scenes that revolve around it, language is a lot more important to the enjoyment of the game.  And with the jarring translation and localisation choices peppered throughout in dialogue, menus, and tips, it really lets the game down and affects my enjoyment of it.\n\nI understand the game has likely been made by a small team, and may not have had much in the way of resource to dedicate to English translation and localisation.

The art, and the Princess, are adorable.  If you are familiar with stat raising games , then this game won't take long to figure out.  However, there are also clear notes to help those less familiar with the \"how much neat stuff can you cram into one turn\" type of game.  I give Volcano Princess high marks for letting you choose how to raise your daughter; also, the fact that you have to consider \"how did I do sticking to my goals as a parent\" is interesting.\nOverall:  Very impressed with the story, the art, and the cute little girl.

The game focused more on grinding and very much strategy-based, and the strategy part also differs in terms of what goal/ending you are working to get by the end of it.\n\nSome of the issues that is a bit off-putting for me is just the translation in terms of the characters' name and the dialogues. As someone who doesn't speak English as their first language, it is understandable, however I do hope this will be improved in the future. However, some of the inconsistent spacing between words in the English version is jarring which often happens when you translate the writings into this language, but I'm sure this will be fixed in future updates. The energy bar is small and a bit limited since certain actions can cost you around 5-8 points, which means it is depleted quite fast unless you've prepared beforehand, but that adds to the challenging nature of this game which can be a selling point to other players. Some of the mini-games' instructions are a little unclear which are partly due to the translation issue, and partly due to myself for not connecting the dots. There are some bugs that you might accidentally find, but from my experience after encountering one and submitting a report, the developers are proactive in solving them although it might take some time.\n\nAs this is my first time playing a game within this genre, I'm not able to provide an in-depth comment on the plot except that I did enjoy the story line. The art style is cute. I love that you have a lot of options when it comes to love interests and even other relationships, who each have an interesting story to tell. I like that I can restart the day if I messed up on certain activities, which is very forgiving of the game. As another person commented, despite being the father, it does feel like the story doesn't push the daughter to the side and give her the autonomy in most of the actions performed in the game as the story revolves around her life. The playthroughs that come after you've completed the first one feel easier once you familiarized yourself with it.\n\nOverall, would I recommend it? Yes, if you can overlook the problems I mentioned and allow the developers some time to solve it.

Each little activity has a small learning curve before you can figure out how to maximize your success: admittedly none of the activities seem very well balanced or super polished, so once you figure out the optimal strategy there is not much to think about within the activity itself. You really have tons of freedom though with which parts of the game to engage with and come up with a palette of activities you want to focus on. The main choice is always where you want to spend your time, and it really just feels like a bonus that each system is deep enough to be somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it seems like there were some systems which got cut, and some items which don't really have a use... a shame that it could have been even better. \n\nBased on the positive reviews I expected the life sim gameplay to be good, but what surprised me was the strength of the story and characters. It's not a masterpiece, but there is definitely some intrigue and emotional weight to the events of the \nstory as the years progress.

I was pleasantly surprised at just how much content is in this game for the price!! The art style, all the endings and achievements possible, the backstories and all the mini-games make this an absolute steal.\n\nIn the beginning there were a few bugs that were frustrating however I expected such as a brand new game and the developers have been releasing updates in a very timely manner. Some of the translations are a little off as you can tell it wasn't English based but nothing I can't understand or look over.\n\nI'll be sad when I've completed all the achievements and have no reason to play anymore.. looking forward to future games like this if they come out with any more!!", "timestamp_created": 1683899458, "timestamp_updated": 1683899458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138179819": {"recommendationid": "138179819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198938084959", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3405, "last_played": 1695811374}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A kingdom for my Rose[/h1]\n\nLet us get this right out of the way at the start: Volcano Princess is a brilliant game and everyone who has even a small interest in the game after watching the trailer or reading the synopsis should definitely buy it. The price is completely fair for the amount of content you get.\n\nNow to put into words why this game is so good.\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nThis game is drop dead gorgeous for its niche. The artstyle is reminiscent of Chinese web comics first and foremost and really good ones at that. There are an unusual amount of CGs in this game. From ending professions and romance options, to story scenes or even minor interactions, the art is everywhere. A lot of raising sims mostly rely on text or numbers, but Volcano Princess goes the extra mile to visualize almost everything. \nEven the inventory items and monster designs are all lovingly made with details that immerse you even more. Every location is very distinct and even one off events like tournaments get special screens.\n\nThe only area where the game is slightly hindered is when it comes to animations. They are generally a bit clunky or unexpressive, but that too has its charme. These usually only happen during activities and are more like small gifs. Generally the art is static.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\nThe basic gameplay loop is simple. You are tasked with raising your daughter by advising her and deciding what she will study at the academy. Unlike a lot of raisintg sims however, you spent a considerable amount of time every day from the daughter's point of view and make those decisions through her. So it is not that the father molds his daughter like a puppet, but rather that the player takes both the role of the father and the daughter.\n\nAs expected from this genre, most of your focus will be on raising stats or gaining favor with people. Gathering items, receiving gits and better lectures are all means to getting one of the over 50 professions the game has to offer, alongside figuring out your potential marriage partner(s). The game offers an unprecedented amount of choices and variables for this and if you don't want to work at all or if you dislike romance you can even avoid both of those things altogether.\n\nWhat stands out most is just the sheer variety of activities the game offers. I spent my entire first playthrough completely ignoring the horse catching/raising game and never participated in races. But those are fully fleshed out mechanics that you can focus an entire playthrough around to get fame and money. You can go explore dungeons with friends, you can go to banquets and get acqauinted with nobles, you can study all day, you can go fishing, you can do alchemy, duel other characters in battle or debates, work as an actress or in a bathouse... and so so so much more.\n\nYour academic/knight tasks depend mostly on what house you picked when you enrolled and who your Lord/Lady is. You can pick one of three and the head of each faction is only available for interaction when you pick theirs, so certain romance options or quests are only available depending on the current faction.\n\nThe daily loop I think most will go through is this: Father/daughter interactions --> farming at the field to get items --> raising your stats and interacting with characters and activities --> decide on that month's curriculum at the academy.\nThe game has around 40 turns (which each represent one month) and once your daughter is 18 years old and becomes and adult the game ends.\n\n[b][u]Romance[/u][/b]\nThe game features a large and lovable cast of characters. Not all of them are love interests, but the majority are. Your daughter (whose default name is Rose, so I will call her that usually) is bisexual and can marry both men and women. The choices are exceptionally varied. You can let Rose romance her classmates, her Lords/Ladies, royalty, the inn keeper, a nun, artists, a lone wolf mercenary and many more.\nThe method to get those romance endings is basically to hang out with the characters you like and get their affection to the right level and see their events. Some endings or paths will lead to not having certain options available, but do not be discouraged, that love can bloom in another playthrough.\n\nThis game really has a endearing cast in general, but I think some of my favorite characters are princess Gwyneth, her brother Kenneth (you can get a polyamorous ending with both of them as your lovers btw), the best friend Nina and the author Lon.\nWhether you prefer straight romance, lesbian romance or something inbetween, the game has it all and is not judgemental in any way. Two women can marry without issue and are just as valid as any other option. The age gap between Rose and some of these characters is rather large admittedly, but that's the great thing, you don't have to do anything you dislike.\n\nI generally prefer yuri/sapphic romance, so I was quite pleased with the plentiful of female love interests, but the game presents all its characters so charmingly that I didn't mind getting Rose close to the boys as well. Due to the nature of the game encouraging replays it is fine to experiment more in my opinion.\n\nMy only gripe right now is that one romance partner is very questionable... for story related reasons. And yes there is a story!\n\n[b][u]Story[/u][/b]\nWhile the overall goal is simply for the daughter to grow into a great adult, there is a lot more going on with the Volcano Kingdom. It has a lot of well integrated lore that you uncover slowly as time goes on. The game has a delightful amount of sublety as well. Many character relations and connections are not spelled out to the player, but can be discovered instead. \n\nThe game sports a \"True Ending\", which is not mutually exclusive from any other ending choice though! You can still get any job or any love interest (barring one) if you get the True Ending. It reveals a lot of plot points that were only hinted at across the game and can be quite challenging to achieve. I doubt many players will get it on their first playthrough. Right now a few things about the plot are still rather vague or confusing to me, but I have also not done everything the game has to offer yet!\n\n[b][u]Other points[/u][/b]\nThe English translation can be a bit lacking in certain parts of the game. The overall translation effort is good and most of it is understandable. The quality differences between certain events or descriptions are very noticable however. The devs are updating the game a lot and have already improved a lot of things, including the translation, so my hope is that eventually the quality will be on the same level everywhere.\n\nYou can pick between Chinese or Japanese voice options, but the only character who is really voiced is the daughter. I personally prefered the Japanese performance, but this is very subjective. Either way the voice work is very good. And it's not like all her lines are voiced, it is only specific scenes. Otherwise every character has distinctive noises they make.\n\nThe game's save system is a bit limited. You can only save at the start of a month/the turn, meaning that if you reload the game you start from the beginning of the day. This means if you wish to quickly redo a choice or activity you will have to go through the entire day again. This probably is meant to disincentivize save scumming and make you stick with decisions, but it is not very fun for me personally.\n\nThe game has exploits, but if you are looking for them then that's probably your prefered playstyle.

Both of these facts will be obvious from within a few seconds of starting the game. It's proudly inspired by PM and borrows mechanics and ideas liberally, but generally does so with updates and reimaginings that make it much more than a shallow copy. Alas, being obviously from a Chinese studio is down to the English text being absolutely riddled with errors typical of translation from Chinese. It's by no means the worst example I've ever seen, and you're not going to get anything as bad as older translation gems like Zero Wing, but you do need to be prepared for a lot of strange turns of phrase and a smaller amount of unclear or incorrect descriptions. If you played Chinese Parents around when it first launched in English, the translation quality is similar.\n\nStill, assuming you can get past that, nearly everything else about the game is very well done. Like the good Princess Maker titles, it reduces raising a kid to scheduling a whole bunch of classes and jobs over their childhood, then gives you some scenes at the end about how you've either raised an absolute monster or the hero of the world. Also like some PM games, there are multiple combat systems for the daughter to go and kill monsters with, as well as a couple of other minigames like horse racing or playing dice. None of it is very deep or necessarily balanced, but there's so much of it that you can easily go through a few playthroughs without repeating very much of the side content. \n\nSpeaking of multiple playthroughs, VP very much expects you to play it more than once. You're not practically guaranteed to be a failure on your first run like in Chinese Parents, but the best endings seem clearly out of reach until you've upgraded your starting character a few times. Each finished run gives you some points depending on what you did, and those points provide you with better starting stats or items so you can get to those better endings. As a bonus, this also lets you quickly blow past the early game content that you've already seen. \n\nI've also seen this compared to Long Live the Queen a few times, but I think you'll be disappointed if that game is primarily what you're after. LLtQ is mostly about trying to navigate a world full of absurd deathtraps trying to stop your game early. I don't think it's possible to die at all in VP, and the focus is much more on the daughter's relationships with the player character and NPCs than on running any kingdoms. Similarly, if you want something like Cute Knight, know that the combat and dungeons here are much more basic. \n\nI generally prefer these games when they're like Cute Knight or Growing Up and cast you as the main character instead of a parent since it's a bit less creepy, but I will say that Volcano Princess is much better in that regard than Princess Maker. VP goes out of its way to show that the daughter has agency and her own concerns, and what she thinks of you is it's own objective and part of the ending. It hasn't changed my opinion that I'd rather play as the kid directly, but VP is probably the best alternative I've seen so far.\n\n--------\nFor more reviews, see [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43219041]my curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1683888769, "timestamp_updated": 1683901415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138162897": {"recommendationid": "138162897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035544537", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1724, "last_played": 1700525337}, "language": "english", "review": "I only tend to write reviews when a game really disappoints me, or really astounds me with how good it ends up being.  Volcano Princess was the second.  I bought this game with absolutely no expectations, simply off the 'game style' which seemed rather generic on the surface, and the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  The reason it is so highly rated was quickly apparently.  The depths of the game has had me playing it religiously for the past three days.  I beat it once, then immediately started a second play-through and beat it again within those three days.\n\nIf I could complain about anything (and lets face it, I always can), it's either the translation or lack of certain things being finished.  I don't want to give spoilers but some things are so vague it's apparent that there is some sort of language mishap going on, or it's a feature not fully implemented.  29 hours played, been through it twice, nowhere near done everything in the game (though I can see how after a couple times through certain aspects could become repetitive).\n\nUnlike most of these style games, the choices really do matter.  A lot.  But they matter so much that they don't matter for completing the game.  There's so many endings and choices, and you don't have to be a big hero.  First time I just ended up as a great music composer.    I haven't even touched alchemy, horse riding, stealing, or several other aspects of the game because there's so much to do that I don't think you can manage to do everything to any degree of proficiency in just one go.\n\nThis is a game that I really hope gets even more added to it, because it's already robust enough to warrant multiple plays.", "timestamp_created": 1683852444, "timestamp_updated": 1683852444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138160948": {"recommendationid": "138160948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043292983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 709, "last_played": 1683788250}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved princess maker 2 growing up AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF GAME IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR!\nno need to spend ANY real money so thats a plus as well. you get to dictate every aspect of the childs life while playing the game. you're free to roam town once a month and do whatever and talk to whoever you want. i also find it easier to have them go to school and actually do good compared to other princess maker games which get very complicated. i finished my first character in about 8 hrs.

Gorgeous Art, varied dialogue and options, interesting characters with backgrounds to discover and many, many endings to shoot for. \n\nIt also serves as a great introduction to the genre by slowly enabling options through the first playthrough, and through subsequent playthroughs these mechanics can be skipped past extremely quickly. \n\nThe game incentivizes repeat playthroughs through it's copious amounts of achievements serving an actual purpose. Achieve something, and you get points to spend towards your next attempt. Giving you that incentive to try something new and experiment with the options available to you. \n\nUnlike other games in this genre, the Father figure is not a completely devoid character detached from the experience. You have goals made for yourself as well. Which takes some effort to figure out how your choices relate to the overall goal. \n\nThere is a story to this with some wonderful foreshadowing in various ways for those willing to pay attention. \n\nEdit: The game does have an appropriate ending, it just took a fourth play-through to get to. That addresses the questions I had as far as the plot was concerned. So I figured I'd edit my review to account for that. \n\nIf I would want to nitpick things:\n\nThere are some grammatical and spelling mistakes in the English version, which are being worked on. Some characters are called by the wrong name, feature name changes depending on menu, and other shenanigans happening, leading to some confusion on who they are. Some character names in particular make little sense in English. Rebsa/Lebsa, one of the Knight Lords being one such example. \n\nI would like to see what choices related to choosing Blood Type and what it actually impacts, since that's not something native to my Country. So I have no idea what my choices mean, if anything at all. With how useless Google Search has become: finding useful and relevant information is such a huge pain, it's almost not worth it. Even for recreational stuff. I just want to be able to make a more informed choice here. \n\nSo whether you are a fan of this genre of game, or someone whose interested in giving this type of game a shot. I can highly recommend Volcano Princess for being a great way to get introduced to this style of game and a fantastic take for those familiar with the style. \n\nWith how Achievements feature as a means to improve your starting stats and abilities: it's a fantastic way to get some replay value. As each subsequent playthrough can unlock more potential endings and making the initial setup shorter and shorter each time.

This is a multiple playthrough game with carryover benefits between runs and that is important to know. My first run through I was surprised how easily and massively I failed at everything, by late game I was starting to develop stats/skills and enjoyed it more but the second playthrough was definitely the more fun one. I'm on my third playthrough now and there are a load of endings you can shoot for but you can definitely max out the second playthrough if you want. \n\nThe game had a lot of broken text early-on and I can't tell if it has been mostly patched out or if I just don't notice it as much but it isn't a big deal. \n\nWhile there's not any really satisfying romance options, if you like visual novels I imagine that this will be up your alley. I personally just love stat maxing and roguelites so I found a lot of enjoyment. It feels a bit like Persona 5 with far less combat and less relatable characters. \n\nA fairly large flaw in the game is that it clearly wasn't finished, several items have no purpose other than sale and according to the community page there was a more in-depth magic/alchemy system in the works. So unfortunately all those cool artifacts and magic ingredients you get are just pointless entirely. I am hopeful they will patch this in future. \n\nOverall I recommend this game and continue to get my money's worth out of it.

I can say confidently that I enjoyed this game thoroughly. It was addicting and highly replayable and had bonuses in case you finished a playthrough that can make your next new game easier which was a nice touch for those who want to complete the game 'easier'.\n\nThe story/plot was also very interesting, I won't spoil it here though, also the setting was also nice. It had a nice amount of gameplay aside from lessons, in fact, I'd say the rest day is where you'll be spending a good amount of time aside from the lessons to increase your daughter's stats.\n\nIt also has a lot of characters that you can befriend, duel, date and of course, marry. All of them I found to be very interesting and likable (yes all), and I enjoyed being able to marry them and still have a career at the same time. Also, this game is great for having poly marriage ends for some candidates. Never saw that in a SIM game and I applaud them for doing so.\n\nNow for the Cons of this game. The translations are not that great. They are readable but you can tell it's not polished but it shouldn't ruin the game for you.\n\nAlso, it has too few save files, for a stat-raising game it should have more than 8-10 save files in case we need to backtrack...\n\nOverall, if you loved princess maker, you will also love this game, it's fun, engaging, and has a lot of replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1683330416, "timestamp_updated": 1683330416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814032495021820068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137846782": {"recommendationid": "137846782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800016993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1684115312}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cutesy!

I do discuss this in the review, and while I still personally like the game- it has a MASSIVE * on it for this. This game is incredibly disrespectful to the daughter. There is a lot of borderline harassment in the form of \"love letters\". If you were abused growing up; as much as this game is actually fairly fun either avoid reading said letters or avoid the game all together. Fair warning.\n\nThere is a very niche collection of game titles starting with the Princess Maker series. They are like a combination of an incremental game and a roguelike, though they predate both concepts. The genre is a subset of a life sim I call a \"raising simulator\". Volcano Princess does its best to recreate this niche but well defined genre in a way which has both positives and negatives. \n\nDuring this review, I will be comparing this game to others in the genre; for comparison's sake I have played the following games in this genre. Princess Maker 2, Ciel Fledge and Growing Up. I will be referring to each of these titles throughout the review; but I assume that this applies to other games in the genre too. \n\nFirst the good; Volcano Princess does a fantastic job at creating an accessible life sim; capturing the appeal of the original Princess Maker rather well. It contains all the same hallmarks and more; you schedule your child's day, explore the town, dungeon dive and more! Unlike Ciel Fledge, the game doesn't punish you for wanting to explore, and instead does a good job at encouraging it. Every day you are wasting time and resources if you don't first explore the town, talk to people and do your best to participate in one of the many side activities you slowly unlock as your daughter ages. It has a solid and refined Visual Novel element, with many ways you can interact with each person, even if it does seem a little too checklisty at times. Of particular note is both the dungeon crawling and cooking systems; which play off eachother well to provide an alternative method of levelling your stats. \n\nMost of your primary stat gains occur not during your scheduled timeslots, but during the exploration element. You must make choices using your stamina on if you refine skills or participate in activities; though the game is not very restrictive in this due to the aforementioned cooking system. Over time you gain ingredients which either buff your skills directly, or increase your action points allowing you to participate in more stat or money making activities. The schedule side focuses more on completing a series of \"classes\"- similar to the skills system in \"Growing Up\", but with the addition of various \"Extra Curriculars\" that provide additional abilities and even buffs to your character. Speaking of buffs, beyond those unlocked through normal play, Volcano Princess includes multiple other forms of progression. Combat Levelling for you (and any companions you befriend high enough to battle with you in one of four selected dungeons),  Skills, which unlock with skill points over time and unlock other additional gamechanging modifiers to double or improve rewards in places you would like, mind body and charisma tokens (gained when completing courses, make activities better and unlock new content), guild achievements, regular achievements and more. Honestly I am absolutely impressed by the wide range of progression options throughout this game. I haven't even mentioned all of them, as every single activity levels up, new places unlock- there is a whole horse breeding minigame which is both easy and rewarding... Gawd. The game is both too long and too short at the same time to be honest. \n\nUnlike something like Ciel Fledge which lasts for an entire ten year spread; Volcano Princess has several time skips which lead to you feeling rather cheated as you seem to feel like part of your daughter's childhood was stolen away from them. What's worse is that while the art for your daughter does mildly change over time, the spritework keeps her looking like a tiny baby throughout the entire game. What's worse is, all of her various love interests can be met when she is very young, and unlike the aforementioned Ciel Fledge, they do NOT age over time with you, instead already seem like young adults right from when your daughter is 10. Not only does it seem really strange that your daughter can randomly date a bunch of people who are much MUCH older than her; the number of creepy and disturbing letters she gets throughout is... disgusting. \n\nThese letters are to the point where, despite liking the gameplay very much, I stopped paying any attention to the dialogue outside of important events. Everyone will hit on your daughter even from age 10, she gets loads of creepy letters from guys saying how they would die for her- and there isn't even any way to say to eff off. No, you get to say thank you, and get a mood boost from reading a wall of disgusting messages. This would honestly be a massive red flag and even a total dealbreaker if I was unlucky enough to had been involved in this sort of stuff while growing up. Instead I just chalked it up to a cultural difference I don't understand. While this game isn't as abusive in its narrative as Ciel Fledge can be, it is still a big downer that I hope can be improved with further localisation. You are allowed to be a good dad, but due to the way the game arbitrarily decides the meaning of \"gentle\" and \"kind\"- it can be VERY hard to get a top dad score your first playthrough... and anything to do with bravery and such is much easier to nail down than gentle and kind, at least in my experience. \n\nIn more \"stuff that bothers me likely caused by a cultural difference more than anything\"- the religious overtones in this game are far far too much. Everything in this place is belief, religion and nothing aside. Even the so called \"science\" pathway is just a \"faith\" pathway. While this isn't a problem in of itself, it does end up being very much on the nose. You have no choice but to either follow the religion entirely- or get too much \"darkness\". What does \"darkness\" do you may ask? Literally nothing but lock you out from some of the best endings unless you repent or entirely avoid anything the game deems as dark. I can understand some jobs in a bathhouse may involve too much skin for a small child sure, but you also get darkness from acting, fighting crimes, stating any kind of opposition to authority. Thankfully, most of the worst options the dad can say also bequeaths the penalty too, which is positive. But I didn't like how central the religious themes were. It really gave me the sense that this society really wasn't going to progress at all, and the world that my child was in would continue to be horrible regardless of her options. The temple is one of the most important places in the game, due in part to the darkness mechanic, but also due to it being the home to the only way to trade fame into free course completion. Given the limited time of the game, this is annoyingly unavoidable. \n\nAnyway, back to the good to finish off. The game is fun, open, and not overly difficult. While I still prefer Growing Up (due to the length, freedom, music and more contemporary setting), I do think Volcano Princess is worth a look if you like these sort of games and don't feel as bothered by the- troubling elements. I hope that given its positive reception, we start to see some patches for the game to improve the localisation to remove these issues; and flesh out the game more (even through DLC, I'd pay for more if it offered enough incentive).\n", "timestamp_created": 1683269304, "timestamp_updated": 1683269304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137814918": {"recommendationid": "137814918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044053661", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1683511801}, "language": "english", "review": "I was skeptical for playing the princess simulator game. \nAfter give it a tried, the game deliver much more than that.

\n-Skill tree of sorts\n-Hella options on who you can romance/marry including characters that lean more towards NPC vs buddy characters \n-romance girls too\n-romance ending with more than just 1 character/poly-romance ending\n-gems or whatever you earn base on each playthrough score that you can use to increase base stats & relations with characters, + bonus features for better game enjoyment \n-archive with all the ending CGs give you clear-cut hints on how to achieve specific endings to make it easier for you\n-outfits have stats to help instead of being just cosmetic\n\nCons:\n-\"Skill tree\" but it's not too expansive (but also understandable)\n-Redundancy after your 1st playthrough but it's to be expected\n-can't skip long CG cuts\n-limited energy bar (can be overcome by stocking up on energy-boosting food but that only goes so far)\n\nGrand Takeaway:\nDefinitely a lot of replay value even if it does get a little redundant  \nI personally recommend saving before you end the game so you can go back to unlock other endings to the same playthrough to save yourself time \nEach time you finish a playthrough, the gems you get to upgrade your next playthrough makes it easier

But even so, this is a solid and beautifully presented dating sim. There's a huge quantity of art; there's substantial breadth of options for activities, love interests, and endings; it is not punishing, so it's easy to jump in and you won't totally screw up your first run if you don't come in armed with a spreadsheet; each playthrough takes a while but is not a laboriously long slog; I especially appreciate that it has a New Game+ feature, so every playthrough can assist you with your next one, if you choose to take advantage of that feature.\n\nYou should know that gameplay is very, VERY heavily RNG-based, and you can only save at the end of a turn (one month). This makes it very difficult to pre-plan your runs in detail; instead, it encourages you instead to have a flexible, broader-picture strategy and roll with the punches. There's pros and cons to this. I find it a bit aggravating, but typically, if RNG throws off your plan you'll have time to recover.\n\nBecause this is a small indie game, the breadth of options available does mean that they tend to be a bit shallow. I wish love interests and career paths had a bit more depth and distinction from one another, but this is only a small complaint.\n\nThe English translation is variable; it appears they have a fluent translator for some sections while others are not fluently translated. Unfortunately, the introduction to the game is one of the poorly translated sections, giving a first impression of a slapdash job. But, over the 1.5 weeks it's been out, the devs have been really involved not just fixing bugs but improving the translation.

The game is a bit off beat in that it's translations can be rough sometimes, but it shouldn't bother anyone who isn't a stickler or struggles to read English. Sometimes I'd pause and get mentally stuck cause I'm a bit of a literalist, but then I'd laugh at myself about it. The mechanics are great and fun, and I feel there is a lot of replayability due to the impact of RNG on the game. It's not too hard, and there is a 1-3 run learning curve if you're an optimizer like myself, but there is room for creative approaches. After you beat the game once you can add legacy traits/boosts which significantly help the freedom of choice for how to direct your princess' lifestyle and choices/interests. The storyline is really cute and enjoyable and I think there are some secrets to be found there depending on what ending you get or what you focus on and there is definitely enough content to explore. \n\nThe only negatives I have is that some parts of the mini games are not skippable, but honestly it's not that big of a deal. \n\nThe voice acting isn't in english but it seems pretty good for someone who doesn't speak those languages. \n\nThe support team has continued to work on and fix bugs they find which is a good sign.

The Youtube series where I take a look at games i think seem cool & give my thoughts on them in less than 10 mins.\n\nToday I will be taking a look at Volcano Princess. Volcano Princess is a life sim RPG adventure game about raising the next monarch, your daughter. Help shape her youth for her to grow into an outstanding adult to rule over the Volcano Kingdom as a single father, will you be enough to help make your little girl great? Let's find out! \n\n//Graphics, Sound & Artstyle//\n\nI just have to say straight up, I'm not a fan of anime. I've watched Death Note & that's about it- however this artstyle has me in awe. Have I been depraving myself of content? The menu music accompanies it nicely & it feels all very regal. I have the voice set to Chinese, and sometimes the Princess voice can be annoying but it's such a minor detail, I don't mind it.\n\n\n//Gameplay//\n\nBeing a choose your own adventure simulator RPG it sort of feels like it's a visual novel of sorts but with a deep stats based mechanic. You will have to guide your daughter from a young age to help navigate the world, as she gets older more spots are available to visit. Here she can do tasks according to however many action points she has. Things like reading from her bookcase can help her raise her intelligence, listening to stories can help her develop her emotion, trips down a river can help build her strength etc etc. All of those stats help her with the courses she will be taking when trying to become a knight, at the end of each day you will help her plan courses so that she can finish courses- leveling up her Strength, Intelligence, Emotion, & Image will make the courses finish much faster and unlock more. \n\nThere are other factors such as darkness, patience, fame & admirers that will influence the life of your daughter and three main attributes that will affect everything like Strength (that will determine your ability in battle), Mind (affecting ability in debates), Charisma (affecting ability in dances & part time jobs). It sounds incredibly complicated but honestly once you start getting the hang of things, its like a satisfying game full of strategy. \n\nI don't want to spoil much as advertised a play-through should be approximately around 8 hours. Part of the charm of this game is learning new mechanics and how everything effects everything. As deep as who you make friendships with to what jobs you choose to complete as the father- everything and with 18 love interests (7 female, 11 male) there is a lite dating game also to unravel within this, as well as a lite JRPG dungeon.\n\n\n//Price//\n\n10.99 USD\n\n\n//How many hours estimated//\n\nAs previously aforementioned each play-through is approximately 8 hours. But with 50+ endings as well. I can't really estimate, however I can say that I will be playing through the game a few times (granted I feel like I'm doing really awesome and might get a great ending),\n\n//Is it playable on SteamDeck?//\n\nYes it is absolutely playable on SteamDeck and I almost prefer to play it handheld because I can just lay in bed and be the best dad I can be.\n\n\n//Final Thoughts//\n\nVolcano Princess is a DEEP game. There's so much to do that it's almost intimidating. You can be an actress in plays, you can catch horses, plant, romance 18 different people, shoot dice with the villagers, engage in illegal horse races, explore a dark alley, fight in dungeons, have a stable- I mean with so much to do, with so many different ways to playing the game, you can lead your daughter to be a saint, someone to be revered or a complete an utter fascist.... but I find myself caring more and more for this little girl & wanting to make the protagonists late wife proud of the little girl I'm raising. \n\nIt's certainly an experience that many people should get to, well- experience. It's cute, witty & more importantly tons of fun. As soon as I saw this game, I knew I had to play it. It reminded me of one of my all time favorite games, Chinese Parents. And it plays a lot like it too but set in a magical world. I find myself wanting more content like Volcano Princess, so I'm gonna be looking into visual novels, and games of this genre. It's certainly left an impression on me, however there are some bad remarks.\n\nTranslations aren't the best, sometimes there are obvious misspellings and it isn't the end of the world but seeing the words like that irks me just a bit. Only some of the dialogue is voice acted, and other text you can hear either grunts or sighs- and at first I thought I didn't mind it, but i found myself muting the voice and just letting the music play. A guide or \"study book\" should be a thing, because i still don't know what impressions are for and it was only after a few months that i found using up my allotted patience would help me build more skills faster. Some words are lost in translation and while the devs are updating the game regularly, I tend to be cautious as when I started playing I had a game breaking bug that prevented me from advancing, when that was fixed another bug appeared that could potentially delete all my save data. It's the main reason I took so long with this review. \n\nDespite all that fuss though, I really enjoy the game. Volcano Princess really amazed me, and whether naming the princess after my IRL daughter made me care for her even more- I just find myself wanting to be the best that I can be for that little girl. I don't know what I was expecting with Volcano Princess other than similar mechanics as Chinese Parents but it is rapidly becoming one of my all time favorite games. Would I recommend it?

good considering the 2-person studio, but some bits either aren't well explained, badly translated, or both, so you might have to figure things out for yourself.\n\nLove interests for your daughter (which include basically everyone she can talk to) are almost all 5+ years older than her, so might be a bit weird if you think about it, but they all have their charms.\n\nPlot's not the greatest -

This has less to do with the diversity of options, and more to do with the depth of those options\n-The game is so good at guiding you that there isn't really a lot of secret things for you to discover. Unless you're aiming for endings/romance routes, one playthrough where you dip your toes into everything basically will be all you need to experience everything\n-NG+ makes it way too easy to get endings, but achieving any of the prestigious endings without them is pretty rough\n-The combat is pretty unbalanced. Your girl's 3-hit DoT skill and Ze's stunlocking are basically all you need to cheese everything. I just brought Kenneth to tank hits for those two, and healers are a wasted slot.\n-While not as bad as the infamous Steam translations for the PM games, it can be rough at time and makes understanding the plot a bit harder than it should be\n-The game pauses when you're tabbed out. There is nothing about this game that happens in real time other than being forced to watch animations in contests.  \n-You also cannot fast forward text in a text-heavy game that encourages replays. \n\nOverall the game was absolutely worth 10 bucks even if I only did one or two playthroughs (I did more. You're talking to someone who played through the behemoth that is PM5 in a week.) Also as someone who went \"I want to marry Gwynneth. Oh, a lot of her interactions involve her brother? Let's also raise his relationship too,\" I absolutely got blindsided with a wiffle bat achieving THAT romance ending.

Clearly inspired by the old Princess Maker games from Japan. If you enjoyed Long Live the Queen, Growing Up, or Chinese Parent Simulator chances are you will love this game too.\n\nFirst play-thru takes roughly ten hours and each subsequent play-thru is shorter because you don't need to read all the text (and you know what you're doing!)\n\nThe Good:\n* Dozens of Endings\n* Each time you beat the game you earn points to spend to give bonuses for the next play-thru\n* Many romance-able characters of both genders\n* Devs have been really communicative and are fixing bugs regularly\n\nThe Cons:\n* Repetitive Combat with a only few viable strategies and party make-ups\n* Currently no skip functions for dialog (etc...) to speed up repeat play-thrus\n\nNeutral:\n* Translation - this has been a huge complaint from players. If you've played a lot of indie Japanese and Chinese VNs then you'll be pretty happy with translation - it's much better than a lot of games out there, and for the most part you can always tell what's going on. If you're not used to playing these kind of games the translation is going to feel really bad.", "timestamp_created": 1682699567, "timestamp_updated": 1682699567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709183990955352783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137429883": {"recommendationid": "137429883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246176492", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1205, "last_played": 1682698759}, "language": "english", "review": "My Daughter has grown up,and became a honorable knight.\nShe will always be my pride and joy.\ni know Ze will take care of her in my stead.\nEnjoy life my child, your'e mother is always watching you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1682699502, "timestamp_updated": 1682699502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137427927": {"recommendationid": "137427927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021851088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1683091331}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable, I love our sapphic daughter. \n\nThe translation quality has been addressed, so I'm being optimistic.

There is a lot to love here and I have enjoyed my time with it so far but there's one big problem I have with this game that endlessly frustrates me. \n\n[b] Overview [/b]\n\nVolcano Princess is a raising simulator where you plan how your daughter spends their time which will consequently raise various stats. After a certain amount of turns, what stats you have will determine what ending you get i.e what profession your daughter pursues as an adult. \nIf you're already familiar with raising sims, Volcano Princess is very similar to Princess Maker 5, another game that I love but wouldn't recommend to people. VP takes the town and character interactions of PM5 and applies it to the month to month planning basis of Princess Maker 2 and Long Live the Queen. It also is much simpler than those other titles as you won't be juggling nearly as many stats. I personally prefer the more in depth stat building that PM5, PM2 and LLTQ offer, however this does mean that Volcano Princess would likely be more friendly to beginners.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n\nThe art is gorgeous and the presentation is generally very strong.\nThe combat is fun and doesn't feel like an afterthought (also Ze OP).\nI like the cast a lot. Kenneth is my favourite, he's cute. \nEven though there are less stats, I still got the \"number go up, brain happy\" feeling.\nThe inclusion of Hades-style level ups to increase your daughters stats for the next run is a genuinely very cool addition.\n[i] Some [/i] of the icky elements of Princess Maker have thankfully been left in the trash. Notably you can't romance your own daughter here and the CGs don't overtly sexualize her. I'm looking at you Princess Maker 2 and your vacation CGs.\nAlso your daughter can date girls!\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n\nLet's get the ones that everyone else has mentioned out of the way first: bugs and the English translation. Once again Volcano Princess is very similar to Princess Maker 5.\n\nFor the bugs, the auto-save does a lot of heavy lifting here to avoid too much frustration as you will likely come across a game breaking bug or two. Also speaking of saves, it's very annoying that you can't save in the middle of a turn.\nAs for the English translation, yes it is very clunky. I feel similarly about VP's translation as I do about PM5's: very clearly grammatically incorrect however, as it's not broken enough impede on my ability to enjoy the characters, so I'm willing to let it slide. The only place where unfortunately it did negatively impact my enjoyment of the story is [spoiler] the ending where you beat up Owl Princess, Lebsa and Asbel [/spoiler] In summary, on a moment to moment basis, the English translation didn't bother me but it did get in the way of me feeling the full impact of the big story beats.\n\nOk so now for the big thing that's been killing the game for me: [i] why are half of the love interests so much older than the daughter? [/i]\n\nWith the exception of Craig and Nina the other love interests are either in their late teens at the start and adults by the end or well into their adult years. Like Hackett, my man, I love you but stop flirting with my 12 year old daughter, you're 19. \nIt sits really badly with me and as a result I feel painfully aware of how much older these characters are then my daughter everytime I interact with them. And because the stat building is so bare compared to Princess Maker, most of the gameplay for me has been in interacting with the cast therefore making the problem feel even worse. \nLike, the daughter dating in PM is [i] bad [/i] and I hate it but at least if I wasn't actively pursuing it I could ignore it very easily. It feels worse when you consider that PM5 has a gross romancable adult  - the idol manager guy - but once again it was easily ignorable if I didn't pursue it. Here I can't bring myself to do that. It's especially frustrating because, like I've said already, game gets rid of other icky parts of PM like the daughter dating and yet why does it doubles down on this one?\nAlso as a side note, the characters who are of the same or close age to the daughter are very clearly not designed with being 13 in mind. If the game told me that Benson, Hackett, Mona, Rebecca and Gwyneth were only a year older or the same age as the daughter I would be totally willing to suspend my disbelief like I'm already doing for Craig. You cannot convince me that that design is for a boy any younger than 17 but again, I can suspend my disbelief. Or hell, if the game didn't tell me their ages at all I probably would've been fine with it.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nWhile I have been comparing Volcano Princess to Princess Maker 5 for most of this review, really my experience with it has felt closer to Little Witch Romanesque. While Volcano Princess is not nearly as bad as Little Witch - which I did one run of and immediately dropped - the gross parts are still too overt and unavoidable to me to properly find enjoyment in the good game and beautiful art underneath.

The 'Princess Maker' series aside, I enjoyed 'Long live the Queen', 'Chinese Parents',  and 'Cute Bite'. 'Volcano Princess' has similarities to these, but also includes a more 'fleshed out' world than I typically see, lots of mini-games (which range from 'that's cute' to 'thanks I hate it') MANY characters and an interesting plot. As is usual for the genre how you raise your daughter, which classes she takes, what activities she does, who she befriends and what attributes she levels up, will determine what possible endings are offered to her when she hits 18.\n\nThere game at release had many bugs, and one or two more were added when the old bugs were fixed. The dev team seems to be working REALLY hard to fix bugs as fast as possible, and have been responsive to community feedback, so I'm confident these issues will be fixed very quickly. \n\nThe English translation has some typos and can be a little hit and miss. Having done translation work myself, I recognise it's more an art than a science.

Volcano Princess goes WAY beyond that, non only mechanics and graphics wise, but the whole feelings it's making me experience. It makes you feel deeply attached to its characters and NPCs, makes your curious about the lore and really engaged to its universe. It's a really good game with a overwhelming experience. \n\nThe mechanics are pretty round, well developed and pretty simple to understand. I enjoy how you have many different paths you can choose and it makes you really feel like you have a 'choice' in your future.\nLoved it!", "timestamp_created": 1682518439, "timestamp_updated": 1682518439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137321847": {"recommendationid": "137321847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867700930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1685305992}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Jugabilidad y est\u00e9tica agradables, buena trama e historias. \u00a1Engancha!", "timestamp_created": 1682515462, "timestamp_updated": 1682515462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137321612": {"recommendationid": "137321612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126834957", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1697173410}, "language": "english", "review": "A game for guys who want a daughter.

Still, that doesn't mean it wasn't a pretty fun game.  I enjoyed a first play through and then a new game+ for the \"perfect\" ending.\n\nThe attribute system is greatly simplified as compared to PM2.  In some ways this is a good thing, as it is much easier to understand for new players.  In some ways this is the worst thing about the game.  It's so easy to just max everything (especially on new game+) that you can make one character to tour all the top tier endings without much trouble.  This tanks the replay value as compared to PM2, where getting any top tier ending involved careful planning to meet the requirements and \"just maxing everything\" was a pipe dream.\n\nThe romance system was the same old thing used since original Harvest Moon, you can chat and gift people once a day, so no points for originality.  However it fits well in this sort of game, and it's as functional as it has always been.\n\nOne point where is surpasses PM2 is the UI.  PM2 was mostly just a set of lists that let you pick what you wanted to do.  In Volcano Princess, different actions are performed in different places in and around town, so you actually have to travel to those different places to do things instead of just selecting them from a list.  It gives the game a bit more personality and makes the game world feel larger.\n\nOverall, while it is an inferior game, it's still a fun game.  I enjoyed my two plays, and while it doesn't have any replay value beyond that, it still made for a good 24 hours of game time.

I played Princess Maker all throughout my childhood and adored it, so it was sad to me when it was difficult to find games like it. Sure, there are handful of games out there that are well enough, but in my opinion none of them ever come close to Princess Maker... until Volcano Princess. Playing this game brings back that sense of nostalgia from my childhood, and unlike other recent games there is a clear true ending to strive for. It brings new mechanics into an old genre and it fits so well together. \n\nNow, I will say a few things. I really recommend this game, but I feel I do need to point out that out of the few playthroughs I've done now I have come across a few bugs. The most notable one is the fact that letters will come in  and if you click on it the words will not appear and it will break the game. There has been a fix created to help with this. However, another bug I came to was the fact that my game was seemingly skipping over the \"Volcano Festival.\" I'm still trying to figure out if this has something to do with the fact that I changed my birthday month in my second playthrough and it skipped over the month of October because of it. Either way, it is a bug that needs to be fixed. The festival is a big part of the lore and gameplay, and it feels like your missing out when you can't even go.

The game takes everything you love about PM2, and adds upon it. \n\nPROS:\nSophisticated stat system\nEasy to understand\nAreas in the town unlock as you progress through the game\nTurn based combat \nMaking friends that you take on adventures, each with different skills\nFestivals that test your daughter, along with minigames\nWide variety of unique characters that feel like real people\nIncredibly adorable father/daughter relationship. Also the option to be a bad dad\nLots of different paths for your daughter to go down, and  balanced with every gameplay\nUnique story with its own twist. Choices you make heavily impact your daughter and story\nSide quests in the Knights college that help advance your daughter in a certain direction\nLots of things to do in the town map\nRomance is very in depth. The game also rewards you with gifts as you advance every relationship\nCooking and Crafting\nLots of straight and lesbian romance routes\n\nCONS:\nDice minigame is hard to understand, even with the guide I'm still confused. I end up avoiding it every playthrough\n\nHorse racing is very hard, even with novice races you have to have an extremely fast horse to win, which is not available until you have at least 40 MND. Also I spent like 2000 gold leveling up my horse and still couldn't win. Hopefully they make this more balanced\n\nYou can date practically everyone in the town. The reason I put this in the con section is because there are some weird match ups involving people a lot older than you, and you can start romancing these people once you hit age 12 lol. So yeah there are some huge age gaps and it gets kinda freaky for my taste. The only plus side is that you can't groom your own daughter like in the original PM2\n\nNo magic classes in the game. If you want to fight in the forest, you have to build up your STR, which sucks  because INT and CHA have no place in battle\n\nThis game is very long. It took me several days to finish one playthrough. I actually kind of like this because the game is very in depth, but I made it a con because some people may not like this when pursuing multiple endings\n\nBattle requires a lot of grinding to progress, although they offset this by spending purple stones to level up characters not in use. The problem is that you have to grind to get the stones, and you can't purchase them\n\nOverall I think this is a great addition to the Daughter Raising Simulator genre, and really scratches that itch I've been craving in a game for a while now. The only thing they could add to make this game perfect (imo) is the ability to decorate your room. I think it would be super cute to acquire different stuff to place in there to personalize it. They kinda do this with the Alchemy station, but you can't see any of the decorations visibly.

[\u2026] Como padre, est\u00e1s LITERALMENTE dedicando al menos 18 a\u00f1os de tu vida simplemente a criar a una chica para que otro hombre la disfrute.[/quote]\nVenido de la china mandarina, tras una superexitosa campa\u00f1a de crowdfunding, nos llega Volcano Princess, un PrincessMakerlike con un nivel de pulimentado propio de Gainax en sus mejores a\u00f1os\u2026 excepto que el equipo de desarrollo est\u00e1 formado por dos t\u00edas, posiblemente trabajando en un s\u00f3tano de ocho metros cuadrados. Con un equipo tan peque\u00f1o est\u00e1 claro que la visi\u00f3n art\u00edstica del proyecto ha quedado totalmente plasmada, si bien ha sido a costa de algunos errores en el apartado t\u00e9cnico. \n\nPero empecemos por el principio; sabes a lo que vienes. Eres un padre, tienes una hija, y su porvenir depende de tu capacidad de navegar men\u00fas y minmaxear estados emocionales, conocimientos y relaciones.\n\nTras una breve etapa en la infancia, tenemos 4 a\u00f1os para convertir a nuestra adolescente en una mujer de tomo y lomo. El juego sigue una estructura mensual en el que cada mes podremos gastar varios puntos de energ\u00eda en diversas actividades: explorar mazmorras, actuar en el teatro, tener citas con las 15 personas con las que queremos casarnos, plantar zanahorias, apu\u00f1alar vagabundos en callejones\u2026 lo t\u00edpico. Dichos puntos de energ\u00eda se pueden recuperar ligeramente, pero por lo general estamos bastante limitados (sobre todo en nuestro primer run), as\u00ed que es mejor no diversificar hobbies. Esto obviamente lleva al hecho de que hay mucha repetici\u00f3n, pero seamos realistas, es un mal inherente del propio g\u00e9nero.\n\nNo todos estos meses son totalmente jugables, durante unos cuantos de ellos tendremos que asistir a una fiesta o torneo que, por lo que sea, ocupar\u00e1 todo nuestro mes, a pesar de que el evento en s\u00ed no parece durar m\u00e1s que unas horas. Si bien me gusta que el juego tenga este tipo de momentos, me parece que deber\u00edan ser adicionales al mes en lugar de sustitutivos.\n\nAl contrario que Princess Maker o Long Live The Queen, Volcano Princess opta por una experiencia mucho m\u00e1s apacible y sencilla. Por ejemplo, hay un estado que determina el humor de la chavala, y si baja del 50% sus stats se dividen por dos. Creo que son en contadas ocasiones las veces en la que eso me ha pasado, y arreglarlo es sencill\u00edsimo. El juego tambi\u00e9n ofrece un sistema de New Game+ bastante bien implementado en el que los logros que saques pueden convertirse en puntos con los que puedes facilitar enormemente tu siguiente run. \n\nTambi\u00e9n hay un stat llamado \u201cdarkness\u201d que aumenta a medida que realizas acciones de dudosa moral, como trabajar de crupier para la mafia, o apu\u00f1alar vagabundos en callejones. Si tienes m\u00e1s de 50, se te nieg\u0430 la posibilidad de usar una de las funciones m\u00e1s \u00fatiles del juego, por lo que suele ser buena idea no ir full edgelord. El concepto est\u00e1 bien, y hay unos pocos finales que dependen de tener m\u00e1s de cierta cifra, pero por lo general gestionarlo no es un problema en ning\u00fan momento. Ya que estamos, que criticar es gratis, hubiera estado bien si las interacciones con algunos personajes cambiasen en funci\u00f3n de lo mucho que idolizas a Shadow the Hedgehog, pero que yo me haya fijado no se da el caso.\n\nY ya que estamos, hablemos de esos finales, que son a fin de cuentas uno de los aspectos m\u00e1s importantes de estos jueguillos. Hay mucha gente (entre los cuales me incluyo) para los que la experiencia Princess Maker consiste mayormente en \u201c1 solo run, y que sea lo que Dios quiera\u201d. Como en la vida real, si mi hija acaba siendo la emperatriz de la naci\u00f3n o la prostituta del barrio depende \u00fanicamente de mis decisiones y el RNG.\n\nVolcano Princess cuenta con m\u00e1s de 50 finales seg\u00fan la profesi\u00f3n, a los que se suman m\u00e1s de 10 finales seg\u00fan la pareja ([spoiler]o, sorprendentemente, parejas[/spoiler]) con la que termines. Se queda corto con respecto a los m\u00e1s de 70 finales de Princess Maker 2, pero hay que tener en cuenta que la mayor\u00eda de dichos finales eran un simple sprite de la chavala vestida para la ocasi\u00f3n. En el caso de Volcano Princess, contamos con una serie de CGs de alt\u00edsima calidad.  \nY es que \u00e9ste es el aspecto en el que el juego brilla m\u00e1s fuerte. No s\u00e9 si necesito decirlo: \u00e9ste es uno de esos juegos que entra por los ojos; es supercuqui. La artista del juego tiene tambi\u00e9n el rol de \u201cProducer\u201d, y es f\u00e1cil ver c\u00f3mo esto es un passion project para el que ha tenido todo el dinero del mundo. \nYa no es s\u00f3lo que tu hija sea la hija m\u00e1s jodid\u0430mente \u5361\u54c7\u4f0a del mundo; a nivel est\u00e9tico el juego es una peque\u00f1a maravilla donde constantemente est\u00e1s viendo arte que est\u00e1 ah\u00ed a pesar de no ser necesario.  El juego no necesitaba que muchos de los NPCs con dos l\u00edneas de di\u00e1logo tuvieran dibujo, ni necesitaba tener casi 300 items con sprites \u00fanicos, ni necesitaba tener 15 trajes (todos ellos supercuquis) que variasen en funci\u00f3n de la edad de la ni\u00f1a, ni necesitaba tener arte en distintos estilos para cada una de las clases. Pero lo tiene. Una y otra vez me sorprendi\u00f3, y siempre para bien, la cantidad de esfuerzo puesta en el apartado art\u00edstico. \n\nAhora hablemos del otro aspecto; el t\u00e9cnico. S\u00ed, \u00e9sta es la parte en la que le echo un peque\u00f1o jarro de mierd\u0430 al videojoco.\n\nEl juego tiene una traducci\u00f3n al ingl\u00e9s bastante p\u00e9sima (aunque bueno, si sois fans de Princess Maker ya est\u00e1is acostumbrados a jugar a vuestros grooming simulators en ingl\u00e9s roto). A grandes rasgos se entienden las cosas, pero hacia el final el juego toca temas bastante abstractos y hay momentos en los que literalmente no ten\u00eda ni idea de lo que estaba pasando. Las desarrolladoras son perfectamente conscientes de que esto es el principal problema, as\u00ed que es muy posible que se solvente con el tiempo. \n\nHay algunas decisiones de dise\u00f1o cuestionables. Por ejemplo, si tienes pensado explotar el sistema de granja, vas a tener que comprar mucho esti\u00e9rcol. Cada vez que compras lo que sea, tu relaci\u00f3n con el vendedor avanza un punto. Es decir, que al final del juego no vas a poder hacer m\u00e1s que casarte con \u00e9l. El poder del esti\u00e9rcol, nena.\n\nHay muchas cosas mejorables a nivel de usabilidad. Debido al cuantioso RNG llegar\u00e1 un momento en el que te tocar\u00e1 savescumear para intentar ara\u00f1ar la mayor cantidad de finales posibles. Desgraciadamente el sistema de guardado deja bastante que desear. S\u00f3lo dispones de siete espacios de guardado, y m\u00e1s te vale acordarte de qu\u00e9 estabas haciendo en cada uno de ellos porque la informaci\u00f3n brilla por su ausencia. Si bien puedes guardar en casi cualquier momento, al cargar la partida el d\u00eda empieza de cero. Esto ya de por s\u00ed desanima al savescumeo, pero el mayor problema es que las cutscenes no se pueden saltar ni acelerar; vas a tener que desgastar el rat\u00f3n como si estuvieras con el cookie clicker. Esto se convierte especialmente en un problema a la hora de sacar los finales. Lo que deber\u00eda ser un proceso de diez minutos se convierte en m\u00e1s de una hora. \n\nTambi\u00e9n digo, muchos de estos problemas s\u00f3lo te minan la moral tras 25 horas de repetici\u00f3n. Y posiblemente se arreglen en el futuro. [b]EDIT:[/b] Ya se puede acelerar el di\u00e1logo.\n\nPor si no quedase claro, el juego me ha encantado. A pesar de sus fallos, lo considero de lo mejorcito que he jugado en este g\u00e9nero, aunque para ser justos, tampoco hay mucha m\u00e1s opci\u00f3n. Para terminar de rematar, el precio es rid\u00edculamente bajo. Incluso si s\u00f3lo quieres sacar un final y olvidarte, te va a dar diez horas f\u00e1cilmente.

I must admit, this is truly a difficult start since early departure of my wife, but I must press on for the sake of our daughter, our dream. At her early age, we loved to went around town and tried everything we could do at that day. early morning activity was always go-to start for our plan. I knew, this wouldn\u2019t lead to any further mastery in her future, nevertheless I wished she enjoyed everything that I could offer. \nAs she growed up, she started to went around town and be a part of them. She truly one of the heart from the town, everyone is her friend. -heck, even i lost count, how many people has come to our house to see her (my guess is roughly 9, for romantic event). But it put ease on my mind since I got caught an unknown disease. At least, if it\u2019s the will from the heaven to separate us on earth prematurely, she still had the town to rely on. But thanks to the heaven for he decided not to do so until the time.\nMy daughter wasn\u2019t a champion but she was champion in my heart. She might not the best daughter in the world, but she\u2019s the best for me and I hope the best for her. I\u2019m proud of her, because she can be who she is and married to whom she loves.\nWelp, actually, that\u2019s my bad. I thought, it was better to had good term with his headmaster- Mr. Claude- so she wouldn\u2019t have much trouble in school. Both of them took it too seriously, what a mess. At least, my advice, to cook first the ingredients, which come from her adventure, was a good idea. She becomes a good cooker and has her own restaurant.\nAnd here I\u2019m, on the first spring of this year without her, my wife reach home, which is truly a saving grace.\nAlso my transformation into a chicken is canceled, I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m disappointed.\n================================================================================================\n\n\nReview\n================================================================================================\n(Disclaimer) This\u2019s my first steam review. It\u2019s worth to take note that my gaming history mostly in fps genre and/or something relate to world war 2 but recently, I want to expend my horizon. So, take my opinion with a grain of salt. No, a lot of them, not just a grain.\nVolcano Princess is a rising-\u201cdaughter\u201d simulation with visual novel and rpg frame. The players are tasked to raise her daughter whatever they see suit for her. Your aim is her future career and fianc\u00e9 (and yes, you can make your daughter marry to other daughter, I tried this to avoid \u201ccucked\u201d feeling but failing due to academic reason: pleasing the headmaster). How to do it? Raise those numbers, baby~. Each turn, the player has a number of action. It can be used to do activity and replenished in certain ways. To end turn, player \u201cplan\u201d study activity for the daughter.\nThere\u2019s a lot of arts, ton of them, and there\u2019re good but due to the variety accessories, I find it\u2019s insufficient and bothering. But this flaw is ignorable.\nThe voice is limited to just reaction such as laughing, thinking, etc. There\u2019s no text reading.\nThe music is okay at bringing the mood, but I ignored it most of the time.\nThe rising elements (or the gameplay) is okay. Most of the time, the players raise her daughter through town interaction and planning system. I find this system is boring, due to repetitiveness, since most daughter actions are dictated by player options directly (not through father as mediator) and counted in numbers. I prefer to say it as lack of surprise element because it\u2019s sureness (the authority of player and the honesty of numbers). % RNG isn\u2019t the surprise element I mean, but the turning events base on choice like \u201cDisco Elysium\u201d (unfair comparison, but that\u2019s the best I have). \nThe story is niche, classic fantasy and a little bit of plot. I\u2019m not sure how the plot turns out since somehow, I managed to avoid by achieve true ending. The good part is the light-warm interaction between char\u2019s family. Other interactions are sometimes ambiguous due to translation, but still readable by putting few logics. Too bad, I couldn\u2019t focus the story much (mostly I skimmed) because I feel uncomfortable with the UI. It\u2019s my problem since I have encounter many similar UI and I couldn\u2019t do much about my concentration.\nThe game itself is a little bit buggy. I couldn\u2019t open the letter from friends (or I stuck with letter in opened position) and few times my games force close by itself, I\u2019m not sure why.\nFinal verdict, I with reluctant to pick unrecommended but due to major recommended review, I decide so. I couldn\u2019t recommend this game to past-self because my gaming history. Nevertheless, it still a good experience although at certain point, I want to bash my head to my keyboard so badly.

That's an entire feature of the game that not only doesn't work but literally breaks the game. Its also essentially auto save only. There is a save function, but when you load the game no matter where you saved you restart the entire day so you really can only save at the start of the day, where auto save saves your game already. To be fair the game tells you this when you save but if that was going to be the case the devs could have totally take the player save functionality out had the same result and fixed other bugs. If the player save feature is going to be there it should do something. Not sure if others had the issue, and at least this bug wasn't game breaking, but there is a stables race game bit to the game and it just doesn't function. You hover over the button to \"Participate\" and you can sit there and click all day but despite the button reacting visually to you hovering over and clicking it the button does nothing. Sometimes other clicks don't respond but if you wait a second and click again it suddenly works, and other times you click to read dialogue and it just skips two or three frames of dialogue or narrative and there's no way to go back so you just flat out miss it.\nI feel like this could be a very good game especially for $10, but with all the bugs and some of them flat out game breaking along with sections/features of the game that just don't work at all this feels like a beta version or an early access game that you're paying for to do beta testing for free for the devs. Maybe there will be an update that fixes everything and I'll have to change this review, but until then I just can't recommend the game.", "timestamp_created": 1682331944, "timestamp_updated": 1682331944, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530695974826812744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137213102": {"recommendationid": "137213102", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031998759", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1688376765}, "language": "english", "review": "i really love this game it's fun and addicting but the bugs are really annoying, crash here and there force me to restart a turn.

Not nearly as much as My Life as a Teenage Exocolonist for a few reasons. There are several problems that you may or may not be able to overlook.\n\nMost noticeably, the translations are CRUNCHY. It's not really a problem for most of the game, you can pretty easily get the gist of what was meant. Once you get in to later story stuff for the true ending it gets pretty difficult to understand, to the point that I'm wondering if there are some sequence breaks I found accidentally.\n\nThere are also two pretty severe and consistent game breaking bugs. First and foremost are the gift letters you receive. These will lock the game up every single time you try to open one. Fortunately they aren't really a necessary part of the game, they're mostly for flavor. Second is a save data corruption bug that can happen if you have cloud saves enabled. As of the version I'm playing (1.00.00 I think) the devs even have it in the announcements with instructions for how to turn off cloud saves. There are also a number of other bugs that are less consistent, e.g. I once had to force quit when I got stuck in the horse capturing event.\n", "timestamp_created": 1682312871, "timestamp_updated": 1682312871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736602187156677246", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137211551": {"recommendationid": "137211551", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095949494", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 707, "last_played": 1684684428}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game so much.", "timestamp_created": 1682312298, "timestamp_updated": 1682312298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137211037": {"recommendationid": "137211037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199084854836", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1348, "last_played": 1682470104}, "language": "english", "review": "Very buggy (game-breaking bugs -- had to roll back a patch to even play).

Be a good dad and raise an awesome daughter. \n\nThe game is similar to Long Live The Queen or My Life As A Teenage Exocolonist. \n\nYou talk to people, give gifts, take classes, go on expeditions, farm, cook, work at a part time job, do alchemy, etc. You raise statistics through coursework, consuming certain farming outputs, consuming potions, buying outfits, or getting decorations for your house. Some combat specific stats can be raised through going on expeditions. Talking to characters you see on screen also grants a \"perception\" statistic / currency that is used when responding to letters you see if you have admirers, which can be gained from fame you get from attending balls or working as an actress, or from part time jobes at the bath with more sketchy jobs like card dealer for the mafia granting more admirers. The perception currency you get from talking to each character makes it worth while to talk to everyone and makes it so there are no useless character interactions in the game.\n\nAt the end of a playthrough, the person your daughter has the closest relationship with is the trigger for who your daughter marries as an adult. Your daughter may romance female characters if you to. Relationships with characters can be raised by chatting with them, giving them gifts, consulting them which also raises your statistics, challenging them to debates or duels, and taking them on dates. Dates so far seem completely platonic with some romantic undertones as nothing more lewd than handholding or hugging is shown (at least that I have seen in my 2 playthroughs so far).\n\nAs you play the game you will inevitably have accomplishments which are worth points at game end to make life the next time around easier. You can boost statistics, base relationship values with folks, boost fame, and get items for the next playthrough.\n\nLike some other games in the genre, some of the \"best\" or possibly \"true\" endings are much easier to accomplish in your second playthrough with boosted statistics. There is some explanation on why the starting a new life narratively makes sense, but giving the specifics of why new game + is a thing in this setting would spoil the story. \n\nCurrent state, there are some typos, not enough to break the game, as the developer does not speak English natively. There are some bugs, that I ran into which caused me to need to restart the game. The developer has a discord and is actively working on fixing the reported bugs. \n\nI felt pretty good playing this game, I did not feel stressed out like I did in trying to get a good ending in Long Live the Queen. There are many endings you can get, and it is not the end of the world to get an average ending. Every playthrough can help you get achievements to boost your character in new game +. \n\nOh, and the art is nice for the game.

The devs have heard their fans and are working towards fixing the game breaking bugs. Whoever is still having problems with the corrupted save files even after trying to roll back the patch, all you have to do is;\n1. Click windows + R and run %AppData%\n2. Go back to the full AppData folder, the search will automatically take you to the roaming folder\n3. Find LocalLow folder\n4. Find Volcano Princess\n5. Delete everything in the Volcano Princess folder. It is the one saving your corrupted save files. You have to delete all of it to get the game to work again.\n\nAfter doing all of the that, my game is progressing again. Thank you devs for listening to us! I am leaving the old portion of my review below this.\n\nNEGATIVE REVIEW\nI really wanted to like this game. The concept is cute, the characters are lively, the overall game has so much potential. Unfortunately, this game has game breaking bugs. To the point where it is actually unplayable. There are several people complaining about translation issues, and sure the English translation could be better, but there are two very specific bugs that most people seem to be having problems with. The letters you receive from other characters and when you try to tame a horse.\n\nThe letter bug you are able to bypass by not even entertaining the thought of clicking on it. Unfortunately, the horse bug completely crashes your game and breaks it. I can't even play the game anymore. It won't let me get past the opening sequence. There are people who keep saying to unpatch the game, to force it roll back to the old patch, but it does not work if your files are located Program Files (x86). As of right now, my game is actually unplayable.\n\nI recommend saving your money until these bugs are completely fixed. I will change my review until I am able to play the game again.", "timestamp_created": 1682294026, "timestamp_updated": 1682364911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137201327": {"recommendationid": "137201327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012125842", "num_games_owned": 1076, "num_reviews": 218, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1682661679}, "language": "english", "review": "game crashes on start even with the fix and I hope it gets patched soon,\nbut damn this a nice game", "timestamp_created": 1682291708, "timestamp_updated": 1682291708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454914242029190063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137200819": {"recommendationid": "137200819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045235803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1682447282}, "language": "english", "review": "The good: very charming and relaxing.

Of the ~2 hours on record for me so far, about 33% of that time has been spent replaying content after any number of errors force crash the game, break the UI so that menus can't be exited, and more.\n\nThe bottom line: there is a fun and charming game to be had here and with an introductory discount, it may be worthwhile. Be prepared to lose time, progress, and motivation to a number of technical issues beyond the player's control. Will update this review after more time/fixes have been applied.\n\nEDIT: Update after a couple of days of waiting on bug fixes. I've now spent about 50% of my game time starting new games, losing progress, replaying content to try and get around the bugs, only to hit game breaking bugs again.

I know you can ignore the letters but it's my first play through - I want to see what my buddies have to say. I'm not temporarily switching the game language to Chinese as a work around. I'm not going to change my game to roll back the most recent patch. I'm going to wait until the bug is fixed.\n\n***\n\nThe music is pleasant, the characters are engaging, and the game play is enjoyable. This game is like Long Live the Queen and Princess Maker on steroids in the best possible way. \n\nTell me you've never played a Princess Maker game without telling me you've never played a Princess Maker game? \nBy complaining about the translation. \nIs it wonky? Sure. \nIs it unplayable because of it? Nope.\n\nAs this is my first play through I'm not entirely certain what I'm supposed to be focusing on so my daughter has performed in plays and worked at the baths. She's made lots of friends and I love the scenes with them spending time together.\n\nThe dialogue between the father and daughter is heartwarming. This game makes you want to raise a daughter well so that she will succeed. So far I haven't had any instances with her running away from home like Olive in PM2, but I also haven't let her darkness get terribly high. Olive in PM2 annoyed me with her running away from home. If Rose ran away in Volcano Princess I'd curl into a ball and cry on the floor.\n\nRelationships: Your daughter can't date her father but she CAN date girls. We love to see it. She can also have relationships with people a bit older than her - and I do not like that. Just a personal thing, grandpa types shouldn't be sending my kid letters.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682276691, "timestamp_updated": 1682276691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0,

I was expecting it to be some dumb poorly translated visual novel, and while it's still poorly translated (which only really makes it funnier, on top of a very funny game), what's mind blowing is HOW MUCH CONTENT THERE IS and also HOW GOOD IT ALL IS. I spent 11 hours on my first run, and noticed there are 58 ENDINGS, EVERY CHARACTER IS ROMANCEABLE (except 2, sorry dilf lovers) and there's a HADES-LIKE MIRROR OF DARKNESS SYSTEM. THIS GAME IS A ROGUELIKE VISUAL NOVEL????\nI'm also blown away by how much heart it has. It really nails feeling both like raising a daughter and growing up yourself, as the game is split between playing as the father and as the daughter. The characters are ALL incredible, there isn't a single character I even thought was meh. The only problem I have with the story/characters is that there is SO MUCH that I can't possibly fit it all in one playthrough. Luckily, as I mentioned before, the new game plus allows you to start with a wide array of benefits like in Hades, which honestly is a very similar game.\nAs far as I can tell, there are 3 main \"routes\" you can take, which is basically strength, intelligience, or charisma. I went charisma on my first run, which meant I made a killing doing plays or working at the bathhouse, and can't wait to try the other two routes!\nThe combat is VERY good, which I was not expecting AT ALL. Like I said before, I did the charisma route, which meant my strength was lacking, but it was still really fun finding a combination of weapons and abilities that could let me triumph (burn is broken btw, it essentially gives you an extra attack worth of damage each turn, and it only accumulates)\nI've been writing for too long.

There's a lot to love in this game, but the English Translation REALLY holds it back.\n\nOverall, this game is really fun. The characters are cute, drawn well and overall seem to have a lot of substance to them and some level of nuance. There's replay value in the fact that you can spend points from achievements gained on a run, to get higher starting base stats/items/etc to make the next run easier and hopefully to achieve that \"better\" ending or an ending that you are gunning for. \n\nThe gameplay is rather simple. You have a certain amount of energy each day to do certain things, with ways of gaining more. As time goes on more and more, the character's daughter (your daughter) grows older with certain time skips at certain points throughout the game. You gain stats, skills, and subject scores in relation to the classes you take/the activites you do in the overworld. Or, instead you can spend energy fighting monsters in the forest, clearing out the corruption to hopefully find the \"Owl Princess\" to defeat the big bad. Or, you could become a socialite and try to enter nobility through social mingling. You can also grow food, catch horses and talk to citizens much like Fire Emblem Three houses did. Where you can talk, spend time with, duel in word play/actual battle, give gifts etc. There are certain activities like the \"dark alley\" that seemed put in last minute, that don't offer much to you and seem to be completely left field with art style. But not many have that issue. \n\nThe music is very fitting for this game as well, and catchy at times though the lack of longer length tracks makes the second or third play through get rather depressing as once you heard the music once, that's it. \n\nThe Arty style and art direction is great, the characters look awesome and the set pieces are well done with some art looking a little odd but nothing that looks out place (ignoring you dark alley, with your weird pixel based art)\n\nBut, all of this benefit, this great game packaged in a 10 dollar price tag is marred by the English Translation. At times it's passable, at other times it's so bad it's hard to understand why is being conveyed. As an example, during dates if you fill up all the \"romance\" points you get an option called \"ambiguous.\" what that means, I'm not entirely sure other than you get higher rewards. \n\nI really love this game, I played it almost non stop for three days because I fell in love with what the game was, even if the English Translation was bad. However, not everyone will be able to sift through the confusingly structured sentences, the weird conveying of information and simply strange word translation that really hampers the enjoyment. At times, the translation won't even work giving the name 50C at one point for a character. To give the devs a lot of credit, it is only a two female team from China. The Translation at this point almost feels like a fault of the publisher rather than the devs. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money if you can stand the translation, if that is concern give it a month or so and by then the translation should be up to snuff for any player. Easily one of the best games I've played this year, and I really hope a better translation comes out so I can truly appreciate what this dynamic duo was trying to make.", "timestamp_created": 1682123191, "timestamp_updated": 1682380970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.789835572242736816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137081149": {"recommendationid": "137081149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128106239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1683042049}, "language": "english", "review": "You can raise your daughter to become a demon king.
