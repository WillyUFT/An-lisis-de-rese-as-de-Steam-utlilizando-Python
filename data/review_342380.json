fan-service heavy story with a male protagonist and several normal and supernatural women around him. The protagonist this time is apparently a normal teenager when he gets attacked by a monster on his way to school. He is saved by two women who turn out to be angels and suddenly also appear in his school as classmates. Soon, a third woman enters the scene, apparently a demon or succubus, who has sent the monsters after the protagonist in the first place. Several flirts and some choices later, the game explores the theme of being ignored during teenage years, but falls flat doing so. Sakura Angels is not a deep game, but presents a bit more choice than Sakura Spirit and is slightly more engaging. Visuals are on the same level, and voice acting is available in Japanese. Despite this, Sakura Angels is still a very lacklustre way to spend time, and not a good Visual Novel at all.", "timestamp_created": 1668593354, "timestamp_updated": 1668593354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123188649": {"recommendationid": "123188649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000998015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1296, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1435069299}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have played Sakura Spirit, you enjoyed that game you will enjoy this.

It\u2019s essentially softcore porn with a nonsensical plot.\n\nThe story only serves to move the main character around the city so he can see scantily clad anime girls. There is also a lot of cringeworthy dialogue that is only there to appeal to the \u201cnice guy\u201d demographic. Without getting into plot specifics, every character is written quite poorly. The villain is primarily motivated by loneliness, while the two angels seem to begin the story already in love with you. The romance doesn\u2019t make any sense because the story takes place over the course of what seems like a week.\n\nThe visuals are drawn well, but are obviously in a weird, over-the-top style. I assume that someone into anime porn would enjoy them, although it seemed like there was only a handful of porn images. Honestly, you are probably better off just googling hentai if that\u2019s what you are looking for, rather than wading through a terrible story just for a glimpse of anime porn.\n\nThis game has a lot of issues and I don\u2019t really understand why anyone enjoys these. If you want nude anime girls, you can look at that for free online somewhere, and if you want an interesting story, there are plenty of genuinely good visual novels available.\n\n2/10\n[quote]\nVisit our [url=https://www.mmmreviews.com]website[/url] for more in-depth reviews and recommendations\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1595628830, "timestamp_updated": 1595628830, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563374459743499756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72149290": {"recommendationid": "72149290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344082254", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1593858983}, "language": "english", "review": "(/\u03c9\uff3c*)\u2026\u2026\u2026 (/\u03c9\u2022\uff3c*)", "timestamp_created": 1594025742, "timestamp_updated": 1594025742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524354279041290283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72136347": {"recommendationid": "72136347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198863230916", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 293, "last_played": 1595387975}, "language": "english", "review": "fun little story. nice art.", "timestamp_created": 1594006255, "timestamp_updated": 1594006255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71645452": {"recommendationid": "71645452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424443528", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1594115825}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes i recommend this game to other players", "timestamp_created": 1593430135, "timestamp_updated": 1593430135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70416130": {"recommendationid": "70416130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040919135", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 561, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1591504427}, "language": "english", "review": "Entertaining!

There is a bit more emphasis on the story this time with a little bit darker theme compared to Sakura Spirit. It is still a fairly short VN (around 6 hours) with couple of fanservice scenes here and there but definitely less than previous instalment.\n\nOur MC Kenta is your typical average high school student who has been having some severe headaches which are directly tied to his nightmares he has been having lately. But there seems to be more to it than meets the eye...\nOne morning when Kenta is on his way to the school, he is assaulted by some kind of shadow monster and that's where our heroines appear to save the day. 2 guardian angels, Hikari and Sayaka who has been secretly protecting Kenta.\n\nSayaka is cheerful and always optimistic while Hikari is typical Tsundere, prone to violence when trying to hide her embarrassment. Both girls are fully voiced this time which is nice change compared to Sakura Spirit. The voice acting is good enough but not the best I have heard.\n\nThere are quite a bit of choices you can make during the game and some of them affect the ending you will see but the diferences are not that big. There are 3 posible ending variations.\n\nMusic this time wasn't as good as with previous title but still decent enough for most parts.\n\nVisuals are pretty good with some added effects and nice CG gallery. All the background images and sprites were of good quality.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game if you want some short and quite funny VN but better to wait for a sale since the discounts for this game are pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1576567447, "timestamp_updated": 1576567447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666",

The NPC or characters in game have that same effect. \n\nA lot of beautiful detail went into each one to give them their own unique look and appearances making them beautiful and very enjoyable to look at, The graphics in this game are truly a work of art. Under the menu options we have the means to choose window or full screen mode.\n\nSounds:\n\nTo accompany stunning art they added incredible music, every scene or place in the game has beautiful background music accompanying it, from soothing music to nostalgia inducing, the music truly makes this game great. \n\nIt adds a lovely sense of calm as you enjoy the story line.\n\nReplayability:\n\nThe game has certain choices you can choose from, but that isn\u2019t really a reason to replay it, the game however can be replayed, we all reread a book once in a while, especially if it was a good one.\n\nThe fun part here is that you can have it move pages on its own as you sit back and enjoy the story line again and again, so yes this game has a means of replayability even though it\u2019s a different one from what we are used to.\n\n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\nSpoilers ahead:\n\nThe graphics and sound come together incredibly, if you couple that with the amazing story line, we have ourselves a work of art that everyone who enjoys reading will absolutely adore, it truly is that beautiful.  The more you play the more you want to play; you can get lost in the story line, and given how amazing the game looks via the art work and that amazing music you really do get lost in this epic visual novel.\n\nSince this is a book and giving away the plot will ruin it, I won\u2019t share too much regarding the story line, to keep it as short as possible, your ancestors sealed away an ancient evil spirit and now it and its forces are after you, why you ask? Well that you will have to find out as you delve deep into this amazing game, but fret not you are accompanied and protected by two beautiful and magical ladies whose duty is to protect you, so you are not alone.\n\nSteam has this game tagged as Nudity and Mature, so expect to see some form of nudity, depending on where you are from, nudity ratings may vary, so for the sake of caution the game was tagged containing nudity. Expected nudity that can be seen here would be naked characters with exposed breasts but no exposed nipples. Her backside can also be seen but her bottoms in not in any compromising position.\n\nScore 8\nBy: MGRza\nDate: 18 January 2015\n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Mac: Linux \nGenre: Visual Novel: Anime\nCensor Rating: Nudity: Mature\nAge Rating: R18\nDeveloper: Winged Cloud\nPublisher: Winged Cloud\nRelease Date: 16 January 2015\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\n\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za", "timestamp_created": 1536479633, "timestamp_updated": 1589380943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536706626415252686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44630584": {"recommendationid": "44630584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075867570", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1535324694}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A lot of \u201cplot\u201d, but barely actual plot.[/h1]\n\n\"Whether Sakura Angels will be worth your time is really going to be up to you.

While retaining its main comedic and ecchi tone, it sports a slightly more elaborate story and character development compared to Sakura Spirit. By focusing on just two girls, their personalities and interactions shine thorugh much more clearly, resulting in better immersion and player involvement. It's much easier to grow to like the two girls, to laugh at their antics and to pick your waifu. There's also a few more choices, some meaningless and some adding up to one of three different endings. I'll say that it did give me a few good laughs and involve me enough with the girls.\n\nHowever, it's still mostly a cavalcade of clich\u00e9s, there's even less in terms of \"juicy material\" than in Sakura Spirit, and the art is cute and charming but still not good enough to justify the purchase alone.

Shinigami girls show up, tell you you have special blood. Hollows from unhappy humans. One of them is a hot girl. In the end you cure her hollow by being her friend.\n\nThere is barely any interactivity. There is voice acting in original japanese on occasion which was a nice touch but every character interaction felt derivative and like a caricature. The effort on the writing just felt really low.\n\nFan service was not exactly very simulating with a few underwear shots here and there.

And i won't say wether that is true or not since that isn't up for anyone to say. And as much as that may or may not be true, i did \"somewhat\" enjoy the VN. Let's go through it, shall we?\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nOkay look, it has been a while since i last played this game so what i am about to say may be a slight variation of the actual story. You play as Mr. Generic, Genericson, look, it's the typical VN protagonist, it's not important. You play as stupid guy, and one night while walking home you encounter this creature, or shadow rather. But before it get's a chance to munch on your bones two Angels come and rescue you. I am sure you can guess what they look like from the store page. Throughout the story you will go to school with these angels and you will encounter a dark angel that will try to kill you. You will of course also be able to choose the best girl, which ever one that might be. \n\n[h1]Grammar:[/h1]\nThis is a section that i always dread when it comes to VN's but since it's from Winged Cloud and they have some competent writers, it's decent and i didn't encounter any errors. So good on them on that.\n\n[h1]The Art/Visuals:[/h1]\nI know this point may seem pointless since you can just look at the screenshots, but i still wanted to leave my thoughts on it. It's good, and it's high quality, which is expected from Winged Cloud, since they sure have more than enough money to spend on it. The art style is in their typical iconic art style that we have seen every time. Please i know that this is a older VN from Winged Cloud but that doesn't make it any less true. \n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIt's an okay Visual Novel. However i do have to say that for the amount of content that you are given, 10\u20ac is far, far too much. I can absolutely not recommend it for that price. Wait for it to go down to 5\u20ac or less. Then it would be worth it, otherwise, not a chance in hell. But if you look away from the price, it's a okay VN. It's nothing special at all. Not even close, but if you want something dumb to spend a couple hours on then sure, i am not stopping you.\n\n[spoiler]Also for those that are wondering. The VN does not have a 18+ patch so if you want to buy it for the patch then i am sorry to tell you but this is not one of them.

The ONLY thing I can compliment is the art style because really it's the only good thing about these games ever.

The text boxes are so low that half the time the text BLEEDS OVER ONTO THE QUICK MENU. It's something that could have been so easily fixed with even an ounce of testing. On top of that sometimes sprites will appear DIRECTLY over each other.\n\nI refuse to accept that these games are to exist solely for porn because you can find the images FOR FREE in the Community Hub. I can't rate these games based off the fanservice for that reason alone. There's just story that goes so unexplored that it dumps exposition on you at the last minute then has stuff happen like \"oh shit we were supposed to do plot stuff right? We spent too much time on tits and asses that we forgot.\" If you're gonna have so much focused on the fanservice then just make a straight up hentai game cause if not then you just have a game that's nothing at the end of things.\n\nBecause of the nature of the shoddy stories and easily accessible fanservice that these games have there's 0 reason for these games to exist.

So I will try different visual novel game. 2) Winged Cloud company is seriously shady:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlh8e201lI0", "timestamp_created": 1526400261, "timestamp_updated": 1526400261, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567357420921325684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42016925": {"recommendationid": "42016925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198225641168", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1481407100}, "language": "english", "review": "\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\uff0c\u6302\u4e86\u4e0b\u5361", "timestamp_created": 1526214468, "timestamp_updated": 1526214468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41940542": {"recommendationid": "41940542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305401575", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1552513660}, "language": "english", "review": "govno", "timestamp_created": 1525890578, "timestamp_updated": 1525890578, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398737877607345581", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41870329": {"recommendationid": "41870329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066512174", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1495370106}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cute, as it was good enough to check it up. <3", "timestamp_created": 1525536899, "timestamp_updated": 1525536899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487903237342834473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41860048": {"recommendationid": "41860048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252767678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1615386327}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game =-=", "timestamp_created": 1525496670, "timestamp_updated": 1525496670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41838998": {"recommendationid": "41838998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255296141", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1524891071}, "language": "english", "review": "good pictures screen shots lovely voice acting but the end is... well 7.1 hours of playtime enjoy", "timestamp_created": 1525399817, "timestamp_updated": 1525399817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41782005": {"recommendationid": "41782005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065590353", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1509572947}, "language": "english", "review": "show bobs and vagene", "timestamp_created": 1525123953, "timestamp_updated": 1525123953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496702730655670166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41704591": {"recommendationid": "41704591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190380543", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 598, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1524771734}, "language": "english", "review": "Sakura Angels is a visual novel focused on your relationship with 2 girls trying to protect you from another girl.

Enter Sayaka and Hikari, two Magical Girls in charge with keeping Kenta safe.\n\nThe characters are clich\u00e9, Sayaka is cheerful(genki girl), Hikari is a  tsundere and Kenta is the normal, semi-weak male.\nAs with Sakura Spirit I find writing lacking and poor, in fact I enjoyed Sakura Angels less than its predecessor, the main character\u2019s motivation didn\u2019t seem to have the same sense of urgency Spirit did and as consequence it the story is even more of a chore to read.\nSakura angels ending feels rushed, another thing the previous titles as in common, like the devs were tired of it and wanted to end the game tying things up in any way possible, turning the antagonist the most disappointing aspect of the writing, with her reasons being childish and delivering us another anti-climatic ending, with our heroes unexpectedly becoming exponentially more competent and dispatching the evil entity with minimal effort.\n\nEditing and presentation are lacking too, while the writing seems better and feels more cohesive than Sakura Spirit, it still suffers from a plethora grammatical mistakes and awkward phrasing.\nThere is also many instances where the text overflows the text box and sometimes it even is overlaped by the rest of the User Interface.\n\nThe choices are plenty, but have no impact providing only a few lines of different dialogue for each choice, it took me 3 Hours to see everything the game had to offer, every choice, every dialog.\n\nAs for the BGM, it seems more generic this time around and much less immersive than what was present on Sakura Spirit. The visual novel does include Voice Acting which is a big plus, but the text/voice sync is weird and badly done, in many instances I had to wait for the girls to finish talking before the text was displayed.\n\nThe art is great, the backgrounds and the girls are well drawn but that is the only redeeming factor of this visual novel, like the previous title though, there's lack of variety on both, backgrounds and characters, and also a disconect of what's happening on the story and what's shown on the screen.\n\n\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nIn short, Angels suffers from the same incompetent storytelling and structure with Wanaca's Art being the sole redeeming factor, the inclusion of voice acting does provide a bit of immersion but it's not much of an improvement over Sakura Spirit, mainly when the rest is static or worse in comparison. \n\nIt is a shame since it did have a nice, even if cliche and overdone idea, but they chose not to develop it further, making it a shallow and skip-able Visual Novel, do you like the art? Then go to Winged Cloud Patreon or contact Wanaca and try to buy access to her art instead, this game is not worth the cost.", "timestamp_created": 1523482379, "timestamp_updated": 1523606817, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685281753540039063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41397024": {"recommendationid": "41397024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309586785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 127, "last_played": 1523365680}, "language": "english", "review": "No kiss\n0/10", "timestamp_created": 1523365645, "timestamp_updated": 1523365645, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519408524036407471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41388043": {"recommendationid": "41388043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309129240", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1592570949}, "language": "english", "review": "This game saved me from suicide.\n\n\nJust Because sayaka has huge anime Tiddies", "timestamp_created": 1523309145, "timestamp_updated": 1523309145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725821912288665771", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41353549": {"recommendationid": "41353549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093848252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 468, "last_played": 1522029115}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a movie!", "timestamp_created": 1523155736, "timestamp_updated": 1523155736, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447154492139816284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41347795": {"recommendationid": "41347795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279518384", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1575751942}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was great, I expected... uhh... something else opposed to what I recived, BUT, I was definitely not disappointed.

The art is very well made, is this what you would call \"eye-candy\"? Well anyways, did I mention that this game has boobs? And a handful of it too. This game has three different endings, which are fairly similar, but are dependant on the small choices you take through the game. Sadly not too many choices, and some of them are insignificant, but hey, what am I really here for? \"I only play VNs for the story\" Yeah, sure. These endings kind of open up for the ability to replay, and this is where the \"skip\" function is really handy, so that you can skip to the new scenes that you haven't seen yet.\nThe game does not have a patch (you most likely know what I am talking about) like some of the other Sakura games have, but this didn't really ruin my experience in any way. Of course this varies from person to person, dependant on what you're looking for.\n\nTo summarize:\nPros:\n-Beautiful art (anime grills)\n-Voice acted\n-Good enough story\n-Ecchi scenes\n\nCons:\n-Kind of short story (depends, considering that I got 12 hours)\n-Functions like \"auto\" may be a little bit slow, and isn't synched to the voices\n-No \"patch\"\n\nAs a conclusion I would quickly just say that this game was great, I was nit-picking on the cons. You will probably not experience any dissatisfaction with it. This is your average Sakura game, and you probably know what to expect if you're familiar with the series.\nWell, I recommend to buy this VN if you're interested, get ready to choose best waifu, and happy reading!\n", "timestamp_created": 1515442828, "timestamp_updated": 1515442828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534936428070068359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39164237": {"recommendationid": "39164237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262240693", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1515358753}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a fantastic game with made much of love.

This review won't be a compairson of the two, seeing as they're two ENTIRELY seperate games, but I will be using my experiences from Spirit to gague the experiences in Angels.\n\nPLOT (Mostly spoiler-free):\n\nThe story of Angels is rather dark and serious compared to the bubbly soundtrack and vibrantly-colored art.  You assume the role of Tenka, a high school student who is suffering from a reoccuring dream and splitting headaches.  As he is walking to school one day, he is attacked by a monster.  Just before he is killed, his two \"guardian angels\", Sayaka and Hikari, show up to save him.  Without spoiling too much, you learn the reasons behind Tenka's dreams and headaches, and go about solving those problems.  Your dynamic...trio...has a lot to offer up in personality.  Sayaka is loud an happy, but also has a streak of evil mischief to her.  Hikari is quiet and bossy, but has adorable moments of genuine happiness.  The two play off each other, and you, quite well, and they had me laughing in several scenes.  I felt engaged by the conflict, and wanted to see it resolved with great curiosity.  It's a great feeling when you slowly feel yourself sucked into a narritive, and Sakura Angels had my full attention.\n\nART:\n\nLook, when it comes to the anime art style in games, you either love it or you hate it.  I found that the art in this particular game had such vibrancy and emotion, that it embodied the characters they were reflecting.  Pictures of Sayaka were bright and almost always in motion, and pictures of Hikari were a bit duller, but her bright color palette represented her hidden softer side.  For a game with no existing explicit patch, the art felt more erotic than it should.  In fact, you're greeted with a full-on shot of Sayaka's rear in one scene.  The art felt carefully planned out in a sense.  Tenka never had large, over the top, \"anime\" reactions to seeing the girls half-naked, so the eroticism in the art felt a bit more subtle.  Even if you might not be the biggest fan of the anime-styled games, I'm sure there's a pic or two in the gallery that will make you smile or otherwise..\n\nMUSIC:\n\nThe soundtrack to Angels was par for the game itself.  Happy scene, bubbly music.  Serious scene, ominous music.  Fight scene, electric guitars.  The soundtrack wasn't so awful that I had to mute the music, but it was never good enough that I wished that there was a soundtrack available for it.  Mostly, it just faded into the background until I heard it switch.  I guess that could be considered a failure, but I digress.\n\nOVERALL EXPERIENCE:\n\nIt took me about 4 hours to complete the gallery in Sakura Angels.  Unlike Spirit, you have a choice of 3 endings.  You can choose to favor Sayaka, Hikari, or neither, and it changes your ending scenes.  The choices to decide whose route you are going to be on are sprinkled throughout, and all you need to do is pick enough choices (that's 3 out of 4) to favor one of the girls.  Pick an even distribution of choices for them, and you get the neutral ending.  I suppose the choices don't matter much, seeing as the ending is very brief, but I felt myself desiring to see how each of them played out and how they would affect the other character.  Unfortunately, there were a few other nitpicky things that bugged me as I did this.  The voice acting (which was a welcome addition) felt like it was recorded in someone's bedroom or garage.  Some scenes had so much echo, that it was impossible to ignore.  Also, when I would foward onto the next line of dialogue before the voices were complete, the sound would stutter, and I even experienced a crash while skipping some already-read dialogue.  I would like to attribute some of these failures to my computer, but it's unclear as to what caused it.  The voice acting...that's nothing that a better computer can fix.\n\nSo in conclusion, the four hours I poured into this game were full of smiles and laughs.  The plot seemed rigid enough that I didn't feel unsatisfied.  Even with the minor issues I had, the adventures of Tenka, Sayaka, and Hikari were a blast!  The game's writing really makes the experience enjoyable through the entire time.  Currently (As of October 27th, 2017), the game is on sale for 2.99 USD.  For just three dollars, you can dip your toes into this game, and hopefully get pulled in as much as I did.  I wouldn't recommend skipping this Sakura titie, if not for just the writing and dialogue alone!", "timestamp_created": 1509161095, "timestamp_updated": 1509161095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575516819953918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36025164": {"recommendationid": "36025164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335293655", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1508985594}, "language": "english", "review": "vry hawt gaem, meh pen15 went up", "timestamp_created": 1509055371, "timestamp_updated": 1509055383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545262277126312256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36011923": {"recommendationid": "36011923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088502572", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1513877827}, "language": "english", "review": "boobs", "timestamp_created": 1509021340, "timestamp_updated": 1509021340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687009990215301514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35993049": {"recommendationid": "35993049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402995855", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1506910794}, "language": "english", "review": "This one is all right...

Here, they don't contradict one another, and work together without feeling too forced. This is why I could find some enjoyment in this visual novel.\n\nLike the other times I have recommended visual novels, this is a condition-based thing.\n[b]Sakura Angels is all about giving you something you already love. If you don't like anime/manga or if you're just tired of seeing similar archetypes and tropes, this game isn't for you.[/b]\n\nBut if you are willing to revel in the classic tropes and clich\u00e9s, then there is  some fun to have here : some lines can genuinely trigger a laugh, and the addition of competent Japanese voice acting makes the characters way more enjoyable than those of silent visual novels. \n\nThe game is overall a big step up from the previous \"Sakura\" visual novel I have played : Sakura spirit. \n\nIn Sakura Angels, not only do we get those great voices, but the player now has way more choices than the singular one of the older game : even though the main story is pretty linear again, the player can at least chose some dialogue options now, and the ending will change a bit according to which girl you decided to give more attention to.\n\nI say \"giving attention\", because really, this visual novel isn't truly a dating simulation. It's more of a small fantasy story where you can lean towards a girl in the process. \nSakura Angels only has 2 girls you can truly interact with. This small number is both a problem and a quality. Less girls means the story is more focused : we don't get scenes that come out of nowhere so every girl can get the spotlight.\nThis can be a problem if you don't like either of the girls. But since the two girls are classic anime opposites (the \"tsundere\" and the \"genkiko\"), you should most likely lean naturally towards one.\n\nMy main complaint is the lack of character poses and illustrations when it comes to depicting the action scenes. Most of the magical spells are left entirely to your imagination, and you barely see the girls actually using their (classic but) kickass weapons. You only get text for all that.\n\nI am aware that visual novels are very small indie projects. And because we got the big improvement of having voiceover, I will not thumb down the game for that lack of \"event art\". Still, I truly wish the battles would have been given more pictures and effects. Especially the final, climactic one.\n\nSakura Angels is all about providing classic stuff at a cheap price. But sometimes this is what we want. It's up to you to see if you can enjoy again what you enjoyed before several times, despite the limitations of the medium and the budget. \n\n...And if you are part of the crowd who never enjoyed that kind of manga, just stay very far away from this.

"language": "english", "review": "First of the Sakura Visual Novel games I have played. And probably the worst Visual Novel I have played. While the worst from my perspective it does have a lot of good points! Just a few issues that really dragged this title down for me. \n\nUpdate: I've played three Sakura visual novels and this is THE WORST! (Changed to down vote as Winged Cloud have better titles and here are much better visual novels out there).\n\nThe score:\n\nStory          2.00/4.00\nArt              1.50/2.00\nAudio         0.75/1.00\nMechanics 2.00/2.00\nCharacters 0.50/1.00\n\nTotal ==     6.75/10.00\n\nThe issues:\n\n- Sayaka's voice actually hurts. The high pitch from some of her lines just make me cringe in pain\n\n- Extremely predictable!\n\n- Lack of branching paths that \"change\" the story. \n\n- It's a linear story with 3 different endings. However, the gallery images just don't feel worth it. (But it's good to see some form of branch)\n\n- Fight scenes felt pretty poor. I'd rather just see some art pieces showing our angels fight the villian. (This some what does fix itself later into the game).\n\n- Story dies out over time to the point where I got bored and I wanted the game to just end.\n\nThe Good! :D\n\n- Art style is excellent for both characters and backgrounds.\n\n- \"Particular\" images show our beautiful angels in multiple forms of clothing and poses. As expected for a Sakura game.\n\n- Good to see some differet endings. Although, still a linear story.\n\n- The User Interface (UI) is absolutely wonderful! Excellent Graphical UI (GUI) layout. Smooth interface. Lots of save allocations. Perfect for speed readers, slower paced readers and readers following the character's audio.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI cannot recommend this for multiple replays. I found myself feeling tortured when closing towards the ending. I am rather dissapointed with this game.\n\nHowever! This game gets a positive review from myself because it passes the line. It's not terrible. It functions and has content.

I'm a fan of anime, I used to enjoy the harem genre, but became disillusioned by it once the genre began to suffer from \"Pok\u00e9mon Protagonist Pity\", i.e., the protagonist is just such a dumb and dense shit that never learns anything from the ridiculous experiences and obvious tells of unwarranted affection from multitudes of females and/or other side characters.

Yes, there's an end-state, but I don't sit there and say \"Damn, that was an end-state\", I instead say, \"Did I seriously just click 450 times to be told that shit and get like 8 erotic images, I can get better erotic images without even having to click anymore with Google Assist\", I'm not saying the conclusion was bad, it's exactly what I was expecting: uninteresting, just like this genre.\nThanks for reading and God bless.", "timestamp_created": 1491196423, "timestamp_updated": 1491279209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.357672244310379028", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30914051": {"recommendationid": "30914051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2378, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1491184192}, "language": "english", "review": "This visual novel is an interesting short story.

These two would have to be the reason I ended enjoying the game as much as did for the charming behaivor and compelling apperances. Their personalities are quite opposite, one being reserved and serious while the other is very buoyant and enjoys having a laugh though I still grew attached to them fairly equally. However, I ended up having slighty more of a liking to one of them but that isn't because the other girl was bothering, it's just a personal preference. \n\nThe art is quite impressive and your companions are quite satisfying to gaze upon. The style of the art does get sexually suggestive at times but it just varies in subtlety and obviousness, but hey, I cant complain.\n\nThe dialogue is enjoyable to read and can be humorous at times, especially during the banter between your two companions.

Si quieres ahorrarte el analisis completo pasa a la ultima parte donde doy mis conclusiones\n\nEl principal problema que tuve con este juego es que simplemente es demasiado promedio, es como cualquier otra novela visual que hayas visto. Con completa sinceridad digo esto, en cuanto se presentaron todos los personajes predije como se desarrollaria la historia. Chicas magicas que protegen al protagonista de otra chica magica que es a su vez sirviente de el verdadero antagonista que es malo porque simplemente es malo y quiere matar al protagonista porque es el elegido o algo asi. Y eso fue lo que obtuve.\n\n1.- Duracion: es un juego increiblemente corto. Yo lo pude terminar en dos horas y si le das a la opcion de skip, dejandote solo elegir las opciones puedes terminar el juego en menos de 10 minutos.\n2.- Personajes: crei que los personajes serian cliche y si bien esto es verdad en el caso de Kenta y Hikari (no mientan, ellos dos son el protagonista de cualquier anime harem y Hikari es cualquier otra chica tsundere) realmente me sorprendi con Sayaka, la cual en mi opinion es lo mejor de todo el juego. Mientras que el personaje de ambas era en su mayoria fanservice, Sayaka de hecho tenia una personalidad interesante y divertida a tal punto que siempre me sacaba una sonrisa y seguramente a muchos otros tambien. Debo decir que los disenos de Sayaka (en general) y de Yuzuki (forma chica magica) me gustaron, no por la cantidad de piel que muestren ni que tan desproporcionadamente grandes sean sus senos (chicos, tengan criterio, si un personaje muestra una excesiva cantidad de piel esta casi asegurado que no le daran importancia a su personalidad o historia, como fue el caso con Hikari en cuanto a personalidad y Yuzuki en historia). \n3.- Historia: ... Predecible, demasiado predecible. Honestamente quien no haya adivinado de que trataria no tiene analisis critico en absoluto o simplemente no conoce los cliches mas usados en novelas visuales. Otra cosa que agregar es que las elecciones que hagas no afectan en nada el desarrollo de la historia, unicamente te dan miniconversaciones diferentes tras cada eleccion y obviamente con quien te quedas en el final pero para ser honesto no los considero finales, no inicias una relacion con nadie, la historia termina igual y lo unico diferente repito son las conversaciones. Ahora siendo realistas, a alguien en serio le importa la historia en este juego?\n4.- Banda sonora: Es basicamente la misma de cualquier otra novela visual, nada especial pero quiza te aburras de prisa considerando que es la misma musica usada en diferentes secciones. Creo que solo son 3 pistas en todo el juego pero afortunadamente no te hacen querer asesinar un perrito ni apagar el sonido y ya sea que apagues la musica o no sera lo mismo en tu experiencia de todas maneras\n5.- Escenarios: de nuevo, lo mismo que cualquier otra novela visual. Cuarto del protagonista, comedor, escuela, playa, bosque. Estan mas vacios que el corazon de Electronic Arts (aceptenlo, son el diablo) y no hay nada de especial en ninguno de ellos. El unico que me llamo la atencion fue el de la playa y no porque fuera particularmente hermoso o llamativo sino por los efectos. Fuera de eso no hay nada mas que agregar.\n6.- Reparto: En general las voces me parecieron adecuadas para cada personaje pero hubo una que resalto de las demas en mi opinion, la de Yuzuki. Su voz me parecio perfecta, hasta llegaria a decir que hermosa y era capaz de representar cada emocion que sentia a la perfeccion. La voz de Sayaka simplemente sonaba alegre siempre y Hikari era la de cualquier tsundere.\n7.- Comparacion: si lo comparamos con otros juegos de la misma serie, Sakura, hay mejoras pero unicamente en el aspecto de la cantidad de opciones que puedes tomar pero tampoco es como que sea un milagro que salve el juego del poco contenido que tiene ni tampoco es que sea un cambio grande.\n\nCONCLUSION\nPensaran que odio al juego con todo esto y la verdad es que... no realmente. No me malentiendan, el juego es demasiado corto y esto no es necesariamente algo malo pues hay otros juegos cortos que he disfrutado bastante pero en este caso hay tan poco contenido que no se le puede dejar pasar. En mi opinion la mejor palabra para describirlo es PROMEDIO. \n\nNada grandioso ni nada horrible, no presenta nada nuevo en ningun aspecto y tampoco se besa el culo a si mismo como juegos mediocres que se creen el proximo Fate. No creo que se merezca toda la mierda que le lanzan pero si entiendo porque algunos odiarian el juego con su falta de contenido y una vez mas, lo promedio que es. Pero creo que no lo ven de esta manera: si no lo disfrutaste es porque simplemente no estaba hecho para ti. Si con solo leer de que trata y las imagenes del juego no te pudiste dar una idea de como seria entonces entiendo tu decepcion, pero si lograste deducir como seria y aun asi lo jugaste entonces no puedes quejarte pues la culpa es completamente tuya. El juego es obviamente para pervertidos que quieren un fap rapido y para nadie mas. Si esperabas encontrar una buena historia o personajes interesantes buscaste en el lugar equivocado. \n\nPara pasar el rato esta bien, sera cliche pero tiene todo lo que a los pervertidos les gusta y quien sabe, quiza te saque una que otra sonrisa pero a no ser que lo veas en un SUPER DESCUENTO no recomiendo que lo compres, con su corta duracion seria lo mismo que quemar tu dinero. Si lo compras a su precio completo o a mas de $20 quiere decir que en serio deseabas ver algo para tu fap diario y solo puedo decir... viejo, para algo existe el porno. \n\nCALIFICACION FINAL: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1476931451, "timestamp_updated": 1476931451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487387806177139282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26093065": {"recommendationid": "26093065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248593146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1485122414}, "language": "english", "review": "hey, pretty good", "timestamp_created": 1476740712, "timestamp_updated": 1476740712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484278678894042969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26087040": {"recommendationid": "26087040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098405417", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1476675022}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely not worth 10 bucks.

Yes, it has pictures and Text, yes you can choose some things from time to rime (very little) and yes you can reach multiple endings. 3, to be correct. Girl 1, Girl 2 or neither, if i remember correctly. The choices are very obvious, you will favour either one or the other with it. \n\nThe Visuals are okay, except for the point of the characters.

Not enjoyable at all. \n\nThe story as [i]very very very very[/i] generic, to the point that you could tell exactly what would happen when.

Otherwise your a coward and your helpfulness rating does not count.\n\nI bought this game for $5. Now, you may be thinking 50% off is a good deal for this game right? Wrong. This game being a visual novel has absolutly 0 replayability value. The choices you make are not story changing at all, unless you want to pick a different girl route. There are plenty of other games on the steam market for $5 that is much more worth your money. Completing the game takes about 2-3 hours. Buying the game for $10 is getting ripped off. If you are looking for a good visual novel with replayability value, DO NOT BUY THIS.\n\nThe story is pretty standard. There is a lonely protaganist that somehow meets two girls and screws around with them. Then at the very end they need to complete a quest which is barely mentioned throughout the first and middle parts of the story. All of the girls are forgetable, and the story is nothing special. Most sakura games follow this same route.\n\nNow, you must be wondering: what are the pros for this game/story? The only thing I will give them is great character/art design. Other than that, none. Unless you like looking at girls with extremely overexagerated chest sizes this is a complete waste of time.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nThe value of this game is very low. Story is bland, completly overpriced, and if you are going to buy this game grab it off some shady ass site like g2a where it goes for 1 dollar.

Music wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything memorable or catchy either. Visuals were pretty nice, but this is just another ecchi GAL game after all. Finally, the story wasn't very well thought out and was extremely short. Don't let my playtime deceive you, I just wanted the trading cards.

Does not have full frontal nudity, mostly tastefully covered up naughty bits, but has some nudity from behind. Has Ecchi and fanservice stylings.  No patch needed, the artwork is as is.  Good for a few hours of reading.\n\nGet it with the Sakura bundle, when on sale.  Could be worth sale price, if you really like visual anime novels, but not the hentai kind.

Wait let me reprahse that. This is not a game nor will it ever be. \nI don't understand how this genre of video game is so popular. The basics to this game is to read text and click then read more text. After you read 1 chapter of text you stumble across a choose your own path thingy. *Click to fight* or *Click to run* (That basicly sums up the choose your own adventure part) This game is nothing but a cash grab at anime girls with big boobs that's all.

After I finish a Visual Novel I will say a few things I liked about it here on my profile. Angels had an alright story that was pretty simple but not simple enough to be boring. It was around a 5 hour long story atleast at the pace I read so it was long enough where th emoney was worth it. The story was good and your two angels Sakara and Hikari were both interesting characters that both were easily lovable. There were few choices that either leaned towards one angel or the other and at the end it determined what angel ended up truely liking you more then just a friend. Though that didn't make a huge difference for replayability the first time around you will notice your choices effected the ending a little. Things I did not like about it was how it ended when I thought they could of still continued it and the main character Kenta was not likable at all. When I play Visual Novels the aspects i want the most is a main protagonist I can really love and remember and a emotional ending which this game had niether.

Why, you ask? It did not give me what I had expected; what was advertized. To be clear: I know it was a visual novel and I liked the first one a lot. In this one, it brings more choices, dialogue, a voice acting patch, likeable characters and nice music. Plus the artstyle is still great.\n\nSo why do I struggle to give it a passing score then? It is Sakura ANGELS. The developer is WINGED Cloud. The advertized CG/Cover of this game shows a devlisih girl (Yuzuki)/fallen angel, with WINGS. But sadly... those are all the wings you're going to get. Sakura Spirit got the foxgirls right. I expected angels with actual wings. [spoiler]The story even mentions their wings multiple times.[/spoiler]\n\nI was throughly disappointed by the fact that the only wings in this game, as in CG with wings, are present on 1 shot only, that also happens to be the exact same one as the one that advertizes the game on Steam. I was waiting for it.... waiting for it... waiting for it.... but they never came. And that really, REALLY disappointed me. No wings, no angels. At first I thought was just teasing, but it was not so.\n\nAlso, please don't mind my playtime. I watched the whole thing on Youtube before, but wanted to buy it for the VA. And because I was going to buy the bundle anyway.I quickly skipped through it again to see if I had missed CG's with wings, but no. They're nowhere to be found, aside from the only one everyone already sees when they buy the game.\n\nSo after this rant, will I give it my thumbs up? No. They simply did not live up to my expectations and the wings even being mentioned in the story, but not being present as CG is a big - f u, dear reader! -  in my book. I like these Visual Novels and I like the company, but my point is pretty clear, I think.\n\nDo with this as you will.

What a wild ride it was.[/h1]\n\n[b]Have a little background information about my experience[/b]\nSakura Spirit was the opening game in the Sakura series, and amidst the endless tide of reviews containing \"Hurr durr breasts\", there were some actual positive reviews. So when the Visual Novel (V/N) went on sale, I bought it, installed it and fifteen minutes later I'd finished, honestly wishing there was more to it. Sakura Spirit was a genuinely, surprisingly, enjoyable intro to a full length V/N that could have been. \n\nThe setting was alright, more than half the cast were quite good. Hell, even the boring humans weren't completely shit. And there was that hot demon goddess lady who didn't do much but was interesting enough for me to want to see more of her. Both literally and figuratively.\n\nSo, the bar being set fairly high for the Sakura Series, with it's nice art and decent characters, I was looking forward to the rest.\n\n[b]So, Sakura Angels is good then, right?[/b]\nNO, SAKURA ANGELS IS BAD.\n\nNot good, in any way. Hell, not even the usually above par (which admittedly isn't a very high par for anime style art) artwork. Some scenes draw characters a little weirdly, usually the faces are strange and the heads are huge. To the art's credit, that Sayaka picture is pretty nice. You know the one. \n\nI can only assume all the good character designers have long since been fired from the Sakura Dev Group, because nary a single character in this has any interest or depth to them. Sayaka's energetic, mischevious character is entirely ruined by the protagonist being a fucking idiot. \n\nHisaki (The other main girl) started out alright, but has almost 0 character progression what-so-ever, and what little progression she has is hidden in her specific ending, in which she smiles more than once ever. Not only is she a really mediocre tsundere at best, what little of interest she has is further ruined by the protagonist being a fucking idiot. \n\nThen there's the Third Girl, Yuzuki, whom I can only imagine was an after thought. She is potentially the most interesting, and not only because the other candidates set the bar so low. THEN SHE GOES AND RUINS HERSELF BY BEING \"I'M SHIT AT LIFE AND CAN'T MAKE FRIENDS I HAVE SUCH A DEEP CHARACTER FEEL BAD FOR ME AS THE APPARENT ANTAGONIST\". To Yuzuki's credit, she is the only character that isn't further ruined by the protagonist being a fucking idiot, since she does all the work herself.\n\nHave I mentioned the protagonist? If I haven't, he's indescribably stupid, but if I had to try, I'd call him a fucking idiot in the most venomous way possible. He's the most rubbish, generic, bland player insert character I've seen in quite some time, and I've seen alot of V/Ns, both good and bad. One of the options seems to give him an anyeurism, as he completely forgets both the question he was asked a second ago, and the scene that is still presently unfolding before him. He's a fucking idiot.\n\nThe protagonist, however, sums up the V/N quite nicely; Sakura Angels is a dissapointing mess of many generic V/N traits and characters, and it certainly shows. These traits, of course, extend from manga and anna may, but the particular nuances of Sakura Angels are [i]very[/i] boring, generic V/N.\n\n[b]Enough of the characters, what else?[/b]\nThe entire thing sets itself up to last a while, then comes to a grinding halt about an hour and a half in because the plot realises it hasn't got anything past intro. Antagonist explanation and dramatic ending are crowbarred in, the resulting mess ending in less than a week, story time. \n\nIf you've picked one of the girls more than the other one, our fucking idiot prot will sort of declare his love for them (sort of), then they live happily ever after. \n\nIf I need to point out that knowing your two stalkers and completely falling for them, stating that they've completely changed your life in unprecedented ways, all in less than four days, is completely stupid, then this story is probably for you, because you're equally as stupid as the whole ordeal. \n\nI'm fine with a bit of romance and taking a fancy to someone, but four whole days is not enough to base so much drama on. He should be barely friends with these people, let alone care for them so much.\n\n[b]So yeah.[/b]\nI was dissapointed by Sakura Angels. After setting the bar so surprisingly high with Sakura Spirit, Sakura Angels fails to live up to be an even acceptable V/N, let alone a good one. \n\nIt's a shame. Really, it is. I know people will look at this review and think \"Haha, what an idiot, it's a game about Boob Girls being Boob Girls.\". To an extent, this is true, but I want everything to be the best it can possibly be, especially things I've had experience enjoying, and the Sakura Series is no exception to this.\n\n[b]Also[/b]\nThey got Kurumi from Date A Live to voice Hisaki. Date A Live is my favourite anime, and I like Kurumi, but hearing her voice come through Hisaki's mouth weirded me out a bit, and ruined what little of worth the character had left. One can only assume that the Voice Actress read the script and saw it for the rubbish it was, putting at little effort in as she could get away with. \n\nThis isn't a bash at Kurumi, by the way, her voice is fine, it's more me associating the voice with someone else.", "timestamp_created": 1466527613, "timestamp_updated": 1466536119, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662084341049194336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23678850": {"recommendationid": "23678850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061579928", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1465493861}, "language": "english", "review": "Gotta love this fan service treat!", "timestamp_created": 1466474997, "timestamp_updated": 1466474997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23665708": {"recommendationid": "23665708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046767213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1466445233}, "language": "english", "review": "it wasn't til the near end i realized they spoke a different language.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466413251, "timestamp_updated": 1466413251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612987935543060303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23625487": {"recommendationid": "23625487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061486204", "num_games_owned": 665, "num_reviews": 273, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 939, "last_played": 1684295186}, "language": "spanish", "review": "delicia de novela visual los fondos emoticones demaciado kawai ami gusto lastima que no halla parche anticensura pero bueno no lo quita lo bueno del juego con este seria el tercer juego que llevo en la saga de sakura\n\nEDITO las vocez estan desentes me supongo que tanbiem tendran para el sakura spirit y demas solo en el caso de los sakura beach no tiene", "timestamp_created": 1466220795, "timestamp_updated": 1466278227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23453404": {"recommendationid": "23453404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166245512", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1465397371}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the artwork of the Winged Cloud team... but the Nudity and Mature tag did not had any purpose after all :((\n\nArtwork: Infinite/10\nMusic: 8/10\nStory: 5/10\nNudity: 0/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nOverall (Assuming art is 10): 6/10 \n\nUnless you came here knowing fully this game is just a \"fan service\" sort of game, then I can not recommend this game to you. :(", "timestamp_created": 1465399689, "timestamp_updated": 1465399689, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49614831805229187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23451133": {"recommendationid": "23451133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132131858", "num_games_owned": 583, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1468446244}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Why use P-0-r-n-H-u-b Premium when you can save up money for this amazing game?

If this game only took an hour to play it would still be an hour too much of such awful writing.\n\nThe story is a mass of tired cliches that do nothing to help that the text itself is over-wordy, repetitive drivel and the characters are worn-out tropes. The writer needs to seriously improve their skills.\n\nWithout some kind of story, and engaging text to give it some context, the artwork has no special value over any picture of breasts you might find. This isn't really a game, and the bad writing gets in the way and makes it worthless as as novel. \n\nThe English-language PC implementation is shaky too. The text runs off the bottom of the screen and goes over the top of the menu text items - a lot. Maybe it's a font problem, but Sakura Spirits doesn't have the same problem. And Japanese voice acting? It's probably the least bad part of the game, but I can't understand a word of it so... It doesn't make the bad writing go away. \n\nAs for porn?

The game tells the story of the protagonist, Kenta, a male high-school student suffering from headaches who one day encounters something dangerous and otherworldly, and is protected by two young angelic body guards, Sayaka and Hikari.\n\nThe setting is fairly familiar, seeming like countless other animes, mangas, and visual novels, but the story is well told and the characters are likeable. A couple of gratuitous panty shots give the game a slightly guilty feel, and add the 'mature' and 'nudity' tags to the Steam page, but really it's all harmless enough, and suprisingly fun.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe sets are nicely drawn, although I was a bit disappointed with how much they were repeated. One street scene, for example, looks the same on a fine sunny day as it does on a day on which the characters are complaining about how much it is raining.\n\nThe character graphics and occasional risque gallery shots of the three main female characters are all very nicely drawn and suitably attractive. Small animations add to the life of the characters, as do the character graphic overlays moving around the screen to follow the action as described in some scenes. Very nice!\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe music is relatively atmospheric and suits the story well.\n\nThe three main female characters all have nice Japanese voiceovers. Not being able to understand anything more than rudimentary spoken Japanese, I can't vouch for the accuracy, but they sounded okay to me.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nSakura Angels plays like any other visual novel. You read some text, click for the next paragraph, and look at the pretty pictures, occasionally making choices as the story presents them.\n\nUnfortunately there's only really a small number of decisions that affect which ending you see, and even then you can't really 'lose' (there is no bad ending), but the game includes a useful 'skip' feature that allows you to rapidly move over areas of the story that you've already seen on previous playthroughs, making it only a small effort to go back and try the different options for that one important decision.\n\nThe story is fairly typical of the genre, but the writing is excellent for the most part; I only saw a handful of typos throughout. The story itself isn't really 'mature-themed'; it's only the inclusion of some fairly mild gallery shots that makes this Steam tag appropriate.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\n\nPros:\n+ Sayaka and Hikari are great fun\n+ very nice art, particularly the characters\n+ Japanese voices\n+ trading cards\n+ great writing quality\n\nCons:\n- a bit short; I completed it in just over two hours, then spent another hour or so going back to see the other choices and what differences they made\n- no achievements; these could have been easily included and mapped to each gallery shot, as a nice addition to the game\n- the protagonist is a bit of a putz; I wanted to give him a slap in a few places in the story\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nSakura Angels is a good, fun anime visual novel. It's the first of developer Winged Cloud's visual novels that I've played so far, and I enjoyed it. I only wish it were a bit longer.\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1461100141, "timestamp_updated": 1461100175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495477557182312012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22521338": {"recommendationid": "22521338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037113595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1474147485}, "language": "english", "review": "Not my proudest fap", "timestamp_created": 1461093417, "timestamp_updated": 1461093417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53544008731842041", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22515952": {"recommendationid": "22515952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133707056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1478550408}, "language": "english", "review": "Most characters have two solid reasons why this game was meant to be played with only one hand.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1461074302, "timestamp_updated": 1461074302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22466997": {"recommendationid": "22466997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177288205", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1460864844}, "language": "english", "review": "Switch the tab simulator 2016", "timestamp_created": 1460858588, "timestamp_updated": 1460858588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499531686305999756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22344681": {"recommendationid": "22344681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025640353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 217, "last_played": 1460312287}, "language": "english", "review": "Boob Simulator", "timestamp_created": 1460312561, "timestamp_updated": 1460312561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22325404": {"recommendationid": "22325404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118095881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1460230598}, "language": "english", "review": "def not worth the money...", "timestamp_created": 1460230686, "timestamp_updated": 1460230686, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474875569343566895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22245625": {"recommendationid": "22245625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014987700", "num_games_owned": 1630, "num_reviews": 139, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1481369432}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're into VN's for boobs and near nudity, this is for you.

"review": "I want it to be noted up front that I do NOT recommend this as a GAME. I think that's important to keep in mind when looking at reviews on a gaming platform to realize that a visual novel is not a game. I'd also like to note that this review may contain minor spoilers on some of the general trends of the game, but I will do my best to avoid specifics for prospective buyers. I also turned off the music and sound effects, so I can't comment on those aspects either. With all of that in mind, please enjoy the rest of the review.\n\nThis is a visual novel, which means that explaining the story too much is going to outright spoil it. The basic plot is that you essentially are taking the perspective and role of the main character, Kenta, which I believe is still in high school but don't quote me on that detail as it could be later education. Anyways, he has been having intense headaches and sleeping horribly without understanding why. That is, until one day on the streets coming home from school when his intense headache is swiftly followed by an attack by a supernatural creature! Just when things are looking most grim, he is saved by a couple more supernatural beings. He finds himself in the hands of two guardian girls with magical powers that are tasked with protecting him from these evil creatures. Who are the creatures? Who are these two mysterious girls? What could all of this mean? Well, you'll have to find out for yourself.\n\nI think it's important to explain why I DO recommend this title. The story is alright. I didn't find it to be anything spectacular, but it functions just fine. The various options and multiple pages open for saves are very convenient for managing your experience to your liking. Plus, there's even a skip function. This is helpful for replaying the game so that you can quickly skip over parts you've already experienced in order to get to the new parts faster. This is because you can actually make a few choices in the game that will effect the following events and ending. So using the skip function to test out different paths in the game is highly useful. There are some reused images for the characters and backgrounds, but every so often you'll be rewarded with a custom drawn image. This is where most of my enjoyment of the game comes from. I think the two main girls are very pretty. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the people looking at this game are looking at it for the promise of hot anime girls. I can say that it delivers. There are three attractive cartoon women to look at, with a few expressions, outfits, and custom pictures. All of the custom pictures can be found later in the gallery so you won't need to play through again just to see them. So, as the general fapping tool that it tries to market itself as, it works just fine. And hey, I even found myself getting somewhat invested in a couple of the characters.\n\nHowever, let's address the shortcomings here. Again, the large selling point of sex appeal can't exactly be ignored. While it does work for some one-handed fun, I do think it could be a little lacking for most. There are mainly two girls you see the whole time. You see some of the third, but not nearly as much. Each one has a standard pose they're always in, with sometimes altering their poses slightly, changing their facial expressions, and a few costume changes. And, of course, they have their few custom pictures. This isn't bad, but I think there could've been some more variety, especially with the limited number of girls to gawk at. Plus, there's always the possiblity that you won't find any combination of the three attractive. Even finding just one unattractive takes a huge hit to that main selling point. I guess it's probably pretty shallow and harsh to judge such a thing, but I think it's very fair considering a large portion of the audience will be here for the obviously intended sex appeal. I do have to give it a little credit, though. Unlike Sakura Spirit, the characters feel a little more realistic in their actions and reactions rather then it being about tons of inuendos constantly being stamped out by an unbelievably decent protagonist. This time around you can at least feel that the girls are more restrained and the protagonist more human. It makes the title feel a lot more natural and compelling. I guess that's the trade-off, which may be a turn off to some.\n\nI also took some issue with the in-game choices. I think the feature is nice and has some interesting results, but it feels out of place. You aren't really the main character here. The main character is Kenta, and he seems to have his own personality. You're just in his perspective. So when you make choices for him, it feels almost out of character. So either the story should've been more static and true to his character, or more open with choices and allowed you to be the main character instead. \n\nThis next part gets a bit spoilery but stay with me if you're not too afraid, otherwise skip to the next section.\n\nI also found that the three routes you can go weren't all satisfying. I think the best route is the neutral route where you don't have a preference for either of the main girls. The ending feels a lot more like the start of the game, wrapping it all up in a nice, familiar bow. I enjoyed the Hikari ending the most because I got the most attached to her. I felt like she was hard to get close to, but that she appreciates that relationship the most and it just felt so natural to want her. And the events that play out as a result all feel very natural. When I played it over again favoring Sayaka I felt bad. She seems so light and happy, but she has trouble listening to me half the time and it made Hikari seem a lot more lonely, jealous, and mean. It seems like Sayaka could make herself happy with or without me so it didn't feel like my feelings were mutual. Plus, she teasingly torments Hikari a lot, which seemed playful in the Hikari route but just plain mean in the Sayaka route. I also thought that having a Yuzuki route would've been nice. She seemed to have such a compelling backstory that I could've found myself feeling for her, but the game didn't offer that as an option. Her destiny is set in stone regardless of what you do, which is a real shame.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of all is just that this game ends with a lot of new questions and old questions unanswered. We still barely know much of anything about these magical beings. We don't know what will happen to the characters next. We barey started learning about Yuzuki. Whatever relationship you pick seems to lead to very little in the end aside from future possibilities. The main plot is resolved, but the end isn't necessarily satisfying. And I really was hoping for a kiss from Hikari... sigh. I guess we'll just have to cry for a sequel and hope it happens.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Sure, it's by no means a game. It's a bit lacking in a few areas. It's not amazing. I recommend it because... well... not only did I have a fun time with it, and I know you know what I mean, but I also found myself caring about Hikari, a fictional character. Maybe that says more about me than it does this title, but it's something worth experiencing for yourself, regardless of who you get attached to. It's probably not worth the full ten bucks for most people, but get it on sale. Especially if you like the Sakura series in general. Besides, sometimes it's fun to give your fapping a little context.\nhttps://youtu.be/qkfSx740OzY", "timestamp_created": 1457532982, "timestamp_updated": 1581735377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618461728096008301", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21538303": {"recommendationid": "21538303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119716966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1487391591}, "language": "english", "review": "To: Fellow Perverts everywhere\n\nAhem, let me explain this game\n\nboobs, boobs, boobs, butt, more boobs, more buts, tentalces, slime, and yes, belive it or not, BOOBS.\n\nThis game is awsome, not only is it a normal visual novel that has plot...i'll let you decide which kind i'm talking about, this game has choices like all the other sakura games, and 3 diffrent endings. This game (sadly) does NOT have a hentai patch, so sorry about that. It is the second in its franchise and is the only one with voices (for now). It has steam cards, no achivments and much material to make your night... special? Loved it, if you can't buy the game, watch it. This has no news for a sequal but since they went as far to put voices in it they may think it's special enough for one, I mean it's not to far streached, another one of there games is getting a sequal.

It is another production by Winged Cloud, who have released several VNs with a similar aesthetic theme.\n\nThe storyline is not going to win any prizes for originality or scope; however, it is sufficient enough to drive the novel from start to finish. There aren't really any emotional investments made into the story, nor are there any distinct moral or philosophical undertones apparent; however, that does not detract from the experience, because the game does not necessarily try to construct a pretentious plot or theme. Instead, it is focused on providing a cute, entertaining experience for the reader, and in that regard it succeeds. There are some choices made in the game, but as far as I can tell they don't really have too much of an impact on the final story. The characters are not deep, but that doesn't detract from the story; I still found the characters to be entertaining and loveable.\n\nThe artwork is quite nice. The protagonist's guardian angels are both cute and well dressed, being presented in several different outfits over the course of the novel. The background images themselves are also pleasing. The artwork of the monsters, however, leaves a little to be desired, although the antagonist is sufficiently well presented in her own right. One aspect of the story I wish was more presented is combat; there is no real effort made on screen to make the characters appear to be engaged. The erotic artwork also borders on the rediculous; then again, there is probably a significant clientele that is looking for such an exposure in this game, so I don't hold it against the novel. Nonetheless, I was pleased with the quality of the artwork and find it to be beautiful and enjoyable to see.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the music as well. While you may not experience such music as John Williams or Hanz Zimmer, the novel has an engaging and pleasing soundtrack that fits well with the game. The only complaint in this regard is that some of the music during combat scenes was not used to its full potential.\n\nThe novel's length is short -- about two hours or so. I am, however, a very quick reader, so your own experience may be closer to three hours or more.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this visual novel as long as you know what to expect from it. While it may not be a masterpiece of the visual novel genre, you will be entertained for several hours. I guess if you are into the erotic aspect of it, that is an added bonus too; however, my recommendation doesn't require that you desire that part of the novel in order to enjoy it. I didn't buy it for its near-nudity, and still enjoyed it; nonetheless, with its price point at $10, I would advise waiting until it goes on sale before making the purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1454117436, "timestamp_updated": 1454117529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773673653602600098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20818633": {"recommendationid": "20818633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180051918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1454039064}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though i reccomend it i dont think this is money worthy, there are way better visual novels out there! but eh, atleast i can say that it wasnt a complete loss?", "timestamp_created": 1454039173, "timestamp_updated": 1454039173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20809726": {"recommendationid": "20809726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125504128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1590261482}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1454005963, "timestamp_updated": 1454005963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494391947984695435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20781182": {"recommendationid": "20781182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074634016", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1455691430}, "language": "english", "review": "Aye, I bought this game because...

After the absolute bunk that Sakura Swim Club was, my initial plan was (unless it's, specifically, a Sakura Fantasy title) to never touch another Winged Cloud product again...but, it turns out that I had bought this thing on a sale at some point.\n\nSo, I'll address the pros first, as few as they are. To be perfectly fair, it's an improvement. Maybe, it's the fact that they couldn't try to excuse abysmal writing and terrible production value with nudity, but... Whatever the case, it's a step in the right direction. A small and shaky step made by a drunk dog onto the surface of a recently frozen lake, but a step forward, at least. \n\nNow that credit given where it's due, I still have to say that it's not enough to justify a recommendation. \nThe writing, while certainly a step up over Swim Club, does a passable job of building things up...just in time to wrap everything up in what I can only describe as a premature ejaculation. Everything having been transfered to the \"being up and resolved\" train, having forgotten \"pacing\" and \"flow\" at the station.\nThe music is better, though hardly anything notable. \nThe art...well...it worked the first time around, until I realized that the character models are, quite literally, being recycled through every game. \n\nIn short, Winged Cloud, keep trying with these side projects. Maybe, one day, you'll work up to having your products be on par with something like what a studio like Frontwing can produce. \n\nP.S. Where the hell is Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2?

The graphics, limited voice acting, and music are the only redeeming qualities of this \"game\".\n\nOverall the story of Sakura Angels is mediocre.

Most of the other characters are so incredibly one-dimensional and function more as props than full-blown characters.\n\nI might buy this for half the given price as a distraction and to have the music and screenshots.

Sakura Angels isn't breaking records. It's fun to imagine what is actually happening animation style in your head. The cute Japanese voices definitely help give you a good image on how the characters would walk, move, interact and the like. The CG is beautiful. And the writing gets you giggling. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, and why should it? I'm not going to give any spoilers, but these girls definitely aren't culinary masters.\n\nAnd now for me to complain a bit - Why is the CG so disconnected from the writing? It's a visual novel, if you're going to put the protagonist in particular situations, why not draw it? Yes, our imaginations are the ones that need to work here. But black screens would have been enough if you wanted that. There are so many points in the story where I really wanted to see what was happening. It's a visual novel, so let me see what I'm reading! Not to mention how many unanswered questions I have...\n\nThat aside, I'm glad I picked this up at the five dollar price. I can say that the tease is only worth that much. But pick it up if you can, because it's a mighty good tease, and there's going to be more, so support the artists and creators so that they can support us, and give us more of what we need. A deeper story with more characters (wouldn't mind seeing some male characters for diversity. There needs to be something there to make the story more intersting!) More CG to depict the various parts of the story (Be a visual novel more) and perhaps be clear with your aim for the choices. If they could branch more and allow the story to take different directions, that'd make the story fun to play multiple times.

how much of an improvement this was. The story was much more interesting, the characters were more interesting, the MC was actually likeable, I actually felt myself caring for everyone in the story. This was soo much better than Spirit was, you could tell that they learned from the mistakes they had previously made. With Spirit it seemed like they were just adding filler story to get to the lewd pictures but with this one it really seemed like they focused much more on the actual story. There are quite a few more choices in this one too and they affect the story a lot more than the one choice in Spirit did. The music was also better and more varied. I was so into the story I kinda just glossed over the \"nudity\" bits [which again like Spirit aren't actually nude bits]. I really enjoyed this and will probably play through it again to see how the other choices affect the story.\n\nAnd yes, I understand I'm probably one of the very few people who actually took this game seriously. lol\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSakura Spirit Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonvytube/recommended/313740/", "timestamp_created": 1435686224, "timestamp_updated": 1435686891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16811337": {"recommendationid": "16811337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019051923", "num_games_owned": 1818, "num_reviews": 118, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484939769}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una novela grafica muy controversial ya que va para un publico adulto, si bien no tiene lengiaje vulgar pues si podras ver imagenes un poco fuertes (todas son censura \u00ac\u00ac), la historia es entretenida pero me parece que muy corta, te la recomiendo pero siempre y cuando este en oferta.\n\nSolid Snake", "timestamp_created": 1435681607, "timestamp_updated": 1435681607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16782302": {"recommendationid": "16782302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083412390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 29213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1918, "last_played": 1536112109}, "language": "english", "review": "ples", "timestamp_created": 1435595204, "timestamp_updated": 1435595204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525549590587615967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16768209": {"recommendationid": "16768209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036760849", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1439131186}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend performed tiring exercise while I screen shared on skype", "timestamp_created": 1435525414, "timestamp_updated": 1435525414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594092309474945068", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16762937": {"recommendationid": "16762937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092968018", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1435545685}, "language": "english", "review": "The two main characters, Sayaka and Hikari, should be on a comedy routine.

Let's get started I guess. Take note, where I might be saying some aspect is bad in an aspect of the game, I did not mostly take into account everything else. I was looking at each aspect individually.\n\nStory - 5/10\nThe \"Plot\" wasn't good. Really. There were a couple of cringy moments at the start of the novel that made me want to drop it instantly. For example, the overuse of the Protaganist thoughts during times like when they first met Yuzuki was really cringy and uneeded. The only reason I stayed was for the so called \"romantic\" choices with Sayaka or Hikari, and storyteller really butchered it. (I wanted a kiss scene. Why. ;~;)\n\nMost romance/(insert any genre here) has to have a kiss scene or at least something really... (kawaii? Moe?) to make up for it at the end or any kind of build up. Not to mention that the romance build up between Hikari and the MC, since I only played her route, not too keen on doing Sayaka's since I don't like her character (N-Not that I like Tsunderes okay! There wasn't any Dandere/Kuuderes...) was really bad...  \n\nI mean, all you did was talk to her on the roof, even thought it wasnt much, then waltz in on her in bathroom and what, chose her over Sayaka at the beach? Theres wasnt much buildup to make her go all \"caring\" after you, and even throw away her so-called \"Tsundere\" attitude... Felt too rushed for that.\n\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nConsidering that this is an english-based indie game made by developers from all over the world, the gameplay is actually pretty good. Then again I have been playing games from some I guess the \"most publicised\" and (AAA?) companies like Pulotte and Sprite, my standards were kind of high...\n\nBut you need to work up the choices better in my opinion. How? Like you should have maybe, just maybe, given a chance to kiss her.. (I want kawaii~ The art works so well with this! Voice Actors aren't really that needed. Thought it will be a huge gain.)\n\nArt - 8/10\nNow, I'm pretty sure overall everyone came because of the art. I mean, it's the only thing that appealing to this game and mostly th reason why people want to see how to the story came out. The art is great. Real great. Tons of fanservice though, not exactly what I wanted. But it was to appeal to the main crowd here on Steam so I guess it's normal. Oh, and the enviroment was well animated. Why? Have you not notice the sunlight filtering down, literally, on the rooftop, and the animated sea on the beach? Now that was nice. Almost felt like NekoPara there. Hue.\n\nHowever, there was a few flaws tho. Scenes like the \"Cafeteria being crowded\" with a really empty cafeteria is kinda... not there. I get it that the alternative is to have some sort of imagination. But really, you should have draw people inside to really emphasize on this.. \nTrue, it's pretty hard to draw, since I'm a Game Artist-in-study myself, and trying to get the poportions according to how far the perspectives are is pretty hard. Then again, maybe you devs should have taken more time to spread out your deadline for games and really work on each aspect of the game, then we might have gotten a better impression of  you guys. \n\n\nOverall Conclusion- 6/10\nWith all these fast games coming out so fast, and then patches for Voice Actors and all coming after, I really think your just looking to milk us of our money with this games. I mean, the story wasn't thought out well enough, none of the background art to be put together properly, It all points to fast deadlines and stuff. \n\nWhich makes me wonder why would you want to have fast deadlines? Why all the need for this? The only logical reason for all of this is basically to milk us of our money to have funds. But for what, I don't know. Maybe they need some base funds to have longer deadlines and good games, that might be a good thing. But why not make a kickstarter for that then? Your publisher is Sekai, you have of alot publicity there. They can help you with increasing publicity for your kickstarter. It dosen't make sense.\n\nThen again, if your just trying to make Steam-standard VNs for the others on steam to be introduced to Visual Novel scene, then I guess you kinda failed there.

Theres no sense of progression story or impact, its really rather dull. \n-  The story is lack luster, its the standard socially awkward nerd (who they don't even bother to name) which apparent is the entire male population of B grade anime protagonists - hes never seen a hot girl before and is only with them as convince has drawn them together. The story is slwo and linear. YOUR DECISIONS DO NOT MATTER. Its like having two different doors to the same room.\n- If you want anime books i would recommend the internet. There are much better ones for free.\n\nIn summary: no game content, just a lack luster story and lots of text scrolling for a few standard anime pictures you could find in google.\n\nPersonally Id recommend huniepop instead - I got it in a bundle - Yes its cheesy but the puzzle games are fun, highly addictive and progressively challenging, the story is relatedable as a awkward guy managing to get comfortable around women, your choices matter a bit more and i found it surprisingly fun despite it being far from my regular game. Plus it has cheesy anime pictures, not as good as snapchatting but probably a bonus for the geeks out there who havent discovered the internet.

Wait a minute. - What is happening? - Please, settle down. We've got a situation in there I'd rather not discuss till me manager gets here. Look, there he is. Talk to me, Krabs. It started out as a simple order: A Krabby Patty with cheese. When the customer took a bite, no cheese! Get ahold of yourself, Eugene. I'm going in. Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager of this establishment. Everything's gonna be just fine. - I'm really scared here, man. - You got a name? - Phil. - You got a family, Phil? Come on, Phil, stay with me. Let's hear about that family. I got a wife and two beautiful children. That's what it's all about. I want you to do me a favor, Phil. What? Say cheese. Order up. Three cheers for the manager! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hooray! Gary, I had that dream again. And it's finally gonna come true. Today. Sorry about this, calendar.

SpongeBob! What are you doing in here? I have to tell you something, Squidward. Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work? - There's no shower at work. - What do you want? I just wanted to say I'll be thanking you in my managerial acceptance speech today. Get out! Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony. That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab . Oops. Hold on. - Congratulations, buddy. - Oh, thanks, Patrick. And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple. I love being purple! We're going to the place where all the action is. - You don't mean...? - Oh, I mean. Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat!

Good luck, SpongeBob. Hey, look for me at the ceremony. I got a little surprise for you. I'm a Goofy Goober Yeah Hello, Bikini Bottom! Perch Perkins here, coming to you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty. Until today, that is. That's right, folks. Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab . First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs. Hello. I like money. What inspired you to build a second Krusty Krab right next door to the original? Money. Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer! Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors. Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet... ...from A to Y. - A to Y? Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet. What about Z? - Z? - Z. The letter after Y. W, X, Y, Z. Plan Z! - Here it is, just like you said. - Oh, boy. It's evil. It's diabolical. It's lemon-scented. This Plan Z can't possibly fail! So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...! I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. I think I stepped in something. Not in something, on someone, you twit. Sorry, Plankton. Are you on your way to the grand-opening ceremony? No, I am not on my way over to the grand-opening ceremony. I'm busy planning to rule the world! Well, good luck with that. I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion. Stupid kid. Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab . - We paid $ for this? - I paid . Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager. Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah! Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee. Yes. The obvious choice for the job. He's right. A name you all know. It starts with an S. - That's me. - Please welcome our new manager... ...Squidward Tentacles. Yes! Yeah! Oh, better luck next time, buddy. Yeah! All right! People of Bikini Bottom, as the manager of... SpongeBob. Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs. Go ahead, Mr. K. I'm making a complete what of myself? The most embarrassing thing you've ever seen? And now it's worse because I'm repeating everything you say into the microphone? Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob, you didn't get the job. - What? - You did not get the job. But... But why? SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... ...mature than you. - I'm not... ...mature? Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... Now, let's see... - Dork? - No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork. - A goofball? - Closer, but no, no, no. - A ding-a-ling. - Wing nut. A Knucklehead McSpazatron. Okay, that's enough. Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it \"kid-ager. \" You understand-ager? I mean, you understand? I guess so, Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob? I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready. Depression. Poor kid. Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob! Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss something? Did you see my butt? Later that evening... Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune. Oh, right. The royal court is now in session. Bring the prisoner forward. So you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown. - Yes, but... - But what? But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher. Well, then I guess I can't execute you. - Twenty years in the dungeon it is. - Daddy. You're free to go. Bless you, Princess Mindy. Mindy, how dare you defy me. Why do you have to be so mean? I am the king. I must enforce the laws of the sea. Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments. That would be nice. Squire, clear the room. I wish to speak to my daughter alone. What is this, Mindy? - Your crown? - And what does this crown do? - Covers your bald spot. - It's not bald, it's thinning. This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline. No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day, you will wear this crown. I'm gonna be bald? Thinning! Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like your father. Dad, your \"crown\"... What the...? My crown! Someone has stolen the royal crown! I got it. I got it. Hey, all you Goobers, it's time to say howdy to your favorite undersea peanut, Goofy Goober. Howdy, Goofy Goober!

That being said, it doesn't necessarily gets a \"good\" score from me, but rather a somewhat mediocre \"good enough\".\n\nIt has very nice drawings, an entertaining character study, but there are (again) no H-scenes and your choices hardly alter the story in an interesting way. The plot is very thin, and I wouldn't mind it that much actually if the writers had invested more time in writing independend routes for each of the 3 heroines, instead of 3 very short and generic ones for Hikari, Sayaka and a neutral one. Which leads me to another waste that is Yuzuki, which packs alongside her devilish hotness hints of an actual intriguing and deeply psychological backstory. Which isn't elaborates upon much, of course.\n\nIf Sakura Spirits desperately needed a patch to make any sense of anything it was trying to do, Sakura Angels only needed some fine tuning to actually be a quite decent casual western VN. Most definitely not a great one, mind you, for that there was not enough time and thought invested. Otherwise it could have gone far.\n\nAgain: The game has 3 endings in which you either become [i]sort-of-but-not-really-a-couple[/i] with Hikari or Sayaka, or neither of them (this third option should have been Yuzuki OR a harem ending, but what do I know, right?). I say [i]sort-of-but-not-really-a-couple[/i] because what we are really presented with is kiddies stuff: the furthest you'll see them getting intimate is a hug. Now, I don't think explicit sex is necessary to convey love through a VN, but at the very least the writer could have gone with a kiss to give us a romantic visual cue or sign of affection that, you know, shows us that someone likes the other person seriously. I would have been okay even with a kiss on the cheek, but no, this was probably considered XXX hardcore pornography. That was, in my humble opinion, just plain immaturity on Winged Cloud's part.\n\nThe potentiality of Sakura Angels was heavily lost on the decision to almost fully ignore Yuzuki as a 3 dimensional character. It would have been interesting if the creators actually gave quality some thought, to see a Yuzuki route that actually expanded on the little info we had on her, making her's the only that is told in the aftermath, [spoiler]when Hikari and Sayaka have to go, and how the main protagonist Kenta would deal with it.[/spoiler] But the writer didn't even care to establish if Yuzuki is human or not, nor for what entity the other girls are actually working for.\n\nThe climax of this VN is about how Kenta has difficulties concentrating enough but ends up saving the world anyway. The climax. Is. Literally. About. HOW. The protag. Can't concentrate. Or rather, forgot a detail of what he had to do to SAVE THE F***ING WORLD. You could have done SO MUCH to make it epic, but nope, that would have required creativity and investment. I could make a better climax on the spot, [spoiler]like, let's say, maybe a fight inside Kenta's head against \"the evil\", or a message from his badass ancestor on how to reseal the enemy.[/spoiler] It was just way to lame for such a great task as saving the world should be.\n\nAnd let's talk about that: saving the world. Really? The bloathed ego of the writer couldn't content with, I dunno, the city or the region in which the VN plays? I think even going as far as saying that the main cast was fighting a [i]national threat[/i] would be making things way too dramatic for the proportions of this VN. If THE WHOLE WORLD really depended on Kenta and the evil sealed within his blood, don't you think [i]THEY[/i], whoever they are, would send their best and most capable magical girls, instead of Hikari and Sayaka? Who demonstrated several times that they weren't working together for too long.\n\nWhich brings me to another point.\n\nThe VN likes to play with the unsaid, that is, Hikari and Sayaka never reveal too much from where they are, who send them and their backstory. Everything supposedly top secret and to protect Kenta. See, such a technique isn't necessarily bad, but you need to know how to use it, otherwise you end up in a literary catastrophe like here. A [i]good[/i] video game example would be Guilty Gear Xrd's story mode and how a lot of technical nonsense terms are thrown around,- but eventually explained or presented in such a way it doesn't become a bother to the watcher. We had no idea who \"the Conclave\" was in the beginning, but from the way everybody talked about them and how they were presented TOLD us, the watchers, that they were up to no good. Who really cares about the \"Schwarzschild Radial Limit\", as long as it rocks in that one scene, giving the protag a chance to kick butts in a cool and flashy way? See, if you manage to suspend your audience's disbelief, you are doing it right! If you just omitt something that is ESSENTIAL to develop your characters deeper than the surface, you are writing yourself into a dead end.\n\nSakura Angels didn't need, but freely choose and is proud of being shallow. They had everything in their hands to make a  great casual western VN, even the experience of what not to do to make at the very least a decent one, and they wasted all their potential. For what I don't know. So many plot holes, so little character development (although the little bit they have ARE admittedly fun to read), so few routes to choose from, such a big letdown. \n\nScrew this game. It is WAY better than its predecessor, but I guess it's only good to fap to the pictures.

It's a good game, a really nice job. But I must say that is too easy, most of the decision didn't affect the final you get, also after checking the flowchart I discovered that you just have to take few desicions in order to get the route you wanted, and those desicion were too obvious. I'm not an expert in VN but what I really enjoy in this kind of game is thinking about the desicions I make in the game and how those can affect the story. Concluding, if you want something good with nice character, nice art, great soundtrak, a really good sense of humor, easy and fast to play, I recommend Sakura Angels.

This second game in a major increase on the story.  The first game had little to no options (I think one) as to how the story turned out.  This game, so far, seems to have some options which reveal different paths (pics) of the characters.\n\nI have to say I enjoy the writing.  Sure, it's a little cheesy and long at times, but the writers do a good job at explaining what our hero is going through.  The artwork is obviously enjoyable (As a single man) and the choices i've faced so far unlock different outcomes.\n\nIn the end, Sakura Angels is what it is.  A virtual novel, with some VERY adult themes, and an enjoyable experience.  Here's what I promise you.  Buy the game, and you will have 5-10 people join your Steam Live Stream almost instantly but never admit they are watching it!  lol.\n\nWe have the dev team's official release to produce video of this game with commentary, so I hope you enjoy it.  We at Rogue Ocean Gaming interview a lot of developers of indie games, major games, and games you might have not heard of to get the questions answered.\n\nPlease like, comment, and subscribe to see more footage!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSzjBphQfsU", "timestamp_created": 1423012176, "timestamp_updated": 1423012176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14306702": {"recommendationid": "14306702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127269538", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1460413503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me gust\u00f3 el juego, los fondos son agradables, las chicas est\u00e1n guapas, el fanservice en general est\u00e1 bien.

Its like watching Anime, but with semi-still images, and people who fight by smashing in to each other. Good story, This isn't a game you get for gameplay, there is a lot of reading. The characters have been developing nicely thus far. Im not sure where I am at in the story, but it feels like it might end soon. I definintly want more stuff by these developers. Its a good \"Game\". I use quotation marks, as there is a lack of gameplay, but thats how it was designed. Its more of a visual novel, that you sometimes interact with. I'd personally give it a 78/100 so far. It only gets better as I go on. I did have to hold down space bar through some parts, as the computer is convinently placed in the kitchen, but I later re-visit these parts with the quick-load option, which is awesome for somthing like this.

After playing Sakura Spirit, its predecessor, I was given the impression that Sakura Angels would make a extreme resemblence to Sakura Spirit; with it's lack of choices, pretty linear and boring two-sided story, and not so memorable characters. When I played Sakura Angels however, I was pleasantly surprised. If you are not familiar with the Sakura games they are what many would classify as a 'visual novel'. Of course in a japanese sort-of looking design with lots of Fanservice. Sakura Angels is no doubt 100% better than it's predecessor. It provides you with more choices that you can choose from and they can lead to different types of outcomes (not sure if they effect the ending). Characters in this game seem much more vivid and memorable, and the story was clear and was just straight forward; perfect for this game. It took me three hours to complete Sakura Angels, and nearly an hour and a half for Sakura Spirit.

Sakura Spirit wasn't exactly a quality title, although the artwork was pretty. However, after reading through Angels, I have no regrets on purchasing it. Although, the writing isn't exactly top notch; it is far from terrible. I found myself smirking quite a bit all the way through. It doesn't try to pretend to be anything other than a cutesy story based around magical fights, making breakfast & awkward romance. The artwork is top notch as well! I found myself appreciating how well done it was moreso than gawking at all the anime jubblies in said artwork. This is seriously some 5 star art! The novel also isn't COMPLETELY kinetic like Sakura Spirit. There are a lot of choices to be made but it doesn't change much outside of some dialogue for a few sentences. It stays on a set path (for the most part). \n\nBasically, if you're buying this in hopes of getting an experience close to Planetarian or Cho Dengeki Stryker, you will be disappointed. This is just a 2 hour (maybe 3 if you read slow) cutesy little novel full of fan service. It's not a story that is going to blow you away, nor is it something you will think about much long after you read through it. This is just a nice read to kill an afternoon.

Prior play of Sakura Spirit isn't required since the controls are simple so even new players can play at a leisurely pace.

Just look at their faces, not a single corner guys, this is the example of perfect aliasing, GTA, Far Cry 4, they all can bow down to this amazing monument created to display the best graphics possible in a computer game at the moment. And that's not all: Even my crappy pc can run it smoothly without dropping any frames. This game is a technological masterpiece, Star Citizen is dead before it went out of Alpha.  [b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]\n\n[i]Sound[/i]: Oh my gosh don't even get me started on the sound this soundtrack is one of the most catchy themes i have ever heard. Forget the Portal soundtrack because Sakura Angels is all you need.  Also a huge plus compared to benchmarks in the sound category like Portal is that it has more than one track and all of them are equally amazing i just have to give it a full 10 points.

You can use the mouse, you can use the spacebar and you can even let it play all alone, this game has it all, forget your 400apm in sc2 using a steering wheel with force feedback. This game will make you enjoy yourself even more and it doesnt even require 1 apm if you play it on automode. This game is easy to learn but hard to master since one of your hands is always occupied anyway, but with the built in support for Beginners and advanced Zweihander strategies this game is your first step at becoming a professional. [b]Controls: 10/10[/b]\n\n[i]Multiplayer[/i]: Forget the war between Battlefield and Call of Duty! The real multiplayer game is here to stay! Playable with an unlimited amount of friends at home or through skype everyone can play together. Just wipe out your Joysticks and start playin. Auto-mode makes sure you dont have to fight about whoever gets to click and lets be honest, we are far too concentrated on our joysticks anyway. [b]Multiplayer 10/10[/b]\n\nAs you can see there is literally no point speaking against this game. Sakura Angels is the best game of all time, it's the game Duke Nukem Forever promised us to be.

However let me be honest here, I saw it coming when I realized the similiar names and art styles. However the R17 CG and artwork here are good and I bought the game because of it. \n\nThe game takes place as you causally going through your day as Kenta and the \"usual\" anime route, encounter appears. You are then saved by two girls who happen to be magical. You eventually found out they are your new classmates. They protect you after getting involved. You have a few options in this game and you will always have an ending. The game in itself makes you have the option of an end between the two girls, Hikari and Sayaka. Now there is also an ending where you can get both and that route well is balanced.\n\nA few thoughts\nUsually in some VNs there are characters there that you know you can't date and I found that with Yuzuhi. It's like you have that antagonist you like but couldn't have. That was another defining interest. It's like wanting to know the face behind Tali from ME. Or having that one antagonist you wish for that one bed scene you wish. Yes we've been there and if it appeals and attracts, people will buy it.\n\nNonetheless the game filled the time and made me like it. Enjoyable. The story seems short like before and needed a bit more. A route with Yuzuhi would be nice! Same with what they could have done with Sakura Spirit with Tsuyuri. \nNonetheless the game cg firs a 5/5. \nThe story 3.7/5. \nOption choice and dialogue, some amusement, some we saw coming. 3.6-4.0/5.\n Give it a shot if you like. I can give a recommend for the art and that's another thing that sold me. However I think there needs to be more to VNs than just that.\n If I start being more detailed and do this out of 10 well I'm thinking 6-7/10 might be it.\n\nBasically if you want to get the game go ahead. Enjoy it. However if price not for you, you could wait. There's no rush. There wasn't any continuations like other games too for instance that came about. For instance, indie developers who make games don't include a dlc or include expansion after release which is sad because I do believe some games need it.
