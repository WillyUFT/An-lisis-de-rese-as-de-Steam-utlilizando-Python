I think it could have done with a bit more dialogue or otherwise implicit theming, as I mostly just felt like I was going through motions in terms of story. However, the combat is very fun and reminiscent of bullet hells. It is also a bit short; I've got 100% map completion after a relatively short time, with many deaths. I don't think that takes away from it, but it is worth mentioning. Visually there is a lot of nice scenery, and the secrets are nice to find. I think the game would fit well with someone who already enjoys metroidvania styled games as a simple variant of it. I don't think the puzzles or story are heavy enough that I would recommend it to anyone looking for those things specifically.

Foi muito bem recomendado e eu queria conhecer. Cheguei com altas expectativas e isso \u00e9 sempre um erro.\nPrimeira vez que zerei foi no Normal com 7 horas e 40 minutos.\nSegunda vez que zerei foi no Hard com 4 horas e 10 minutos.\nZerei mais algumas vezes no New Game+ do Normal pra ver o que acontecia e n\u00e3o existem grandes mudan\u00e7as al\u00e9m de posicionamento de novos inimigos comuns e dano aumentado pra eles. Foi um bom treinamento pra dificuldade Insano que zerei com 2 horas e 48 minutos.\n\nPontos positivos:\nToda a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de arte desse jogo \u00e9 magnifica. Pixelart, cen\u00e1rios, m\u00fasicas, efeitos sonoros e visuais ficaram incr\u00edveis. Quero destacar a m\u00fasica que toca na \"terceira forma\" da Rainha. Ela empolga muito.\n\nPontos negativos:\nQuero deixar claro que n\u00e3o quero ser cruel e tudo aqui \u00e9 a minha opini\u00e3o como gamer com 35 anos de experi\u00eancia.\n\n - Gameplay muito travada. Ao atacar a personagem se desloca quase um passo pra frente e isso me incomoda demais. Pra piorar acredito que \u00e9 a protagonista com o menor alcance que eu j\u00e1 vi. Ela tamb\u00e9m fica presa em movimentos e isso faz a fluidez se perder.\nAcho incr\u00edvel que a speedrun esteja em 21 minutos na dificuldade Normal. As comunidades se puxam muito. \n\n - Hist\u00f3ria super b\u00e1sica e quase inexistente com personagens que mal se conectam ou simplesmente n\u00e3o adicionam. Existem algumas op\u00e7\u00f5es em di\u00e1logos mas n\u00e3o existem consequ\u00eancias. A motiva\u00e7\u00e3o da protagonista \u00e9 interessante, mas a vil\u00e3 deixou a desejar.\nA protagonista n\u00e3o fala e isso me incomoda desde RPG's antigos do Super Nintendo. \u00c9 uma escolha que eu gostaria que fosse evitada apesar de entender pq ela existe.\nQuero deixar um destaque super negativo pra parte inundada. Nem todo jogo precisa de esgotos ou mapas inundados e quando existe um mapa inundado \u00e9 quase obrigat\u00f3rio que exista um sistema de f\u00f4lego que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nesse jogo. A protagonista respira por magia eu acho. Toda aquela parte n\u00e3o fez sentido.\nNo geral eu me diverti muito com o jogo. Recomendo mesmo tendo me estressado bastante pois a dificuldade se baseia na protagonista ser super limitada.

No tiene rodeos innecesarios, su apartado jugable y art\u00edstico est\u00e1 cuidado de manera tal que se nota el cari\u00f1o que los desarrolladores tuvieron a la hora de crear el juego.

Overall 5/10.\n\nThe main reason that I pick up this game is because of the pixel art and the boss that everyone know about. \n\nVery nice metroidvania, game with honestly fun when you didn't fall down the instant spike trap randomly laying around (simple control but I'm playing on keyboard and it a little weird ngl). There's also a mechanic to get into tight spaces and honestly it should just be another button, making you change to an active item only when you need it is meh.\nHitting enemy feel like you are crushing them, even tho you are using a leaf lol. Also the bow shooting is one of my favorite feeling in the game, so simple looking but it feel so great idk why.  8/10\n\nVery beautiful art and background. I like the garden looking place the most with the roses and stuff. Mobs look amazing and their movement is very fluid. And of course the boss fight is wowowowo. The sword loli is ugwoooo  9/10\nMusic is great but most of the time you are in the scary castle type part and it get old quick. 7/10\n\nGame wasn't hard by any mean, but I really don't like the random spike trap. Like the floor crumbling trap that fall into an arrow trap is great but the random spike on the floor that cause instant death is ugh. It's the backtracking part that get on my nerve the most. \nYour Hp is there just to be there you gonna die in one hit with boss anyway, you would do well to just dodge using i-frame. Honestly in this game it easier to do hitless run than others game cuz the boss is so rudimentary and i-frame is so big, especially after you got the air dodge.\n\nI heard there is a story but I wasn't paying too much attention to it. [spoiler] Aside from that guy finding his wife... [/spoiler]\nThe major gripe i have with the game is the ending.

I am not familiar with any other game from the series (which will be corrected soon) and even though this game is fourth in the [i]Momodora[/i] series (serves as a prequel) no prior knowledge of the events is required for full enjoyment!\n\nThe story is simple. Evil is spreading through the country and slowly corrupts everything. Kaho, a young priestess from the village of Lun, arrives in the city of Karst to seek an audience with the Queen. Unfortunately, right on the outskirts of the city, Kaho learns that meeting the Queen isn't going to be easy because the corruption is particularly heavy here and the way leading to her is sealed off. Without any other option than pursuing her goal, Kaho needs to navigate through the different city locations to collect four parts of the city crest that have the power to break the seal. The streets are, thanks to the evil in the air, far from safe though and Kaho needs to stay vigilant as many enemies are lurking around and one small mistake can doom her and with her the whole country.\nDespite the ever-present evil taint the city isn't completely abandoned and Kaho can meet a few individuals who are searching for their loved ones, answers, protection or they are just simply trying to survive - not that everyone is going to be so lucky.\n\nKaho isn't defenseless against the monsters and as a priestess, she has skills both in archery and swordplay\u2026 with a slight detail that she uses a Leaf for it. Yep, you read it right. XD Oh, I love this picture\u2026\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=905197703\n\nJokes aside, as you progress you collect items with active or passive powers that will make you stronger in the long run and that's always a good thing. After defeating a boss you obtain upgrades for your bow or new ability; when you do especially well and manage to surpass the boss without a hit you receive a sweet item, which you can't get any other way. You can find other items in secret places or buy them from the few sellers that are still in the city. You can equip only three active and two passive items though, but you are free to change them anytime you wish even in the middle of the fight, which can be pretty useful! Active items, like the healing bellflower, have only a limited quantity of uses but do not worry, every usable item gets restored to its full numbers at every checkpoint, like your health. ;)\n\nFighting in [i]Momodora[/i] is challenging, quick paced and extremely fun! The controls are responsive and don't hold you back. Except for one secret boss you have to fight them all and you need to learn their attack patterns well as a simple head-on tactic isn't enough for some of them even on lower difficulties! Every mistake you make gets quickly punished, but it doesn't turn into a frustrating chore. If you die you get transported to the last visited checkpoint, but nothing else, you keep your items and all money. As for the checkpoints, they are distributed across the map very reasonably and there are no too-long paths that you need to re-do in case you fail (except for the finale and that's because it's [b]the finale[/b]). I also like the way you can save - you pray at the bell to open a menu or you just hit the bell with your weapon and it saves, neat!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2940448979\n\nI love the pixel graphics of both characters and backgrounds. The music is also exceptional, especially during boss fights. All of it creates a great atmosphere and in some moments I had goosebumps and my heart ached (oh, the fight with [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LcULezhM0&pp=ygUPbW9tb2RvcmEgZmVubmVs]Pardoner Fennel[/url] felt almost like fighting the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m_j6Ziz3vQ&pp=ygUaaG9sbG93IGtuaWdodCBwdXJlIHZlc3NlbCA%3D]Pure Vessel[/url] in the [i]Hollow Knight[/i]). All of the characters are introduced only for a brief time, which is a shame on one hand as I would love to know more about them, but on the other hand, it works well thanks to the shorter length of the game.\nAside from fighting various enemies, you have to overcome many obstacles in the form of traps that kill you in just one hit. Platforming is done nicely with a few truly challenging stages. But overall I didn't feel like being punished by it (like in [i]Indivisible[/i]).\n[i]Momodora[/i] isn't anyhow long and you can get to the end in a few hours, there are two endings and getting the true one will open New Game+! Achievements are there to push you further through the rabbit hole and test your masochist's limits, so beware. ^_^\n\nSo what I am trying to say here is that [i]Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight[/i] is an excellent game with beautiful visuals and music, great gameplay and atmospheric and memorable fights.

Perfectly balanced in almost every area I can think of, which lets the core experience shine through.

Even the boss fights don\u2019t overstay their welcome like a lot of modern games that have sipped from the Dark Souls well. \n\nVisually the game manages to be quite striking, despite its seeming simplicity. I\u2019m not much of a pixel art or anime fan, but I love everything about the artwork here from the main character, Kaho\u2019s, design and moves to the creatures she faces. You can tell what the hell you\u2019re looking at 90% of the time, which is a plus in this genre. It\u2019s dark and fun in only the way manga and anime can pull off as you\u2019re beating weird monster women with a sacred leaf while jumping over tomatoes with clubs.\n\nI will note the game could be perceived as being on the short side for this genre, but I\u2019d argue because it doesn\u2019t include a lot of the fluff geared towards wasting the player\u2019s time that so many modern games do to appease audiences that demand such things.", "timestamp_created": 1686428917, "timestamp_updated": 1686428917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139716553": {"recommendationid": "139716553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799937436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1684900365}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't very good.

But something is off with this one... \n\nAs i started to play, i soon realized, i just not having fun with Momodora, as i should with any good or even mediocre metroidvania. There are just so many frustrating elements, that i was constantly annoyed by it and just wanted to finish and move on already... \nProblems:\n\nSPIKES. The spikes are just the worst in this game. Instadeath, in any difficulty, and they are not always visible enough. Thats getting worse at the second half of the game, when u have better movement skills for backtraking and u just wanna rush from A to B, but spikes constantly kills u. I was so frustrated to run the same areas again and again becouse of spikes. Why not just damage, what is the fun here?\n- checkpoint placements are bad, becouse there are several cheap deaths in the game... for example: spikes. Or enemies that push you  into the... spikes. \n- No checkpoints after bossfights... ahahah... thats a joker here! imagine, that i defeated the boss before the last boss, and there was no checkpoint after that... so i died in a SPIKE! WOAH MAN! I could defeat him again.... why would the game just... save? Or put a checkpoint after every boss? No. Put spikes !\n- The game's theme and overall atmosphere is just weird for me, not into the setting, and hated the enemy designs even more. Loved the first worm boss, that was the only interesting fantasy thing here.\n- Combat was mediocre, not really had fun with it... Controls were fine however. \n- Absolute disaster difficulty system. Dev just missed both difficulty totally... The Normal diff is INSANELY hard, full of cheap shots, u can die by 2 hit, bosses are just frustration factories. So... let's try easy... Easy is not easy, easy is a joke. The game plays itself for you. You cannot really die there... I dont understand how can a developer screw up 2 difficulty at the same time. Even an easy game should have challenge, but a Normal should be NORMAL, not Very hard. Oh yeah, i have seen others complaining about it on the forums long time ago as well... who cares anyway, if something is broken, just stay that way, right? \n\nPros:\n- Game is short, and it ends\n\nI loved Elderand, Monster Sanctuary, even finished and liked Beholgar!

Unfortunately, the last sitting where I put about half of the time in was at least a year or more after the first sittings causing this review to not be my best as I only partially remember the early game.  Normal difficulty was totally fine. I'm no Metroidvania/Dark souls pro, and I found the difficulty totally reasonable especially considering I finished the last third of the bosses after a year break and having to relearn the controls. The art is incredible, and is easily the best/most impressive part of this game. I love pixel art, and they did a wonderful job.  Controls were tight/responsive and I felt that if I got hit or missed a platform that it was definitely my fault. Story existed but I didn't pay much attention to it. Sound and music was fine, I just don't remember any of it standing out in a good or bad way. What causes me to give this a 6/10(ie worth playing but has issues or worth playing if you really like the genre) is mainly that every part between the bosses looked amazing but felt just meh to play. Trash mobs were trivial to deal with at all times and the platforming was easy. Backtracking was unendingly painful. Even when you can warp it doesn't show you which bell you are going to you just have to guess/remember which name goes where, which is such a simple QOL addition. I have no clue why they didn't add it. One thing I always look for in a good metriodvania is how much tension I have between checkpoints especially if I have got a bunch of new stuff. Is it worth backtracking to make sure I keep my stuff and not have to redo it all or push on and hopefully make it... And sadly that tension never really existed.\n\nOverall, the game was a fun romp through a really nice looking world, but the zones/enemies just weren't  memorable enough to elevate this to a great game. Bosses were solid for the most part and while I enjoyed the experience it didn't leave a lasting effect on me.

Buy if screenshots/gameplay look appealing.[/i]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing art, sound, and animation.\n[*]Emotional story. The story is very minimalistic, reminiscent of Dark Souls, but less cryptic. There is a lack of hope amongst the NPCs, and at times, you will be forced to kill those who should be allies, not enemies. There are many bright and colorful areas, but also dark and moody ones, with splashes of blood strewn about. There is nothing morbid, but the games story and atmosphere often left me feeling uneasy.\n[*]Good combat and movement. Metroidvanias are a mixed bag when it comes to their combat systems. Thankfully, \"Momodora\" contains good combat and movement. Pro tip, stay grounded and roll to dodge attacks. Jumping back after attacking will usually get you hit by tracking projectiles.\n[*]Frequent saves. This game does not waste your time with pointless boss runs and long treks across the map.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game is extremely short. I finished my first playthrough on Normal difficulty in 3.5 hours with 99% map completion, most collectibles, and the true ending.\n[*]Replay value is limited. There are collectibles, achievements, hidden boss items, etc, but most of these things can be gotten with relative ease on the first playthrough, and the things you missed aren't worth writing home about.\n[*]The game has a high skill floor, without the ceiling being much higher. I actually dropped this game the first time I played it years ago, because I was struggling to grasp the game. Coming back, it clicked, and I beat it in an evening without much effort. Thankfully, there are more difficulty settings, but overall, I thought the difficulty curve was much flatter than it should have been.\n[*]Hitstun nullifies basic enemies. If you've played a game like \"Devil May Cry,\" you may be familiar with juggling enemies. In DMC, you are often against many enemies, and juggling a single enemy only gets you so far in a fight. In \"Momodora,\" you often face one enemy at a time, and can just spam the attack button, leaving the enemy in permanent hitstun until they die. Enemies die so fast, I'm not even sure why the game contains hitstun for enemies. While I'm glad fights aren't a chore, they can end up feeling cheesy with no alternative.\n[*]Unable to mark the map. The reason I only explored 99% of the map and collected most of the collectibles, rather than all, is due to the fact that, as far as I am aware, you are entirely unable to mark the map. None of these collectibles really matter, and I did almost zero backtracking, but the player should have some ability to notate where they will need to return to, if the game does not do it for them.\n[*]Must hold Ranged Attack Button to charge. The ranged attack is extremely powerful, and it would behoove you to hold this button literally the entire time you play. For this reason, it may be easier for players to use Keyboard controls, rather than a Controller. While Negative-Edge attacks (attack on key release, rather than press) are fine, it's a pain to dedicate a finger to holding a button down literally 100% of the time.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Mixed:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Hitstop is extremely long. It honestly reminds me of Samurai Shodown. This took a bit to get used to, and eventually it felt natural.\n[*]Anime aesthetic. I love anime as an art style, but I find the extreme perversion of 99% of anime distasteful. There is really only one enemy I can recall that I would consider perverted, and that was the giant blue lady with massive breasts. In fact, you spend the entire fight attacking her breasts to damage her, and she shows up multiple times within the game. I found this fight hilarious, so I didn't mind. The imps look like kids, so fighting them was a bit sad, but that fits with the overall mood of the game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nOverall, I would definitely recommend \"Momodora\" to any metroidvania enthusiast. If you looked at some gameplay or screenshots and thought the game looked fun, you will most likely enjoy the game. Just note that it is short and difficult.", "timestamp_created": 1681459398, "timestamp_updated": 1681459398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

I've bought the digital Xbox, and PS4 version and 100% it on both platforms while also buying the physical version for Nintendo Switch because I adore this game so much. The game is roughly 4-6 hours long, and admittedly I do wish it was longer, but that tends to be my main complaint on most indie games. Not that the time detracts from the game in any way. Absolutely love the high bit pixel art style combined with this very atmospheric dark, and sorrowful setting the game has going for itself. The somber, melancholic music only further adds to this games atmosphere. Overall I find the game to be fair but challenging, and you're even rewarded with powerful items if you beat bosses without taking any hits. Additionally, I find the save mechanic very unique and enjoyable. You run up to hit a bell that saves the game, yet it has no load screen or wait time. I enjoy being able to hit the bell only to hear it's chime go off all the while I'm still running forward with no slow down to the game progress in any way. (Personally I wish more games had a fluid save system like Momodora.) At times the game goes on sale for dirt cheap (Like $3.99) on all platforms if you don't wish to pay full price. (Even then it's not a expensive game to begin with at $9.99.)

I was hoping, that it would take me longer than 3-4h to beat the game with both endings but nevertheless I still think this was a cute and fun adventure, which I can only recommend for other to play. :)", "timestamp_created": 1678745333, "timestamp_updated": 1678745333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134611679": {"recommendationid": "134611679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236458058", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 253, "last_played": 1678732054}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] \u0411\u0415\u0417\u0423\u041c\u041d\u041e \u041b\u0410\u041c\u041f\u041e\u0412\u0410\u042f \u041c\u0415\u0422\u0420\u041e\u0418\u0414\u0412\u0410\u041d\u0418\u042f [/h1]\n\n\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0438\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0438. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0441 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0439! \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f \u0431\u0443\u0431\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430, \u0432\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u044b)))) \u041d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \"\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0431\u0435\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c\" \u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e!", "timestamp_created": 1678732310, "timestamp_updated": 1678732310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518538892269134521", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134570643": {"recommendationid": "134570643", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062890372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 478, "last_played": 1678606257}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended with a strong qualification: The \"bad\" ending is one of the more infuriatingly dumb things in a game.\nMomodora is a charming metroidvania that is a bit shallow in terms of the gameplay.

Are there any particular barriers of note, whether engaging challenge or boring grind? Are the achievements designed well enough to elevate the game-play experience? Or are some poorly designed enough that you'll be forced to choose between a miserable slog or stopping just shy of 100%? If this all sounds like pointless nonsense to you: you are probably objectively correct, and there's plenty of other reviews for you. For those of you that embrace the madness like me, I hope this will be helpful!\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\nAchievements here are mostly what you would expect from a Metroidvania (collect / explore fully), and are further streamlined by the game being fairly small, and there being an easily-accessible item that will alert to most secrets / items in rooms.  That aside, there are two points worth noting.\n\n[b]Multiple Play-throughs:[/b] At the very least, two play-throughs are required to get all achievements, as there is one for completing the game on the hardest difficulty, which only unlocks after beating the game once on hard.  More realistically, one would be looking at three, in order not to do a full clear for other achievements on a harder mode than necessary.  Fortunately, the game is short enough that this isn't particularly onerous.\n\n[b]Skill Challenges:[/b] In addition to the aforementioned difficulty-linked achievement (which involves one-shot death from anything), there are a number of other challenge-linked achievements (never dying in a play-through, never killing non-boss enemies in a play-through).

While it basically only has 2 upgrades that affect traversal, after the second boss it becomes surprisingly open and non-linear, as by this point you can route the rest of the game whichever way you want. There's only two 3 arbitrary keys to progress, one is to open the the last area of the game, and one is really close to where you need to use it.\n\nThe game also has a plethora of items (all of which refill on save points, so no need to hoard it), most of them are useful and decimate Boss Battles if you know what you are doing. The number of items feels surprisingly similar to games Bayonetta, where good players are rewarded with ways to be better and faster.\n\nAs I said, the game is short, but it makes up for it in terms of replayability. It is probably one of the easiest Metroidvanias to pick up and replay due to its short length and how the game rewards good players with methods to save time.

The controls are tight, the animations and sound effects are crisp and smooth, and the enemies have well telegraphed attacks and movements.\n\nUnlike most Metroidvania style games, it doesn't require that much backtracking which might make it more accessible to somebody who is usually turned off by that aspect of the genre. However, there is stuff hidden in every area of the game if you are curious enough to go back in explore, which has also made the game fairly replayable for me. The structure of the game reminds me of Megaman ZX, which was also a traditional side scroller adapted to the format of a metroidvania. Every time I play the game I find a new secret tucked away somewhere on the map. There is a shocking amount of detail and content packed into this game for those who care to look for it, and those who don't will still find a pleasantly challenging set of levels and boss fights that can be cleared without a huge time investment. \n\nA surprisingly solid triumph for a series that has otherwise flown under most people's radars.

I picked it up again today, and after getting past the next two areas, i'm dropping it again. For a game that focuses heavily on combat over everything else, the combat is some of the most frustrating and tedious I have played. You get two attack options, a melee attack with no variation and a bow with no variation. No up or down swings, no aiming your bow, nothing but swing and shoot. I've played puzzle games with more combat options than this.  Even worse, enemy attack patterns are boring and samey, and bosses are huge damage sponges. Difficulty options change your HP and nothing else, and enemies on hard mode (and even normal mode too!) can sometimes kill you in one or two hits, EVEN IN THE FIRST AREA. The platforming is just as mediocre, and same goes for the map designs. So many dead ends with nothing in them! Why? I want to leave a note here about the story, but it seems to be nonexistent for the most part, even in reviews from people who finished the whole thing. All and all, I didn't hate the game. I could never hate it with those beautiful graphics, but it was so frustrating and boring that I couldn't be bothered to finish it despite how apparently short it is. From what I can tell in other reviews, none of this improves as the game goes on, and you get a whole one upgrade that gives you any new options in or out of combat.

Definitely nowhere near as good as say hollow knight or dead cells. \n\nLet's start with what's good. The art style is nothing short of amazing. The pixel art is really nice and looks a lot better than most retro games IMO. The soundtrack is also really good, no complaints there either. And plus the game is cute as fuck. And there are cats. But that's about it. Honestly if you like the art style and music, you should probably still play the game, just temper your expectations when it comes to the gameplay, which is pretty poorly designed.\n\nSo let's start with a quick overview of the gameplay. It's a souls-lite, so you  have a dodge roll as well as enemies that telegraph their attacks. However there are a lot of design choices that just make this system not work. So.. you have a bow right? With unlimited ammo. That basically means that you can spam attack any melee enemy. And ranged enemy. And shooting them stuns them, so they can't attack you when you are shooting them. Which makes the melee leaf basically useless. \n\nThe dodge roll feels clumsy and it's really hard to time it so that you avoid damage perfectly. Plus it's not like it's really that useful anyways. As mentioned, you can basically bow spam any enemy and get them in a stun lock, so well timed dodges are only needed for a handful of ranged attacks. And that's not helped by the fact that most enemies have fairly vague telegraphs so you don't always know exactly what they will do (especially with new enemies). Now I wouldn't call the combat incredibly frustrating since it isn't really that hard but it is a bit monotonous and has very little skill requirements or scaling. \n\nIn addition to that, the game only saves at saves points, and these don't come that often. Get killed, lose all your progress. This can also happen after major events, such as killing bosses. Oh, and also accidentally stepping on a spike instantly kills you. Yeah. There are a few sorts of upgrades and abilities that you can get but really these don't change the game is a major way. There weren't as many hidden areas as I was hoping for and I did find exploration to be only mediocre compared to other metroidvanias. And I didn't find navigation as intuitive. It isn't bad but it's not as good as say hollow knight. \n\nThe story was also a bit disappointing. So there is supposed to be some curse in this land. You come here as a priestess and need to cleanse the land of the curse. But there isn't really much information beyond that. Nothing on how the curse came. Who the queen is. Characters are fairly simple story-wise, usually with only a couple lines of dialogue each. No fancy backstory for any of them. \n\nAll in all, whilst I would say that the gameplay was kind of botched and that there were a lot of poor design choices, it's not bad enough that the game is unplayable. I still think that it was enjoyable thanks to the art and music but don't expect a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1666459831, "timestamp_updated": 1666459831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124216116": {"recommendationid": "124216116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198898377440", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1665580575}, "language": "english", "review": "Repetitivo, mec\u00e2nico demais e dif\u00edcil pra caramba, \u00e9 muito chato ter que matar todos os bichos o tempo todo!

This kind of vaporized, however, when I learned that my sprite seemed five sizes too large for the levels I was navigating through. While you have decent control(a little bit of slippery momentum notwithstanding), the individual screens are never really sized in a way that let you play with it. You have the world's most anemic double jump, but considering that it's needed to make nine out of ten jumps in the first place, the point of it seems kind of lost. Likewise, I do love having a dodgeroll with I-frames, but since enemies take up 90% of the space on any given platform, dodgerolling away from them just means you'll eat a hit anyway since the dodgeroll will barely get you through them.\n\nCombine this with the most basic enemies taking four or more hits from your melee attack to take out(and the less said about the ranged attack the better, it's insanely slow, does even less damage than the melee attack and you'll only ever want to bring it out for when an enemy is specifically positioned to punish your use of melee), and it just feels insanely clunky to play. Considering that your hits stun most enemies, too, if you can land that first hit, they're as good as dead from stunlocking anyway, so nothing is gained from making them take more hits to kill other than annoying the player. This is on normal difficulty, by the way.\n\nThe bosses are a bit more interesting, but that's really stretching \"a bit\" until it's creaking and close to breaking. They pop up more or less out of the blue, with no attached fanfare or lore or anything, just boom, here's a big health bar to whittle down as they repeat the same two attacks over and over.\n\nAnother point of annoyance is the way save points work. NOTHING is saved when you get lobbed back to one by a death. Not your collecting of powerups or anything, which means that it gets insanely tedious if there's a room that bops you a couple of times and it has some stuff along the way you want to grab.\n\nThere are absolutely better platformers with more responsive controls and more engaging gameplay out there to play, I can't imagine what would make anyone choose to play Momodora over those, unless it's because they start hyperventilating when they learn that one of the game's first bosses involves punching a giant monster lady in the breasts over and over.\n\nI'm kind of glad that the game didn't

Each defeat was your own fault and your lacking skill, but it was tailored in such a way that you want to continue playing and become better.\n\nMomodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is not like that. Momodora ruthlessly punishes the player for a pixel difference between a successful or a failed dodge roll, and annoying enemies that make these poor game mechanic choices even more frustrating and unbearable to continue playing. Forget even trying out hard mode if you're an experienced player (normal mode is just as frustrating though), unless you want to spend hours just learning how to roll properly without dying in one hit in the first area.\n\nMomodora works like this in all aspects. You die by poor development choices, not because you actually have anything in terms of skill to improve on. And to make the game even more frustrating: after every death, you get teleported all the way back to your last save point. This makes for boring and tedious walks (and many failed dodge rolls) back to where you once were before you can finally continue the game (and walk back again because you died on your way there).\n\nYou cannot call these mistakes a feature of being a challenging game.

El arte de los personajes es bastante simp\u00e1tico, los escenarios est\u00e1n muy bien hechos y dan a cada zona una personalidad bastante marcada, el desaf\u00edo es bastante justo con la mec\u00e1nica de la evasi\u00f3n que se siente genial cuando se hace correctamente e incluso con recompensas para aquellos que logren derrotar a los jefes sin ser tocado que da un curioso valor de re-jugabilidad una vez que te das cuenta de que, si un jefe no te toca, te da un peque\u00f1o \u00edtem que no solo es poderoso si no que suelen tener algo m\u00e1s de historia en las descripciones. Se nota mucho la evoluci\u00f3n de la franquicia y este tengo entendido que fue el primer juego en llegar a consolas, supongo que sirve que no tiene un numero en el nombre aun que al empezar el primer juego de la franquicia a un tributo de Cave Story, el cambio ha sido enorme, aunque he disfrutado cada juego y es interesante ver c\u00f3mo se van agregando y mejorando conceptos. \n\nQuiz\u00e1 algo corto comparado con otros Metroidvanias, pero eso mismo (junto con las selecciones de dificultad) permite que sean buenos para introducir a alguien en el g\u00e9nero y una bella pieza para alguien

But it is really polished. You can also equip different accesories to help you in your journey.\n\nThere are plenty of checkpoints during the game, also usually before the bosses (which are nice, but not incredible). The map is not big as this is a 6-10h game, but even so there is a warp ability later in the game.\n\nThe best thing about the game is the tight gameplay and the art. Each zone is really beautiful.

But that is not bad! It fits to the length. You can beat this game in one session. The pixelgraphic is cute and the areas are beautiful animated and varied. Most fun i had, was the Bossfights. They are very fair and easy to learn and even if you have problems with one, the savepoints are always very close to them. And that is a big point i sometimes cannot understand in other Metroidvania... It is really frustating to have a long way back to the Bossroom. Sometimes there is not much room between challenge and insanity... But here is everything on point!\n\nIf you enjoying pixelarts and metroidvanias, this game is for you. Sure, sometimes it is confusing to find your way and you cannot do the \"Over 9000 damage super saiyajin laserbeam\", but i think they will do better in the next Momodora game.\n\nFor 10$/\u20ac you will be entertained for about 1$/hour. The value gets even better if you dive into new game+ and extend your playtime.

Greatly recommended. Don't recommend you rush through it though, at least not on a first play through.\n.\nAfter beating the game once, I really don't need another play through to know that this game is really good. The characters, backgrounds, and enemies all look fantastic. The animations are even better as they bring so much to life. The game is rather short, I'd say roughly 4-5 hours if you're going for everything you possibly could get on your first play through. The game has no shortage of challenge and will regularly test your mettle with some boss fights.\nAlthough with the secrets to be found and short notice tells on some enemies and most bosses, I strongly suggest you take this game at a steady, or even slow, pace. Rushing through it would 1. leave you rather confused in some areas, as the game is akin to a natural labyrinth and if you haven't been paying attention, you're guaranteed to wander (unless you look up a guide) for quite a while. And 2. It would be doing a serious injustice to rush through and ignore the charming and interesting details put into this game.\n.\nPros: Art, Music, Gameplay, Challenge, and Collectables are all amazing, at times the challenge can get a bit hard depending on your play style, but it's very much possible in the end (I went through on Normal. Easy grants you two extra items to help with health management, and Hard increases the number of enemies in the various rooms).\n.\nCons: If you're rather impatient and don't like waiting around for possible secrets to unveil themselves (specifically in the Subterranean Grave is the one that annoyed me the most), you will have to take long routes back. My advice, as stated earlier: take the game slow and steady, be aware that there's going to be secrets in every area (there's an item you can buy that makes a noise when there's a secret yet to be found in a room, this is a completionist's best friend) and if you're struggling to find something, think it over, and use what you have at your disposal.", "timestamp_created": 1657342542, "timestamp_updated": 1657342542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118428830": {"recommendationid": "118428830", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998508470", "num_games_owned": 429, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1657252530}, "language": "english", "review": "If I wanted to play games that are designed to quickly and routinely kill you in one or two hits, I'd go back to 80's era coin-op.", "timestamp_created": 1657252646, "timestamp_updated": 1657252646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427066624164581299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118423699": {"recommendationid": "118423699", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095989327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1630948485}, "language": "english", "review": "I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1657244721, "timestamp_updated": 1657244721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118346766": {"recommendationid": "118346766", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997553202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1657159781}, "language": "english", "review": "Quit to Menu: The Game\n\nLiterally my entire experience with this game is Fight a boss, kill the boss, step into the next room and immediately die (quit to menu), fight the boss again, then backtrack to the previous save point before attempting to make any further progress.\n\nI actually hate this game.", "timestamp_created": 1657140903, "timestamp_updated": 1657157269, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466058969497680664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118324543": {"recommendationid": "118324543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039471478", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1669087492}, "language": "english", "review": "Most fun I had in a while.\n10/10 will play again.", "timestamp_created": 1657116019, "timestamp_updated": 1657116019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118306802": {"recommendationid": "118306802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044144092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1656869391}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun metroidvania with souls style save/healing item system.

Luckily, later on, you'll have a tons of upgrade that makes you quite OP and mistakes would become less punishing.

Sure, the pathways diverge, but there's only, perhaps, 3 or 4 points where the paths substantially go in seperate ways. Otherwise they always wrap around to each other or lead to dead ends. When heading in the right direction you're mostly going in a linear path. So you won't get confusion to any significant degree. Perhaps due to the short length the game never gets overly complicated in its map.\n\n\tSpeaking of, they could've color coded the map to differentiate the different areas from one another. It doesn't help when you're trying to backtrack and don't remember exactly where a specific area is, so you have to go off memory. Especially when you can transform as a cat, and can backtrack to gather that one optional item (that gives you no benefit except money).\n\n\tThere's a battle system comprising of the same 3 hit combo and ranged arrows. By 2016 (its release date), you'd expect more from a combat system. Momodora plays like something from 1991 with its basic 3 hit melee attack. There's no huge flaw here, it's just oddly simplistic. \n\n\tThe ranged attack has definite problems, though. The arrows are unleashed via a button; they generally do very little damage. They can be charged for a stronger volley, but you'll also lose the charge easily. Dodged? Charge lost. Climbed a ladder? Inexplicably lost the charge. You can even lose the charge if you let go off the arrow button too early, which messes up the, \"charge while melee attacking\" strat sometimes. It takes a decent amount of time to charge, so that hurts.\n\n\tWith that said, the arrows aren't at the point where they make your melee attacks worthless. So it's decently balanced, even with the charge issues. I just wish you had more nuance to the combat, but given that the enemies are just as simple it's not a surprise.\n\n\tThe real angle here is the sprite work. Like everything else, the sprite work isn't complex. But it's attractive in its simplicity. Some of the background work is wallpaper-tier. Just as everything else, I wasn't astounded in this respect either, but I did appreciate the quality. The music also nets its share of praise, but I find its overstated for what's here. It's good, but not exemplary.\n\n\tReverie under the Moonlight is actually the 4th Momodora game, in a series dating back to 2010. It's a prequel; not that it matters given how little story it has. It's a solidly made game, and far more polished than anything before it. But it simultaneously has no deep alure to it either. It's a weird spot to be in when your game has no issues and is competently made, but is also easily forgotten.

Bow shots are snappy and zip across the screen. Charged shots pack a large punch, which makes the wait worth it.\n[*][h3]General Enemies[/h3]\nEnemy placement is generally good. Most of the time, you can either play aggressively to quickly clear a screen, or play safer and pick enemies one at a time. General enemies are all unique and don't seem to have any BS attacks. They are well telegraphed and easy to learn.\n[/list]\n[h2]Art and Music[/h2]\nBoth are great. The pixel art is pretty and ages well. This game has a strong visual identity. The music is pleasant in the background. I believe it conveys the eerie and melancholic atmosphere well. The music during boss fights open up to create a tense feel, without being intrusive. One of my favorite tracks is \"Pardoner's Dance\" vs Fennel. It's easily the standout piece of the entire game.\n\n\n[h1]Neutrals[/h1]\n[h2]Bosses[/h2]\nThis section still skews towards the positive side. The bosses are all really unique with their own quirks. Overall, they're very fun to tackle, but some attacks don't seem as well telegraphed as enemies. Either I'm unobservant or they really don't telegraph well. I noticed some minor viability problems, such as Lubella's falling orbs. The initial particles are a bit hard to pinpoint before they form into solid orbs.\n\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[h2]The Map[/h2]\nThis definitely isn't a deal breaker, but I found myself having a hard time navigating around the world.

The pixel graphics are really well done and the combat is truly excellent.  It does not wear out its welcome, I played through the game in about 5 hours.  One thing the game could REALLY use is some way to place markers on the map.  There were multiple places I wanted to revisit but had no idea where to find them, as the map is just a monocolored grid and did not help much.  Besides that one rather large complaint, everything else about Momodora was good or great, I enjoyed it.  \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1650400918, "timestamp_updated": 1680969401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113941632": {"recommendationid": "113941632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256558967", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1612763771}, "language": "english", "review": "While I don't have many hours recorded here on steam, I have played this for at least 200 hours on my Xbox.

Figuring out how to get the true ending wasn't too hard, it just required some back tracking and paying attention. \n\nMy only gripe probably isn't the fault of the developer but, the controls on my PS3 controller would go apeshit in the menus. Without even touching any buttons, the cursor would move about. This didn't happen during game play so I'm a little puzzled myself. It is probably my controller but, why didn't the main character go apeshit during gameplay?\n\nOverall, an above average metroidvania game worth your time and munny stars. :)", "timestamp_created": 1647202848, "timestamp_updated": 1647202848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654823422431945801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112002149": {"recommendationid": "112002149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118683698", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1647039888}, "language": "english", "review": "Talentless attempt to make something that looks like video game.", "timestamp_created": 1647040076, "timestamp_updated": 1647040076, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365880906581878662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111868900": {"recommendationid": "111868900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851671716", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1672913740}, "language": "english", "review": "Best booba", "timestamp_created": 1646843335, "timestamp_updated": 1646843335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111811138": {"recommendationid": "111811138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805323567", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1646867737}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a solid metroidvania.

I just love it. pixel art has always been one of my favorite art styles in games and other forms of art. so the art in this game is really damn amazing. in this game. the bosses, enemies, and characters feel so unique.  the attacks and the sounds they make in this game are so satisfying to pull off. music is also, great. along with the backgrounds and sounds. it's really amazing. I like everything about this game. lore is good. not much of it. but it's good for a short game like this. which in my opinion is probably the only bad thing. but it's also, good. I wish that it was longer. But maybe the replay value of the game would take a hit. so I like how it is now too. talking about the replay value of this game for me is amazing. it's short and the controls are so easy to get the hang off. that I come back every few months and play it like 2 to 5 times. I first found this game on Xbox game pass. and 100%ed it. they then removed it from there. so I couldn't play anymore. so I went ahead and bought it on steam and did all the achievements again lol. it's really fun. that's really the base of it. it's just so damn fun to play. and to watch other people play it. I wish it was more popular. i know it got big. but it's been years since it first came out. so it's not as big as it use to be. But hopefully, since the 5th game in the series is coming out.

It shows me the ropes, but it does that to throw me down a flying fox. Momodora RUtM does not do that. The bossfights often felt more like an exercise in waiting down a timer than a tightly designed contest of skill, which is made worse by the alternate ranged attack, which does only a small amount of damage but is very safe to use.\n\nMaybe that's wrong, maybe the exploration, the collectables, the experience of existing in such a nice world is the core of the game. I think overall, this is a death by a thousand cuts. The combat would be good enough for a game this short! ...if only the pacing was tighter. Why is the pacing loose? ...Because of the map design, and the lack of directions you're given, and the lack of variety when backtracking!\n\nThis game will hit the sweet spot for some people.

But they try too hard with it.\nThere's even like 2 boss fights that only happen because of a stupid assumption.\n\nAnd did I care about these people? [u]No. Not a single bit.[/u] The story is actually nonexistent. The atmosphere and dialogue are cliche as hell. The dark themes don't exist either. And the \"lore\" is a crutch for not actually having any fucking storytelling at all.\n\n[quote=the publisher] Momodora: RUTM shouldn\u2019t exactly be categorized as \u201cMetroidvania\u201d or \u201cSouls-like\u201d, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it\u2019s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you\u2019ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too. [/quote]\nMore lies.\nFirst of all, it's barely a platformer. You have a crap double jump and an imprecise air dodge. There's no interesting platforming. Unless enemies knocking you off counts as engaging. \nAlso there's instadeath pits and spikes.... in a platformer...\n\n\"Metroidvania\"? It's effectively linear. The only \"exploration\" you ever unlock that isn't a specific key is when you unlock Cat form. And that [i]only[/i] allows you to get more lousy HP upgrades.\n\n\"Souls-Like\"? Yeah maybe if in Dark Souls you die instantly from everything on your way anywhere and are unfairly punished for trying to do fun things. Oh, and in dark-souls your weapon sucks, I think? Yeah this game has that too I guess. And a healing flask. It's basically dark souls.\n\n[quote=nobody] Music [/quote]\nOh uhhh, it exists? I think? I remember 2 distinct songs playing... I can't remember what they were like though. I think almost all the areas are silent. \n\n\nAnd since I didn't have anywhere else to put this: I quit due to missing a shortcut to a checkpoint near the second boss. After dying to it like 2 times, I made it to the second phase... where I had to hit a giant witch in the boobs.\nI just uninstalled instantly. Then a friend convinced me to go back and do the whole thing. Was it worth it? Yeah area 2 is by far the worst, but the game still sucks.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nCONCLUSION: this is the most overrated game I have EVER played and I am absolutely astonished at its reviews and how much everyone likes it. It is a paragon of outdated, bad design and mediocrity. Maybe I'm really bad at souls-likes, but I can't be convinced that this game isn't a bad souls-like itself\n\nPlay Hollow Knight instead.

This game has quite a lot of pros and a few cons which I will explain while critiquing the ever-present categories of story, gameplay, world design, music and sound design, art and graphics, and main mechanics.\n\n\t       Let\u2019s start with the category in which I think I have the most real-world experience: art and graphics.  Momodora is a pretty pixel game with colorful characters and locations.  All the enemies are unique from each other and most have interesting designs.  The bosses look especially good.  I don\u2019t think there were any areas that I found myself confused with animations or anything of the sort, so overall, the game is communicative and stylish at the same time.  In the category of art and graphic design, Momodora scores an 10/10.\n\tNext, we have the gameplay.  As I said in the introduction, this game takes a lot of cues from the games made by From Software such as the Dark Souls series, but it also takes a lot of tropes from standard 2d platformers.  There is a dodge-roll that has I-frames and a great many items that have both gameplay use and lore/story implications.  The dodge-roll, however, is not as integral a feature as it is in the Dark Souls games.  I believe it would be entirely feasible to complete the game without the roll, especially since I did a great deal of my dodging with the standard movement options otherwise.  There are quite a few items that I found quite useful and even fun.  In a classic Souls fashion, there is even a hyper-mode that you can achieve using a couple items in combination to help you deal out an obnoxious amount of damage.  In addition to these other abilities and items, there is also a ranged attack that you start with which gets upgrades throughout the game.  There are a few side-quests, only one of which did I actually finish to get the true ending of the game.  The bosses are fun, challenging, and inspired.  The enemies are unique in their attacks and movement.  My only gripe with the game is that it suffers from the same problem as Dark Souls games.  It doesn\u2019t in any way need a difficulty slider as I don\u2019t think the game is made for it, even though I did play on hard (which was the hardest difficult available to me).  The game increases its difficulty by adding more enemies, increasing their damage, and decreasing the amount of health that you start with (and probably end with.  This is cranked up to the point where early-game enemies can one or two-shot you.  This isn\u2019t all bad, but the difficulty feels very shallow and feels like it falls off pretty early once you pick up one of the many health upgrades.  Overall, the game is fun, even with its difficulty choices.  The game also has NG+ as well as an \u201cinsane\u201d mode after the completion of hard mode.  In the category of gameplay, Momodora scores a 9/10.\n\n\t       World design is up next.  This game is heavily reminiscent of Metroid games in terms of the map and world layout.  The player moves from screen to screen similarly to Metroid or Mega Man.  There are secret breakable walls to access special areas and items.  Bosses can be fought in a non-linear fashion and areas can be accessed similarly.  The world is pretty connected with each area usually connecting to at least three other areas.  I was satisfied with the distance between save points and the late addition of the ability to warp between them.  Overall, I think the world design was well done.  In the category of world design, Momodora scores a 9/10.  \n\n\t       Story was a surprisingly big part of this game, even though it had the clear influence of From Software games.  The story, heavily summarized, is that you play as a priestess named Kaho who is on a journey to stop the spread of, and hopefully cure, a curse that has spread to her village using the power of her leaf (which she uses as a weapon) and her faith.  The item descriptions are quite additive to the lore of the story, but the characters throughout the game do a pretty good job telling it to you through their actions and dialogue.  I was pleased with the characters and story for the most part.  In the category of story, Momodora scores an 8/10.\n\n\t       The music in the game wasn\u2019t anything special, but it wasn\u2019t anything abrasive either (in most cases at least).  The soundtrack sounds simple.  I think that\u2019s the best way to describe it.  The instrumentals feel a little bare, but at least they are contextually fitting.  There was one \u201csong\u201d that was actually painful after listening to it for a long period of time, but I can\u2019t remember which area\u2019s ambiance it was.  Otherwise, as I said, I didn\u2019t find most of the music abrasive in any way.  In the category of music, Momodora scores a 6/10.\n\n\t       I think I can confidently say that the game\u2019s main mechanic was that the vast majority of the characters (enemies, NPCs, and otherwise) were female.  If I recall correctly, only one character was male, and one boss was debatably male.  Otherwise, the entire cast was female.  Fun and \u201ccultured\u201d mechanic, scores 10/10.\n\n\t       I honestly really enjoyed this game.  I enjoyed it enough to play it in one long sitting, and I feel like I never do that.  I can confidently recommend it to any Dark Souls fans who also like a bit of fanservice mixed with platforming.\n\nCumulative Score: 52/60", "timestamp_created": 1641268158, "timestamp_updated": 1641268282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107262531": {"recommendationid": "107262531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062395258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1641336714}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fine.

Much better than most of the other small cheaper ones out here, defininely worth playing I'd say. The core story and experience is pretty short, but it feels good, has some clear story, progresion, interesting enviornments and enemies, and is overall pretty solid and tight in its controls and gameplay. There's a good number of extra things to hunt for if you really want to, and to challenge yourself with like collecting the items or such for a bit of extra time.\n\nIf you want something with a much higher and more detailed story, this is lacking as it keeps it more simple and vague, a little bit like Dark Souls in that regard, they pull off the feel at least, but the underlying story is still a thousand times simpler, but it does feel nice for the most part.\n\nMy biggest praise is that it's ballanced, sort of. More recent games I've tried like Skull, Dead Cells, etc... have a focus on randomness in their content. And such systems tend to result in you just sometimes getting back luck, in fact most of the time having sub par luck, and not having the best or desired gear or equipment or enemies for what you have so you just have a really hard and sometimes downright unfair type of time. None of that in this game. You can reliably enough beat the entire game with your default attacks without taking a single hit between bell visits (bonfires, mini save points). In fact that's the insane difficulty, you die if you ever take one hit. And it was honeslty quite refreshing, when I fight the enemies I learn their skills, and counter them with my pre built abilities they are designed to fight against. I always CAN beat them fairly. Now, that said if you're not as good or just want it to be easier, there's easier difficulties and even on harder ones some great items you can get that franklly when stacked in the right ways can power through some bosses entire health in literally seconds by burning these, so you can get overpowered to an extent if you want. Though it's also worth saying these best items are mainly gotten by beating bosses without taking any damage, do that and they drop their special loot. Some of it can be bought at merchants otherwise but it's often pricey that way.\nOverall, good game, nice atmosphere and entertaining combat. I replayed it several times and did bother to do the insane difficulty run beating all main bosses with no hits (there's an optional one I plan to try that with later but expect her to be harder than any other boss on insane by a notable bit).", "timestamp_created": 1638763148, "timestamp_updated": 1638763148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105311590": {"recommendationid": "105311590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035944557", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8652, "last_played": 1638739712}, "language": "english", "review": "this game has everything! boobs, big boobs and cats! and u get to be a cat what more do u want from a vidya gaem??", "timestamp_created": 1638731167, "timestamp_updated": 1638731167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104925644": {"recommendationid": "104925644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244470632", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 409, "last_played": 1662780088}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice, short little metroidvania, that has nice looking pixel art, and satisfying gameplay.

The locations, scenery, and tone of the game are very well translated through the artstyle and while at times it could get a little tough to discern the foreground from the background, overall it was very nice. \n\nThe gameplay, at the very least at the very beginning, can be very tedious. Your movement is limited to a double jump and a roll at the very start, with enemies that can kill you in 2-3 hits and a lot of repetition from death. This could make some players leave the game very early on, but once you reach about the halfway point and obtain two very important items, movement in this game becomes much much faster and a breeze in a lot of cases.\n\nThe combat is pretty simple, with a short range melee attack which can hit both on the ground and in the air, as well as a long range attack which can be charged (after getting 2 certain ingame items this can become the best attack method), and a variety of enemies, at least in terms of design. They can all be killed in 2-6 hits, and since you cause a lot of hit stun when attacking them, they aren't ever really an issue. \n\nItems in this game are near critical for making this game more tolerable both movement wise and combat wise. You can purchase an item which replenishes your health after defeating each enemy, an item that makes your long range attack have a poison affect, etc. You will have to explore and grind for money to obtain some but it is very worth it once you have them.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty short, it only took about 5 hours to complete total, and the enemies and bosses, while sometimes cheap feeling, and really much of a hassle and can be dealt with relatively quickly (especially when using your long range attack).", "timestamp_created": 1637894106, "timestamp_updated": 1637894106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103925804": {"recommendationid": "103925804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198884103661", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1638394501}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game", "timestamp_created": 1637869707, "timestamp_updated": 1637869707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103795045": {"recommendationid": "103795045", "author": {"steamid": "76561199019085429", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1642905017}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego con historia y continuidad, de esos juegos en los que podes disfrutar cada parte por separado y a\u00fan as\u00ed lograr que sean una experiencia \u00fanica.

Dying means you go all the way back to your last save point. \n\nI did enjoy some boss fights that were hard but fair, but for real the common enemy can 2 shot you OFF SCREEN and you have no way of knowing where they are and your bow will not hit them either.

I would absolutely recommend it to fans of the genre, especially if you like stuff like Touhou as well. It certainly isn't Hollow Knight (I don't think that game will be surpassed for a long time, its genuinely the crown jewel of the genre to the point where Metroid and certainly Castlevania's names should probably just be replaced in its nickname with Hollow Knight-like), but it is a great choice for scratching that itch again should it ever come up. \n\nMomodora's aesthetic combines the brightly colored, constantly shifting and afterimage-creating neo-32-bit goodness of Cave Story, the elegant \"everyone and every monster is a girl\" nonsexual cuteness of Touhou, and the melancholic heft of, well, Hollow Knight or Bloodborne to create a perfect balance between a comfort game and a more weighty action-platforming adventure. Its difficulty level is complementary, too, with enemies being tricky enough that you can't just blaze through like an idiot spamming healing, but likewise without any really absurd or sadistic encounters that mark the game out as a hardcore test of reflexes. Arguably the most significant aspect of this game is its sound design. The sharp, compressed MIDI-bass sound of your adorable, pastoral priestess heroine striking enemies with her enchanted leaf is every bit as snappy and satisfying as Hollow Knight's nail, and the music tracks perfectly reflect the pretty, girly melancholy that the game itself exudes, to the point where its fun to listen to by itself, your fond memories of the game alone being enough to keep it company. \n\nThe level design is just servicable, and the game overall is short but sweet, with the difficulty and mechanical innovations being probably not significant enough to pose an interest for real nuts and bolts loving skill based gamers. But for what it is, that being a $20 Metroidvania, Momodora's very respectable vibes are enough to make it a gem worthy of much more than the recognition it has gotten. Maybe before you play another 2D graphics Dark Souls III hoping that it will give you back what beating Hollow Knight took away from you, give this game a glance.", "timestamp_created": 1631930602, "timestamp_updated": 1631930602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552238821983337402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99378506": {"recommendationid": "99378506", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125731072", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 705, "last_played": 1633236446}, "language": "english", "review": "tis' really good from graphics to the OST, combined with tight gameplay makes it a really good experience\n", "timestamp_created": 1631685973, "timestamp_updated": 1631685973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99274614": {"recommendationid": "99274614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293102732", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1575678211}, "language": "english", "review": "Pardoner Fennel my beloved <3", "timestamp_created": 1631514670, "timestamp_updated": 1631514670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99260708": {"recommendationid": "99260708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834751756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1631941961}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego, mec\u00e1nicas simples pero satisfactorias", "timestamp_created": 1631489127, "timestamp_updated": 1631489127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99148991": {"recommendationid": "99148991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134712580", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1321, "last_played": 1631346534}, "language": "english", "review": "Had this game sitting in my library for quite some time and decided to give it a shot.

Yes, the game is hard (more so depending on the difficulty and if you're aiming for some of the trophies) but you can't really call it unfair as you'll be more or less okay if you master the mechanics\n\nSome things to consider:\n\n-The game is short. I started it on a friday and finished it on a sunday by playing it initially on hard without previous knowledge. Like other games, you get to a point where you understand how to dodge or avoid damage, making it easier than what it looks.\n\n-The story is not all that interesting. I know this isn't the first game in the series but it's one of those where there's lore on the item description and the characters tell you snippets of the story and what happened. I don't have a complete problem with that but I feel it's kind of a crutch to make it seem \"Deep\".\n\n-The attacks are very basic. I know I said before the combat is solid but it's attached to how you only have one combo and one shooting attack. As you probably know this means a lot of getting close to a boss, combo it, get out quickly, throw some arrows, rinse and repeat. I went into the game thinking you would have a loadout of weapons or something but that's not the case. There's some accessories to help you on your way but that's pretty much it \n\n-The achievements are BS. I've never liked those \"complete the game without dying\" or \"complete the game avoiding x thing that's all over the map\" and I feel are only there to squeeze more gaming time. I respect people that like it but it feels cheap that, if you like to see the completion mark in 100%, you need to grind and suffer\n\nAll in all, it's a very short experience but it's an experience nonetheless.

La est\u00e9tica, su m\u00fasica, los personajes y sobre todo su jugabilidad lo ubican en ese puesto (hac\u00eda rato que no me enganchaba tanto con un juego).\n\nAlgunas cosas a tener en cuenta si es que estas pensando en comprar este t\u00edtulo:\n-Lo corre casi el 98% de las pcs (requisitos m\u00ednimos muy bajos y 60 fps estables).\n-Es un juego que recompensa much\u00edsimo al jugador curioso: Su mapa es bastante grande, los paisajes son hermosos (se sacan capturas de pantalla 24/7) y las zonas est\u00e1n conectadas con l\u00f3gica.\n-Ideal si se busca un desaf\u00edo: Momodora RUtM no es un t\u00edtulo el cual se golpee todo lo que se cruza y as\u00ed ir avanzando (a lo hack and slash). Los enemigos (en dificultad normal) con 3 o 4 golpes nos dan un game over (yo lo estoy terminando por 3era vez en dificultad insano, y hasta los minions m\u00e1s d\u00e9biles te one shotean de un golpe). Por eso el juego brinda un bot\u00f3n de dodge, que nos permite esquivar el ataque enemigo y punishearlo (esto mismo pasa a la inversa: si se ataca sin pensar o a lo loco, el enemigo punishea).\n-Diversidad de objetos que nos permiten armar diferentes builds para pasar el juego (much\u00edsimo replay value con los items y las m\u00faltiples dificultades, sumado a los logros de steam).\n-Los jefes, que no son muchos (10, 2 sub jefes y un jefe secreto) poseen personalidades \u00fanicas y logran ser memorables. Lo bueno de Momodora: RUtM es que al estar tan bien construidas las conexiones entre las zonas permite una exploraci\u00f3n y orden de jefes para nada lineal (con esto me refiero a que, por ejemplo, el jefe del monasterio  fue mi cuarto jefe en la primera partido, el quinto en mi partida de dificultad dif\u00edcil y ahora es el s\u00e9ptimo en mi partida en dificultad insano. Sin dudas mi jefe favorito).\n\nAlgunas cosas que no me gustaron:\n-La visualizaci\u00f3n del mapa est\u00e1 todo en un mismo color; la \u00fanica forma de saber cu\u00e1l zona es \"la de arriba del mapa\" o \"la que est\u00e1 a la derecha del mapa\" es con la memoria (aunque como dije antes, al estar tan bien unido el mundo que el juego plantea, no es un gran problema).\n-Algunos personajes secundarios pasan completamente desapercibidos y no aportan mucho a la narrativa.\n-El lore, que es buen\u00edsimo, no se explota al 100% (igual, dir\u00eda que se lo explota un 89%).\n-New Game + no brinda mucho contenido extra al juego.\n\nCuando termine el juego en dificultad insano, har\u00e9 una gu\u00eda explicando builds recomendadas, objetos y orden de jefes para poder sacar el logro de steam.\nRecomendad\u00edsimo 10/10, y esten hype por el Momodora: Moonlit Farewell", "timestamp_created": 1630514470, "timestamp_updated": 1630522276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98617647": {"recommendationid": "98617647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134396068", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1630506286}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the most beautiful and well-designed Metroidvania I ever played", "timestamp_created": 1630507420, "timestamp_updated": 1630507420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98596386": {"recommendationid": "98596386", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168379692", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1653985158}, "language": "english", "review": "i liked it when i slapped that big mommy gf's tiddies", "timestamp_created": 1630468369, "timestamp_updated": 1630468369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98578114": {"recommendationid": "98578114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116950613", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1643588493}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't remember specific details that well, but I know I absolutely loved the music, gameplay, story, and the unique monsters and bosses along with the memorable and lovable npcs.

It has some non-linear level design, but not to the point where I would consider it a \"metroidvania\". Speaking of which, the level design is great, making the player use every tool at their disposal to traverse most of its world.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Kaho is a priestess from a faraway land who's come to cleanse a curse coming from the kingdom of Karst. Along the way she will meet some of the inhabitants of the kingdom, who will either lend her help or try to kill her. It's not particularly complex, but it does feature multiple endings, which gives the game some replayability, especially if the player's interested in getting every single achievement. \n\nIn terms of presentantion: the music and sound effects are arguably the best part of Momodora: Without spoiling much, they add a lot of tension and a sense of dread to certain parts of the game. The artstyle may be adorable at times, but it definitely doesn't clash with the darker parts of the game. \n\nThe gameplay is nothing special, sadly. The combat is well done and so is the platforming, with both being slower than most other games in the genre,  to the point some people consider it to be a Souls-like (A statement with which I disagree, but I can see why some people would say so). Kaho controls really well, mostly thanks to the controls being very responsive, although it might take a few minutes to get used to the timing of her attacks.\n\nOverall, Momodora. Reverie Under the Moonlight is a great game. It's simple, yet effective in both gameplay and story. Biggest drawback for some might be the fact that it can be beaten in one sitting, but it might be a good reason to get it for others.

You have a leaf (pretty much your sword), and bow and arrow. You have items that act as active and passive abilities. You find hidden walls, NPCs to interact with and do quests for (hidden quests), and lots of exploring. My knocks for this game revolve around enemy variety. There is a lot to be desired.

[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story\n7/10[/td]\n        [td]Story here is nothing to write home about, but thought went into it. Pretty much you are a priestess who is looking to confront the queen because of a curse that has spread to her lands. You then find out once reaching the city where the queen resides, everything went belly up. While what is there is good, I want more. I want lore, hidden memos, something that gives more more pieces to the puzzle. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Exploration\n9/10[/td]\n        [td]There are a lot of secrets to find in the game. Hidden passages, shortcuts and collectibles are out there for you to search. While not the most metroidvania game overall, it nails the exploration. And with the nicely designed world, you will find yourself wanting to see what else is out there. [/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Final Grade\n8/10[/td]\n        [td]Again, keep in mind that you are buying a game that for your first run, will likely finish in 4 hours. That in mind, the game is priced at 9.99 USD. I will recommend it because for what it is, it is a solid game. It just is what I said before, short. Otherwise you should find enjoyment out of it through the exploration, boss battles, and music.

The main draw is that it's very short, but it's an excellent game.\nThe gameplay feels precise, the art and music are very atmospheric and well done. It has a tone similar to Dark Souls, and it's also a fairly difficult game. I do not recommend playing on hard.\nStory's a bit obscured, but I suppose that might be intentional given its inspiration.

(I've beaten it under 4 hours in one go) \n- Has some Easter eggs, cameos, objects and dialogue that seems to bring upon objectives, but in reality they don't, and it ends up in a dead end. (Rip blue prisoner)\n- Does not have checkpoints apart from save spots, and forgetting to save the game to die, will cause you to lose a ton of progress. (to be fair though, save spots are mostly close from each other)\n-Can become infuriating or stressing at harder difficulties, as many enemies have really cheap ways to attack you and instantly kill you.\n- Has few achievements, i think only 10? the game rewards you with goodies for killing bosses without taking damage or treating certain npcs a certain way, and not all achievements reflect that.\n- Ladders are annoying, and this game has too much of that. Just spam jump button while climbing.\n\nPROS:\n- Graphics are lovable, mixing minimalist color palettes mixed with modern art styles. its notorious how much love they have in classic eras of gaming. a huge jump in looks from older Momodora games.\n- Gameplay is addictive, great and challenging, trade in and out combat style having a powerful arsenal of attacks that encourages learning patterns while you push your greed on how many attacks you can get before having to dodge.\n- You can become a kitten\n- Exploration is amazing, with every dedicated area neither being too big or too small. Full of secret rooms, invisible walls and hidden passages, some easy to find and some as hidden and obscure that you will need the help of items to find them.\n- The game does not have a clear order. you will find many paths, and you can do most of them as you please. yes, progression is locked behind keys in some areas, but you still have exploring as the main task, while the game gives objectives trough it.\n- Items are the most important thing to add diversity and define play styles. Id recommend finding those that match and to try the ones that have negative effects on them too. you may find a good use for them.\n- The player never feels overpowered to the enemies and bosses, and having low health in this game is scarier than any other game, as scrolling to the next screen will always respawn enemies, even if you have killed them before. You will grow to like this.\n\nConsclusion:\nMomodora RUTM is an amazing side scroller souls-like metroidvania, that has many mechanics to call their own. Its a very good experience for new players in easier difficulties and a rough challenge for hardcore players in its hard and last unlockable secret difficulty.  The game has a more firm emphasis in platforming and exploration than most games of its kind, raising more questions than answers since mystery and uncertainty rule trough start to its end, visible in its characters, backgrounds and lore.", "timestamp_created": 1629348536, "timestamp_updated": 1629348536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97796402": {"recommendationid": "97796402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284780204", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1629288669}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un hollow knight mas corto y pixelado, engancha bastante ta bueno", "timestamp_created": 1629288706, "timestamp_updated": 1629288706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97780523": {"recommendationid": "97780523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118935059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1629263681}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun action platformer.

It's very short, even after getting both endings. 7/10 at least, but I can't recommend it.\n\nThe game is very cheap. But for 2 hours I don't feel I got a lot out of it - as I'm not much of an achievement hunter.\n\nThe game is challenging in a weird way. Entering a room one way can have enemies attack you from off-screen, but entering the opposite way can have the same enemies facing away and be easy targets for a quick kill. Combat isn't hard but when you get hit, you usually get hit very hard. However, healing or save points are usually not an issue. Some enemies have some really questionable hitboxes, so beware. Bosses are usually more fair, but still require some trial and error - though rarely frustrating.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from a Metroidvania. You can't go somewhere? Perhaps you'll get an ability to help you later, so remember to come back. Rub your face against the walls and look for hidden passages and try not to get lost. I got 98% map completion without effort. Navigation isn't too hard, thanks to a mostly comprehensive map that's only one button away.\n\nYou later get the ability to warp between save points. But it's a weird trade-off that I don't think I've seen in other Metroidvanias. You warp with save points, instead of warp rooms. That's a nice convenience. But you can only warp to SPECIFIC save points in each area, and the game doesn't show you where before you do, so you'll have to memorise it instead, or look up a map. Again, a trade-off. Not necessarily worse than other Metroidvanias, just not an outright improvement.\n\nFor the story? You're a priestess who's charged with ridding a city of a curse that's spreading. You do this by slapping the demons away with a giant leaf. Very nice! After that, it's whatever the NPCs tell you, but you probably don't need to worry about that. However, you don't really feel like the story is progressing at all. I had no idea I was getting close to, or fighting the final boss until I actually defeated them and suddenly got the Bad Ending. It caught be by surprise, since there was no build-up unless I literally missed it. All I could do was find out what I was missing and try again. And what are my thoughts?\n\nSpoiler warning: [spoiler] I got the Bad Ending because I hadn't yet found a box of winds to spin a windmill (that I should have been able to rotate with my arms...) and dipped my leap in a puddle of water below, turning it green. After that all I had to do was go back to the same boss and defeat them in the exact same way. Only difference is that instead of TWO phases, now it had THREE. And what is the difference between the endings?\n\nIn the Bad Ending, you die from the curse, but don't lift it. Oops.\n\nIn the True Ending, you die from the curse, but lift it. Oh, but it's cool your spirit totally lives on and stuff. All that extra legwork really paid off. [/spoiler]\n\nIn the end, I'm just feeling disappointed by the experience. I primarily play for fun and feeling like I accomplish something, but your take on either may differ from mine.

I purchased this game on a whim because of my desire to play something metroidvania style, and little did I know the gem that I had come across. Momodora:RUtM is nothing short of an absolute must have for your library. Not only is this game packing some great visuals, great animations, beautifully built worlds, but the gameplay is so spot on. The balance in platforming, bosses, and enemy types were all mixed into a very very well done, high energy combat experience.\n\nNot only did the developers nail every aspect of this experience, but they even gave you more reason to play through multiple times with how great it is to play. This is definitely a title I see myself coming back to over the years just as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night has been. \n\nAnd don't let the cute aesthetics fool you; this game will kick your rear end. Some of these fights really do get tough and some segments really need your focus to be sharp. My only regret with the game is that I wish there was more of it because I didn't want it to end. In the future, this company will most certainly have me excited with anything else they release.

You play as Kaho a mage who is sent on a mission to end the disturbance affecting the area. Upon doing so, you will meet a cast of characters/bosses that add more to the overarching story.\n\nPersonal Preface:\nMomodora: RutM is my very first Momodora game. It is, apparently, the 4th title in the franchise. I was only introduced to this particular game since I knew some of the developers. As a good friend, I did help to spread publicity by word of mouth upon release. As  bad friend, I only recently played this game even though I knew about it well into development.\n\nMy first playthrough kept me very immersed in the Momodora universe. The mechanics of the game made me feel that this was a hybrid of games like Metroid/Castlevania, obviously, as well as other platform-based genres like Megaman. Adding new abilities and discovering new areas or enemies made the game fun and challenging. Even upon completing my first playthrough, there is an in-built incentive to play again. A New Game+ would invite you to finish exploring the map, and complete no-hit challenges against bosses. The community has also spurred on various challenges to increase the difficulty even more (dashless, leaf-only etc).\n\nOverall, I found the art to be cohesive and visually pleasing without any major detriments. The character designs are interesting and enjoyable. Interactions with NPCs are more involved than you would assume. The music is fitting. From different areas like the marsh to the cathedral, the tracks encompass where you area in the story and the gravity of the scenario. A favorite track is Pardoner's Dance, a wonderful boss theme that uses piano to build the drama and tension of the battle. Yes, actual instruments, not chiptunes.\n\nNot everything about Momodora: RutM is perfect. Is Momodora: RutM standalone? Was it designed to be? I felt that I was always an observer in this tale. While the driving motivation never waned, I think there were more questions than answers even by the end of the game. Perhaps the game is dependent on the history of the previous three or perhaps the universe is meant to be fragmented and disjointed. Hidden lore could have helped to alleviate this issue that retells the history or updates the player of the events leading up to present day. \n\nTL;DR version: Good game with nice art and music.

The warp system only takes you to a specific bell in an area and you have to work your way through enemies to get to whichever bell you need to be at to progress. This was somewhat frustrating at times considering that this game does promote backtracking in order to find special items and collectibles.

For a good palate cleanser of a game.\n\n[h1]One Priestess to Stop a Deadly Curse [/h1]\nBasic premise/Story\n\nFrom developer studio, Bombservice and directed rdein. Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is an indie metroidvania where you play as a young priestess named Kaho as she journeys to the eastern kingdom of Karst to stop a curse that has been corrupting nearby lands including her village. \n\n[h1]A Leaf and a Bow? [/h1]\nUnique Gameplay\n\nThe game oozes with 2D bit aesthetics that are both charming and minimalistic. There weren't a whole lot of systems involved to remember. Except using a bow and your leaf to attack enemies, consumables option and even some handy items/spells you can use during combat. Each giving off a passive or active effect. Momodora doesn\u2019t even take that long to beat with my playthrough clocking at just a little bit over four hours. With 99% map completion. The music, while subtle, helped give to life many areas you will visit throughout the map in Momodora. Yet it doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome. There are plenty of save options nearby to save your progress and restore your health and consumables while on the go. Usually bringing up the map and going back to places you previously couldn\u2019t enter is recommended once you gain a key ability that will allow the player to traverse into the new zone. Making backtracking a breeze and using new abilities to traverse is fun. \n\n[h1]Moving the Curtain Aside.[/h1]\nFinal thoughts/Ruminations\n\nTo my utter surprise I was quite captivated by Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight. It\u2019s been some time since I played a metroidvania game and I was hooked by how minimalistic the game details its world, inhabitants, lore and more without saying too much. While I would appreciate some more world-building to flesh out the game some more. I believe Momodora does an adequate job in selling the game\u2019s premise to fans. There is no need to saturate the game further when it would break the balance and momentum of what the game already tries to convey to the player. Not much I can critique on the game, besides wishing for more music tracks. The gameplay was simple and effective by relying on the mechanics given at the start. Players can go deeper with combos in tandem to combat some bosses the game throws at you. In addition to some new abilities you will gain later on to help with traversal and combat. The story surprised me deeply and I couldn\u2019t help, but be touched by the ending. Without any context, it goes into a direction I found fitting albeit one I didn\u2019t expect at all. Still Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a must for newcomers or veterans of the metroidvania genre looking for something new, charming and short.  \n\nTotal Times Beaten: 1\nScore: 8/10 \nDate Finished: 5/21/21\nDate Reviewed: 5/21/21\nHours Played: 4.14 hours\n", "timestamp_created": 1621649457, "timestamp_updated": 1621649457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92385410": {"recommendationid": "92385410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340847703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 277, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1621593818}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick Description:\n-Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is the 4th entry in the Momodora series and is hands down the most polished version of the series.  This is a cute, mini metroidvania that metroidvania fans are likely going to enjoy.  It's a one man team and is quite rough around the edges, but makes up for it w/ charm and engaging combat.\n\nWhat's Good:\n-This game has a ton of charm.  There are a lot of cute characters and npcs all over the map.  Even some of the larger than life bosses are adorable looking characters.  I like the contrast between the brutal combat and the cute characters.  There are enemies that kill in 2-3 hits and spikes that instantly kill you.  You would never expect that from such an adorable looking game.\n-I'm a big fan of the pixel art.  I like the way the bosses look, the impact when you hit enemies w/ your weapons, and when small star-like currency flies out of dead enemies.  The environment itself is serviceable, although not as polished as top tier games.\n-The boss fights are hands down the most fun and challenging part of this game.  There are a quite few bosses in this 5 hourish game.  Some of small and agile, while others are very imposing and towering above you.  These bosses hit hard and are tough.   Memorizing their patterns and equipping the right powerups are key to victory.\n-Lots of secrets to find.  I really loved exploring the world.  This is not that big of a metroidvania and the map isn't great, but traversing the world is still really fun.  You will be heavily rewarded for checking every square inch the map.  Some secrets are really obvious, while others are more obtuse.  Being able to equip more health potions, finding powerful relics, or simply gaining health can all be found if you search hard enough.\n-You have a basic short ranged four leaf clover and a long range bow.  I loved that they chose a four leaf clover to be used as a weapon.  It's small things like this that make Momodora stand out.  You can unlock powerups that make your arrows poisonous or add flames to your attacks.\n\nCould Use a Few Changes:\n-Very difficult during the first 2 hrs.  You are way under-powered and thrown into the deep in.  During the first 30 minutes, there are several enemies that can 2-hit you.  Even after the first hr, there are a ton of enemies that can 3 hit you.  There are also lots of instant death spikes to avoid while platforming.  This is going to cause a lot of players to give up before really enjoying the meat of this game.\n-Pacing could use a lot of work.  I think this game would have benefit from adding one to two more areas and making this closer to a 8 hr experience.  Basically, as of right now, you spend your first two hrs dying left and right, then by the 4 hr mark, you become an incredibly overpowered tank that can brute force its way through almost everything.  If this game were a little longer, then they could have made the beginning a bit easier, and had a longer build up until you become extremely powerful.\n-Most people do not enjoy one hit death spikes.  They are used quite a bit here, especially in the second half of the game.  There has to be more creative ways to add new challenges to the end of the game.\n-Some areas of the map are kind of bizarre, and you can tell that this game lacks the polish that the best in the genre have.  You will also see quite a bit of duplicate enemies throughout the game.  Some enemies from the very beginning will also be at the very end in the same form.  This is not ideal imo.\n\nThoughts:\n-I'm glad that I finally got around to playing Momodora.  I haven't played any of the other games in the series, but I've been told that this one is the best and most well rounded of the 4.  There is a final 5th game in the works which I'm excited to check out.  This isn't a perfect game but it's a competent metroidvania that fans of the genre should check out.  The dev was clearly inspired by Dark Souls and the challenging, methodical combat is one of the highlights of the game.\n\nConsensus:\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  It's only $10 new but is an absolute steal right now while it's on sale for $4.  If you are scrambling to binge another metroidvania, than Momodora Reverie of the Moonlight is a fun one worthy of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1621647681, "timestamp_updated": 1621648859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92340088": {"recommendationid": "92340088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243525206", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1697939944}, "language": "english", "review": "i smacked a blue girls tiddies with a sword and they jiggled 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1621573679, "timestamp_updated": 1621573679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92339409": {"recommendationid": "92339409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030451917", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 347, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 568, "last_played": 1587501816}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent Metroidvania, Slightly Challenging, Janky Hitboxes on Higher Difficulties, Story wasn't anything special.", "timestamp_created": 1621572174, "timestamp_updated": 1621572174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92121051": {"recommendationid": "92121051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059926226", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1659621276}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Precioso.", "timestamp_created": 1621196075, "timestamp_updated": 1621196075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91955913": {"recommendationid": "91955913", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067442602", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1659990879}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La verdad es una joyita, la jugabilidad es genial, el pixel art es precioso y la m\u00fasica acaba de darle ese toque como oscuro, la exploraci\u00f3n es bastante divertida a mi parecer.

Once all the upgrades are collected, the game is much easier, but the opponents stay exactly the same.

If you love the genre, your enjoyment is guaranteed.\nThe pace is relatively fast but never so much that you can get away with just button smashing. Furthermore there are some sections that focus more on platforming and offer a decent break from the fighting.\n-There are upgrades, items and secrets for the player to find but not so many that you end up spending hours upon hours to find out what to do to progress the game.\n-This was one of my first metroidvanias and I found it accessible and endearing. A great introduction to the genre.\n-The art and the soundtrack both looks amazing. I wish there was an exploration mode where one can just go around and talk to the characters of this world -that is how compelling Momodora looks and sounds.\n\nThe Negatives\n\n-A bit easy during the first time one plays it. I died only a few times, all during boss battles and even those took no more than a third try.\n-A little on the short side. I finished in 6-8 hours and I am but a newbie.\n\nThere has been real dedication in the making of this game and it shows. If you enjoy or are interested in metroidvanias, check Momodora out -it is worth full price and if you come across it's a steal.", "timestamp_created": 1618873544, "timestamp_updated": 1618873544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90557687": {"recommendationid": "90557687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414041135", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1700354893}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Arte", "timestamp_created": 1618804217, "timestamp_updated": 1618804217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90488874": {"recommendationid": "90488874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179013523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1684300246}, "language": "english", "review": "Esse jogo \u00e9 simplesmente uma delicia do come\u00e7o ao fim!", "timestamp_created": 1618698184, "timestamp_updated": 1618698184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90441542": {"recommendationid": "90441542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198434097260", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1618633172}, "language": "english", "review": "A short really fun game that you can play in bite sizes of in one sitting", "timestamp_created": 1618633342, "timestamp_updated": 1618633342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90431762": {"recommendationid": "90431762", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997872929", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1425, "last_played": 1618617488}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good Metroidvania game, but if there's one thing I learned it's to never take simple game design basics for granted.

So much so that it's kind of annoying.", "timestamp_created": 1618616630, "timestamp_updated": 1618616630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90278343": {"recommendationid": "90278343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010605289", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 895, "last_played": 1618368430}, "language": "english", "review": "The TL;DR is: Combat is bad, enemy variety is poor, exploration is dull, almost no meaningful upgrades, and the bosses are forgettable.\n\nI want to preface saying that I got all the achievements for this game so I did spend an adequate amount of time playing it.\n\nIt's fun enough to play, but is so burdened by flaws and annoyances that pile up into an overall rather unenjoyable experience. \n\nMap design ranges from annoying to downright poor design. The actual ingame map is poor, the entire map being just a bunch of red tiles instead of denoting a color for each major region. Additionally, it's filled with numerous one-way paths that make you waste time looping around just to continue exploring if you had the audacity to pick the wrong direction first. Several of these one-way paths are impossible to get back to until you get a late game upgrade, and I use \"upgrade\" very loosely here. \n\nBecause for a Metroidvania, the game doesn't really have upgrades. And I mean actual, gameplay improving upgrades letting you advance your exploration ability. The only actual upgrade that does *anything* for exploration is being able to turn into a cat. The problem is this does nothing actually beneficial for you--you lose the ability to make ranged attacks and can't climb ladders (which are common in the game) so you have to spend most of your time as a human regardless. The only thing it lets you do that's special is walk through tight corridors. Those corridors are few and far between throughout the game, like the cat ability was an afterthought. It's as if the developer occasionally remembered they had to do something with it now and then, so they threw in a token room every so often where you have to turn into a cat for 5 seconds before doing platforming as a human.\n\nLike most games in the genre, the combat is fairly simplistic, with your options being a melee attack and a bow, along with a roll that has a large number of immunity frames that's mandatory to use to avoid a lot of boss attacks. The combat, though, ended up being one of my biggest annoyances with the game through its poor design and inconsistencies. The melee attack consists of a simple three-hit combo, but the problem is each stage of the combo makes your character step forward slightly. The end result is numerous annoyingly positioned enemies either cause you to fall of a ledge into spikes (which kill you instantly), or cause you to step forward and take contact damage with the enemy you're hitting. \n\nSometimes. Sometimes you take contact damage. That's half of the inconsistency in the combat, you sometimes take contact damage from touching enemies, Sometimes you don't! Whether or not you do is based on if the game feels like it. The other half is damage output from enemies and bosses, which has no consistency whatsoever. The same attack can do a massive variance of damage to the point where the damage values feel completely made up and just use a random number generator. As an example, one boss always starts by dropping a lightning bolt on you. Across dozens of observations, the exact same attack at random did barely a pixel of my life bar, a third of it, half of it, all but one pixel, and outright instantly killed me. Exact. Same. Attack. The *entire* game is like this--your life bar is just an imaginary number and the game decides you live or die from an attack based on completely arbitrary values.\n\nBetween all of these problems, I ended up just spamming the bow for the near entirety of my playtime. There's nothing tactical about this because you can't move and use the bow at the same time, but the bow was blatantly designed as the superior weapon in the game; the majority of passive equippables and required upgrades in the game buff the bow, the melee attack gets absolutely nothing unless you go out of your way to make it slightly less awful, and you can't do that until shortly before the final boss.\n\nThe boss fights themselves were at best acceptable, and at worst just downright annoying due to the combat mechanics. Your character cannot jump very high, and most bosses are the same height as you, with the end result being that if they pin you in a corner you WILL take contact damage trying to escape. Rolling is less useful as half the bosses have erratic movement such that rolling will cause you to take damage regardless. Overall, due to the fact you don't get any meaningful movement enhancing upgrades in the game and no alternatives or real upgrades to your attacks, the boss fights are pretty forgettable HP sponges where you spam the bow until they die.\n\nExcept they, for some reason, gave all the bosses special drops if you can beat them without taking damage. Half of these are items you can buy from a shopkeeper slightly later in the game, giving you a small power boost earlier than expected. The other half are exclusive items that are hilariously gamebreaking, capable of tearing through 30-50% of a boss's life in one use (and you get up to 2 uses of each gamebreaker item). The funny thing is all the bosses kill you instantly on Insane difficulty, forcing you to beat them hitless, giving you guaranteed access to all these gamebreaking items that let you crush the bosses without challenge. If the combat and movement systems were good in the game I'd accuse this of being cheesy and lame, but the bosses feel like such a waste of time that I fully advocate cheesing them. \n\nI've never played the other games in the series, and that isn't a problem with regards to the story and characters because the game has basically no story or characters. There's an evil curse, you need to cleanse it. End of story. There's like five characters you meet a single time, trust you immediately, and either tell you completely obvious observations about the game world (everybody is dead or a ghost? Wow couldn't have figured that out based on the ominous music and all the ghosts I've killed so far) or just hand you a key item. Only one of these characters even has a name, which just feels weirder. There's a few other completely worthless NPCs who say equally useless statements like \"I'm scared\" that don't add anything. \n\nAnd, finally, the game is short. That's probably one of the biggest upsides to the game, in that despite its stockpile of annoyances that incited me to make a review in the first place, it didn't last long enough to make me actually hate the game. It's barely 4 hours long, and that's on a first playthrough that got the true ending, all upgrades, and full map exploration. You can casually speedrun the game in under 40 minutes once you know where to go. Momo4 at its core being a short game is also the root cause of other problems, like how few upgrades the game has. Can't pace those well when you can beat the game blind in a single sitting.\n\nOverall it's not offensively bad, not unplayable, is acceptably fun, but the problems with combat, lack of upgrades, dull exploration, and forgettable boss fights really dragged down my opinion of the game.

Start combining reveries with moonlight, and you're only a step or two from smoking clove cigarettes in a graveyard while writing free-verse poems about autumn.\n\nWell, they don't go that far, but for something with such a cutesy look it does manage to create a surprisingly dark and somber mood. Between the falling leaves and misty forests, the shadowy towns and cathedrals, and the ominous red moon overhead--that's never a good sign--there's an awful lot of atmosphere for such a humble-looking little game.\n\nEven more so than 3000th Duel this one really stress tests the fundamental strength of the metroidvania genre. How many load-bearing elements can you remove from a game like this while still retaining structural integrity?  Turns out, quite a few.\n\nWho needs endless farming and complex crafting systems, zillions of spells and items or a HD graphical sheen? Just hand me some intuitive controls, nice animations, moody atmosphere, melancholy music and a map to fill in, and apparently I'm good.\n\nThe backgrounds in particular really stand out here. Not only do they look good for their style in a superficial sense, but there's also a real unifying artistry that helps them punch well above their graphical weight. You get the impression that the authors have a solid picture in their heads of this strange world of theirs. It comes across in the coherence of whole aesthetic, as well as the eccentric little touches--the cats, the the ringing bell save points, etc.--that combine to lend extra character.\n\nI've heard people use the term \"souls-like\" to describe the combat, although in this case all that really means is that you have dodge sometimes and maybe think a little bit before swinging your weapon. \n\nOh, that weapon, by the way? If I understand it right, it's some kind of magical leaf, which I've gotta say is definitely a first.\n\nYeah, don't ask me why that is. I guess this game doesn't require a whole lot of explanation, which is a good thing since they don't really give you any. Like everything else here, the story is pretty minimal.  You're some kind of magic nun or something who shows up in a cursed land to cleanse it of evil by swatting the dark queen with her killer leaf, and, uh, that's about all I got. \n\nBut hey, just goes to show that it doesn't always take a lot.  A tightly-made little game with a strong basic design and a bit of creativity and some signature flair can have an outsized impact.\n\nIf you're interested in a nice metroidvania-style sojourn in a well-crafted setting--and who wouldn't be?--you'll probably walk away happy from this one despite their best efforts to the contrary.\n\n\nYou can find more indie game reviews at [url=https://oddlittlegames.com] oddlittlegames.com [/url] or visit my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34514756/] curator page.

The biggest visual change is the protagonist grew to 2.5 tiles height, far higher than the 1.5 tile of Momodora 1 and 1 tile height of Momodora 2 & 3. But the basic engine of the game seems to be the same as Momodora 3 (& 2).\n\nThe changes are, there's 2 playable forms of Kaho in this game, the human form (2.5 tile height) and the Kitty form (1 tile height). This enable certain hidden and secret area that are only reachable by the kitty form and certain places that can only be access by human form.\n\nThe basic battle is almost the same as Momodora 2&3, with a few changes. They've restored air dashing and double jump to the game. They've added an equipment table to the game, so we can now equip the items we found in game. \n\nThe coding improvements also allowed certain graphic layout to be possible, making the game more beautiful than the previous series.\n\nAs for the story, it's certainly an upgrade compared to the previous series. Both story and story telling shows huge improvements. But still, not up to the professional standard yet. Just enough to keep the plot intact. They've tried to put some meaning to the previous series in this one. Adding Eri (from Momodora 2) suggesting Momodora 4 is from a timeline before Momodora 2. Kaho herself made an appearance in Momodora 3 as a NPC, so this is somewhere after Momodora 3. But still... it doesn't really matter as even when they tried to link the time line, the story isn't related and player will not miss a thing if they didn't play the other series.\n\nLike Momodora 3, this one here has multiple ending. As well as secret areas and hidden items to collect.

The game felt pretty unfair until I got some upgrades, then it just felt pretty easy.\n- The game doesn't seem designed around only having manual saves at certain locations. With most traps or pits in the game instantly killing you, exploring is really stressful as any character interactions, items you picked up, map you uncovered, etc. is lost if you die and you have to do them all over again. I came back to the game after several months, beat a boss, and came across a lake. I proceed to go \"huh, is there swimming in this game?\", walked in, fell through, and died instantly and had to do the boss all over again.\n- The games story just feels like a skeleton. I haven't played any of the previous games but it kinda sucked when [spoiler]The MC just kind of unceremoniously dies at the end, and the game is like \"and she was barely remembered at all..... :)\" like really? Also, why does the weapon upgrade that is required to get the true ending just kinda slapped in a well with no mention by anyone whatsoever and no buildup?[/spoiler]\n- The MC's goddamn idle yawning animation. Don't get me wrong, it's cute, but it really needs to be disabled for a little after boss/story segments. Nothing kills atmosphere like narrowly defeating someone you are meant to feel bad for fighting, seeing the person you killed fade away, not realize you have control again and the MC just step back and yawn like \"what? that's it?\" like, what is your character again? \n\nOk so overall, I'd say the art, music, characters, and world of Momodora are wonderful, but from a mechanics and story standpoint the game falls really flat for me.

The game is quite brief [my first run lasted 4 Hours 20 minutes], but there is new game+ and other challenge modes to satisfy even the most soul's-thirsty masochist.\n\nThe Bad: low monster variety, combat is simplistic [dodge, stunlock, kill], the minimalist story that would make Dark Souls seem overly detailed, characters were forgettable.\n\nThe Ugly: the challenge modes are linked to the steam achievements [even no deaths], so don't expect to 100% this game.", "timestamp_created": 1613272439, "timestamp_updated": 1613272439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86506527": {"recommendationid": "86506527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241025840", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1613179810}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is criminally underrated", "timestamp_created": 1613179961, "timestamp_updated": 1613179961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86380157": {"recommendationid": "86380157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025043062", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 514, "last_played": 1610261235}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid action-platformer metroidvania with decent boss fights.

I don't know if everyone will get the special feeling I do from this game, but even if you have a more casual interest I think you'll enjoy it.  It's cute, short, and made very well. To me, the game is basically perfect and I have no complaints whatsoever. It's one of the first games I've speedran and it's the first real game I've Perfected.\n\nIf I look past the emotional attachment I've gained for Momodora over the years I still think it's a beautiful game. The traversal is fun. You get a variety of skills and powerups in Metroidvania fashion (more Castlevania than Metroid) and several of them affect how fast you can move as well as allowing you to explore and progress. The combat is simple and even trivialized by some of the powerful items, but the difficulty levels are very well tuned so you can have the challenge you want. The simplicity is redeemed by being polished to very satisfying levels. The art, sound design and music are fantastic. It succeeds at being both very cute and somber. The writing for the story, lore and characters walks the line of telling you just enough to have a solid foundation while leaving a lot up to the interpretation of the player. As you can tell, every aspect of the game follows the trend: less is more. It works because it's so cohesive and polished. It could feel empty or basic, but the mood is just right and you'll become much more invested than you would expect.\n\nMy save files suggest that you can expect 5-6 hours from the game at minimum, which is already worth the price tag. The game doesn't feel short. I think it's very replayable (and speedrunnable!) and you could get a LOT more out of it.\n\nShout out to halfcoordinated!

You traverse various castle grounds in search of the queen's help, wielding your magical leaf and bow, gaining magical items and meeting characters along the way. The game is the fourth in a series, although you don't have to have played the previous games to understand this one.\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nWhile your main weapon (a magic leaf) stays the same throughout, so much of the game is about smooth and satisfying combat. Each encounter is an awesome acrobatic romp, as you vanquish evil with well timed dodgerolls, quickly fired arrows and a good whack of your leaf. \n\nAfter about an hour on \"normal\" mode, I played the rest of the game on \"hard\" mode, which was a good balance between challenge and stress. Most situations could be navigated through with a little determination and careful planning, and the variation in magical objects and loadout to use definitely added to the fun. When the difficulty ramped up with the boss fights, you were challenged to understand their patterns and attack accordingly. At most moments I felt powerful and threatened at the same time, which was an amazing balance. Again, I cannot understate how smoothly the combat plays. The only critique I have of this aspect of the game was that [i]sometimes[/i] the hitboxes felt a millimeter or two off, but for the most part they were fine.\n\nThe enemies and bosses varied in interesting ways, and the exploration of each map area was interesting as well. \n\nIt should be said that the game is shorter than your average metroidvania. I was surprised to check my map after a few hours and see that I had already covered 40% of it. That said, it doesn't really detract from the quality of the game - and the calls to replay it on \"insane\" mode (with only 1 hp) or with a pacifist run, speak louder than most games given the enjoyability of the combat and movement.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story reminds me of Dark Souls (doesn't everything?). The characters don't say much, although they do say enough for you to connect with the overall downtrodden and derelict mood of the game. The mood and exposition are compelling and they do drive the player forward through twists and turns, which end up jam-packed in this short game. Like Dark Souls, much of the lore is stored in item descriptions, for those who are interested. \n\nThe characters are interesting, though this aspect does suffer slightly for its preoccupation with an anime girl aesthetic. For instance, it is a little embarrassing or distracting when the chest of one of the bosses reacts to the swipes of your leaf. But for the most part the anime girl aesthetic isn't foregrounded, and there is also something to be said for having a cast of interesting female characters who mostly aren't sexualized. \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe pixelated art of this game is beautiful. It isn't exquisitely detailed, but it is worth looking at and is distinct all the same. Each section of the map was a vibrant (or deliberately not vibrant) area that I looked forward to exploring.\n\nThe only critique of this aspect comes along with the previously mentioned critique, there is occasional unnecessary sexualization of the cast of female characters, but, again, this isn't too significant, I would say. \n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe audio here is the extravagant seal on this 16 bit love letter. All of the sound effects are delightful saw waves and square waves. And the background tracks for each boss battle and map area, while not staying in the 16 bit style, are [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXGdHu1b1fg]evocative and encompassing[/url]. \n\n[h1]Technical & Other[/h1]\nIt took a while to set up the proper resolution of the game, and occasionally the were issues with audio, but these issues weren't significant.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nMomodora: RUtM is a fun little metroidvania. It is short, but a treat to play given its satisfying combat, and was only helped by its compelling story and characters.

the game is more combat-oriented than something like hollow knight. i don't know if this is a fair statement to make given that i've only done one playthrough of momodora and a handful of HK but given how the game pushes you into using degenerate speedkill strategies in order to acquire loot from bosses and how ALL of the trash enemies besides one enemy, in the **tutorial** of all places, are complete pushovers with the bow makes me stand firmly on how i feel after playing around with the ingame systems.\n\n1) boss drops are really powerful and are only obtainable when you flawless them (excluding Edea's Pearl), so cheese burn strats / persistence is the name of the game. this is a design issue on its own given the scarcity of items in the game (max 16 actives in inventory, 17 passives in inventory) because other items don't compare. this issue becomes amplified when coupled with boss loot conditions. boss items allow extremely easily speedkill strategies using the bow and items. i was able to melt the final boss's 3 health bars in roughly under 30 seconds while active.\n\nthe game doesn't tell you about this method of loot acquisition either (I only found out because I wanted to see if I could go underwater after beating up milky machine and her adopted child - spoilers, I didn't save), and thank god it's a short game or you have heavy incentive to abandon your save game and try again from the beginning when/if you figure it out. most bosses have save points directly before them, with the exception of frida and discount ornstein and smough.\n\npocket incensory and bakman patch are by far the worst offenders of this, considering you can get them both early since the game is non-linear. you get those and necklace of sacrifice and you've basically won the game already. tainted missive's additional two stacks from generic anime waifu protagonist lets you proc the necklace without additional setup, allowing you to oneshot almost every common enemy in the game. the other powerful items that aren't from bosses STACK with this, allowing for really high damage multipliers (roughly 4x damage at low HP, and you want to be at low HP all the time during bosses for easy resets if you fail the loot condition)\n\n2) persistent contact damage makes several bosses unpleasant to fight, specifically the crow boi. there are two ways to offset contact damage in this game - stunning the enemy temporarily makes them do no contact damage, or don't use the leaf. bosses gain stun immunity after a certain amount of hits and may win trades since the leaf is slow and has small range - BUT you can deflect SOME projectiles with it.\n\ni hope you like ranged weapons, because the bow is easily the best weapon in the entire game when you're playing casually. the leaf by comparison is borderline suicidal with a pretty bad return on investment because of occasional soft counter-attacks in melee range, lack of passive item support and forced movement when slashing. git gud and/or use the bow. i ended up resorting to using missive + necklace + bowspam + bakman to quickkill every boss after i got tired of fennel counterattacking me during my third hit of my combo because i didn't want to spend a ton of time mastering how to roll away from her, only to get hit by her teleport contact damage OR rolling into her because her sword hitbox takes up a fourth of the screen, and you can't jump over it either. i then pulled out the godslayer greatbow and shot her in the head 5 times and had a major anticlimax, because she's a fun fight despite all the asspulls of getting hit ONCE and having to retry. it feels like the game is balanced around speedkills because enduring some of these faster fights is not feasible after a few minutes.\n\ni don't enjoy using the bow - enemies are not built around it aside from the few that are immune to bow damage (lol). i used the leaf for the majority of my playthrough on hard and made it take much longer by extension. as soon as you get the first boss drop, the melee attack becomes objectively bad and after you get more ranged support then your leaf becomes a nice trophy in your key items. if you opt for using the megashark or magic builds when you play terraria, you probably won't mind this. as a stubborn melee user, i'll get my teeth pushed in for no reward other than for the fun of doing it.\n\nin conclusion, the way bosses flow make me feel like you're intended to use both melee and ranged damage to defeat them, but their mechanics incentivize playing at range and invalidating wanting to play as fennel but with a leaf because of contact damage. why even give me the option to use melee?\n\nif I were to fix this, i would add boss refights that drop their loot at the end of the game or have bosses always drop loot in the main story, with speed adjustments to punish playing at range.\n\nedit: also the level design is somewhat questionable but people have already read through this much so i won't elaborate further\nedit 2: i went to look back vs fennel and apparently you can jump over the sword twirl, i just jumped too early and it's pretty precise. the teleport still catches me though, need way more practice roll cancelling.", "timestamp_created": 1609291067, "timestamp_updated": 1609292367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83509326": {"recommendationid": "83509326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102932740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1609095115}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego, si bien es un poco corto recomendar\u00eda comprarlo en oferta", "timestamp_created": 1609274943, "timestamp_updated": 1609274943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83454647": {"recommendationid": "83454647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114914850", "num_games_owned": 2406, "num_reviews": 953, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 90, "last_played": 1639198416}, "language": "english", "review": "i found this out through a speedrun on twitch\n\nso i play on hard like an idiot", "timestamp_created": 1609222825, "timestamp_updated": 1609222825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83449647": {"recommendationid": "83449647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044139356", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1609214387}, "language": "english", "review": "Momodora RUtM is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen.

I had it in my steam library for the longest time but never found the chance to play it until recently. I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed the game, so I went back and found the first and second games which I played through as well, making me further appreciate the polish and love that went into the third game. This game, however, was supposed to be the last one.. and it was!\n\nMomodora: RUtM ended up being a very enjoyable experience, despite a couple of originally poorly left tastes. I'll get to that.\nWhat I want to say now though is that for 10 dollars? Hell yeah, get this game. No doubt about it, you get your money's worth. You get your money's worth and then some if you do happen to get it on sale.\n\nNow the gameplay of this game is very simple. Attack with a leaf, attack with some arrows, and roll. That's all there is to the main mechanics. You're able to spice things up with passive items that affect certain things regarding money, attacking, etc. There's also active items which recharge on every ring of the bell, so you never feel pressured about stocking up on something for a helpful pickmeup since it works around replenishment. Otherwise, there's just a big map to explore, plenty of bosses to fight, and enemies to beat up that stand in your way. I enjoy the combat despite the simplicity. That single 3 hit swing is satisfying to pull off, and unlimited use of range moves to a separate button separates this game from III as the superior in range, since it's so easy to just create a projectile. \n\nOne of the biggest changes, and seriously, I can't emphasize this enough... that I appreciated was the change to bosses from Momodora III. For every Momodora game before this one, bosses always felt... poor? Like, the challenge was there, but for some reason, bosses in the prior games did not randomize the move they would do next. You always knew what was coming and when they would break for you to attack. I never liked that because it was less about reaction times and more about repeating steps until victory. In this game, the attacks are randomized in execution and bosses, for the most part, are attackable whenever. It instead goes for a proper balance of mixing when to dodge to when to attack, and that felt so much better instead of waiting for the same moment again and again.\n\nNow there are two major gripes with this game. Both of which I fell victim to because... the game sure as hell doesn't tell you. One: there are boss items you can get. BUT. The catch is that you MUST beat them without getting hit. This isn't even something I would have thought to try unless you told me there was something out of it. On top of this, if you beat a boss and do get hit, the item you get from that is lost permanently for that run. I don't like it when games put a super high risk like this for a reward, because you'll often find that built in stuff now has no utility if you want these items. Heck, there's an item that increases your attack by 100% temporarily for the cost of some health. But guess what? Self damage during a fight still counts as taking damage! There's also a ring that increases damage when low on health. Also useless, because you'd have to get hit in the fight to even trigger the effect! I hate that. \n\nNow, I should say that beating the bosses without getting hit isn't particularly hard. It isn't easy either though, and you'll find yourself getting frustrated because this idea of not getting hit conflicts with the idea of the game. The items you get for beating bosses without taking damage aren't necessary by any means, but that doesn't exactly make me feel any better about how they're locked away by a conflicting mechanic.\n\nThe other issue? This one is dumb, seriously. There is a unique shopkeep within the game that has one condition to decide whether it appears or not. If you break this condition, you will never know he even existed. This guy sells unique stuff only he has too, and that is a good way to make someone mad when they find out later. Unless, of course, you don't even look up a guide. Then you'll never know he existed since nothing tells you!\nWhat's the condition? There is a spider that shows up in the first area. He's the only one that looks the way he does (other than the unique shopkeep) and is the only non-boss enemy to have dialogue. Now, it's dialogue is \"Uguu...\". Okay. Don't know what that means. Might as well go talk to him, right?\nBAM! You take damage by walking into him! So he's an enemy! Kill him! \n\nBut no. He's an enemy, but one that, if you kill, never reappears and you can't access the shopkeep anymore. If you wanted me to keep him alive, game, why do you make him hurt me? That's incredibly misleading. Whatever. If I had one other minor gripe, it's that you could easily miss the item that lets you warp around until late in the game if you don't know where to look. Go through the area that requires diving underwater first when given the option to go multiple ways. Once you get a new ability, then go back to the place where you started. This will be very helpful!\n\nReally though, those are my only gripes with the game and they're not even that big. The game is somewhat short if you don't go for everything, but I recommend going for everything since it makes the game a lot more enjoyable. I really wish that the idea of making the next Momodora game 3D wasn't scrapped as I would have really liked to see how it transitioned. I hope this won't be the last game in the series, because I'd love more of the gameplay that III and this brought to the table!\n\n(Also get Momodora III)", "timestamp_created": 1608066672, "timestamp_updated": 1608066672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82395105": {"recommendationid": "82395105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198894158017", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 862, "last_played": 1640914973}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sin duda es el juego con el que inicie la saga y es mi favorito en todos los aspectos.", "timestamp_created": 1607994976, "timestamp_updated": 1607994976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "82319115": {"recommendationid": "82319115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326741793", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1607866731}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool adventure indie game.

The shorter length makes the game more suited for multiple playthroughs, which based on the steam achievements is something that the devs probably intended. Also, given the game's low price the short length isn't really an issue.\nIf you're wondering whether this is a good place to start, this game is a prequel to the other games and you don't really need to have any knowledge of the previous games's stories. The first two games are freeware, though, so there's not really any reason not to play them.

I feel like a lot of people might agree that Fennel's fight is the best part in the game.\n\n[b]Gameplay/Combat[/b]\n\nNormally, I don't like metroidvanias that only has 1 type of main weapon. Although there are few exceptions, and one of them is definitely Momodora. The combat is satisfying enough to keep you entertained, you're only equipped with a leaf (that plays like a sword) and a bow (which you can charge to shoot more arrows), either you want to play all melee, all ranged or mixed it's all up to you, and of course there are items you can use to change your playstyle a bit. And just like other Souls-like games, dodging is important.\nOverall it's just fun to play.\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\n\nAt the beginning, you get to choose a difficulty, Easy, Normal, or Hard. \nI've never played Easy but Normal was very well balanced for a first playthrough, until you get to a certain point where you've collected a bunch of Heart fragments (extra HP) and Bellflower (healing item), a lot of bosses would be too easy to beat, on my first playthrough (which was on Normal), most of the bosses are beaten after 2nd try, even the final boss wasn't hard to beat.\nI'd still recommend playing on Normal for a first playthrough and replay on Hard for a 100% run.\nAlthough if you want a challenge on Normal I suppose you can go for the Imperishable and/or Pacifist run (never actually tried a New Game+ so I'm not sure if it adds difficulty or not, probably does).\n\nOn Hard there are extra enemies in some maps, and your Health is lower, sometimes you'd even die in one hit, but I feel like this is the difficulty where the game meant to be played on.\nWhen you beat the game on Hard, the Insane difficulty will be unlocked, where everything basically just kills you in one hit, in the description it only says \"Don't even try this\". I mean it's up to you if you want to do this or not, but to me this was actually fun, I usually get frustrated when games gets too difficult but thanks to the fun combat, I don't feel that at all.\n\nBut perhaps it's not only about the combat, but also the save point placements. When you're about to fight a boss, you don't have to face like hundreds of enemies after leaving the save point, some of the save points are also placed right besides the boss room, so this game is quite kind on that matter.\n\n[b]Royal Pinacotheca[/b]\n\nYes I'm making an entire section dedicated to one area in the game. \nMinor spoiler warning.\n\nThis area is accessible after you've obtained all 4 Crest Fragments, and to me this is just the Blighttown of Momodora. I mean it's not that bad, but, I remember dying a lot in this place, maybe I'm just bad at the game but still. On top of that this game has the hardest boss in the game (in my opinion), Lupiar and Magnolia.\nDespite all of that this is probably the most memorable place for me, probably a nightmare too.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nOverall I just love this game, especially with the art, gloomy atmosphere, and satisfying combat.

When you're hunting down the final bits and bobs it's tough to know which save point to warp to because it's all jumbled together as the one colour. Take a look at the in-game map design of Blasphemous. The sewers are brown. The ice mountains are blue. The woods are green, and so on. It makes looking at the map SO much easier on the eyes. \n\nThe animation is absolutely fantastic! Especially for Pardoner Fennel. \nA solid experience. It's nice to see this series evolve from Momodora 1 to 3 then this. This is like the culmination of everything we've seen so far and then some more. It's the most similar to Momodora 2 with the open map exploration, unlike 1 and 2 which were linear and a more arcade-y design. This is definitely the right way the series needs to go. Great soundtrack. Art reminds me of ib. Game is trying to be Dark Souls but feels more like Blasphemous (which was trying to be Dark Souls). \nIn summary, once again, a great game from rdein. Very little to pick at, other than what was mentioned above (which really isn't a criticism but more like a suggestion for some quality of life that's easily updated with a patch.

It looks like a game developer learning the ropes. It is clearly inspired by the Metroidvania genre, and makes a good attempt. It survives by keeping things quite simple, and it's quite an interesting game if you have an interest in game development.\n\nOverall, this is a good attempt at a Metroidvania, and there are a lot of positives. But I can't recommend it without the caveat that expectations must be kept low.\n\nPositives:\n- Retro art style is quite beautiful in some areas, particularly the backgrounds in the forest.\n- Music is nice and creates an atmosphere.\n- Combat is generally good fun, and the bow and rolling works quite well.\n- Warping and many save points alleviates some frustration\n- Map is good enough to get you through\n- Cheap when on sale, and not a bad play if you set your expectations low\n\nNegatives:\n- Overall lack of polish\n   - The map is very basic. Some indication of different areas would have been less frustrating.\n   - The jumping/swimming sprites are static\n   - The level design wasn't great. The only items that helped you progress were keys, and all locked doors looked the same, regardless of the key needed.\n- The story telling is extremely poor. Who the characters were, what they were called, what was happening, all of this was absent. Things happen to characters, and I don't know who they are and don't have any reason to care.\n- Everything in this game seems to be an anime girl with cat ears.

Nothing special and feels mundane D&D style, \"Go and kill this person\" -type of quest. Controls in other hand feel awkward. 50% of my deaths was because I accidentally either pressed Item Selection, Bow or Dash instinctly. My finger would have been pretty sure that  Back Trigger [ L2 and R2] -Buttons should for cycling items. Left Trigger [L1] would be for item activation and Right Trigger [R1] for the bow. Dash and Item activation doesn't change on the control menu unless you reroute your controller's macro buttons from the Steam menu. Which can be a hassle for people who just wants to re-map their preferable control method.\n\nGame is solid three hour fun, but there is too much unnecessary deaths.

Explore, fight, gain new abilities, etc. It varies a bit from the usual formula by mixing in some Soulslike elements, notably a Eustice flask style healing system.\n\nThe controls are extremely satisfying (essential for this genre). You rarely feel like you're waiting for an animation to finish.\n\nGameplay is overall about 7-10 hours, depending on how thorough you are. Personally I'm delighted that it's short. Longer games can easily overstay their welcome.\n\nMy only real complaint is the map. It would've been nice if the map regions were labeled, and nicer still if we could've added our own notes. The warp ability doesn't let you pick any save-point, just one per region that's pre-designated.\n\nPresentation - Retro pixel art style. The overall presentation is a mix of dark and cute. It serves decently, and provides a good callback to other Metroidvanias. There's a few interesting vistas, but most of the tilesets are same-y. This isn't a game I'd recommend on art alone, but the art does add to the experience.\n\nThe protagonist is female, which is good, we could use more games with female leads, and while her animations are a bit cutesy, she's at least never sexualized.\n\nSpeaking of goofy sexualization; My only complaint is the Witch of Decay. You get into several fights with this enormous witch... and her breasts. Seriously. They have their own impact/jiggle animation. It's completely out-of-touch with the rest of the game's presentation and tone.\n\nStory - Minimalistic and pretty typical for this kind of game. The kingdom has been cursed. Go face the source of the curse and either defeat or free them from it. It's more of a framing device than an actual plot. That said, I appreciate that it takes itself seriously. Indy projects too often aim for \"funny\" plots instead of serious ones. The writing is rarely up to the challenge.\n\nInnovation - There's nothing new here, but what's been included has been refined to a razor (leaf?) edge. Momodora is a good example of how a game doesn't have to innovate to be worthwhile.\n\nConclusion - A nicely self-contained Metroidvania that's absolutely worth your time IF you're a fan of the genre and looking for more of the same. Definitely skippable if you're not a Metroidvania fan. If you've never played this style of game, then Momodora is a great entry-point.

Momodora is a prequel to an indie game series about priests, witches, and undead powers. I had previously played Minoria before this; a spinoff inspired by the series, so I was familiar with its Metroidvania-esque gameplay, combat system, and atmosphere. I think this game is a little slower, and less challenging overall; but it has some of its own appeal in its environments and straightforward design. Minoria had a totally different artstyle, though it used some of the same motifs, and whereas I think that worked really well, the pixelated areas and characters in this game still look great. The story isn't anything special; and the music is pretty good. \n\nEssentially it's just a 2D timing/attack action game, where you have to dodge correctly, choose between range and melee, and navigate a simple maze. There's some unlockables on the way, but I find that some of the sorceries aren't useful, or don't come into practice until the final hour, so you mainly just rely on your bow and \"leaf,\" which acts sort of like a sword. One of my favourite elements is you can turn into a cat, but there isn't that many puzzles, and I found the game to be kind of easy outside of boss fights. Even then, there's enough healing items that if you do get hit, you can kind of power through combat. I'd generally recommend you play on Hard, unless this is one of the first games of the style you're attempting. \n\nIf you have a craving for sprite adventures, this is an excellent game to pick up; and though it won't last a long time, it's polished enough that it may draw you into the series, or inspire you to tackle other games in the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1600997869, "timestamp_updated": 1600997869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76448257": {"recommendationid": "76448257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079396272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1600893717}, "language": "english", "review": "How to play momodora 101\nStep 1: Flex on enemies by beating them to death with a leaf\nStep 2: Become cat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: FLEX ON ENEMIES HARDER BY BEATING THEM TO DEATH WITH A LEAF AS A CAT", "timestamp_created": 1600893817, "timestamp_updated": 1600893817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76356127": {"recommendationid": "76356127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198998407315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 482, "last_played": 1686452977}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esp.

It all pulls together in a nice and very fair challenge.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a good Metroidvania, though be warned that this game only takes a few hours to finish nearly to completion.

I don't really care to play the harder difficulties as a result because I think these issues compound into a game I just find frustrating. I find it overrated and was very disappointed when I finally tried it after seeing all the praise, but if you like it, more power to you.\n\nFirst off, the combat has some issues.\nWhile at first the melee seems pretty nice and weighty, with every move pushing you forward - the cracks start to show when you realize the game has contact damage and it's really easy to get knocked out of a combo just from that. While it looks like for the most part staggering an enemy with a melee hit will stop it from contact damaging you, if anything's nearby that wasn't staggered, it'll hit you out of your combo. You seemingly get no i-frames, even during your finisher.\n\nThis is especially a thing during the final boss, which doesn't seem to stagger - you'll try to wail on her and you just get knocked back for no good reason. Most humanoid bosses do stagger, but they can break out of it too. This wouldn't be so bad - I'm used to it from playing KH2FM - but the problem is that damn contact damage. It's usually not a lot, but it's still frustrating. You really just have to shorten your combos or try and judge the distance you can use a finisher on some of these.\n\nThere are no real aerial combos either, so after a while I just ended up saying \"screw it\" and used ranged attacks for most of my damage. This leads to some of the taller bosses just getting really stale and repetitive (like, again, final boss) because all you're doing is hopping and hitting over and over and over.\n\nSecond - the other main problem I have is that this game just really didn't need to be a Metroidvania. It's kind of a Fusion-like - there's not a ton of interconnectivity and exploration involved. It's also a bit more like an Igavania, with kinda obtuse secrets that'll leave you constantly hitting walls with your leaf. I don't mind either style of 'vania, and I think it's just the execution that matters.\n\nSo unfortunately, I really didn't feel like exploration was all that rewarding - the damage is so high even on normal that health pickups kind of felt pointless, a lot of your equipment is either bought or gained from flawless boss fights, and there's only really two upgrades that gate your progress (ignoring the actual shards themselves, which basically make up a key). It takes really damn long to get a fast travel ability - while the map isn't very large, it's still large enough to make backtracking to far away areas tedious.\n\nThe level design also does a few things that just really don't make sense to me. There's a few dead end rooms that seem like they would have something there, but don't. There's also a couple of these rooms that have water in them that will kill you if you fall in - which makes zero sense when the game has a water level that lets you dive right in without so much as an oxygen meter. I also have to question why there's instant kill spikes in a Metroidvania game with sometimes pretty long stretches between save points. Usually, MVs with instant kill spikes have some kind of grace element that makes these deaths less painful - Ori 1 had checkpoints you could make yourself, and Mega Man ZX (not one you hear often I bet) had a lives system.\n\nThere's other nitpicks I have but I just wanted to get my main points across and that's it really. I feel like a lot of the problems I had with the game just carried over into Minoria from what I've seen, which got significantly less praise than this for whatever reason. I hope that the next Momodora game that was just announced learns its lessons from this, Minoria and its peers to win me over. Otherwise, this is why I just didn't enjoy my time with Momodora: RUTM.", "timestamp_created": 1598492873, "timestamp_updated": 1598492873, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593744218349456787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74927279": {"recommendationid": "74927279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122121489", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 998, "last_played": 1598423377}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Tiene una muy buena ambientaci\u00f3n y estetica, el juego en si es corto y entretenido ideal para un fin de semana", "timestamp_created": 1598423492, "timestamp_updated": 1598423492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74912100": {"recommendationid": "74912100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040117043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1688601235}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1598394020, "timestamp_updated": 1598394020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74771995": {"recommendationid": "74771995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389095011", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 393, "last_played": 1598174966}, "language": "spanish", "review": "A decir verdad no esperaba mucho de este titulo, pero jugue Minoria y vi una referencia en el juego de este y me dio curiosidad jajaja los dos son igual de buenos.", "timestamp_created": 1598175080, "timestamp_updated": 1598175080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74742210": {"recommendationid": "74742210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063072962", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1598125785}, "language": "english", "review": "The only thing I didn't like was the painfully long frames when you hit something, meaning you could get attacked during your attack.

Wait until it's on sale. \nTotal gameplay 1st time was about 4hours on normal. \n---------------------\nPros:\nPretty, if you're into 2d artwork\nMusic, while nothing memorable it was very atmospheric at times. \nPolished, it is complete with some minor replayability and new game+. \n-------------------------\nCons:\n\nShort. Way too short. \n\nPower scaling was off balance. The beginning, while I was getting used to controls was by far the hardest. Comparatively, end game, when I'd finally learned the game, felt breezy easy and too short. If you're looking for \"dark souls\", look elsewhere. \n\nCombat: Either snipe out of bounds or get in close before they hit. Little variety in how you approach combat. Often I would get locked in a swing animation and would be unable to turn around quick enough. Not having a down jump attack is something you'll regret not being given.\n\nBosses could be accomplished in under five times. Very easy and they could be summarized as spam bow from the corners. Also, I'm not sure if I missed it, but there was no lore for half the bosses...they just appear at inconvenient times. \n\nLore, I'll admit, I didn't play the first three and I felt like I was severely missing a chunk on the protagonist's back story. If you're looking for \"dark souls, no questions answered\" kinda lore, look elsewhere.\n\nItems and money: Unless I ground a ton, I never had enough money to buy all the new item/buffs. As I progressed I kept feeling like I had to go back and buy out the merchant...but I was never given the chance.\n\nBacktracking: Warp comes in way too late in the game and most of the time you're just wandering between health upgrades trying not to die before reaching the next save.\n", "timestamp_created": 1596086277, "timestamp_updated": 1596086277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73450454": {"recommendationid": "73450454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240072914", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3094, "last_played": 1602630127}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u2874\u2811\u2844\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u28c0\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28c0\u2840\n\u2838\u2847\u2800\u283f\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u2874\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u2840\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2884\u28e0\u283e\u2801\u28c0\u28c4\u2848\u2819\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6 ta bueno\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2840\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u281b\u2802\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287f\u28bf\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u287e\u28c1\u28c0\u2800\u2834\u2802\u2819\u28d7\u2840\u2800\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u282d\u28a4\u28f4\u28e6\u28e4\u28f9\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28b4\u28f6\u28c6\n\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28ee\u28fd\u28fe\u28ff\u28e5\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2882\u2814\u289a\u287f\u28bf\u28ff\u28e6\u28f4\u28fe\u2838\u28fc\u287f\n\u2800\u2880\u285e\u2801\u2819\u283b\u283f\u281f\u2809\u2800\u281b\u28b9\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cc\u28a4\u28fc\u28ff\u28fe\u28ff\u285f\u2809\n\u2800\u28fe\u28f7\u28f6\u2807\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28c4\u28c0\u2840\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847compralo\n\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2809\u2800\u2800\u28a6\u2848\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28fd\u2879\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2832\u28fd\u287b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28dc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\n\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28b8\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28f6\u28ee\u28ed\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28c0\u28c0\u28c8\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1596002196, "timestamp_updated": 1596002196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631097555160522461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73392543": {"recommendationid": "73392543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035589123", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1700352952}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally got around halfway through this game and so far I'm enjoying it.\n\nI originally bought the game in October 2016 but never really touched it around the time or played it too much although according to steam I spent 1.5 hours on it I never got past the 2nd area of the game (The Dark Town) and stopped playing it for other games at the time.\n\nI did the same thing to Rabi-Ribi back in 2016 which is another Metroidvania, Now with Momodora, I bought the game on PS4 recently a 2nd time despite the fact I already owned it on PC. \n\nI decided to play through the game on PS4 and so far I'm enjoying it.

In this game you play as Kaho, a young priestess, that is looking for the source of a curse so that she can destroy it. While traversing the areas you will have a leaf (the primary attack, your melee weapon), a bow, and various items/spells (that you purchase from a merchant or find as treasure) at your disposal. This game offers four difficulty levels, making it approachable for nearly everyone; However, there are some relatively minor sexual themes so you might find inappropriate for children.\n\n[h1] Thoughts [/h1]\nThis game is absolutely stunning looking. The areas, bosses, and enemies are all very diverse and beautifully done. There are quite a few different areas presented in this game (from the woods to the chapels and castles), and the amount of different enemy types is impressive for such a small game. [spoiler]Lubella and Derelict Frida are two particularly beautiful bosses[/spoiler]. The animations are super smooth and wonderful to watch as well. The whole experience just looked exceptionally polished.\n \nOn top of looking the great, the game [i]feels [/i] great. The melee combat has such a wonderful weight to it that is just so satisfying to me. Finding ways to work the bow in to combos was really fun, and experimenting with the different items/spells was also really rewarding. The items added a wonderful modern element to an otherwise relatively simple game. The bosses were all pretty exciting to fight; I particularly enjoyed fighting [spoiler]Pardoner Fennel, Lubella, and the Queen[/spoiler]. Combat aside, the movement in the game felt just right; tight, and not too slow or fast. Once you unlock [spoiler]the ability to turn in to a cat[/spoiler], you can traverse areas a little bit faster. The checkpoints were really forgiving, and teleporting around also made the size of the map totally do-able without being overwhelming. I also really enjoyed the concept of defeating bosses without getting hit to get extra rewards. The four difficulty options make sure that just about anyone could play the game and enjoy it, and personally, I found Insane (the hardest difficulty, where you die in one hit) to be the perfect challenge for me.\n\nThe story in the game isn't very exciting, but I also don't think it's really that significant to the experience. This game borrows a little from Dark Souls (the checkpoint system reminds me of it, unlocking the ability to teleport about halfway through the game, and various other elements like some of the items you can use), but it definitely doesn't have nearly as serious of a story. You are basically just playing as a priestess that is on a quest to [spoiler]defeat an evil Queen to prevent her from destroying the world. In doing so you end up sacrificing yourself for the greater good[/spoiler]. It's very cliche, but that is standard for action/adventure games. I suppose I should mention that [spoiler]there are two possible endings (a good ending and a bad ending). As far as I know, the only thing that really matters is whether or not you upgrade your leaf before you defeat the final boss. If you upgrade the leaf you will unlock a third boss phase and the good ending[/spoiler]. The writing in this game definitely doesn't escape the shadow of the visuals, gameplay, or music.\n\nThe music is just great. I particularly like the tracks House of Cinders (the opening is extremely atmospheric and kind of reminds me of a broody Dead Can Dance song), Pardoner's Dance (it's just beautiful), and The Lovely Queen (it's so intense and retro). I actually listened to the OST after finishing the game just to take in the music a little bit more and it's a pretty great soundtrack that adds a lot to the experience of the game (the Pardoner boss fight is so much better with that track playing). The sound design is also really great, with the combat and movement sounding wonderful and making everything just come together so well. \n\nI would highly recommend this game (to everyone, but particularly people who enjoy retro games or metroidvanias), especially at such a low price ($9.99 is truly a bargain for this game). My first playthrough was around three hours, with subsequent playthroughs being under an hour. In all four of my playthroughs (one on each difficulty) I didn't experience any bugs or issues.

For better or worse, I 100%'ed it within 20 hours, but it looks like the game has a bit of a cult following, and you could definitely cook up your own challenges involving items and playstyles.

Everything seemed to work properly. Otherwise, a completely forgettable metroidvania experience: there's nothing here that stands out from anything else in the genre. There's little enemy variety which makes trudging through areas a slog of repetition. You have two attacks which never change throughout the course of the game, making the backtracking un-fun compared to other games in the genre that juxtapose your present abilities against what use to be challenging to deal with. Design choices that slow down gameplay such as not having a minimap, an item bar that only has 3 quick slots but can be changed out at any time by pausing. There isn't a strong narrative, character development, mysteries to investigate, or other internal motivation to drive your actions other than 'I want to beat the game.' Additionally, it's incredibly short, and the difference between the 'good' and 'bad' ending is picking up one item at the end that requires a slight bit of backtracking.\n\nLastly, there is a section that requires you to go underwater to progress. Until this point, jumping in water was an instant death. I explored the entire map searching for a hidden ability or passage to continue, only to find that there was one place that you could enter the water without dying. As far as I could tell, there was no in-game information to express this was the correct path. This was disappointing for someone that enjoys exploration games. Not only that, but, once in the water, you have infinite air and can 'swim' by jumping as much as you want. Knowing that, why even make water hazards before this that instantly kill you if the water is harmless otherwise? It's a strange design choice to be sure.\n\nIf you're looking to get into a game in the genre, this might be an ok starting point, otherwise you won't find much substance in this game to keep you invested. You're be better served to play Symphony of the Night as far as AAA games go, and perhaps Death's Gambit if you want to stay indie.", "timestamp_created": 1594834725, "timestamp_updated": 1594834725, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480456024408340454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72692787": {"recommendationid": "72692787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049474443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1593398493}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game that shouldn't take too long too complete, great soundtrack and atmosphere, and pretty challenging \n\n9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1594755242, "timestamp_updated": 1594755242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72631506": {"recommendationid": "72631506", "author": {"steamid": "76561199017154670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 464, "last_played": 1594661277}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego encantador de estilo pixel art si son amantes de los juegos de la antigua escuela no te debes \n perder este, recomendable al 100% \nUn tip para los que que abren el juego por primera ves : los items usables se regeneran en las campanas asi que usenlos sin miedo a perderlos", "timestamp_created": 1594661674, "timestamp_updated": 1594661674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72607162": {"recommendationid": "72607162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006678314", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1594630846}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00bfPerder todo tu progreso cuando mueres entre los 5 puntos de guardado que hay en todo el juego? \u00bfPermanentemente? \u00bfY adem\u00e1s es un metroidvania?\n\n\n\nNi con cobrando sigo jugando a esto.", "timestamp_created": 1594626097, "timestamp_updated": 1594626128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72585545": {"recommendationid": "72585545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392991997", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 609, "last_played": 1594587917}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, a very fun challenge.

The insta-kill spikes are also a huge turn-off, as they are in the other games. What I found amusing was a underwater level, but every other aspect of water in the game is instant death.

You can jump mid-air, but it's so tiny of a boost that I don't even feel like using it. Yet, it is frequently needed to reach some platforms, and since it is so tiny, it gets really difficult to make some jumps that should actually be trivial. I also had some issues with the controls. E.g., after using an item, I expected to be able to switch items right after, but it's not possible. I know I have to wait a bit to use another item, but I should at least be able to switch it whenever I want! I died a bunch of times to a boss, because this very thing kept failing me. The game is difficult, which could be a good thing, but I don't think it is difficult in a good way. It feels mostly like artificial difficulty to me. After many tries, when I finally conquer a difficult section, I don't feel like I earned it, or that I'm better at the game after that many tries.

Momodora 4 is much more of a metroidvania than its predecessor but still fumbles the progression elements. Most of the main power-ups are not linked to progression and can be acquired in any order; therefore, for the power-ups that are linked to progression, the worlds optional areas are accessible in an uneven manner and discourage exploration. The inclusion of hitting random walls to destroy them without indication still remains a mechanic I believe is outdated but I do personally think neutral of the mechanic. For the positives, the world is fun to initially progress through and poses a mild challenge. The combat adds a three hit chain attack with the attack button and the same bow as the last game. All in all, a game worth playing but it did not knock my socks off.  There are clear areas for improvement and I cannot wait to try the next game by the development team: Minoria.\nThe bosses left a lot to be desired. I would almost say the bosses are a downgrade from Momodora 3 but one boss actually left an impression on me that I will remember as one of my favourite bosses I have ever fought. The one boss I did enjoy ended up raising my excitement too high because the rest of them were disappointing. Some of the bosses were above average but the bosses worse than \u2018above average\u2019 were awful. So, I guess overall, a polarizing boss experience.

It has a certain charm, and the mechanics are straightforward. Overall, the experience is better than the gameplay itself, which can be a bit slow and floaty. First, the world is well thought out and charming. I could easily explore and enjoy what the world has to offer, and the unique flavor lets you know you're playing something that is in many ways set apart from the average 2D scroller. This brings me to the art, which is very well done in a similar manner. I find the different areas visually impressive, and while they bear a kind of simplicity they also feel alive insofar as the medium can allow such a thing. The sound design helps with this as well, and while the sounds of the world (voices, footsteps, attacks, etc.) are fairly average, the music girds this title with a sense of adventure. The gameplay is pretty classic in its concept, making it easy to understand and very straightforward, providing no barrier to getting right into the game. Also, points for control scheme customization. The execution of this gameplay, however, is where I feel the games comes up a bit short. I found myself heavily favoring ranged attacks simply because the close-up melee attack took so long to animate. The movement in general felt floaty, and made any attempt at precision a gamble. It was somewhat annoying interacting with an otherwise interesting world. I found myself having to slow myself down to the game's pace in order to play comfortably. Overall, if you're looking for a nice creative game to play for a while and don't mind that the inputs aren't as crisp as they are in some other games, I think you're in for a fun time.

While there are various enemies, you pretty much deal with them in the same fashion: hitstun up close or spam/charge arrows at range.\n\nThe bosses have fair patterns and usually take a few tries. They are pretty fun!\n\nFor me the game is very enjoyable, I just have some nitpicks with it. It feels a bit unpolished in some areas. For some dialogue, there are unnecessary pauses. For bosses with multiple phases, they just kind of reappear awkwardly. The penultimate boss doesn't even have a title, what's that about? Some of the atmosphere is great like in Karst Castle, while other places have deadpan ambience. That's fine because the tone is pretty lonely, but it just feels out of place when other areas have fuller soundtracks.\n\nWith all that said, do I still like the game? Yes!

Visibility is much better, sound is better balanced, and Ivory Bugs are much less hidden.\n\nMomodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight is a short metroidvania from Brazil.\n\nGraphically it's pretty pixel graphics, Kaho has pretty decent animations, in both human and cat form.  Some of the foes are a bit less detailed, but everything generally graphically works.  The reflections when near water look really nice, but sometimes get confusing as to what is the reflection and what is real.  A lot of areas are dark, and sometimes the foes and NPCs can blend into the background.  It's fitting for the story but it makes it easy to take cheap hits.\n\nMusic works, it's nothing special but feels appropriate for the game.  Sounds generally fit as well, though a few sound effects come in far too strong (certain foes when melee'ed or the spinning staff attack used by the cone hatted foes).\n\nBosses are well done, most attacks are well telegraphed.  This is important as defeating certain bosses without losing health (from poison, damage from the boss, or self-damage with items such as the Tainted Missive) will give you a special drop.  Some of these items can be duplicated or mimic'ed in lesser form from later purchases, others (such as the extremely strong Bakman Patch from Lubella 1) can be permanently missed for that playthrough and cannot be duplicated by any other items.\n\nNon-boss difficulty is pretty high throughout the game.  Kaho is not very durable without getting several vitality upgrades, many of which need cat form or air dashing to reach.  Early game when learning you will die a lot.  The earliest foes you meet are the most random and difficult to deal with, imps and witches.  Later you'll be able to handle foes better.  Spikes and pits are almost always 1-hit kills, and there are a lot of those in mid to late game.  Explore cautiously, and be prepared to redo sections often if you die.  Try to get as many Bellflower upgrades as you can.\n\nThe map is passable but not great, most rooms show up on it and there are very few completely secret rooms.  It does not show still closed doors or mark where items you missed are.  Be careful when looking at the minimap with Select on the controller (I'm not sure of the keyboard command), as the screen is NOT paused and enemies can still attack.  Looking at the map when accessed from the pause menu will let you check the map safely.\n\nThe Ring of Candor which you can purchase will do a chime when you enter a room if there is a secret passage or Ivory Bug in it.  Getting all the Ivory Bugs is extremely difficult as there are several really well hidden ones (in invisible hidden walls or ceilings), and they're only a few pixels in size.\n\nOverall, it's well worth the purchase if you like metroidvanias, especially if you get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1589637097, "timestamp_updated": 1647647581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69189065": {"recommendationid": "69189065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118719917", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1589561030}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best metroidvanias around!

Other than that the story that takes place during the game is there but minimal so you won't see much about it even as you play. They'll get the base points of the story across but that's about it.\n\n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\nThe gameplay is good but can wear on some people as it's the same for every enemy: boss or common enemy. Attack, roll away from attacks, attack, etc. There are some spells but overall the direct confrontation is better as it's quicker to dispatch enemies. The bow is straight up the best thing as you'll stay safe but the gameplay will become dull if you rely on it. Two items you find and buy later on are extremely good for the bow making it common enemy stomper. The item that adds fire damage to your attacks not only does that for the bow but also makes it stagger enemies (drops from the fire boss if you don't take damage during the fight). The secret spider merchant sells an item to allow your arrows to pierce, when combined with the fire item, makes your bow the go to for killing common enemies and even dealing with around half of the bosses.\n\n\n[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]\nAll the difficulties up to hard are relatively easy to deal with if you proficient at side scrolling games like Momodora. The insane difficulty lives up to it's name as you start the game with basically no life and even with all HP upgrades any direct attack from any enemy will kill you. When it comes to dying you can choose to \"retry\" or return to the main menu. If you choose retry it just dumps you back at your last save station and you continue on your way. It's very forgiving when dying even on insane difficulty.\n\n\n[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]\nThe graphics are pixel designed. That much is obvious even from the store page. I have a soft spot for these designs as I grew up with pixel games back on the NES and original Gameboy. The graphics of the pixel art itself is pretty nice. Not the best ever but it's great to look at.\n\n\n[h1][u]Audio[/u][/h1]\nI didn't have anything to dislike when it came to the sounds or music. It's all nice to hear and works in unison with the game's design. My only gripe is the death scream for your character Kaho is bit loud but that's it.\n\n\n[h1][u]Performance & Bugs[/u][/h1]\nGame ran very smooth. Played it with a keyboard and didn't have any issues with any input. The game ran without issue graphically and in general. I don't think I even came across any bugs either or if I did they weren't noticeable.\n\n\n[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]\nOne of the better side scrolling pixel games I've played in the past few years and is an experience everyone should try if they like/love these type of games. It might not become one of your favorite games ever but it's something you more than likely will enjoy from beginning to end.\n\n\n\n[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]\nThis review, as with all my reviews, are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make it any more valid than someone else's view on the title. I also will not review a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. This is from score reviews having a 0 and 10. A game can't reach 0 unless it's unfinished and unreleased and in that case can't be reviewed. No game can be a 10 because that would indicate perfection and no game is perfect. There's always flaws.\n\nIf I happen to like or recommend a game it doesn't mean I'm blind to any potential flaws it may have nor does it mean I'm going to defend the company who made it. If I happen to dislike the game or not recommend it that doesn't mean I hate the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews aim about the game in question and not the players who like or dislike it. If a game is bad enough I will heavily criticize the devs and company. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking or not liking a game.\n\nIf the game I'm reviewing is an online game, be it PvP or PvE, please use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated the game is. You don't want to waste money on a title with no players in it. Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft titles. They usually have smaller player bases on PC but if crossplay is available then you generally don't need to worry about a small PC player base.\n\nMy reviews might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if I feel they can be done better. If you got all the way to the end of this then thank you for taking the time to read it all.", "timestamp_created": 1588638011, "timestamp_updated": 1614415826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68583319": {"recommendationid": "68583319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127472874", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1591327599}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay wasn't great, bosses were often simple and too repetitive, and I didn't get the story...

Me ha gustado mucho que se pudiera atacar tanto cuerpo a cuerpo como disparando con el arco, y que este tuviese flechas ilimitadas. Te permite superar algunas zonas sin tener que complicarte la vida innecesariamente, pero tambi\u00e9n sin hacer que el juego sea demasiado f\u00e1cil por ello.\n\n[*]Hay varios objetos equipables con habilidades muy pr\u00e1cticas que resultan satisfactorios de utilizar. Adem\u00e1s, se puede abrir el men\u00fa de pausa para cambiarlos en mitad de la pelea.\n\n[*]La dificultad del juego est\u00e1 bien medida. El juego es generalmente pasable sin tener que darte cabezazos contra el teclado, pero sin ser tan f\u00e1cil como para pas\u00e1rtelo yendo sin cuidado. Igual las \u00fanicas excepciones son al principio, donde tienes poca vida y es f\u00e1cil morir, y al final, donde hay varias zonas con plataformas estrechas rodeadas de trampas que te matan instant\u00e1neamente. Y estas est\u00e1n entre una pelea de jefe y el siguiente punto de guardado, que es el \u00fanico al que puedes acceder tras dicha pelea. Lo primero se pasa tras un rato jugando. M\u00e1s o menos tras completar la primera zona. Lo segundo, es s\u00f3lo un cachito muy corto al final, antes de llegar al \u00faltimo jefe. Aunque es muy irritante.\n\n[*]No hay muchos enemigos, pero para las dimensiones y duraci\u00f3n del juego, tiene una cantidad y variedad razonables. Ni le falta, ni le sobra nada. Las peleas de jefes, generalmente, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n muy bien.\n\n[*]Tal vez este sea uno de los pocos juegos etiquetados como Metroidvania que realmente tiene zonas interconectadas entre s\u00ed por varios puntos, e integradas en un s\u00f3lo mapa. Otros simplemente tienen varias \u00e1reas por las que al salir vas a un men\u00fa que te deja teletransportarte a otra zona, o tienen entradas y salidas conectadas sin estar puestas en un mapa en el que encajen todas. Aunque en ese sentido, es una pena que el mapa no sea un poco m\u00e1s grande.\n\n[*]Hay [i]New game+[/i], que tras terminar el \u00faltimo jefe, te permite continuar usando tu ranura de guardado para reiniciar el juego con (casi) todos los objetos e incrementos de vida que tienes al terminar.\n\n[*]El arte es muy bonito (salvo quiz\u00e1s en cierta caverna que est\u00e1 abajo a la derecha en el mapa) y la m\u00fasica muy suave y agradable. Algunas zonas tienen un ambiente que sin ser infantil, es relajado y ligero, mientras que otras tiran a ser un pel\u00edn m\u00e1s siniestras, pero de manera muy sutil y sin exagerar, y no quedan mal unas al lado de las otras. La narrativa, aunque es simple, logra tener junto al arte su dosis de dignidad. Ello permite que el juego se pueda tomar en serio y se disfrute sin necesitar salirse de clich\u00e9s ni complicar las cosas. Algunas zonas de las que son m\u00e1s siniestras y algunos momentos del juego que tienen un aire m\u00e1s dram\u00e1tico pueden recordar un poco a [i]Dark Souls[/i]. Tal vez sea uno de los pocos juegos que tiene un estilo parecido a esa serie sin empe\u00f1arse en imitar la dificultad tonta y bruta de hacer las cosas dif\u00edciles porque s\u00ed.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Contras:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Me hubiera gustado ver algo m\u00e1s de variedad en cuanto a objetos, sobretodo para pelear o moverse por el mapa. Los objetos relacionados con pelear est\u00e1n bien y son muy \u00fatiles, pero lo \u00fanico que hacen es mejorar lo que ya sabes hacer en vez de darte opciones diferentes.\n\n[*]La exploraci\u00f3n no es del todo lineal, pero pero hay muy poco backtracking. El mapa es demasiado peque\u00f1o para poder aprovechar eso bien.\n\n[*]Hay varios vendedores de objetos a lo largo del juego, pero una vez visitados no te aparecen marcados en el mapa. Esto no ser\u00eda malo si hubiese un s\u00f3lo vendedor o todos los vendedores tuviesen la misma lista de objetos para vender, pero no es el caso. Si una vez has reunido dinero suficiente quieres ir a donde alg\u00fan vendedor a gast\u00e1rtelo, vas a tener que volver a buscarlos por tu cuenta.\n\n[*]Hay trampas que producen muerte instant\u00e1nea.\n\n[*]Hay zonas enteras llenas de agua donde se puede bucear sin problemas. Sin embargo, en otros sitios, si saltas al agua mueres autom\u00e1ticamente. Me parece un fallo de dise\u00f1o bastante cutre que en el segundo caso no te dejen simplemente salir nadando, mientras que otras zonas son enteramente submarinas y simplemente no necesitas respirar.\n\n[*]En uno de los jefes me llamo la atenci\u00f3n y me dej\u00f3 muy satisfecho que sus ataques, de tonos claros, contrastaban mucho con el fondo oscuro para dejarte verlos bien, y darte una oportunidad justa para reaccionar contra ellos. Bueno, pues ese mismo jefe te lo encuentras una segunda vez y ocurre justo lo contrario. Sus ataques no se ven bien porque no se distinguen bien del fondo, y hace la pelea m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil por motivos por los que no deber\u00eda serlo.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1580071184, "timestamp_updated": 1580071184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53271031379699707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62452907": {"recommendationid": "62452907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162056575", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 434, "last_played": 1580080936}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10", "timestamp_created": 1580049289, "timestamp_updated": 1580049289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62415724": {"recommendationid": "62415724", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025522562", "num_games_owned": 1486, "num_reviews": 227, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 579, "last_played": 1579998130}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well crafted little platformer.

It hits all the check-boxes that makes a good metroidvania title that can easily be completed in a couple days.\n\nThe game focuses as you, a priestist of Lun, tasked with traveling to a nearby kingdom to help rid your people of a terrible curse. As you arrive, you find out that the nearby kingdom is scourged with the same curse and riddled with monsters and a depressing setting which contrasts well with the cute nature you think the game will be. There are few NPCs in the entire game, but the little dialog they do provide helps support the bleak setting you are thrust into.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is an action platform where you can use a (HOLY) maple leaf to smack your foes about, and a charge-up bow to hit them from afar. Some enemies get stunned and are easy to kill while others require you to dodge and attack which keeps you on your toes at all times. There are also a few powerups (air dodge, spells, potions, rings, etc) but none that really shook up game play for me to a great degree. I would have liked to see more meaningful power-ups but I'm not sure if this is just a staple of the series or not.\n\nDifficulty isn't too terrible.

I have absolutely no idea what anyone sees in this garbage. The combat isn't enjoyable in any way, enemy design is boring and at times borderline ridiculous (two boss fights are giant women whom you need to smack their tits to kill them), the metroidvania exploratory aspects of the game are near non-existent, the game is very challenging in a boring play-it-super-safe kind of way, there are no interesting weapons or attacks. I generally don't give a shit about story but this game has absolutely none at all(yet the box art/steam art makes it look like some grand adventure with many wacky and interesting characters). \n\nI just, I don't get it. There are plenty of other metroid style games out there that are so much better than this.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, the name is stupid, too.

Gorgeous art tho\n\nLong version: Almost all of the difficulty in the game comes from one of the following sources\n- Enemies/bullets that appear from nowhere, forcing you to memorize their locations\n- Instadeath spikes in locations that aren't especially challenging, but which will cause you to replay the last 5-10 minutes if you touch them\n- Save points and shortcuts that are extremely scarce, and one-way paths that are fairly abundant, forcing you to navigate through large portions of each area over and over again just to get around\n- Having to backtrack through old areas (not looking for secrets, just to get around), then getting hit while you're zoned out\n- Solutions to these problem (eg fast movement, fast travel with bells) being only available in the last third to quarter of the game, once you stop needing them, and not being very effective at their job even then\n\nNothing in the game ever really felt challenging; even the final boss and secret boss were pretty easy. Those fights are at least kind of interesting conceptually, but the vast majority of the game is not in those fights, and as outlined above, there isn't much else to it. For most of the time I was playing, I was either bored or mildly frustrated; it felt like the game was trying its hardest to make me zone out, but the game punishes you for doing so with level design that forces you to slowly backtrack through old areas and memorize exact enemy locations. \n\nAt this point there are just lots of better action platformers, even by the same publisher (check out Touhou Luna Nights, which has none of these problems).

The art style is nice and the sound design builds a good atmosphere. Game-play is solid and feeling kinda similar to the souls \"don't rush it\" formula.

Boss fights and many other moments in the game require death to learn what's going on. Again, this feels very cheap as do the boss fights which seem to happen way more often than they need to. All i ever shout is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!! Honestly, it's just not cool...\n\nFighting a boss that starts flashing to warn for an attack is fine but when the attack is a massive explosion around the enemy that your witnessing for the first time you just get one hitted, despite having all health upgrades. Dark Souls animates their bosses and adds sound ques so you KNOW something big is about to happen. This is lost in pixel art 2D...and so you die!\n\nBut overall, exploration and combat with upgrades sprinkled around make it very much a game that can be hard to put down. It annoys me as much as entertains me. Worth grabbing in a sale but be prepared, this isn't anywhere as balanced and enjoyable as a real souls game.

I think it is asking me to diligently learn every enemy's moves and pay a lot of attention to the bosses, but the extremely inconsistent hit detection and absolutely punishing amount of damage mean I die endlessly while trying to proceed.  And dying means a painful shrieking scream out of my speakers, which is hugely jarring.\n\nMany times I have reached a point where I thought I was doing well, only to succumb to a poor design choice of an instant kill hit before reaching a save point.  Hilariously, there was one boss I completed, walked to the left, puzzled over whether I was looking at a ledge or water or something and figured the game wanted me to explore - so I jumped in the water and instantly died.  Had to play the boss fight over.  Then, a short time later, I discover my character can exist forever under the water for no apparent reason, but only intended water pools.  THIS is the entire game for me.\n\nWill things kill me instantly or reward me for walking up and talking to them?  Is one arbitrary path leading to an impossible boss I'm not ready for or something else?  Will I be hurt by touching an enemy or not?  Who can say.  And, after enough of this, I'm not sure I care anymore.\n\nI am punished for doing anything the game designer didn't intend and simply don't have the patience after dying repeatedly to want to wait and learn the boss fights.  I can tell there is a great game here wanting to get out, but it is as if there is a deep almost cultural lexicon which I am missing.\n\nIn many ways I *want* there to be a level of uncertainty, but I guess other gamers seem to enjoy a puzzling grind fest.  I get that.  The old Megaman series was a lot like this, but I think I was hoping for something a little more modern Castlevania or Cave Story than old-school difficult.  It probably comes down to whether you want a relaxing game for the weekend after a hard week at work or really need a challenge.\n\nThankfully, this was just a random Humble Bundle game for me, so I'm not really disappointed in that.  Just admittedly frustrated at the game to the point where I realize I didn't enjoy much of the past few hours in it.  It is a shame, as the game looks so nice, otherwise, I want to enjoy it.\n\nIf you *want* that challenge, this is a good short little game to pass a day with.", "timestamp_created": 1574628260,

Those are some of the good things, but there's a lot of bad as well IMO and in the end it wasn't enough to save me from eventually just loosing interest.\n\nIt's made what is, in my opinion, a critical mistake in the design of pretty much any game that includes a dodge: it's easy to get locked out of having access to your dodge. There are common used animation all of the place that lock the dodge for a moment, and result in attempting to dodge... doing nothing. It's perfectly acceptable for big charge-ups or other powerful moves to lock you out of your dodge, it's easy to learn which abilities those are and be prepared to commit to them if you're going to use them. But attacking twice? You're locked out of the dodge for a period of the second attack?\n\nIt lacks a key component of metroidvania games for as far as I got, there aren't abilities that open up the map. Just keys. Now... I've seen a number of map areas that appear to need abilities to access them... so I'm guessing that there are abilities somewhere to access them... but at 46% map completion I'd gotten none. At best, there feels like there's a pacing problem somewhere in there.\n\nThe story telling felt... just... meh... I simply wasn't pulled in. Then again, I don't play these games for the story telling. I play them for the game play. It was lacking. The game didn't feel fluid, it didn't feel like you had control, it felt like there was an extreme lack control.

You have two attacks, a melee leaf strike, and a shot with a bow.\nYou deal with every enemy in exactly the same way:\n1) You run to melee range, and since every attack stuns them, you just stunlock them to death.\n2) You stay at a distance and spam arrows until they die.\n\nThere's no reason to deviate from this, no reason to vary it up. However, this would be fine, if the enemy design was interesting, alas, this can also be summed up in four different categories:\n1) Enemies that walk towards you and melee attack you.\n2) Enemies that throw projectiles or spells in either an arc towards you, or actually targeted.\n3) Melee enemies that block attacks from the front except when they're attacking.\n4) Enemies that slowly float towards you and do contact damage/explode.\n\nYour only reason for fighting is to earn currency, which is in itself fairly useless.\nThe next part of combat could be a very redeeming aspect, which is boss fights. Sadly, this is the worst part of Momodora for me. The bosses are just boring slog. They're slow, the attacks are all easily avoided, the telegraphing is extremely inconsistent. To give an example from the same boss, which has 2 melee attacks, one which does roughly 40% of your hp in damage, and one which does 80% of your hp in damage. The former has a long windup + visual effect playing, the latter has one unique frame of animation, quick windup, and no visual effect.\nIn general, the bosses are slow, have almost no attacks, often very boring ones, can go off-screen/be invulnerable for such long periods of time, that your character literally stands still for long enough to play the idle-fidget animations, one of which is a yawn, which is exactly what the boss fights feel like.\nAny semblance of difficulty comes completely from the high amount of damage each attack deals, rather than from interesting attacks to dodge. Overall, an extreme disappointment.\n\nThis is an easy game, but death is inevitable. Most of the deaths I've had came from one of two sources:\n1) Water, which in some places you can, and even must swim in to progress. In other places, the exact same looking water is an instant death.\n2) Spikes, any platforming mistake is an instant death.\nDeath sets you back to your last save point, which can be quite a far way back, so it becomes rather tedious.\n\nLuckily there are a few things in the game that make me not completely regret spending the time on playing it. Firstly, aesthetically the world is pleasing, and the same goes for the music. The story, while nothing special, is cute enough. The characters you meet give the world some flair, and while I was quite disappointed that they almost never react to any actions you've taken in the world, it was still rather pleasant. Secondly, there is some decent exploration, and while secrets mostly lack any indication (except for a passive item that chimes when you enter a room with a secret), it's still something I enjoyed, and the main reason I finished the game.\n\nOverall, the game is mediocre at best, and I really don't see how it received such universal acclaim.", "timestamp_created": 1572176898, "timestamp_updated": 1572176898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641361653804779053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55816340": {"recommendationid": "55816340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240936778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1528, "last_played": 1653358796}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me happy.", "timestamp_created": 1572123563, "timestamp_updated": 1572123563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55805538": {"recommendationid": "55805538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077597708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1572135444}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been a big trip. To begin, I didn't know much about this game or what to expect. I quickly learned it is a Metroid-vania which typically rewards exploration.

The game was difficult for me in the beginning, however once I had gotten a handle on the controls/appropriately dodging, the game does become quite enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I did like the game eventually, with a few caveats:\n\nCons:\n- The early game will punish you for recklessly moving forward; I'm not certain if this was intentional, but often times your HP only allows for 3 hits before dying. While this does force you to get a better handle of the controls, I have to admit I rage quit a couple times (though I did keep coming back)\n- With some boss fights, there is not always a save point prior to the boss room; this can make some boss fights frustrating\n- The map is a bit annoying - it would have been helpful if the different areas were color coded\n\nPros:\n- The game offered a decent challenge once the game mechanics were learned\n- Interesting areas to explore\n\nNeutral:\n- While there are new sprites for enemies in new areas, there are a number of enemy types which are pretty much the same. Once you've gotten a handle on these basic enemy types, the game becomes a lot easier.\n\nMy first playthrough took me just under 8 hours to complete with most of the secrets found.", "timestamp_created": 1572099618, "timestamp_updated": 1572099618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55796413": {"recommendationid": "55796413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123127282", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1586963583}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game art style?", "timestamp_created": 1572078246, "timestamp_updated": 1572078246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55781206": {"recommendationid": "55781206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147070455", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 632, "last_played": 1572205572}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, it is very entertaining, good bosses and fluid gameplay, 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1572033721, "timestamp_updated": 1572033721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55780579": {"recommendationid": "55780579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035520659", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1571701957}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it as tribute to halfcoordinated's speedrun of the same game.

Its single map contains a maze to explore with different environments that hide different visuals and enemies, hiding upgrades, items, easter eggs and even new environments that will encourage the player to explore. Its designed to be replayed, with a New Game+ mode, and additional difficulties that will prove to be quite the challenge.\n\n[h1]Its affordable price tag makes it a no-brainer for fans of metroidvania 2D side-scrollers, and it's also recommended to anyone looking for a challenging game.[/h1]\n\nNow onto the details:\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nYou're thrown into the shoes of Kaho, a priestess of the Lun village, which has fallen victim of a curse that has extended itself throughout the land, and it's your duty to find a remedy.\n\nThroughout the story you'll discover more about the world around you, and will meet unique characters, be it allies or foes.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nTo be honest, one of the things that made me try out this game was seeing it on Youtube and being stunned by the animation quality and art. It's brimming with personality. Unique and expressive characters and beautiful backgrounds make for a stimulating experience, with each area containing different environments and enemy types, each with their own theme.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay reminded me of [i]Dust: An Elysian Tail[/i], and breaks down in three main categories:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Exploration[/b]\nThe game is set on an open-ended environment, which means that you'll be trapped in a single level where you can go back and forth to any direction you want, and revisit places at any time.\n\nThis kind of gameplay has it's pros, and cons:\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Allows the player to pace the gameplay and explore the level to their heart's content without having to worry whether they'll miss something out.\n[*] The environment is refined and there are many multi-purposed areas. This means that some passageways are initially unreachable by the player, which with the later found upgrades, can be explored, bringing life again to what seemed [i]just another cleared area[/i]. With the addition of fast-travel on the latter half of the game just makes exploration more entertaining.\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Requires backtracking. One of the bad things about these kind of games is that, until you start getting oriented, and/or receive fast-travel, you might find yourself mindlessly walking around the same areas over and over again, which can get a bit repetitive, more so in the first half of the game.\n[/list]\n[*] [b]Combat[/b]\nCombat is composed of two components: Melee, and ranged attacks.\n\nMelee has a simple 4 combo mechanic that can be repeatedly used with no cooldown, it's simple yet satisfactory to use, and very effective.\n\nRanged attacks are done with a bow and an [i]infinite[/i] amount of arrows, so you don't need to worry about ammo since you'll be using it, [b]a lot[/b]. The bow is the most complex of the two, allowing for charged attacks that, with upgrades, can charge to different levels, attacking in different ways. Other upgrades include rate-of-fire, charge speed and damage.\n\nHowever, our protagonist can also [b]dodge[/b] by rolling. It's a really effective and useful mechanic, nullifying any damage done to Kaho when on a roll.\n\nThe only frustrating aspect is [b]contact damage[/b] which makes some boss fights frustrating as you'll find yourself taking damage before learning that some characters will roll and move like the player, only that they deal damage by merely [b]touching[/b]. Obviously this is based on preference, as the game will give you the tools to overcome this, and you'll have to approach combat in a different way.\n\n[*] [b]Items[/b]\nThere's a simple inventory system, with slots for consumable items, and passive items. They are sold by different merchants with the in-game currency obtained by either secrets or killing enemies.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Well, off to check out the rest of the series.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1571355132, "timestamp_updated": 1571356315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55633991": {"recommendationid": "55633991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121976983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 565, "last_played": 1605116989}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, amazing atmosphere!", "timestamp_created": 1571263093, "timestamp_updated": 1571263093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55594515": {"recommendationid": "55594515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044787595", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1471977781}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting platformer with a cute artstyle but is just too difficult to be enjoyed.", "timestamp_created": 1571017392, "timestamp_updated": 1571017392, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.297707587480545044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55593260": {"recommendationid": "55593260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010241670", "num_games_owned": 749, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 322, "last_played": 1570940574}, "language": "english", "review": "A short and sweet metroidvania with gorgeous pixel art, fun and challenging bosses, and the perfect amount of depth for its length.

While the game is short (I finished it in 4 hours), there was never a dull moment. I was constantly going to a new level within 20-30 minutes, which also meant that I was facing a boss within 20-30 minutes. All the levels and bosses are unique and different from each other, which made for a fairly fun experience.\n\nIn this game, you play as a priestess who attacks with a maple leaf\u2026\u2026 just roll with it. She also has a normal weapon, a bow, which she uses for ranged attacks. So you have a melee attack and a ranged attack. The ranged attack has the benefit of range (duh) but the drawback is that it does less damage. While the melee attack has the drawback of needing you to get close to your enemies, and therefore putting you at risk of taking damage, the benefit is that it does more damage AND it's guaranteed to stun most enemies on hit (apart from bosses). Because both attacks have very real benefits and drawbacks, you're going to want to switch between them as the situation changes, which keeps combat interesting.\n\nEnemies themselves are pretty fun to fight. Full disclosure, if you were to face any enemy 1 on 1, you would probably destroy them. However, what keeps enemies interesting is the COMBINATION of different enemies at once. The levels are designed in such a way that you can't just run through spamming the attack button. You have to wait a little bit, think about the best way to approach the enemies and how they'll react to seeing you, and approach them with a mini-strategy in mind. That doesn't mean the game is slow. It's actually pretty fast-paced, and in fact the correct strategy is often to be on the offensive and attack the enemy before they have time to attack you. It's just that 1 wrong move can lead you to taking a hit (for example, if an enemy takes 3 hits to die but you press the attack button 4 times, the level is designed in a way to punish you for it). So yea, the level design is top-notch.\n\nIn regards to bosses, they all look and act very differently from each other (e.g. you're not just fighting a lot of big dudes in armor like in Dark Souls 2). They also require some level of mastering before you'll be able to overcome them. This is because each boss has very specific timing on when you're supposed to dodge the attack. You can't just spam dodge as soon as you see the attack and expect to not take damage. You have to learn the proper timing through trial and error. Furthermore, each boss will drop an item if you can kill them without taking damage. This adds a whole new level of challenge to bosses, and it's something I found a lot of enjoyment in.\n\nThe progression in the game is the game's weakest point. You don't get any new weapons, so you always have only 2 very specific attacks. You also don't get any new movement abilities (you get a mid-air dodge, but that's for combat and is never used for platforming. You also are eventually able to turn into a cat, but that's just to fit into small spaces). There's no levelling. In regards to loot, you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. 1 active item slot is used for healing (i.e. estus flask), so you really only have 2 active item slots and 2 passive item slots. The passive items you can get are pretty boring and are just damage increases, money drop increases, etc\u2026 (you're basically going to use 2 loadouts. 1 loadout increases money collection and reveals secrets. Another loadout increases damage). While there are a lot of active items that are spells, they're effectively useless because all spells require a charge time. That's too slow for bosses and it's faster to kill normal enemies with melee. So yea\u2026.. You're not going to progress much from the time you start playing. What you're doing in the beginning of the game is preeeeeeeeeeetty much what you're going to be doing at the end of the game.\n\nApart from the progression, there are 2 other weaknesses that stop this game from being anything better than \"good\".\n\t\u2022 Damage buffs too strong: With the active and passive items, you can get a lot of damage increases that make fighting bosses too easy (active item that gives 100% more damage + passive item that gives 100% more damage at low health + passive item that gives fire damage to attacks = 200%+ damage). This meant that most bosses took like 30 seconds - 1 minute to beat.\n\t\u2022 Not too difficult/mechanically complex: Enemies eventually become a non-issue because they all die in like 3-5 hits and by the end you have plenty of healing to tank hits until you reach the next save point. Even bosses aren't all that difficult since most of them only have like 3-4 attacks, and almost every attack is simply a matter of timing your dodge-roll properly. Not even jumping is required to dodge any boss attack. It would've been more interesting if your character had more defensive options to choose from (e.g. blocking) or if more enemy attacks required you to move in certain ways to dodge them. \n\nThere's a vague story thrown in. A queen in a kingdom is spreading a curse across the land, and you were sent to stop her. Along the way, you see a lot of NPC's who've lost hope. It's a fairly typical \"slay the villain\" kind of story. None of the characters are developed or anything (most characters only say 3 things in the entire game) and there's no explanation of WHY anything is happening, so there's nothing really to get attached to.\n\nOverall, this is a good Metroid-vania game. However, at the end of the day I can't say it's any better than \"good\" because it's over too quickly and it's honestly not all that hard.

At a glance, the story's nothing special - you play a priestess from a small village which has become affected by a spreading wickedbadness, and apparently its source is the massive capital city a couple blocks over. Being the fine upstanding do-gooder you are, you grab your ritual whackin' leaf and head off to see the queen and find out what's wrong with her plumbing. Upon arrival, you find that everything is deeply horrible, and must slay a bunch of bosses in various corners of the kingdom to unlock the path to the final boss and kick it in the jibblies. All very fine and nice and straightforward.\n\nFortunately for us, the team behind [i]M:RUtM[/i] decided to go with the Soulsborne writing style of Showing a world rather than Telling one. As you explore, you meet survivors of the queen's curse who ramble and prattle on and share some deep life goals, but they do a marvelous job of keeping exposition to a minimum. Instead, you have gorgeously polished 2D environments that explain the state of decay far more clearly than words ever could, and each item you pick up offers a couple sentences of vague plot-snacks that make the world at large just a teensy bit clearer. Couple all that with delightful enemy and boss design that straddles chibi and horror splendidly and you've won me over before we even get to the gameplay.\n\n...And then the gameplay's great! Goodness gracious, you little weasels went and accomplished a whole lot with very little there, didn't you? Your character starts the game with a melee attack combo and a few arrow tricks, and you essentially go the whole game relying on those and some consumables. Rather than throwing a massive arsenal at you which you'll never quite get the hang of, [i]Mr. UM[/i] makes each boss encounter creative and complex enough that you need to work out how to go about dodging everything they throw at you while still inflicting damage of your own. And because Bombservice knows it's my favorite gimmick in the world and loves me very much, they even threw in a mechanic where beating a boss flawlessly rewards you with special, unique pieces of equipment, complete with tasty, tasty plot snippets.\n\nIt's not a terribly long game, but that's perfectly fine. What we have here is polished 'til it shines, and even if some pieces of the game seem baffling, I'm willing to accept that that's just the devs having fun.

This was the very first Momodora experience for me. \n\n Despite all of it's flaws, it was quite a good experience. If you ask to me, Momodora is a great option for people to enter the metroidvania(-like) games. It is somewhat short, well adjusted in difficulty, filled with secrets, subtle designed and connected world, also flavored with soulslike experience. It may be hard to catch up with the story & lore. However, people are used to play these kind of games for it's gameplay. So I'll be examining Momodora in gameplay wise. \n\n You have some basic controls. Jump, roll (and dash in the air later on), attack. You can attack with either your sword or bow. I think bow is quite overpowered if you would have taken pickups later around the midgame. Still, I think bosses are challenging enough. After all, you will memorize the bosses' patterns and the whole map because you will be backtracking a lot. \n\n What I most dislike about the game is sadly it's final ending and the boss itself. The final boss was quite easy on normal. Bosses are sweet with their animations and all but as in gameplay wise, I just could not say they are great. Specifically final boss is just too basic. Also the game just punishes you if you have not collected a single particular item. That being said the game only has 2 endings which are Bad Ending and True Ending. I mean there are usually Good&Bad&optional/secret endings. There are no proper ending. If you have collected the item you can get the true ending & achievement. If you have not collected that item you just fail and can't fight with the phase 3 of the final boss. If it wasn't a guide, I would not have been finished the game with true ending. \n\n + Pretty good amounts of bosses with variety\n + Cleverly designed levels \n + A good place to start playing metroidvania(-like) games\n + It is short but lives it's price tag\n + Charming animations & pixel art \n + Item variety, map filled with secrets \n + Pretty well designed difficulty except few situations + great checkpoint system that is similar to the bonfires\n\n - The final boss is just like another boss with 3 phases. \n - Bosses are usually subpar in gameplay terms comparing them to games like Rogue Legacy, Dead Cells, Castlevania et cetera.\n - Endings are bad in narrative terms and doesn't give the feeling of accomplishment \n - Platforming is kinda irritating at times \n\nI give the game a solid 78 out of 100 though. It was enjoyable. Looking forward for a sequal filled with better secrets and bosses, and hopefully more lengthful.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/35602119-The-Deus-eX-foX/ My curator page.", "timestamp_created": 1566087205, "timestamp_updated": 1566087589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646904408931732178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54672212": {"recommendationid": "54672212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970519156", "num_games_owned": 845, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1566083238}, "language": "english", "review": "Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight is a well wrought platformer with snappy controls.

No recomiendo este juego ya que a m\u00ed no me gust\u00f3 debido a las siguientes razones. \n\nEl combate me pareci\u00f3 arcaico, a diferencia de por ejemplo Hollow Knight donde un golpe o una esquiva son instant\u00e1neas. Y se podr\u00eda decir que la lentitud en los movimientos fue hecha para que se requiera una mayor habilidad para planear los ataques y los contra-ataques en las peleas. Sin embargo el primer jefe lo derrot\u00e9 al primer intento al quedarme quieto en un punto seguro.\n\nEsto es un metroidvania y por lo que logr\u00e9 ver, la exploraci\u00f3n estaba mal llevada. Creo esto porque los mapas eran muy lineares con una peque\u00f1a ramificaci\u00f3n por ah\u00ed, similar a Shovel Knight. Sin embargo este juego al ser un metroidvania est\u00e1 intentando otorgar exploraci\u00f3n y sensaciones de descubrimiento, pero al ser tan lineal no lo logra. \n\nLos personajes que me encontr\u00e9 no fueron para nada memorables y carecieron de cualquier encanto tanto en dise\u00f1o como en personalidad. A diferencia de por ejemplo Celeste o Undertale. Donde cada vez que aparec\u00eda un personaje era un motivo de alegr\u00eda pues estaban bien dise\u00f1ados y se luc\u00edan de manera magistral. Y es una l\u00e1st\u00edma porque se nota que los personajes en Momodora en serio intentan ser recordables.\n\nOtro punto que personalmente odie much\u00edsimo fue que hab\u00eda muerte instant\u00e1nea por ca\u00edda en precipicios, en un metroidvania con unos checkpoints, que cr\u00e9anme, estaban muy separados entre si. \n\nPara concluir dir\u00e9 que no, no deber\u00edas comprar este juego debido a su combate, su exploraci\u00f3n, sus personajes y un mont\u00f3n de peque\u00f1os errores.\n\nPero hey, solo jugu\u00e9 por una hora y media as\u00ed que, qu\u00eden sabe, tal vez luego se pone bueno.", "timestamp_created": 1564095797, "timestamp_updated": 1564095797, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437810957431793213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54249679": {"recommendationid": "54249679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025494704", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 594, "last_played": 1563868306}, "language": "english", "review": "Great art,\nAmazing sound design,\nGood music,\nFun combat,\neasy to pick up and finish in one sitting.

Every mistake I made was my, and my only. Whacking enemies is pretty fun, though you might quite quickly find that avoiding them is just as effective (except for some cases). Main character feels satisfying to walk, jump, dash and fight, which is important to mention, beacuse if opposite happens in a game, it ruins a whole lotta fun, in my opinion.\n\nGraphics are really appealing. I wouldn't necessary say that everything looks stunnig, but it's solid, modern pixelart. Quite nice touch is actually seeing it being only pixelart, and none of that blurs and effects on lighting and shading. Same goes for animation \u2013 satisfying to watch (I often found myself just swinging the weapon around to see how the character moves, so kudos to the animators).\n\nMusic and sound design is good. There's nothing that stuck with me (even after repeating bosses several times in a row) so I can't say it's too memorable, but it's solind and enjoyable. I'm not sure on this one, but I would say that most of the bosses share the same track, which gets boring after some time (and loses a lot of its drama).\n\nBosses, are, of course, the main course and boy, are they really thoughtful put together. With a few expections, every fight is unique and memorable, and even though I can't remember all of the characters names, I still remember how to fight them and what moves thes execute in which order. Those are the main difficulty of the game, and the reason you die so often, as expected, but I rarely felt irritated during the process.\n\nDifficulty is rather low dare I say. Despite many options in-game and additional challanges suggested by achievements I didn't have much problem with finishing the game on hard difficulty in around 4 hours, and then re-running it again on insane difficulty (you basically die in one hit form 90% of stuff) in half the time. But then again, for somebody new to the genre it might be more challenging.\n\nStory and characters are quite basic, devs really wanted to go for this scarce, dark souls-ish item descrition lore, but I didn't get hooked. You probably could create quite interesting universe while reading all descriptions and dialogues, but the main arc of the game would still be quite mundane. I don't wanna get into details, but *great threat*, *4 powerful beings*, *primodial evil*, you know the drill.\n\nAnd last, but not least \u2013 heavily inspired by some elements from Dark Souls. I mean, usually it's game mechanics or something like that, but this time I found myself giggling while finding exact replica of \u201cDoes not open from this side\u201d frm my beloved franchise. Beside that, the general feel of the city was came preety close to Dark Souls 3, and the panels showing names of the locations were almost identical.

The game is pretty short (4-5 hours for a first playthrough is pretty reasonable) that you can beat in one longer sitting and it is also a very comfortable game to return to and play again later.\n\nThe story is that you are playing as Kaho, a priestess who is travelling to the city of Karst. A corruption is spreading through the land so you want to reach the queen for an audience and find a way to stop this corruption from spreading and destroying the land. As you explore the city of Karst and the neighbouring areas you will encounter several enemies, bosses and also some friends who will help you on your journey and expand on what is going on in the kingdom.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, you start out with a double jump that makes platforming feel smooth from the start. You have a melee attack combo in which you use a blessed leaf to strike your enemies and you have a bow, which you can charge up to shoot more powerful ranged attacks with. Finally you have a roll, it gives you invulnerability and allows you to pass through enemies making it a very powerful tool to avoid enemies or damage.\n\nThis set of tools makes for combat that has a nice impact to it. The last attack in your melee combo does heavy damage but is also a move you must commit to, so spamming it is not an option unless you want to get hit back!\n\nThe bosses in the game are well design, with various designs and movesets. While the bosses take a while to learn and are not a walk in the park, I found that they offer a reasonable challenge. There might even be something special waiting if you manage to defeat a boss without taking any damage...\n\nOne of the best parts about this game is how the items work. There are two types of items, active items and passive items. Passive items you equip and they do something special by just having them equipped. Active items have a limited amount of uses, but they are refilled every time you go save! This means you don't have to save your active items for that one boss fight in the future that where they will definitely be needed, instead this game encourages you to use your items to progress forwards all the time.\n\nAs for exploration, this game has several different areas with very different atmosphere, design and some level design philosophies. This leads to a nice variety so you aren't stuck fighting imps for the entire game!\n\nOne thing that contributes a lot to the atmosphere is the music, each area has it's own music which enhances the mood a lot. Bosses also have good music which adds excitement to the fights.\n\nThis game also has 4 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane (which you unlock by clearing the game on Hard). On each difficulty you start out with less and less health, from a lot of health on easy to only 1 health on insane (yes, this means any damage you take will kill you!).\n\nFor the completionist it doesn't take much longer to find everything needed to be collected. As for achievements there are some that are a bit more challenging, but nothing unreasonable here!", "timestamp_created": 1561829117, "timestamp_updated": 1629075643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52044204": {"recommendationid": "52044204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418002776", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1646828479}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game", "timestamp_created": 1561824251, "timestamp_updated": 1561824251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52036091": {"recommendationid": "52036091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066013216", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1561989623}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it. :^)", "timestamp_created": 1561823360, "timestamp_updated": 1561823360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51986693": {"recommendationid": "51986693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085474655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1513202015}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing artstyle and fun gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1561818145, "timestamp_updated": 1561818145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51968104": {"recommendationid": "51968104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256557124", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "playtime_at_review": 849, "last_played": 1700358369}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a very good Metroidvania.

A,S,D and i cant remember all then because i changed in the first seconds. that wasnt a good decision, in my sight\n\nMomodora can be resumed in a short, but really good game, if u want some fast experience, doesnt want to pay too much, a pretty art and soundtrack. thats for u :)", "timestamp_created": 1559256558, "timestamp_updated": 1559256558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483901709318161011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50960746": {"recommendationid": "50960746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050853569", "num_games_owned": 3262, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 526, "last_played": 1560116233}, "language": "english", "review": "You must understand that the initial toughness of this game is balanced later on.

There are also places where enemies that are designed to blend into the background (paintings, statues) are introduced by placing them on the other side of an instant death pit, causing you to slam your face into them and die. There are also way too many instant-death spikes and tricky jumps that just feel like cheap deaths.\n\nThe bosses are good looking, but their fight design is pretty awful. The first boss has several attacks with vague sprites (as in, they are mostly transparent and circular with minimal indication) and I found myself turning down the graphics options to lower the detrimental graphical effects such as lighting that hides indicators and particles that clutter the screen. Along with this, many bosses have attacks that either cover most of the screen (the witch that you fight twice has an attack that is both vague and covers a lot of the screen) or chase you down. In particular, one of the humanoid bosses has an attack in their seconds phase in which they dash towards you, swing their sword twice, and then spin across half the screen. This attack lasts for multiple seconds, can always hit you, and can change directions three times. this is basically the \"I'm going to now roll back and forth\" period of her fight. Along with this, the humanoid bosses just love to shove themselves inside of you while you roll, causing you to get hit as soon as your I-frames end. You will roll through an attack only for the boss to move into your space and hit you anyways, it's frustrating. Along with this, some bosses have attacks with minimal or NO indication. The 3rd to last bossfight in the game has an arrow-shooting character who will leap across the screen and cover the center with arrows. the only way to see this coming is to either look at her (which means your not watching the much more important boss that you're actually fighting on the ground)  or to just always assume they're about to do it, which is lame.\n\nThe game also has a bad habit of not showing or telling you what enemies do before they hit you. There is an enemy early on that falls on your head when you stand under it, and this is fine, but then they introduce an orange variation later on that can go in any direction and the first time you find out about this is when it chases you through a tight tunnel you are trapped in. You are given minimal time to react to a new enemy that you have not seen before, and you get hit because of it. \n\nThere are multiple endings in this game SPOILER ALERT and it is really dumb. To get the good ending, you simply play through the game as normal except you use a box of wind to upgrade your leaf. That's it, that's all you need to do. No choices, no gameplay challenge, just go use the box on the windmill and voila. This is unfulfilling and leads to the extremely easy final boss to being even more anticlimatic when you don't even get the good ending. And aside from this, there are very few direct upgrades to your weapons.\n\nThe difficulty curve is really strange and is not really curved at all. I didn't notice the challenge ramping up even a little, with most rooms in the early game being just as hard as the rooms later on. What I did notice was that there were many more cheap enemies that appear out of nowhere or hit you from off-screen in the early game and late game, which makes the mid-game my favorite. The witches are the most egregious example, firing large pink projectiles at you from off-screen that have very vague hitboxes (the attack is made of mostly transparent square sprites and I think a transleucent pink ball) and enemy melee attacks can similarly start off-screen. Compound this with the fact that your basic attack does nothing to deter enemy attacks, and a lot of situations can feel cheap and un-reactable. This is basically gone in the mid-game, but it returns in the late game with enemies like paintings and statues that blend in with background elements until you start recognizing their exact shape, as well as some enemies that literally appear from the walls and hit you. The very last stretch of the game is 3 bossfights that feel completely out of order. the first one is the most difficulat, featuring two different characters with hard to read attacks, the second one boils down to a guessing game similar to 1 ball 3 cups, and the last one is a cakewalk that ends the game completely anitclimactically \n\nThe upgrades you buy from the single in-game shopkeeper are incredibly lame. Most of them are not very useful (there's one that increases your damage and also hurts you randomly, which is totally useless when you're trying not to die, along with one that applies poison to your arrows, which only helps in boss fights but is really not worth it sine the arrows aren't very strong anyways) and in the end the only upgrades that are worth anything are the mandatory story ones that give you mostly bow and dodge upgrades and one store upgrade that makes your weaker attacks flinch enemies, which makes the game incredibly easy. Other than that there are money collecting upgrades I never used, a ring that tells you where secrets are, thus completely ruining the point, the aforementioned random death device, one that raises your resistance to bad effects which only occur from incredibly weak enemies very early in the game, one that increases the speed of your arrows from pretty much instant to literally instant and probably more I didn't even bother buying. You can have two of these at a time and the choice is pretty obvious, which would be flinching attacks and poison arrows, and the poison arrows are just for bosses anyways.", "timestamp_created": 1559082164, "timestamp_updated": 1559082174, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437877386808395386", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50912355": {"recommendationid": "50912355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160700469", "num_games_owned": 969, "num_reviews": 1247, "playtime_forever": 952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1559389032}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1559060069, "timestamp_updated": 1559568097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50900921": {"recommendationid": "50900921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114157251", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1620275381}, "language": "english", "review": "I very much would like to play this game, but despite the stats of it claiming there is \"full controller support,\" the game does not recognize my controller.\n\nI have an F310 Logitech controller; I have tried switching between Dinput and Xinput, to no avail.

When arriving at Karst it's immediately understood that \n       things are not as they seem and the city is emanating the curse Kaho is trying to stop.

You are fighting \n       enemies while making your way jumping and hopping on platforms to boss fights.

A young priestess is sacrificing her own \n       wellbeing (and in some endings her life) for her homeland's safety. Along with meeting and helping out \n       victims of the curse in several sidequests.

Momodora has outstanding music, and I will be purchasing the soundtrack at a later date. This game does follow a story line from a series of games. But as far as I'm aware you don't have to play those to get a full experience from this game's story; as it seems mostly self-contained, but I could be wrong.\n\n My main issue with Momodora is that the game is on the short side. You can beat it in about five hours in your first play through. However, there is a new game+ option and a hard/insane mode; that will increase the game time and make an already tough game even harder. I also feel as though there was also a couple of bullshit moments with the enemy placement in the later levels; The one I remember most is that damn witch in the sewers.  However, most of the difficulty problems I ran into was because of my own skill.

Music, atmosphere, item collection, diverse enemies, etc. but one severe drawback from my pov.\nThe game is challenging but not necessarily in a healthy way. Enemies are positioned to attack where it came off as frustrating. With game design, players shouldn't need to approach a new area cautiously for negative surprises - we should clearly see and adapt without needing to die over and over unless we've memorized enemy layouts when they're unclear. It's the (main) difference between Super Mario versus the Syoban Cat game. This game felt as if it was developed to have more 'random' risks than reward.\nTo be fair, I only played an hour and a half on writing this review, but here are some examples from what I've seen:\n- A wolf breaks out of a box that begins shaking when you approach it. However, the pixel art and lack of ambient lighting in that location made the wolf unapparent\n- Witches began firing before they appeared in the player's fov. There are multiple audio cues for when they fire, but having to rely on that is a bad accessibility move. \n- Enemies apparated/spawned in undeclared locations, which includes the location the player may currently be standing at\n\nOne thing that may be worth noting is that I chose the 'hard' difficulty - but that shouldn't matter with a game design heuristic that applies across the board. Enemies inflicting more damage or having larger hp pools scaling with difficulty makes sense - that's a separate topic from the issue addressed above. At any given difficulty, the issue would still stand; the only difference was that I probably died much more often than had it been on an easier difficulty. \nThe overall combat mechanics make it interesting enough for me to give the game a few more hours of playtime in case this is just an issue of me needing to 'git gud'. And I'll still possibly purchase their upcoming 2019 title, where hopefully the same issue doesn't persist (the trailers look great so far).\nAs a huge fan of this genre, I'm still very eager to see what Bombservice has in store!", "timestamp_created": 1557558823, "timestamp_updated": 1557558823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499112904071807861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50581551": {"recommendationid": "50581551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122239432", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1557533086}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego con un hermoso pixelart, con buena jugabilidad y un excelente soundtrack mis 10 para este jeugo. 100% recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1557533269, "timestamp_updated": 1557533269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50578808": {"recommendationid": "50578808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406165280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 746, "last_played": 1584899094}, "language": "english", "review": "so fun, great atmosphere!", "timestamp_created": 1557519976, "timestamp_updated": 1557519976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50564483": {"recommendationid": "50564483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032632811", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 724, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1557444233}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely sprite work.\n\nIt's a clean Metroidvania where elements of the gameplay and world are translated smoothly over from its inspirations, although that's not to imply that the game is wholly unoriginal.\n\nThere's plenty of challenge available in Momodora but there's thankfully an easy mode lets you explore the game if you aren't up to the task or in the mood for a fight.\n\nDon't overlook this one if you find pixel-art metroidvanias appealing.", "timestamp_created": 1557442679, "timestamp_updated": 1557442679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50563254": {"recommendationid": "50563254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067066773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1597893084}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the atmosphere, soundtrack, graphics, and most of all the gameplay.\n\nIt's a bit like a 2d Bloodborne.

My Macbook Pro can't even run Civ 5 on minimal settings without the fan kicking in, but this game runs like a breeze, even on the high graphic settings.\n\nAlso, I thoroughly enjoyed the surprise boss fights!

I've finished the game several times since, and it deserves at least that much.\n\nI normally like Metroidvania titles that only get easier as you progress, but the reason isn't because the starting zone is so ridiculously difficult to pass through. This game makes that mistake, populating the first cluster of areas you pass through with shield imps who are basically nigh-impossible to actually kill, paired with poison-throwing imps who carpet-bomb much ground (or anything vaguely near you) and are very annoying to avoid (and as it later turned out, these were the only armored and poison-inflicting enemies in the entire game). Maybe my inexperience with combat-oriented Metroidvanias is showing but I wasted way too much time trying to kill everything and constantly dying in this zone, and even when I shifted focus to just getting through without dying, it was still painful. At least this became less of an issue once I got into the next zone and started collecting more items.\n\nI don't hate the Souls-inspired design like the occasional bonfires and You Died screen, but after anywhere from a dozen to a hundred deaths, Kaho's final scream started driving me crazy.  The only way this would've been acceptable to put in would be if Dark Souls had also had the player character emit a similar sound on death.\n\nMy final gripe is the story. Not the whole thing, just parts of it. While it apparently continues a trend in the series of a matriarchal world where the people are accustomed to solving all problems with sacrifices, this particular game mostly offers an excuse plot. A darkness grips the land, so you enter a cursed place to end the source of it all, which turns out to be the result of a deal with the devil. (Sound familiar?) Once you venture far enough you're told to gather a total of 4 fragments (actually 3, since you collect one right then) of an item which for some reason are guarded by the very enemies of the Queen and/or Church (the Pardoner and Derelict respectively, and the Arsonist would qualify as both). Who even knows why one fragment was hidden on a spiritual plane?\n\nThis game does do a lot well, like easier enemies after the first couple of areas, rare/unique rewards for flawless (no-hit) boss fights which help immensely when obtained as early as they are, collectibles to upgrade health and get even more useful items (although there is a limit to their usefulness as you only have 3 active item slots and 2 passive item slots, and using more than 3 actives in the same timespan would require constantly switching items during a skirmish). There's also an optional extra boss if you want one more offensive spell in your inventory (or just seek one more fight), because the boss fights are just that well-designed.\n\nThe boss fights are what makes this game, and that there are so few of them is a shame. (At least the game's base price is low to reflect that.) On my first playthrough I forgot about my extra items and fought most of them vanilla (on later runs, using items, especially the ones dropped by previous bosses, made them a walk in the park on all difficulties), and it was an awesome experience even with all the deaths. The fights were impressively animated and designed, with tight controls and fair i-frames in rolling/dashing (in Easy mode the i-frames are even more generous).\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this, unless you really like Metroidvanias and don't mind the difficulty curve being the opposite of conventional (stupidly hard -> easier, instead of easy -> harder).", "timestamp_created": 1557419345, "timestamp_updated": 1558469049, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447333246469497681", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50551840": {"recommendationid": "50551840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084193965", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 392, "last_played": 1557375622}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little game.

The combat probably isn't that deep, all you will be doing is mashing the X and B button (if you are using an Xbox controller, like I did) and dodging when necessary, but it does its job and it didn't get old for me, the bosses will make sure you have to think about your movements and strategy.\n\nTalking about the bosses, a thing I had with them is that I found the difficulty curve is a little off, some bosses are considerably harder than others, and the final boss is kinda easy (this is in normal difficulty, I haven't tried hard mode yet, so again, take it with a grain of salt), so if you really want a challenge my advice is to go directly to the hard difficulty.\n\nLet's see, what more... well, the graphics are nice and the designs are cute, the protagonist's animations are particularly well done; might not be the best looking game of its kind, but still looks good. The music is alright, a bit unmemorable maybe, most tracks are very ambiental, but it doesn't really matter, it fits the game and that's enough, at least for me.\n\nIn conclusion, it's not the densest, deepest or longest game I've ever played, but for the price it's a really pleasing experience that will leave you satisfied after the credits roll, and with some replay value if you want to extract all of the juice from it, just get used to the dying animation.", "timestamp_created": 1557016679, "timestamp_updated": 1557016679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50481106": {"recommendationid": "50481106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128285760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1557002396}, "language": "english", "review": "The fourth installment of the Momodora series and the best [spoiler] so far [/spoiler], developer Bombservice takes all the best parts of the previous game and improves upon the formula reaching new heights, offering a game much larger in scope, longer, with more action, a bigger interconnected world to explore, wonderful boss fights, more interactions and overall higher quality of an already great series. \n\nThe amazing art consists of a wide variety of immersive locations/backgrounds, from sunny forests to gloomy cursed cities and abandoned castles, inhabited by some nasty-but-cute enemies. The pixel-art animation is fluid, detailed and highly expressive. The music is also a great mix of epic, calm , intense and somber pieces that compliment the story. \nAnd while the story is presented in a minimalistic style it still manages to evoke the melancholic and sometimes depressing nature of the Momodora series - do not let youself be deceived by the cute and colorful pixel art style, the world of Momodora is dark and somber where happiness is hard to achieve.

It's the equivalent of comfort food- probably not good, but it satisfies a craving. (As an aside, this is my entry point into the series, so keep that in mind)\n\nI'll start with the things I liked about it. The world concept was really fun, and I enjoyed the theming of the main character. It really made me want to see what her homeland was like, since it's only talked about in the game. I also enjoyed the way the bow works, and I thought that the charge mechanic was a good idea, sacrificing time to get a wider range/more damage.\n\nHowever, there are entirely too many faults to make it worth enjoying. I'll just list them in bullet point form to save time.\n- The scale was too small. I didn't want to just hear about the main character's homeland, I wanted to see it for myself, and levels felt extremely small and exceedingly linear for a metroidvania\n- The movement was somehow too floaty and too clunky at the same time, and you were slower and didn't jump as high as you should have in my opinion\n- The melee range was awkwardly short and led to a lot of unfair hits\n- It was too hard to dodge out of the way of enemies once you had committed to your combo which again led to a lot of unfair hits\n- The enemies were not really designed with your toolkit in mind (I was able to snipe the first 2-3 bosses with my bow because there was nothing punishing me for snipecamping)\n- There were a lot of moments that lacked polish and showed there was a lack of playtesting, such as enemies having such similar designs to the point that you could easily confuse them for one another, to there being awkward choke points where you take hits that feel unfair, to probably even more if I had continued to play\n- Mediocre graphics and music. I don't remember a single thing about what the game sounded like, the pixel art felt extremely run of the mill, the pallete was muddy and generic, there were talk portraits so you didn't know what any of the characters' faces looked like, etc.\n- And finally, an absolute lack of originality mechanics wise. They literally just copied the bonfire and estus flask system from Dark Souls and the upgrade/item system from Metroid. The best I can say about it is that only having 2 slots for passive items was kind of interesting, but the effects were not dramatic enough to cause you any sort of trouble deciding what to put there- and the fact that you can swap it out on the fly as you need makes it a moot point anyway.\n\nUltimately if you REALLY, REALLY like this kind of game... go get Hollow Knight instead. It does everything this game wants to but 10x better and it's probably 5x longer. But if you already did that and this game is on sale, then knock yourself out? I'd say its just barely worth 5$ if you're a fan.", "timestamp_created": 1556656952, "timestamp_updated": 1556657136, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417676478624343872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50377662": {"recommendationid": "50377662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299088713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 657, "last_played": 1655961755}, "language": "english", "review": "i highly recommend you check this game out.

Some items often tells bits of plot too, similar to Dark Souls.\nThere are two ending to the game, to achieve the best ending possible you need to find pond which you need to soak in the leaf you fight with and you get green leaf back which is more powerfull weapon from red leaf. It gets pretty dark in the more you progress. There are some hidden quests troughout the story like helping the skeleton man find his love again just to find her in her grave and if you visit him later, you will see his atire on her grave with him missing. This is the forth installment of the series momodora with this one being the better and most polished.\n\nSoundtrack: For this game is amazing, it sounds so mysterious and eerie and i love it. They are really well done and really fit the game. \nThere is in total 21 soundtracks inside the game and they are all made by Elektobear.\n\nGameplay: Difficult, but a lot of fun. Controls feels great and character feels very responsive.You use arrow keys to move, A to jump or double jump if you press it two times,S to melee and mash it for triple combo attack, D To use arrows and latter you have upgrades that enchaces or when holdind D you charge arrows for greater spread and damage, Q for rolls which you use to dodge enemies and make yourself faster and you latter unlock air dodge which makes it even faster and W for changing items. Game is platformer metroidvania which means that you choose where you want to go with and that there a lot of items to collect.  Some you can't collect right away since you need required power ups (like the cat sphere to get trough the tight spaces) to get to them, and some are hidden like in the hidden wall in the beggining of the game. Boss battles are most difficult parts of the game, especially on harder difficulties.\nHardest boss in the game is definitly the queen which you need to defeat her 3 times in a row. Some items can be purchased for currency called munnies which enemys drop when they are killed. Collectables in the game are Ivory bugs which you trade off to bunny in whiteleaf memorial park, Health container which expands you hp a bit then collectables you get for taking no damage during boss battles which are usually very good items you can equip. There are 4 difficulties in the game, easy, normal, hard and insane. Trying to beat insane is very, very challanging, basically to beat it you need to go trough everything in game without being touched once on highest difficulty. Game is about 6 hours long or even more if you are completionist.\n\nArt: It has that 16-bit anime-ish art and it looks beautifull. Amount of details to the characters and everything around makes it feel gorgeous. Feels good just looking the main character moving around. Background has some movements but not too much like lights in some levels or swinging roses and slight shading of the background to darker then brighter (examle from whiteleaf memorial park), there are alot of particles that floats around like in karst city some white stuff, i assume snow. When screen moves with you the background moves with you too and i love when games do that.\n\nI highly recommend this game to fans of platformers and anyone interested in these kind of games. it is totally worth its full price even when not on sale.\n\nThanks for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1555060277, "timestamp_updated": 1555060277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537916004657745361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50074962": {"recommendationid": "50074962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268994504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 763, "last_played": 1663967014}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Starring at walls is better\n\u2610 Just don\u2018t\n\n---{Audio}---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boiiiiii\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n\u2610 Just press \u201aA\u2018\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Significant brain usage (pattern learning)\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isnt necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You\u2018ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n\u2610 Story?\n\u2610 Text or Audio floating around\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely (it didn't have a complex story but it felt nice) \n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n\u2610 It\u2019s free!\n\u2611 Worth the price (me: 50% off)\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs (sometimes it freezes for a short time when you are about to change the maptile)\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs", "timestamp_created": 1554974580, "timestamp_updated": 1554974580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738810718059539795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50065215": {"recommendationid": "50065215", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979933822", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 443, "last_played": 1515268575}, "language": "english", "review": "Good platformer.

Like, wow, the game design in this game is bad. Not bad enough to make it not worth checking out, but seriously this is a steam sale purchase, don't spend more than 5 or so dollars on this game. It's really short, repetitive, and annoying in how its designed. Definitely one of those games that warrants a \"meh\" option on steam. \n\na little longer TLDR: Difficulty is really poorly executed in this game, but the mechanics and gameplay are solid enough that I didn't hate the experience, despite a lot of bosses just kind of being cheap and poorly balanced. They do too much damage, don't take enough damage to warrant their damage output (unlike how in Dark Souls nothing usually feels like it takes too long to kill, and it never feels like their damage output and moveset is straight poorly designed). I give it a loose recommendation because the movement is fun and fast paced, but I'd probably rather play Salt and Sanctuary if I wanted a \"Dark Souls in 2D\" experience. And yes, this very much is a Dark Souls in 2D game, and I'm not just saying that because it's hard. \n\nThe review: So I'll start by saying I haven't technically finished the game at the time of writing this (though I have about 75 percent map completion, and there's really not very much backtracking in this game so I'm going to assume I'm about 75 percent of the way through the main content, which in a game like this is enough to give a rough recommendation), so if that's a deal breaker for you feel free to skip this review now (Edit: I am at the final boss now, and I completely stand by what I say in this review). \n\nThat said, I can give this game a loose recommendation. The mechanics and gameplay is overall really solid. You know that saying of \"it's the Dark Souls of ____\"? Well this is the Dark Souls of Metroidvanias (though truthfully if you want something even closer to a Dark Souls of Metroidvanias, play Salt and Sanctuary; it's like 2D dark souls in every sense of the word, all the way down to not having a map you can look at). At least sort of. There's bells that act like bonfires, there's these spikey seed things that act like estus flasks and replenish every time you rest at a bell, you die in 1-2 hits, etc. Which brings me to my next point, and biggest complaint about this game, which is that you die in 1-2 hits (though I am playing on the hard setting). \n\nIt's not even that the bosses are particularly difficult to beat, but when you die in 1 hit at full hit points, yeah, that's kind of not good game design. In a game like Dark Souls, if a move is going to kill you in one hit, it's going to let you know it's coming first. There'll be a big wind up and you'll have a year to get out of the way.\n\nIn this game if the bosses so much as scratch their fucking nutsacks, woop zoop sloop it's back to the bell for you! And pretty much every boss is like this. Very little start up, kills you in one hit. To add insult to injury, the estus seeds (Idk what their name actually is so I'ma call 'em that for this review) don't level up as far as I'm aware in terms of how much they heal, and I'm 75 percent of the way through the game and I've had 5 for 90 percent of my playtime. They also heal fucking pathetic amounts of health. Like, if you take one hit you end up using literally half your estus just so you can survive another hit. \n\nEdit: Okay so as I'm writing this review, I pulled up the items page, and yeah I missed a few of the bellflowers (estus flasks), but my point still stands that in a game where you can't upgrade your hit points through leveling and need to find powerups to do that, dying in one hit from low lag attacks is still just not great game design. I mean I get that it's easy to just have a game kill you in one hit instead of actually balancing difficulty, but frankly if you want a brutally hard souls-like metroidvania I'd recommend Salt and Sanctuary or Hollow Knight (though frankly neither of those are brutally hard IMO, but they're certainly harder than your average video game). \n\nOverall, it's a good time, but the difficulty spikes during the boss fights just becomes unfun after a while, as you get tired of getting really close to killing something and then dying in one hit because maybe you aren't completely perfect and the bosses attacks aren't super telegraphed a lot of the time. You just feel like you got cheated out of a victory more times than you feel like you genuinely lost because you fucked up. \n\nAnd no, this isn't a case of \"Git Gud\", so go eat a fuckin shoe you darn tootin' hooligans.", "timestamp_created": 1554442342, "timestamp_updated": 1554444267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49914589": {"recommendationid": "49914589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176661614", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1565121691}, "language": "english", "review": "I FUCKING LOVE MOMODORA REVERIE UNDER THE MOONLIGHT THIS IS THE BEST GAME IF THIS GAME WAS IN REAL LIFE I WOULD KISS IT SO HARD", "timestamp_created": 1554227306, "timestamp_updated": 1664231868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49902050": {"recommendationid": "49902050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198232382904", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1639884324}, "language": "english", "review": "A quality metroidvania for a good price. the only problem I had was the length, as it was a bit short.", "timestamp_created": 1554163065, "timestamp_updated": 1554163065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49895063": {"recommendationid": "49895063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069912836", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 400, "last_played": 1554129414}, "language": "english", "review": "At first I thought this game was really hard until I realized your items are replenished when you save. Kind of like the Etus Flask from Dark Souls. After that I had a much better time.\n\nThe presentation is certainly neat. Graphics, animations, sound effects, music... it's all good.\n\nUnfortunately, I find the level design rather lacking. The layout of the map and the teleport spots don't seem very thoughtfully picked. Neither do the enemy placements. The second time you encounter the mages (or witches, whatever) you get hit from a source you can't even see because the screen is so big and there are other enemies to take care of before. At that point it is too early to ask the player to pay attention to what is telegraphed via sound.\n\nAlso some enemies don't even turn around when you hit them in the back. They didn't expect you to backtrack even though this is a metroidvania game.\n\nYou open up some shortcuts to straighten out your way from the save point to the boss, which is nice. \n\nThere are some secrets, collectibles / upgrades and equipment but I find that pretty shallow. You learn exactly one more move, the rest is available from the start and it's not very deep. Oh yeah, you can turn into a cat but that is also underwhelming. Also, the game is not that long.
