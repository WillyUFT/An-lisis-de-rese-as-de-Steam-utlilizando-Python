It's like a musical heads-up to be on your toes. Each region even has its own danger soundtrack, adding a whole vibe to the atmosphere.\n\nRain World doesn't hold your hand much (mostly just in the beginning in my experience), so figuring out where to go will make you scratch your head, it may even feel frustrating sometimes. I've ended up wandering aimlessly a bunch. But weirdly, it's made me learn the layout of the game way better. I've even resorted to checking out maps on wiki pages to get the hang of where to go.\n\nThen there's Downpour, the expansion that has only increased my love for the game.

This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm doubtful anything similar will ever top it. If you're thinking about getting this game, note that the Downpour DLC is a must-have; the base game is great, but the DLC has more content than the game itself and is what makes it so phenomenal.\n\nPROS:\n\nSimplicity - Unlike most survival games, there's no inventory or crafting system. What you're carrying in your two hands is what you get. The only thing you have to manage is eating enough food between rain cycles so that you can hibernate. There's a lot of versatility and subtlety in using the items you collect, which you gradually pick up on as you play.\n\nEnemy Design - The best thing about the game is the complex ecosystem, where enemies interact with the player and with each-other in simple yet complicated and unpredictable ways. Even the basic lizard enemy that you first encounter has a lot of depth to it's behavior; it will chase you, sure, but will often get distracted fighting with other lizards, giving you a much easier time sneaking by. There's too much to talk about here, but enemy AI has never been better in any other game.\n\nMusic - The music of Rain World is fantastic.\n\nStory-Telling - Rain World has a unique and compelling plot, and does a better job with atmospheric story-telling than any other game I've played. This is increased a hundredfold by the Downpour DLC. \n\nExploration - The Rain World map is absolutely gigantic; even after 80 hours of playing, there's still an entire area I've left practically unexplored.\n\nCONS:\n\nDifficulty - Rain World leaves the player to stumble around in the dark. Learning how to deal with all the hostile creatures takes a lot of patience, and dying can be extremely punishing. This isn't a bad thing for me personally, but I don't think this game is for everyone.\n\nNo Direction - Rain World gives the player very little instruction on where to go or how to progress, and you can spend hours exploring areas without feeling like you've gotten any farther in the game. This caused me to quit the game early on, eventually coming back to it and restarting. This isn't really a bad thing either, because it makes certain moments of the game much more powerful when you finally get to them, but if you're looking for a game to give you instruction on what to do, you won't find it playing Rain World.", "timestamp_created": 1700668559, "timestamp_updated": 1700668559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151051155": {"recommendationid": "151051155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847420591", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 922, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1700685315}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the few that have made sick in my stomach in a good way.

Each playable character (save for Monk and Survivor mostly) are unique in their abilities and campaigns, allowing for unique experiences depending on the character you select.\nThere are also a handful of collectables placed around the world, giving an incentive to venture out into the far reaches of each region you come across. Finding these collectables allows you to access more items in the sandbox and arena modes the game features, where you can spawn in the various creatures and items in the game to play around with at your own pace. \nIn the Downpour DLC, there are also custom-built challenges created for each playable character, along with an \"Expedition\" gamemode, which has you embark on short journeys in the game world while completing randomly generated challenges for points. \nAll these sandbox gamemodes and the story mode itself give the game a great deal of replay value.\n\nSomething to keep in mind: Rain World is a challenging game. You will likely spend a lot of time getting lost and dying in the first few hours of gameplay as you learn of the game's systems and controls. \n\nIf you can get past the harsh learning experience that is the first few hours, you are in for a truly special experience with a unique art style, an immersive interconnected open world, and a great soundtrack to boot.

The procedural animation, simulation and amount of details in this game are awe inspiring, but there are some questionable level and game design decisions that can ruin the experience. Spoilers ahead!\n\n-- SPOILERS --\n\n1. Shaded Citadel aka not being able to see anything = challenge?\nWhile this location is somewhat optional, when you finally get the hang of the game and start to enjoy it, you get to an area called The Shaded Citadel, in which you simply can't see anything but your character. I'm not sure why the developers of this game thought making everything literally pitch-black fun game design. Yes, I know you can trade or hunt scavengers for lanterns, kidnap light rats or play monk, but it still doesn't justify this decision. This place is hell and I'd rather stick my head in the toilet than go through it ever again. The light rats are cute though.\n\n2. Lack of guidance - this is an \"immersion first\" type of game...\nYes, it's fun to explore and figure things out. But why can't the game clearly explain itself once in a while? The Karma system is not intuitive, the symbols should be numbers instead, the little dots that represent the current cycle are confusing at first, the fact that you can store items, swap items, etc is not taught to the player. The game will guide you with the face of a robot, and you should somehow know that this is where you need to go because robot face equals progression. There are many other issues with the UI being unintuitive and filled with unexplained symbols.\nTo sum it up, it seems like the game prefers immersion to gameplay.\n\n3. Lack of Direction / Motivation / Hooks\nNo, I'm not speaking about knowing where to go, because those guide-ghosts do kind of show you the way. I'm talking about something that will keep you going. That will make you want to go on. A hook that gets you involved in the game. It starts with one, but fails to lure you further in. The only reason I kept going is because downpour released and I could finally play the campaign with my friends, which is a far superior experience to playing alone.\nThis game should be treated more like a sandbox/simulator than a journey, even though it sets you on a journey.\n\n4. Gates\nI kind of get the point, but they involve too much guesswork and luck and the symbols look too similar. The game loves to gatekeep you, and combined with its unpredictable nature, this can result in extremely frustrating moments. For example, you finally reach that gate after many attempts to progress, but oh poor you, you are one hibernation away from entering, go back to find a den. And when you do find one, you're almost there but a random lizard emerges out of nowhere and grabs you. Now you are two hibernations away. This is ok every once in a while, but the game does this systematically. Let the difficulty of the game gatekeep you instead... It's already a tough game as it is. In my opinion, gate-locks should be removed from the game or revamped. Maybe there's an option in the new update that I missed though.\n\n\n--- TLDR ---\n\nAll in all this is a good game and I've had lots of fun with it, but I've definitely had my \"what the hell\" moments, and there are many questionable level-deisgn scenarios and UI related issues. Other than that, there is a pitch-black area which is extremely unfun and too difficult to progress, and the game (which is hard enough as it is) is filled with gates that require special conditions to open and they mostly provide more frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1700490335, "timestamp_updated": 1700579441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150480579": {"recommendationid": "150480579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982531358", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 741, "playtime_at_review": 5729, "last_played": 1700680203}, "language": "english", "review": "This is Rainworld.\n\nYou are playing a slugcat, very cute little creature living in the world that is rather cruel. The world is immersive from the moment you start the game washed up divided appart from your family unknowing about the area you are in.\n\nThe controls might be unituitive at first and you will struggle. Oh you will struggle so much that you will wonder if you ever even have known if you learnt how to jump, grab or use items, but the longer you play the more you master this game. The magic is that you won't lose the challenging part of it.\n\nThere are still danger noodles everywhere and even if you learn how to dodge or kill them you never know what they will do thank to the great Ai, dangerous at the best and..... funny at the worst. (Seriously blue spinny lizards are such mood) \n\nThere is still a lot to learn, only the movement guide that you can find on the internet is over 50 pages long, but you don't need to learn all of those to play and finish this game (Even though it could help)\n\nThe pixelart has its charm, for some coudl appear ugly at first, but it has such beauty with background and areas that you will stand and try to take the view (if you aren't chased by even more danger noodled and danger noodle deluxe edition with added wings and maybe even the animal equivalent of a shooting gun) You will learn to love the tiny slugcat body and its tiny eyes.\n\nThe lore is there for those who want and the base game carries short and interesting story. \n\nI can't recommend this game enough. If you like to play games not to finish it or for the progress (Because you will die and you will die a lot)  and are playing games for rather challenging experience I would give this game a shot.\n\nThough I already have to recommend buying DLC with it because the DLC is so worth it.\n\n+ Slugcat is adorable", "timestamp_created": 1700471480, "timestamp_updated": 1700680252, "voted_up":

Even if caught, if you struggle correctly, you can escape, and I love that realism as a prey animal in this game. You can even get predators to chase after you, goading them by getting up in their space or positioning yourself in an easy to escape position (more or less... I've failed on more than one occasion). Why would you want predators to chase you if they are already after you? Well sometimes, like many predators, they don't actually want to eat you just yet, but well, there is a big ambush predator in your way, and you don't want to be the one eaten. So lure that predator in, and have them fight. Let's you and him fight. There are multiple ways to achieve objectives, and you can even set up long-term plans. And don't even get me started on the absolutely wonderful mechanic of the rainstorms. \nI genuinely, completely seriously, wholly and fully say this game gives me a reason to live life.", "timestamp_created": 1700275318, "timestamp_updated": 1700275318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150324656": {"recommendationid": "150324656", "author": {"steamid": "76561199058776520", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4163, "playtime_at_review": 3475, "last_played": 1700742870}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly accurate simulation of life in australia", "timestamp_created": 1700270408, "timestamp_updated": 1700270408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150322913": {"recommendationid": "150322913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272996629", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9233, "last_played": 1697393514}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

This is an ecosystem and you are at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nThe DLC is massive and like a whole game with the amount of content it adds, definitely get that with the base game if you like rain world sounds.\n\nThe lore is fascinating and intricate although you will likely only see the surface in the average run.\n\nThe difficulty is a turn off for many people and if you struggle with hard games you may not like it. Although the feeling of reward when you do eventually learn the game  is amazing. People complain about the RNG which is somewhat fair but since its basically an ecosystem simulator on top of a game it should be expected, you cant anticipate what another animal should do so the game doesn't let you.\n\nThe art style if beautiful, sound/music is great and used sparingly keeping it fresh and maintaining the perfect atmosphere and level design is phenomenal (although not quite perfect) the stages are designed around parkour combat and exploration with easier but longer roots for less daring players and run around to avoid the ecosystem doing its thing and blocking your path from one way. \n\nPersonally ive never had an issue with reindeer yet but from what ive heard and seen they are quite buggy but not as big a deal as people make them out to be.\n\nOverall this game is a rewarding, skilful and unique; definitely give it a try. not necessary the right game for the plebs who struggle to play hard games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699988117, "timestamp_updated": 1699988117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150117860": {"recommendationid": "150117860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418863854", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 101, "playtime_at_review": 2879, "last_played": 1700448462}, "language": "english", "review": "It's truly raining in this world, damn", "timestamp_created": 1699973545, "timestamp_updated": 1699973545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526066362857818604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150117733": {"recommendationid": "150117733", "author": {"steamid": "76561199394419157", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 341, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1699973031}, "language": "english", "review": "piss xD", "timestamp_created": 1699973354, "timestamp_updated": 1699973354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150116632": {"recommendationid": "150116632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114215047", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1699971832}, "language": "english", "review": " not fun", "timestamp_created": 1699971940, "timestamp_updated": 1699971940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150108077": {"recommendationid": "150108077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860544406", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 3041, "last_played": 1699972618}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best platformers that I have ever played.\nThe world feels endless combined, with every single region having a different ambiance and different soundtracks.

There are plenty that are visually breathtaking or challenge players\u2019 skills. But it is only the very best ones that create their own entire experience. Rain World, is an excellent example of this. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, it achieves this unique experience with a vast, interesting world, lots of mechanical depth, and an incredibly immersive atmosphere.\n\n     In Rain World, the player plays as a \"slugcat,\" an aptly named creature that seems to resemble both a slug and a cat. The player jumps, crawls, hides, gathers food, and hunts in a vast, two dimensional world, exploring every unique corner of a diverse ecosystem on an alien planet, all while avoiding a frequent, deadly downpour. This world contains all sorts of odd, sometimes seemingly impossible creatures, which interact not only with the player but with each other inside of an elaborate, simulated ecosystem, in which the player is but a small part of. However, slugcats sit rather low on the food chain in this ecosystem, and often find themselves being hunted by terrifying, ravenous predators. The player must quickly learn to survive in this world by gathering enough food, avoiding predators, and most importantly, not getting caught in the rain.\n\n\tOne of the things that makes Rain World unique is the natural way that it lets players learn. Instead of shoving wordy tutorial messages in the player\u2019s face or starting out with lengthy and obnoxiously easy challenges, Rain World throws the player straight into the deep end of the pool, and leaves them to learn how to swim on their own. At the beginning of the game, it shows the player the basic controls and other fundamental mechanics of the game, but then immediately sets the player free to explore. The player will probably die countless times throughout their journey, but every time they do they can use that experience to survive the next time they are in a similar situation. While playing this game, the player really feels like they are learning to survive on their own in an unfamiliar world using tricks, exploits, and strategies that they come up with completely on their own. For example, after getting eaten by a ferocious lizard the first couple of times, the player might eventually notice that the lizards are not capable of climbing poles. They can then use this knowledge to easily stay well away from the jaws of the beast, and live for another day. This kind of process happens frequently across all kinds of different situations throughout the entire game.\n\n\tAnother reason Rain World is so interesting is because of the incredibly in-depth ecosystem that it simulates. Every single creature the player encounters in this game has its own survival in mind, its own encounters with other creatures, and sometimes even a unique personality. Unlike other games where everything revolves around the player, the player is only a small part of this vast ecosystem. To demonstrate that the player is really not the main character of this universe, a lizard which has caught the player might get distracted by another lizard, which it decides to fight over territory with, losing interest in the player. Additionally, the game keeps track of and simulates all of the creatures in a wide area, allowing all kinds of interactions amongst the wildlife to happen constantly regardless of whether or not they are being observed by the player. This results in the player often walking into situations happening between other creatures that they aren\u2019t even involved in, which helps make the world seem so much more lively. \n\n\tThe AI\u2019s of the creatures in this game are also quite realistic. Lizards hunting for food will wander around, investigating small noises they hear, and give chase only when they spot something with their limited vision. Giant Vultures will swoop down upon unsuspecting prey, only to fly off frustrated when their prey hides out of reach. The most notable example of this game\u2019s intricate AI systems are the Scavengers, which are monkey-like creatures that live in tribes across the map. Individual Scavengers have unique personalities, remember the player\u2019s actions with a reputation system, demonstrate emotion, and even communicate with the player using body language.  These kinds of deep systems and mechanics not only breathe more life into the game, but also keep the game feeling fresh later on, since it gives the player more advanced systems to learn about and use to their advantage.\n\n\tOne of the greatest things about Rain World is the incredible sense of atmosphere it creates. From the soft sound of dripping water after a fresh rain cycle to the faint chirping of small insects in the background to the distant whirring of ancient machines, there are so many small details in the world\u2019s ambient sound design that makes players feel like they are really in the world themselves. There are also many visual elements, such as colorful rainbows, foggy landscapes in the background, or cascading shadows cast from clouds rolling by, that further contribute to allowing the player to become immersed in the world. \n\n\tAdding to the atmosphere is the game\u2019s music, or lack thereof. The player will spend much of their time accompanied by no music at all, creating a lonely and sometimes unsettling feeling. But, during key moments of the game, various types of songs do play, like the hollow, lonely song that plays when you first open the game, the percussive and suspenseful music that plays when in danger, or the ominous, ancient hymns that play at mysterious locations. Perhaps the most important aspect of the atmosphere, however, is the game\u2019s story and the player\u2019s journey itself. The game\u2019s story is a tragic tale about the protagonist slugcat being separated from their family at a young age, losing all hope of returning, and searching for a new purpose. This story is reflected quite well in the game\u2019s depressing, lonely, and desperate atmosphere.\n\n\tHowever, Rain World is certainly not flawless. One common criticism of the game is that controlling the slugcat feels rather \u201csluggish\u201d and imprecise. While this may feel like the case at first, it really just takes some practice. After spending enough time learning and mastering the controls, it starts to make sense, and players are able to move more deliberately, with precision, and much more swiftly. Some people also don\u2019t like the lack of guidance and the openness of the game, which admittedly does sometimes lead to new players winding up stuck in extremely difficult sections of the game they weren\u2019t intended to be in yet. This is certainly an issue, but the game does use multiple methods that attempt to subtly steer the player back on track, so these cases are somewhat rare. Finally, the main issue that many people have with this game is with the sheer difficulty, and how cruel and punishing this game can sometimes be. When playing through the game for the first time, many players will find the game overly difficult and frustrating, not enjoying this type of extreme challenge at all. But this is simply just how the game is. While some are willing to push through the steep learning curve to experience the joy of mastering this game, most are, understandably, not.\n\n\tDespite its flaws, Rain World\u2019s unique, immersive style of gameplay and story create not just a game, but an incredible, unique experience for some people, a journey which will be looked back upon fondly. However, its harsh and cruel nature will make it less than enjoyable for everyone else. So, while Rain World is certainly not a game for everyone, it is an incredible experience that is worth every minute of its time for those it does resonate with.", "timestamp_created": 1699871588,

The game has a tiny tutorial and complicated movement mechanics so feel free to look things up and DO NOT feel bad about it. The Rainworld Wiki is great for at least getting a basic idea of what locations to go next and what items do (and what controls to use them). \n\nIf you play blind, you'll may get frustrated by how unfair the game is (it is unfair, the developers were more focused on simulating an ecosystem than making a balanced game) and you won't know where to go to progress, let alone how to use items like spore puffs or grappling worms.\n\nAnother thing: you can get mods and still get achievements, so you can play the game with all the QOL you want and not get punished (like SBCameraScroll if you want the camera to follow you). Alternatively, you can download Rotund World and become morbidly a beast.\n \nMultiplayer is fun.\nSlugpups are great.", "timestamp_created": 1699669509, "timestamp_updated": 1699669509, "voted_up":

explain how much of a masterpiece this game is. This game is extremely hard yet fun. When i first heard of this game, it was from a YT vid (thanks Skurry and Daszombes for showing me this) and it seemed fun so i bought it expecting to beat it in like a week max. I was immediately humbled since i couldn't even get past the first gate as monk, and stopped playing for like a month. Then i saw the YT vids again and i tried again. Since i watched the videos i knew what to do now, and made it about midway where i'm now. It was so much fun. Fighting lizards and avoiding DLLs usin grapple worms.

It'll be frustrating and you'll ragequit, but as long as you keep coming back, eventually the game will click. Maybe it'll happen after fifty hours, maybe after a hundred, maybe two hundred, but eventually it'll click. The game also has story-based achievements, and only 13% of users have the achievement you get for reaching the half-way point. That's because most people never reach that second stage. I went in blind as the reviews said, got frustrated and ragequit as they predicted, but frankly I don't have the time to spend dozens if not hundreds of hours just to figure out the basic mechanics through trial and error, so I went ahead and read some of the articles on the wiki. I'm glad I did. I went back to the game after reading the wiki, had a great time and beat it, and I want to do a second playthrough later.\n\nThe frustration that comes with playing Rain World is twofold. The first reason for it is mechanical. It's a tough platformer. You die constantly, and a lot of the deaths are to RNG. However the second and more important reason is that the game is deliberately obscure. It tells you (almost) nothing. It doesn't even tell you you have a [spoiler]health bar[/spoiler]. When you start a new game, it doesn't tell you that \"monk\" is [spoiler]easy mode[/spoiler] and \"surivor\" is [spoiler]normal[/spoiler]. It doesn't tell you what moves you can do or how many items are edible. I'm sure it's mind-blowing playing this game for dozens of hours and then realizing you have a [spoiler]slide move[/spoiler], but I'd rather be told this information up front. The game is hard enough without requiring you to guess basic mechanics.\n\nOnce you have the basic gameplay information, Rain World turns into something more like a conventional metroidvania. You can go anywhere and gain access to new areas by picking up helpful items. You can lose those items again, but you need to bring a light if you're going into a dark area, things like that, so some routes through the game world are impractical. It's not a typical metroidvania for sure, but once you actually understand the mechanics, the game turns out to be much less strange than it seems at first. You jump on platforms, you fend off enemies, pick up health. You go from point A to point B to C, then the credits roll. The game world simulates an ecology, which is neat, but from the player's perspective it's only the deliberate obscuring of the mechanics that prevents you from playing it like (mostly) any other tough platformer with realistic-ish physics.\n\nIf you already know you're one of those <13% of players who don't mind ragequitting, coming back, ragequitting, coming back, etc., for dozens or hundreds of hours before you get it, by all means try it blind. If you're more like me, I'd really recommend reading the wiki before you ragequit and uninstall. You don't have to read any story spoilers, they all have big warning labels on them. Just read the page on the controls and some basic stuff like how hibernation and feeding work. My own frustration (mostly) went away at that point. I still died all the time, but now I didn't mind so much because I understood why.\n\nThe game looks great. I kept thinking of the game Another World in terms of the esthetics. It sounds great too, all moody background noise and drones with some minimalist music here and there. The atmosphere in general is spot-on. The enemy designs are cool and otherworldly. The world-building is consistent and well-done. The game even makes you feel for the couple of NPCs you come across. I played with a PS4 controller, which worked fine most of the time, but I found it very difficult to get the timing down on extended sections of wall-jumping, so I had to switch over to keyboard for these parts.

F**king. Game.\n\nI can comfortably say that beating Rain World is one of my most prized accomplishments when it comes to gaming. Not only because it's very difficult in a refreshingly unique way - more on that later - but also because the [i]spiritual significance[/i] of the game, the ending in particular, left an ever-aching scar on my heart that refuses to heal even years later.\n\nThere's this general belief that game journalists suck at games; I don't want to get into that right now, but I honestly believe that Rain World simply blindsided a lot of its more mainstream reviewers with its unconventional control scheme and strange, dynamic difficulty. This isn't a 2D platformer. The slugcat cannot really jump like we're used to; instead, it has a handy set of other movement abilities, and learning them in spite of your instincts is required to get anywhere.\n\nAnd this is on top of the other unusual design choices. The world is incredibly interconnected and if you're persistent enough, there's nothing really preventing you from doing stuff out of order and even skipping a lot of the game. No worries though - the chances of you doing that on accident are very low.\n\nWhat really makes Rain World shine, however, is the way its difficulty works. Almost all hard games can be learned, and that's what you're expected to do. Learn the steps and execute the dance. But Rain World shuffles things up every time you die. Enemies appear in different locations. A route you took last time might be inaccessible this time around due to a bunch of lizards fighting for turf. Sure, you could try sneaking past. Or even fighting them. But as a general rule you're not a fighter; you have to use a mixture of trickery, stealth, being quick on your feet and occasional violence to get by.\n\nIn other words, you're squarely in the lower half of the food chain. Yes, there are creatures that are below you that you can hunt and consume, but most things want to make a snack of you instead. And they will. Oh yes, they will.\n\nThe most memorable and glorious moments of the game will be where you will have barely escaped with your life over and over again in a single cycle and miraculously managed to find shelter just before the rain came. And as you start to really understand the workings of the world and the abilities of your slugcat, moments such as those will come more and more often. That's its true power.\n\nOn top of all that, Rain World has a spiritual component - one that is not immediately clear, but as you keep playing, you'll begin the true significance of a lot of stuff. I don't think it's practical to completely unravel the plot by yourself due to the insane things you need to do to get some pieces of info, though; I had to consult the wiki to really understand. But it's fine - you'll still get a very satisfying and emotional experience if you go only with what you can find by yourself.\n\nAnd above all else - it's a very, very unique game, even by indie standards. Difficult, yes. But possible to learn and to master. Complex. Obtuse, perhaps; but so incredibly satisfying. Not for everyone, for sure - and yet, I implore you to check it out. I'm incredibly grateful to the Universe that I did and refused to give up.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988/]Curator page[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1699107926, "timestamp_updated": 1699107926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891073763370513916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149515557": {"recommendationid": "149515557", "author": {"steamid": "76561199051260725", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 798, "playtime_at_review": 9241, "last_played": 1700710936}, "language": "english", "review": "A very 'fun' and hard survival game.

Rain World tiene un sobresaliente apartado art\u00edstico y de f\u00edsicas, estas \u00faltimas son geniales y le dan mucha esencia al juego. Sin embargo, su aleatoria aparici\u00f3n de criaturas en situaciones y posiciones determinadas generan casos en los que por ejemplo, nada m\u00e1s salir de un conducto o cambiar de escenario est\u00e9s en la boca de un lagarto o tengas a uno de esos p\u00e1jaros encima. En estas situaciones, es completamente imposible sobrevivir, no es que te falte habilidad, simplemente mala suerte y para suerte juguemos al poker, porque un juego cuyo sistema pueda hacer que simplemente mueras porque toca no deber\u00eda existir. Entiendo que se quiera ofrecer un desaf\u00edo pero fij\u00e9monos en un Dark Souls, es muy exigente y castiga un m\u00ednimo fallo con la muerte casi igual que este juego, la diferencia es que si has muerto en Dark Souls, es porque no fuiste suficientemente perfecto, no por falta de suerte. Sinceramente pat\u00e9tico. Adem\u00e1s a\u00f1adir que hay obst\u00e1culos en el escenario innecesariamente dif\u00edciles de superar y esto m\u00e1s que un reto es un agobio y una sensaci\u00f3n de estr\u00e9s dif\u00edcil de explicar. Como a ejemplo, pongo esas estructuras que parecen escaleras de mano. Por alguna raz\u00f3n, en Rain World al pasar de estar colgado a subir en una barra, el personaje se desplaza hacia la derecha y esto suele ocasionar que se agarre del barrote lateral en lugar de poder saltar hacia arriba y agarrarse a la siguiente barra horizontal. Lo resalto porque no os pod\u00e9is imaginar lo desesperante que es estar media hora para subir. El 70% de este juego se puede considerar perder el tiempo: esperando a que se abran las puertas, durmiendo, muriendo injustamente y pasando ratos intentando subir una est\u00fapida escalera o intentando que tu lanza sea lanzada hacia la direcci\u00f3n que quieres. El otro 30% se basa en aprender cosas sobre las criaturas y objetos que encuentras y explorando para buscar comida o el siguiente punto de control. En conclusi\u00f3n Rain World es casi un juego injustamente echo para desesperarte y en su mayor parte sientes que pierdes el tiempo, por otra parte tiene un excelente estilo art\u00edstico y sonoro, las criaturas son interesantes al igual que la historia que se pueda estar detr\u00e1s del mundo, tiene un excelente decorado de escenarios, los movimientos se sienten muy org\u00e1nicos y por \u00faltimo recalcar que es un juego muy original y con mucha personalidad.

being told are deeply spiritual and profound, i care about every character presented to me even though most of them never utter a word. i love this game. i played an hour and a half 2 years ago and dropped it until a few months ago, and i think about it a lot. once you have that breakthrough, this game becomes something irresistably challenging and exciting. it is so special to me. it might be my new favorite game ever made. if you want to be tested, if you want an uphill battle and to fight for your fucking life at all turns, if you want the fulfillment of overcoming it all. buy the game and the dlc. downpour is worth every penny. if its too much, just buy the base game and experience the initial story through monk. it is worth seeing. \n\nto my fellow completionists, this one is a fucking DOOZY and i don't immediately recommend doing what i did if you're a more casual enjoyer. challenge 70 caused me real actual impactful stress and put me in a bad mood for like 3 straight days. I nearly lost more than 1 500+ point expeditions and it had my heart pounding. this game is HARD. and it is BRUTAL in the ways it kills you. getting frame 1-ed by a scav or getting snagged by a lizard on a screen seam sucks!! but persevere and GOD the game rewards you! its such a fulfilling journey. stay strong.", "timestamp_created": 1698939396, "timestamp_updated": 1698939396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149375038": {"recommendationid": "149375038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198900891140", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1697768023}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lindo juego, con una movilidad y mecanica de IA impresionante.

It is an experience that I am glad I decided to take part it. The beautifully crafted landscapes, the surprisingly in depth movement system, the music that I can't ever seem to get enough off and the unforgiving yet satisfying reward of dominating the food chain. It's great.\n\nThis game is by no means easy, it shows you the bare minimum at the start and pretty much expects you to learn everything about the ecosystem that you are now suddenly part of and you will undoubtedly become a lizards lunch a good amount of times. You will likely end up feeling very lost at the start too, you aren't given a clear objective of where to go apart from a Yellow Overseer following you around pointing out various things about the environment you are in which at times can seemingly make you go back from where you just came. Because of this you can quite easily end up in a very difficult area which is honestly something that could be improved slightly to dissuade inexperienced players or at least give an idea of what to expect before essentially soft locking themselves. If I was to give any advice to new players for a slightly more enjoyable experience, head up and right at the start of the game.\n\nThe creatures of Rain World are often brought up in discussion as the way everything interacts creates a world that feels very real. One experience with a certain creature may differ greatly from each individual making you uncertain if you can repeat the same strategy on it for an easy victory. For example the Green Lizards, you may find one that is very lazy almost making no attempt at catching you, simply biting the air in your general direction when you are close. On the flip side you may get one that doesn't seem to give up chase and lunges at you much more motivated to get it's next meal. You can never quite be sure. (Can't say the same for Reds, They want you dead.)\n\nI would talk about the scavs but honestly they have such a complex system that I don't think I can even begin to explain how real they feel at times.

So many features were put in that you wouldn't even notice if you weren't looking for them and that really shows true commitment to game design. \n     I definitely recommend this game.

It's very old-school in it's design and is, as the kids say, \"Nintendo Hard\". It's design philosophy of tossing you into an alien world and leaving you to learn it's rules extends from the more advanced movement techniques to unclear UI elements. You do get a guide that will attempt to point you in the right direction, but they are driven by procedural behaviors and can be inconsistent at best. \nI do respect that some folks won't enjoy this game, but for anyone that is shying away at my previous description: Just wait a moment-\n\nThe difficulty is important. \n\nI won't tell you that you MUST play this game regardless of your personal tastes, but if you can pay out the patience the game demands, it will absolutely pay you back. \nRain World is a game with a very carefully crafted narrative and intent to its environmental story-telling, with moments and revelations that still to this day give me chills and make me tear up a bit; And that's not including the Downpour DLC.  \n\nIf you still want the story without the difficulty, the game has always had mods and now includes official quality of life features to adjust it as you need.\n\nIf you want a classic styled cinematic platformer with a rich cast of creatures that simulate a fascinating ecosystem, absolutely, cannot recommend enough. \nIf you want a deeply introspective and surprisingly philosophical story that thrives on your actual struggles as a player, this game will live in your head for decades to come. \n\nOh and there's official co-op support. Just be sure to go through the effort of setting up Parsec (and maybe reWASD for sharing keyboard inputs) as my experience with Steam Remote Play is... inconsistent. \n\nFor any of my friends I forced to play this game: I'm not sorry :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1698509512, "timestamp_updated": 1698509512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616051733493804932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149054404": {"recommendationid": "149054404", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075424019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 274, "last_played": 1698504923}, "language": "english", "review": "slug cat be cute :)", "timestamp_created": 1698503993, "timestamp_updated": 1698503993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149047486": {"recommendationid": "149047486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198424461256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1700370458}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no es para todos", "timestamp_created": 1698497761, "timestamp_updated": 1698497761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149039026": {"recommendationid": "149039026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173716133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1699213991}, "language": "spanish", "review": "man ive only played 3 hours but they've been the best 3 hours of my life if u enjoy fully skill games and adventure titles I assure you this game is 100% for you.", "timestamp_created": 1698489153, "timestamp_updated": 1698489153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149029394": {"recommendationid": "149029394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353934116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "playtime_at_review": 6487, "last_played": 1699863217}, "language": "english", "review": "she rain on my world till i downpour\n(this is one of my favorite games of all time)", "timestamp_created": 1698476097, "timestamp_updated": 1698476097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503267943859100342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149029247": {"recommendationid": "149029247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357960205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1698762425}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1698475822, "timestamp_updated": 1698475822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452043771743774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149027412": {"recommendationid": "149027412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445280106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 441, "playtime_at_review": 5432, "last_played": 1700632227}, "language": "english", "review": "scugcat go brr", "timestamp_created": 1698473043, "timestamp_updated": 1698473043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149026865": {"recommendationid": "149026865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837894292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1398, "last_played": 1698492908}, "language": "english", "review": "Took 23 hours to beat the game, I actually missed out five pebbles during my first playthrough since I went from shaded citadel to industrial when then leads to chimney canopy.

Therefore, I am more referring to the player input as Rain World really struggles with that. I am coming from a keyboard which might mean this isn't a problem on gamepads but, whenever you need to interact with some kind of vertical platforming everything falls apart. \nI wanna start with the good things because it's important to understand why this major flaw nullifies every system and makes it impossible to enjoy the game. \n\nThe environment, music and creatures are really well done. You wanna get lost in this world and explore it. I felt the strong urge to sink many hours into this game and all of its components work beautifully together to invoke that feeling. The little encouncters, how enemies and other bugs interact with each other and the soundscape are magnificent to create this dystopian place you survive in. Art design in particular is some of Rain World's strongest bits. Hence why it's so frustrating that it's impossible to stay immersed.\n\nThe problem really lies within how either the maps are designed or how controls are handeld. One of these systems kind of create this tragedy.\n\nYou see, a perfect example is when the environment slowly starts to shake, the rain is coming and the suspense start rising. You are jumping from platform to platform and the whole progress you made that day is almost finished. All you need to do is make your way back which you've prepared in advance by remembering the route and therefore you're certain that it's easy. But then you encounter a horizontal pipe leading to a smaller horizontal pipe above you inbetween two stones. One of those stones has a vertical pipe. You need to press spacebar to jump and then w to grab the pipe above you. Sadly when you do that your slugcat instantly gravitates towards the vertical pipe next to it and then grabs it. You then need to press space again to let go of it and reset the position a couple of times but by then the rain killed you already because it kept teleporting you again and again for like 10 times. Looking at you pipeyard.\n\nAnother instance is when you slept in a dead-end like the garbage wastes and need to do a climbing action on a rather tall wall. Spacebar is also the same input for crawling that last bit of a wall and the walljump which frustrates when you are trying to get over it and you don't have the space to do a backflip or throw-jump so your slugcat is just constantly walljumping until it works after the 5th or 6th try. \n\nEspecially climbing pipes after a walljump is something that just works on a coinflip. Regardless of pressing w your slugcat refuses to grab it and falls into its death. \n\nWhich leads me to the conclusion that the map design is either bad and shouldn't have these types of platforming sections or the controls on keyboard need a giant improvement. Because of this all of your immersion just goes down the drain, your day progress gets resetted and it stops sucking you into its world. \nI played for around 12 hours and tried again and again to love this game. And I actually like everything about it but this flaw makes it impossible to play the campaign when you regularly get stuck in situations mentioned above for minutes at a time until some creature just kills you or you fall into your death without even doing the input. \n\nThe remix improvement were turned on and I have no problem with platforming in general. I suspect I need to say this because it's easy to blame the player but honestly I've tried many times. Celeste 100% wasn't a problem for me. Katana Zero's highest difficulty wasn't either a problem. And the simulation focus on Rain World is even something I enjoyed, the general platforming is good. Pouncing over cliffs and out-maneuvering enemies is fun especially with the combat. It isn't the game feel that I have a problem with which just makes it so frustrating because I like the game.\n\nHoping for a patch or a mod to appear because I still wanna finish it and give it more tries. \n", "timestamp_created": 1698431740, "timestamp_updated": 1698431740, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0,

spiritual resonance\n- nice community\n- sizeable DLC waiting if you like the base game\n\nNegatives:\n- doesn't feel much like a designed game, extremely rough around the edges in general\n- the skill curve is a messy rollercoaster\n- the controls are not fun to use and take a long time to get used to\n- ledges\n- maneuvers that make traversal fun instead of painful are extremely obscure (it would be fine if it was fun already at the skill floor, but it's not)\n- too much randomness in guidance makes it confusing instead of useful\n- too much randomness in food and threats makes you artificially lose time or fail attempts to progress altogether\n- while not too punishing in itself, way too much to allow for the necessary experimentation, and it's tiring to get back to the same point again\n- possibility to get softlocked if you didn't figure out an optional mechanic by yourself earlier on\n- requires a certain player action which makes little to no sense, as it amounts to giving up on trying to find the solution, to progress at some point\n- in no way similar to other games which's communities usually recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1698315885, "timestamp_updated":

I also generally enjoyed its survival aspects.\n\nHowever the game is often repetetive and frustrating.\nI dont really get where the fun in the gameplay is supposed to be coming from:\nThe platforming is rather slow, unresponsive and clunky not to mention the claustrophobic leveldesign that at times completely removes that aspect from the game.\n\n\"Maybe its about exploration\" I thought. But the games systems dont reward or encourage exloration either: If you explore you die. Either becuase of unfamiliar terrain, enemies or because of the rains. Speeking of... do you remember the rain in BotW? How it would hinder you from climbing that mountain? Now imagine that but ten times worse. Why would there be a time limit for exploration? The rains either lead to you retreating back to your previous hibernation spot or to a miserable death somewhere on the way to the next one. I basically always chose the latter which ment I would explore the rain world bit by bit each time getting a little further. This wouldnt be to bad if it wasnt for the karma system, you see each time you die your karma level drops. And like I said you die a lot. But when your karma level is too low you cant get past the gates to the next area anymore which basically makes all your progress pointless and leads to you grinding your karma level back up again.\n\nIve played up to the Shaded Citadel the games third area and its giving me Tomb of the Giant vibes. To give an example as to why I think its poorly designed; the area is completely dark. The only way to see anything is by grabbing some glowing animal. However because of its weight, carrying it reduces your jump hight, causing some jumps to be unreasonably frustrating or straight up impossible. I saw that the monk class can see in the dark but I dont want to start from the beginning all over again. \nI dont know wether Im gonna push through and finish the game or if im gonna move on to something else. I can definetly imagine me competely changing my mind about this game if I get to see the end and ending up loving it but as of now this is my recomendation:\n\nIs rain world a bad game?

Unless you can stack the odds in your favor, or learn to move like a ninja slug, you're going to die a lot before you \"git gud.\"\n\n   Personally, I recommend looking up the lore & some tutorials to help you understand what the hell is going on, & learn the basics of movement.

The controls (again, for me) feel smooth once you get the hang of them, and jumping around from pole to pole to move faster feels very rewarding. \n\n[ GOOD THINGS ]\n\n- The predators and prey feel very expertly coded. I cant predict what they are gonna do next, and in most cases, I have to wildly flee myself before I get mauled.\n\n- This game is not easy. I will mention this in the bad section aswell, but not giving the player the power of god, or a double jump, feels smart. If an overseer recommends I go somewhere that i cant reach, i will keep trying to get there, in various ways, if needed, because i know it is possible for me to get there. \n\n- The soundtrack, character design, and rain system feel flawless aswell. The game gives me a capacity to roam and be awake, but if you stay out too long, then you need to get moving to a shelter and NOW.\n\n[ BAD THINGS ]\n\n- This game is hard. You will not be fed the next area on a silver spoon, and grabbing fruit or grabbing batflies can be challenging. The rain can catch you. The lizards can. Any number of predatory animals or plants can reset you a cycle. But it isnt listlissly impossible hard, as most guides make it seem. Go at your own pace, run away from lizards instead of fighting them, if you want. This worlds only limit is time and skill.\n\nOverall, I love this game, but you dont have to play if you dont want to. Just go at your own pace :]", "timestamp_created": 1698193119, "timestamp_updated": 1698193119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Sometimes my cat can survive in water for super long, other times my guy is in water for 3 seconds and dies. No air meter, I don't know how long till I drown. Exploration is failure. The game often give you 2 branching paths as if it wants you to explore, problem is that one path can lead you to a shelter and the other way will,  waste your time and then it rains, you die in the rain, rinse repeat. More than a few times I enter a room but one of the enemies that can kill you in one hit will just site at a door/pipe, glitching out, rolling over it self or stuck in a pipe I need to go through, wasting time until it rains. Nothing is communicated through you. It's 100% trial and error. I was in the draining area and died to a school of fish. At no point in the game until then did it even hint that fish can kill me. It was only after I randomly wandered into a different area that I seen the fish glow red, which usually means they are dangerous. Problem is that not all enemies glow, some blend in with the background. Some only glow at certain times. The fish only glow near the surface, so when I encountered them for the first time in a mostly underwater area, I die. The game forces you to walk on egg shells and take your time observing and exploring to then kill you with rain. The game punishes you for activity exploring quickly by having enemies blend into to the background or spawn directly in front of the pipes you need to go in to progress and you just have to wait until they move. The game teaches that you can throw things at enemies but it serves nearly no purpose...... until it does. Trial and error isn't difficulty, trial and error isn't a game-play mechanic, it's lazy. Im not going to ram my head into a wall 50 times until I guess the correct answer. The games just give throws occasional new hazards and enemy at you and you either guess how to deal with it correctly the first time or die trying to figure out, or better yet, just trying random things out or go a different direction until it rains and kills you anyway. The whole hibernation thing only serves to extend the game, making it seem like a longer experience. Hibernation doesn't even do anything but gates some areas. Early in the game I ran between 3 or 4 rooms, eating, hibernating assume it would do something positive but it's just there to gate off some areas.

more than just a cute 2D platformer[/h1]\n\nAt first glance, Rain World seemed to me like just another cute little indie platformer. When I downloaded it, I did so along with Ori and Planet of Lana in an effort to stock up on 2D games I could play on a laptop. I was in for a rude awakening when I realized that this was a survival game in a harsh and brutal environment with complex and nuanced enemy design and an overwhelmingly large, scary, yet beautiful world.\n\nThe following is a detailed review of everything I thought the game did well and did poorly from the perspective of a completionist with all achievements and over 240 hours of gameplay. Since I absolutely adore this game, let\u2019s get the negative points out of the way first.\n\n[h3]What the game does wrong[/h3]\n\n[b]The control scheme is god awful[/b]\nThe entire game is controlled with 2 buttons. Every action in the game is basically the jump button or the pick-up button or one of those combined with a directional input or with each other. This can lead to extremely frustrating situations where you\u2019ll be fumbling around trying to pick up or drop or eat certain items but won\u2019t be able to because all 3 of those actions are the same button. This is probably done to simplify the controls since the game is already very harsh in other regards and can be easily remedied with fan-made steam workshop mods.\n\n[b]The randomness of the world can be frustrating at times[/b]\nRain World is a massive complex ecosystem where enemy encounters and behavior can depend on a multitude of factors. Spawns are fixed but how the game\u2019s creatures decide what to do and where to go is very dynamic in nature. Although this is one of the most beautiful aspects of the game, it can also be the most frustrating. It\u2019s fairly common to encounter situations where the events of a cycle will play out in the most unfortunate possible way. Predators can block exits and just sit there or block an access pipe, aerial threats will attack at the worst time imaginable, or a friendly creature that is absolutely necessary to progress will just refuse to cooperate, etc. This is, in my opinion, a small price to pay in exchange for the sheer excitement of the game\u2019s dynamism but can still be infuriating sometimes.\n\n[h3]What the game does right[/h3]\n\n[b]Gorgeous visuals with a unique art style[/b]\nThis will ultimately come down to whether or not you\u2019re a fan of pixel art, but if you are, then this game is nothing short of beautiful. Every area is visually appealing in its\u2019 own way, with its\u2019 own color pallete and theme. From industrial gutters, to abandoned underground train tracks, to a night-time metropolis, to a bridged complex overlooking a rainbow filled skyline. All dark and unsettling yet uniquely gorgeous.\n\n[b]A massive and intricate world[/b]\nRain World\u2019s map is overwhelmingly large. It is comprised of over a dozen regions, each with their own aesthetic and their own fauna and flora. Each region has tons of things to explore, enemies to encounter, and different paths to take. As you pour more and more hours into the game, you\u2019ll get a feel for how all the areas connect to each other and how best to path your way through the world on the way to different goals or objectives. There are always multiple ways from A to B at any given moment and what path you take, or what regions you choose to trek through or avoid is entirely up to you.\n\n[b]A dark and gritty atmosphere[/b]\nThe game has a unique way of inspiring a sense of dread which is represented in all manner of forms. You\u2019re travelling through a long abandoned/forgotten industrial area, in a race against the rainfall with the constant threat of predators around every corner. The world you\u2019re in is harsh and unforgiving and simply surviving while finding enough food to hibernate at the next shelter is a real challenge. It\u2019s a unique thrill with the stress of avoiding hazards and evading predators juxtaposed with the sheer euphoria of finding food or a shelter in an unexplored area. Combine this weird dichotomy of emotions with a dark and dreadful world and then throw in a beautifully melancholic soundtrack and you get a unique atmosphere unlike any game I\u2019ve played.\n\n[b]A profoundly beautiful story under the surface[/b]\nI won\u2019t get into any story spoilers here but the game\u2019s story is very deep and meaningful. The story isn\u2019t presented to you up-front, but is always lying in the background waiting to be pieced together by dilligent players. The story also takes place over a timeline with each of the main and DLC characters contributing a small part to the greater picture.\n\n[b]A living breathing ecosystem[/b]\nThe creatures in Rain World are vastly different from one another in their appearance and behavior. This can range from friendly to fearful to neutral to hyper-aggressive. Each creature has an optimal way to be dealt with, along with it\u2019s place in the food chain and will behave according to a complex set of built-in relationships between them. A predator that wants to eat you may be scared off or killed by an even larger threat. A fight between two predators can provide an opportunity to slip past, which can sometimes even save you after being caught in the jaws of a predator. Some creatures have a reputation system with the player and will react to the player differently according to what their current standing with the player is. Certain predators can be fed to tame them, at which point they will follow you around and defend you (as long as you continue to feed them). Creatures will hunt, kill, and flee from each other and all these interactions are unfolding in the world constantly, even without the player\u2019s presence. This furthers the sensation that this dauntingly massive and unforgiving world exists with or without you and you are only a small part of it.\n\n[b]The best DLC I have ever seen offered for a game[/b]\nDownpour more than doubles the amount of content the game offers for a fraction of the price. Downpour adds a whopping 5 playable characters that each have their own campaigns, unique mechanics, and new stories that take place at different points in the timeline which serve to fill in the gaps and paint a more complete picture of the events that take place. Each campaign also includes character exclusive regions and slightly altered areas based on the campaign\u2019s placement in the timeline. One of the campaigns even features[spoiler]a complete ice age reskin of the entire world map + the collapse of one zone onto another.[/spoiler] Each of these characters and their campaigns could easily be their own DLC and I would happily buy them, but Downpour adds FIVE of them which is a gargantuan amount of extra content to an already content-rich game.\n\n[u]TL;DR[/u]\nI started Rain World expecting to play a cute little platformer and what I got instead was a brutally harsh yet thoroughly enjoyable survival game. It was a journey through a beautifully crafted world with a complex ecosystem and a profoundly deep story under the game\u2019s surface. It offers an overwhelming amount of content to enjoy and only gets more gratifying the more hours you put into it.", "timestamp_created": 1697976598, "timestamp_updated": 1697989298, "voted_up": true,

It will either be extremely right for you or you will not be into it at all. Learning the controls is the biggest hurdle, but I found it very fun after getting over the frustration.\nIf you're patient, and (not to sound pretentious, but it's how I feel) you drop your preconceptions about how and what games \"should\" be, you will find this game insanely rewarding.

[i]I'm so sorry, little one, but I was sorely mistaken.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nI'll start off with what I would classify this game as, because it's a pretty unique experience. In short, it's an environmental survival and resource-management platformer sprinkled with a bit of rogue-lite in there. To be honestly with you, the closest game that I've played that I could compare it to is Noita for it's brutality and platforming, but that's about where the similarities end.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, but it has an acquired taste. There will be b*llshit deaths that you can't control. There will be no-win situations. The phrase \"What the F*CK IS THAT??!?\" will be said countless times during your time in the brutal setting of Rain World. However, what this game excels at is creating a beautiful ecosystem to observe and realize that you are only a very small part of. Let's get into that more, shall we?\n\n[h2]The Strengths[/h2]\nThe environment of this game is extremely well done, down to the smallest detail, and much of this is due to how enemies work. Not only are the level layout and aesthetics gorgeous and gritty, but the enemies feel at home there. Different factions of creatures are in specific places of the map, but can venture out, fighting other factions or even amongst themselves. Furthermore, the \"day\" cycle of the game (going to keep this spoiler free) determines what enemies are out, and let me tell you, when the day is ending, even your WORST enemies simply want to survive like you do. All of these tiny interactions of the AI are what make experiencing this game truly special, because no run through the same area will be same. Getting ambushed by a massive enemy swooping out of nowhere at the beginning of an area? Well, even though your expecting it on the next run it never comes. The enemies are not simply roadblocks for the player, they are a part of the world, just like the player.\n\nAlso, this game can be horribly terrifying, especially when you stumble across new enemies (which happens often). I cannot tell you how many times I have entered a new room, seen what sort of abomination lies with in only to turn tail and run immediately. If this game has one thing to saw, it is that you are not the main character, you are only a small yet integral part of the world you find yourself in...\n\nOverall, this game is great, but only if you're OK with a few b*llshit moments here and there. Otherwise, learning the game and how it works is a joy, and I'm still finding interactions that I've never seen previously. Would recommend, and good luck, fellow slugcat!", "timestamp_created": 1697676682, "timestamp_updated": 1697742445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0,

I prefer keyboard, but you should try both out to see which fits you better\n\n- get downpour, it is seriously great and adds a TON to the world and game.\n\n- the camera takes some getting used to, but you will get used to it don't worry. alternatively, there are camera scrolling mods available on the workshop if you just can't handle it\n\n- there is not any one path to get anywhere, in face there's usually two or three, sometimes four. whether it's within a region, or across multiple regions.\n\nIntermediate Tips:\n- when the game starts to feel easier, get a slugpup! it's a nifty way to challenge yourself, especially if you can't push yourself to do harder challenges yet. \n\n- expedition mode can get extremely fun once you've unlocked a bunch of perks, but it can be tough getting there unless you cheese or grind a few expeditions.", "timestamp_created": 1697561963, "timestamp_updated": 1697561963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

However, this game is extremely fun if you just spend some time on it. I've seen negative reviews on this game saying that the enemies aren't staying on path and they are always somewhere different or maybe the controls are bad and who could possibly forget THIS GAME TELLS YOU NOTHING. All of this is true but, I think if you checked what you were getting into and you knew the goal of the game then it wouldn't be so bad. If you don't know this game is a game that simulates a living ecosystem in a dying world. You are not important because you are only a part of this ecosystem. This is why the creatures of Rain World can move even off screen and do (almost) whatever they want. This game also gives them the ability to control their own movements with procedural animation. Basically it makes them control their limbs and make the limbs move however they want so, that it pushes itself from point A to point B. This makes it even harder to predict your enemy. I'm no expert on this topic so if you want to actually know how this works watch a video about it. Your character is procedurally animated too so expect lots of cool movements based on how you move your arrow keys. The controls are difficult to get the hang of. This is because the creature you play as is learning how to live without family guidance. you will most likely get used to it and if you look back actually good at it. Once I got eaten by a blue lizard the actual easiest predator in the game. Now I killed a red lizard one of the most difficult lizard in the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally lets talk about difficulty...\n\n\n\n Imagine the hardest game you have ever played\ntimes it by 10 and then add a hint of impossible to escape moments.\nYes there is parts of the game that are not fair and unexpected, But is life fair?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short this game is like \"Hey did you think that you are not a top predator?

Jugabilidad de 10. Necesitas horas para saber manejarse en el mundo, pero de eso se trata. Se siente un ecosistema vivo, con sus interacciones entre las criaturas mas all\u00e1 de tu presencia. A parte de que hay profundidad a ese nivel, las criaturas reaccionan a ti y hay acciones que cambian su comportamiento de un ciclo a otro. Ah, lo de los ciclos es algo que puede hacerse cuesta arriba y es lo que hace que el juego escale en dificultad. Por resumirlo, hay un tiempo limitado para hacer tus cosas antes de que te tengas de ir a dormir, y tiene que ser alimentado y en sitios en concreto. Yo recomiendo hacer el juego sin mirar nada de gu\u00edas ni intentar saber las cosas antes de encontrarlas. Pero una vez que ya eres jugador avanzado y te pones a buscar ciertas cosas-entidades de la historias, explorar con un mapa hace que todo vaya mas r\u00e1pido. Por cierto, de lore el juego va sobrado. Impresionante, parece solo un juego de supervivencia/plataformas con gatobabosa y te encuentras con una historia muy loca de scifi. Ya dije mucho.

I had heard about the technical features it had, and since I am a developer myself, I wanted to see. When I loaded into the game, the art already looked beautiful. The movement was a little hard to get the hang of on the keyboard, but I quickly switched to a controller, and it was a lot better.\n\nBy far, I have to say that this is one of my top three games I've ever played or seen, and I've played over 300 different games across all platforms. The gameplay and movement were extremely fun to learn, and the lore was even better. Since it has remote play support, I can get many of my friends, who never bought the game, to adventure with me.\n\nThere were many times when we were struggling to beat some parts (cough cough the wall on Artificer cough cough), but eventually, we did get through it. Throughout the entire game, I always had fun in some way. Even just practicing PvP in competitive or learning how to perform a difficult movement skill, I was always having fun.\n\nIf you are going to get the game, here are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nMake sure that you buy the DLC! It quadruples the game's content and is even better than the base game.\nIt is quite challenging to play, so be prepared.\nDO NOT SPOIL THE GAME FOR YOURSELF. Half of the fun of the game is understanding what is happening in the world.\n\nOverall, I would say that this game is a masterpiece to play. If you are considering buying the game, just try it out!

In this game the easy mode is still pretty hard if you're new to the game and is really more comparable to the \"normal\" mode in any other game.

Through all the characters and epochs we witness the world decaying, as nothing actually mattered and is ready to meet the Void. At the same time we are reminded that the cycle is unending and will start anew.\n\nThis game is my favorite among indie titles and not without a reason. Many talk about its unprecedented natural habitat simulation and dynamic animations, fluidness of movement, steep learning curve, art style, story and lore. For me its all of these things combined into something almost flawless as an experience. It might be not the best gaming you will ever get, even though its really solid and fun soon as you dive head first and submerge yourself properly. But it is The Experience.\n\nIt only got better with Downpour. I cannot sing enough praises to the developers that worked of DLC that worked so much time on it by their lonesome. Videocult is also to be commended as they worked towards bringing DLC developers on board. Downpour introduced so much into story and contextualized many elements from the original game, at the same time largely expanding The Experience. \n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that the game might not be everyone's cup of tea, This review is purely subjective and comes from heart.

While you start the game not knowing much else other than the fact that you are a little creature and must find a way to survive, once you get further into the game you realize just how rich the world is! Everything feels alive in this game and no two runs are the same. Hell, even each cycle is completely different, even if you're in the same area! \n\nThe replayability for this game is insane! Even more so if you have the DLC which I 100% do recommend if you enjoy the base game. While the game is already one that you can replay over and over, if you do find things getting a bit stale then look at the workshop! The modding community for this game is astounding and it seems that every day there is new mods to add and try out! From cosmetics to game aids to new fan made areas, enemies, or even completely new slug cats to play as with their own mechanics! You can also play with friends through remote play so only one of you need to own the game. \n\nI will warn you that the game can get incredibly frustrating at times- especially when you're newer to the game as there is a complete lack of hand holding. You will die *a lot*, but its just part of the game. If that doesn't stop you from turning away completely I really do suggest you try it out! \n\nThis game is so incredibly beautiful. The music, art, story- everything is amazing! As far as I've seen there really is no game like this one. If you want a game that will challenge you or you love a game that has amazing lore or of course if you like just being a little creature then this is the game for you!!", "timestamp_created": 1696775832, "timestamp_updated": 1696775832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147864773": {"recommendationid": "147864773", "author": {"steamid": "76561199199214458", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3627, "last_played": 1699220677}, "language": "english", "review": "This game hurt me on a emotional and physical level and I can't stop playing it. 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1696769820, "timestamp_updated": 1696769820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147859399": {"recommendationid": "147859399", "author": {"steamid": "76561199366233525", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 908, "playtime_at_review": 12580, "last_played": 1700681168}, "language": "english", "review": "Scavengers keep hitting me with rocks", "timestamp_created": 1696763034, "timestamp_updated": 1696763034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147855244": {"recommendationid": "147855244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298469415", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 455, "playtime_at_review": 2714, "last_played": 1700691328}, "language": "english", "review": "gourmand :)", "timestamp_created": 1696757232, "timestamp_updated": 1696757232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147849405": {"recommendationid": "147849405", "author": {"steamid": "76561199236953962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 9554, "last_played": 1700381508}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth your time", "timestamp_created": 1696747859, "timestamp_updated": 1696747859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147848781": {"recommendationid": "147848781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318069648", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2509, "last_played": 1695861171}, "language": "english", "review": "mmm  yes pet scug", "timestamp_created": 1696746750, "timestamp_updated": 1696746750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147845665": {"recommendationid": "147845665", "author": {"steamid": "76561199034877737", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8502, "last_played": 1696806855}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Rain World is a really difficult and immersive world that lets you experience how it feels to fear death every other second. [/h1]\n\nRain World is a beautiful looking game, with gorgeous enviroments inside a world that (for the most part) uses it's eviroments to paint you the picture of the world around you.\nExploring the world that is presented to you in this game can be a ball crushing, spirit breaking and all in all complicated journey, with everything in the world have the slightest chance to murder you in cold blood in 1 or 2 seconds. Having to manouver through the pain is something that you NEED to learn in this game, and even after fully completing this game, I don't fully grasp it tbh (damn.)\ntrekking through the terrain, fully grasping each Slugcats story to its conclusion and learning the mechanisms of the existence of every being is a journey I'm glad I followed through to the end and would NOT do it again. I love this game, but I suck at it I wouldn't retry it, loved it though.\n\n[h2] Downpour [/h2]\n\nThe mod turned DLC of Rain World was quite enjoyable to me. The additional Slugcats used to expand the story that the game tells is something I found quite nice and the explanation of the reasons for the actions of certain caracters, the future of the world and it's conclusion was a tale I really enjoyed reading.\nAlthough the enjoyment of the DLC is heavily conflicted due to how different it feels to the main game with it including:\n[olist]\n    [*]Slugcats having more in-depth [i][And impossible to explain in an evolution standpoint][/i] mechanics\n    [*]The story being more explicitly told to the player\n    [*]The writing which some persons find cringy [i][Which personally I only agree on the use of ~ to convey emotions])[/i]\n[/olist]\nI honestly don't think these are necessarily bad points. The expansion serves as more of a add-on to the game, it gives the player new ways to explore the land of Rain World, gives existing characters more depth and reason and creates their own characters (in the form of the Slugcats) with their own personalities, purpose and reasons, and gives a cool [i](though really strange)[/i] \"conclusion\" to the story.\nSpoilers to Saints Campaign:\n[spoiler] Like honestly I don't know why they though to give Saint ascension powers but like pop off ig[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h2] 100% [/h2]\nRain World is hard as balls to 100%. Although most achievements require just finishing campaigns, completing certain objectives or finding [spoiler]Echoes[/spoiler], the game's already high difficulty makes completing the game quite the lengthy task.\nAside from the main story objectives, Downpour adds two new gamemodes with their own objetives:\n[list]\n    [*]Challenges: A series of scenarios of where you have to complete certain objectives in order to win.\n    [*]Expedition Mode: Play the game in any campaign with a set of objectives that you need to complete in order to win.\n[/list]\nChallenges were fun to try and try again until I finally won after a long series of attempts.\nExpedition made me want to die and I would NOT try it again ill be completely honest. I like the game, but if I have to go through specific objectives with the danger of permadeath ever again I'll scream.\n\n[h2] Recommendation [/h2]\nI only recommend this game if you have extreme patience and are willing to endure a challenge that may seem just really hard at times and really unfair at others.\nThe story the base game and DLC give is really well thought out and I got quite compelled by the narrative that it presented, being one of the games where I actually decided to look into the lore on my own just to learn more about it.\nIt's not a game for everyone, but if you really like challenging platformers or are willing to endure it, I fully recommend it\n\n[h3] TL;DR [/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Beautiful pixel and non-pixel art\n    [*]Really good and compelling story\n    [*]Hard as balls\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1696741012, "timestamp_updated": 1696741134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399",

"review": "It's a very good game and there is certainly some directions and instructions given to you at parts. Whether or not you'll survive long enough or figure things out to get to those early points is another story.\n\nWhile there's many things Rain World does right, the question posed is \"would you recommend it?\" and I look back at my 13.5 hours spent and say that the game is fun, there's variety and many pathways through areas, the freedom is great and being able to go wherever you'd like (mostly) is a big plus. That's where the compliments end though, I can't in good conscience recommend this to other people who want to jump in and start having fun, you need to at least have a goal in mind to work towards before you start to really appreciate some titles and... I don't think that surviving while dying many times over is enough of that to motivate some to keep playing.\n\nMy review is not for fans of Rain World. In fact I suppose it may well be looked upon as my not giving the game enough of a chance, the discussions might even scoff at my measly 13.5 hours and a lot of them would dismiss my review as bad for not having the time put in. Some would argue my review should be wrote after my first playthrough but I tell you this now, you can't get an unbiased review from somebody clearly in love with the game, so before Rain World takes me deeper into its clutches I'll keep my thoughts as they are, I am not converted yet and I think it fills its niche very well.\n\nIf I had to leave somebody reading this with parting thoughts on whether or not to buy the game. Consider if you enjoy games where some paths will be dead ends, backtracking is where you'll spend a chunk of your time, consulting a guide may be necessary for some to enjoy the game. Now read that last point again, so I ask you.. can I really recommend a game where a guide may in some instances be necessary for players to start enjoying it?\n\nThe answer to the above is yes I could. However I am not going to, this is because I respect your time and I believe your time is better spent on other games. Oh but I will add that if you find this game cheap enough it is probably worth sinking that initial half hour or an hour in to get your feet wet, the general vibe you start out with persists throughout the rest of the game so it is in my novice opinion a good indicator.\n\nEdit: I have finished The Survivor since publishing this review and while I have mixed feelings on the ending it was overall good. The steps to achieve it are downright brutal however, with no \"easy\" path.. I mean I get it, fine the game can be a bit harder towards the last milestones.\n\nWhat my complaint here is that the final area overstays its welcome, you go into a very hazey and vague area with no clear shapes, head towards something and then after a couple steps you finish.. in theory. It's not often I actually pause at the very final stretch to check if I'm doing something wrong but here in Rain World I had to pause and check multiple times, there's just nothing happening for a good few minutes with barely any change and that's normal. Then at the very very last part of it all you go do something else to trigger the ending, the problem here is THERE'S NO CLEAR INDICATOR TO DO SO, JUST A VERY VAGUE ONE.\n\nTo be clear I don't have it in for Rain World, there's a reason I stayed up until the ending and I'm not done with it. It is so much more frustrating to me that the final bit could be so confusing.

I especially liked messing around in expeditions once I figured them out! That and the movement tech!! It's so much fun to learn! :]\nThe music is GODLY. Very fun to have on in the background.

I love seeing everyone's theories-- I love how creative everything is.\n\nThis review doesn't have the greatest formatting but I thought to finally share my love for this game. I've bought it twice for myself and five times for friends- and I doubt I'll stop anytime soon!\n\nOnce you get past the learning curve you really start to see your improvement, and that itself is an exhilarating feeling.

A slugcat, a snack for predators. You don't get stronger. You don't develop new abilities. You just... stay you. Your performance in the game can improve as you play more, learning to survive better, but you stay you. You survive as you are.\n\nI could play this game all day. It's so beautiful and amazing, and it gives a whole new feeling to it. It's beautiful in its own way... it doesn't matter if the scenery or the creatures are beautiful. The game is.\n\nIn this game, you start out as a weak slugcat, and stay one. You will die, but you will adapt and survive. You will explore and wander, finding weapons to defend yourself. You go through cycles (like a day), fatal rain coming at the end of each. You must hibernate in your den to escape it. When you hibernate, the new cycle will begin and the rain's timer will reset. The more you hibernate, the more your karma is raised. If you die, you lose some of that karma.\n\nEach creature is so balanced, and it fits in perfectly. They all have their own reasons to be here, even if not all of them are organic, they're still amazing. It feels just like a real thriving ecosystem. Every area and place is all so detailed. I really love the Scavengers. They're so complex and well-developed.\n\nThe only thing relatively bad I have to say about this is how pained the keyboard controls are.

It's a game where you will eventually beat it if you keep trying.\n[b]Exploring is fun[/b], it's just plain fun, that's the main reason to play the game, the game never get repetitive because each region introduce enough things to keep the game fun.\n[b]Gorgeous visuals.[/b] Everything from the locations to the enemies to the slugcats is so charming and memorable.\n[b]Pretty memorable soundtrack.[/b] Thou, it's kinda hard to search for specific themes.\n[h2] Cons [/h2]\n[b]Extremely unreliable Overseer[/b], it was gone for most part of my mid/late game playthrough, I did Unfortunate Development twice because I missed the path to [Redacted]\n[b]It doesn't bother to introduce more advanced techniques that make the game more fun.[/b] Just read the wiki of the game.\n[b]Pretty simple story.[/b] It'll be hours and hours of basically no story at all, you can get extra lore using pearls, but that requieres a lot of effort and backtracking.\n[b]I personally didn't like the last section of the game.[/b] It was hard to see where I could move and I was swimming in the void for 25 minutes. It was not hard or something, just disappointing.\n[b]You can't bang Moon.[/b] Originally the score was 8.5/10, but I had to lower it after writting this part of the review.", "timestamp_created": 1696301498, "timestamp_updated": 1696301935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147538683": {"recommendationid": "147538683", "author": {"steamid": "76561199404768619", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1696380513}, "language": "english", "review": "had a heart attack more than 20 times", "timestamp_created": 1696299148, "timestamp_updated": 1696299148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147537400": {"recommendationid": "147537400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364161934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1838, "last_played": 1696301010}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no idea whats going on and I'm scared", "timestamp_created": 1696297089, "timestamp_updated": 1696297089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147535725": {"recommendationid": "147535725", "author": {"steamid": "76561199517045597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1698593484}, "language": "english", "review": "i is an underated game of the century, its a 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1696294329, "timestamp_updated": 1696294329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147534893": {"recommendationid": "147534893", "author": {"steamid": "76561199200115977", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1700616689}, "language": "english", "review": "slugcat. scug. clug. s l u t.", "timestamp_created": 1696292940, "timestamp_updated": 1696292940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147530443": {"recommendationid": "147530443", "author": {"steamid": "76561199344425773", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1365, "last_played": 1699749201}, "language": "english", "review": "n__n\nI ._.

"language": "english", "review": "10/10 but man where do i even start with this game\nwell i bought the DLC with the game when i first got it knowing it was likely something i would like after i played a little bit of the game on a friend's console and i am glad i did\nwhen i played this game for the first time it was like i when i played Mario for the first time when i was younger\nin other worlds its nice to have a game that kicked my ass for a while before i learned how to play it and the ins and outs of its game mechanics and was still fun\nto say its unlike anything else i have played is a bit of an understatement so here are my thoughts on it in detail\n\n(Lore/Story) the story is pretty good i like the world building and the vibes this game gives me when playing though its areas \n\n(Controls) the movement is clunky but not in a bad way you kinda have to drag yourself though the world like the rodent you play as and there is a lot of neat tech and funky stuff you can do because of this it just takes a bit of getting used to it tho i have always used a controller when playing this game so idk what playing keyboard is like\n\n(Gameplay) getting used to the movement and avoiding being eaten is very important if you cant do that you wont get anywhere in this game. other than that you eat food, wander, avoid the rain, find shelter and die a lot to name few of the things you will be doing while playing and the creature AI is really something else helps make this game feel alive and hungry for Slugcat meat \n\n(Graphics) i know quite a few people that don't understand the appeal of pixelated graphics if you are like these people and cant understand why this game is stunning and gives of the vibes it does then i feel bad for you \n\n(Music) the soundtrack is fantastic and really adds to the vibes love the threat music that plays when enemies are near you\n\n(Issues) the only real issue i have with the game that i can think of off the top of my head is the way screen doesn't scroll in larger rooms rather once you get to the end of the screen and can move past it will transition to the next screen even with the threat music that can help you know where danger is the lack of screen scroll can still lead to a lot of deaths to off screen enemies that fall in to the screen from above or are waiting for you when the screen transitions while you move across the room\n\n(recommending) even tho i had a great time with this game and still do i really don't know how to recommend the game to people because of how different it is maybe give it a try if it looks fun\n\n(Community) while i haven't talked much with other players as of now the modded content that is being made is fantastic keep up the good work guys", "timestamp_created":

The more i explore this game either way, there is something about this slug cat story and journey in game play and story progression that is so profound and thought provoking that it can't be ignored in this form of art. There is something special here and it's not anyone that can get it. Even me reviewing this has doubts if i really comprehend the intended philosophical meaning of it. keeps me thinking and in a good way despite how heavy or light own conclusions can be. If ur interested in this game cause u saw a trailer or anything related to it and if ur a art lover give it a try.  Recommend it. It might not have the same impact on you but it definitely will in some way or another. If you decide to give it a go, don't give a shit and be picky about gameplay. It is what it is and it's actually good in it own way. Just go with it. follow the journey and make your own decisions \"in the dark\". Explore. Figure the lore by observing, it's not obvious.

Humanoid characters running around to progress through a tech tree and dominate the world around them, it is refreshing to see such a simplistic take on this genre.\n\nYou see, this game is not characterized by 'survival' because you have to obtain a certain amount of food to continue living, it is that in conjunction with the sheer oppressiveness of the environment around you that gives it it this genre tag.\n\nYou are prey, and you must act like it. Fighting is never the best course of action, it is always the last resort.\n\nThe only advantages you have over other creatures in this environment is your nimbleness. Your ability to hold tools and craft things is ironically outclassed by another species. You, a human, who have created technology to dominate your environment, are now lowered through this game to the place in the food chain as what is to humans is an ape, or monkey.\n\nRain World is possibly the most immersive non-humanoid survival game I have ever played, and it's not 3d.\n\nRain World's two dimensional playing field becomes less a restriction for the scope of the game and more an intentional design decision to make every room feel that much more claustrophobic. Each area is densely packed with all kinds of flora, fauna, and remnants of the old world, and its your job to navigate through all of it.\n\nFor this, you have been given ample tools, the nimble slugcat you control has access to an array of moves, all situated within a few simple button presses. Jumping, grabbing, moving, crawling, climbing, throwing and squeezing through pipes morph and combine into all sorts of movement tech that I couldn't possibly fit into a single review (seriously, watch a guide on it) however, the quick, snappy control scheme means that you only need those 7 basic things to get through the entire game. This game has almost no form of extrinsic progression, as the progression in your skill is reward in of itself. Whether you learn new movement tech that helps you make that one jump JUST out of your reach, or if you become that more in tune with your moveset, you'll quickly start to see you making fools of everything trying its hardest to catch you... Until you are caught being reckless.\n\nThe humbling nature of this world makes it satisfying to even hit the simplest of jumps, or best the comparatively tiniest of foes.\nAll that packed into great environmental storytelling and a grueling journey around all corners of the expansive and highly detailed map, that makes you sigh in relief when its over... and want to do it all over again.

continue playing it, but at certain point it just feels like a chore\n\nimagine if super meat boy had a maximum timer after wich you die no matter what, and every time you die you lose 20 minutes of progress, at many points in time that's how rainworld feels\n\nthe game is just counter intuitive, even when you're supposed to learn how to play with just watching, it's like they set rules and then made them not work 50% of the time\n\n-this game requires patience to do most things, yet you can't take your time because you would either be being chased by a creature half of the time, or about to get killed by the ingame timer (wich is randomized each day, so you may just have to suck it up and waste another day idling before you have enough time to go trough) and if you instead try to rush, there will always be an enemy camping to the other side of the zone, wich you have to either waste time that you don't have to go trough, or risk it and do a 50/50 of dying and starting again or finally crossing\n\n-this game wants you to learn, yet everything (item spawns, enemy spawns, enemy movement, and enemy AI) is randomized every day, you may get lucky and go trough a zone completelly unharmed, or have to deal with bad spawns, and waste another hour or so dying and respawning over and over, the game also punishes experimenting, since dying lowers you karma level, something crucial to go between each zone of the game\n\n-the tools you have are there, but way too limited, you have 3 slots to hold stuff, in most zones one will be occupied to hold an item you need to traverse the zone, and if you are trying to discover the lore of the game so will be the 3rd one (wich mind you, discovering the lore involves an awfull ammount of backtracking) you may say this is expectable since one is doing a hard challenge put on themselves, but when i have to go trough three times the ammount of torture just to understand what's happening ingame i'd just skip the lore part and try to reach the ''ending'' of the game instead\n\nbesides that, you have the most useless map you could ever imagine, why would you divide it in three different parts? why would you make the player's experience harder in anything that isn't the main aspect of the game itself instead of what counts as one of their only tools? eventually i got so tired of dealing with it that i had to sink into the wiki (getting spoiled major things too, because lord forbbid you get to discover something yourself in the game about exploration without walking 10 hours) just to know where should i even go to begin with, the lack of context and the  minimal help of the overseer didn't get me too far last time (he's literally gone for half of the zones you traverse, cmon)\n\nthe game is just a slug (no pun intended, i love slugcats) and at more than one point it just feels sisyphean to jump from one savespot to another, i know that more than one will say this game IS meant to be hard and that im tilting madly, i know the game is fun but if there's no progress after four hours maybe others can enjoy it but i cannot\n\nTLDR: sometimes, this feels like the complete opposite of a game with how it expects you to handle it\n\ni have bought the base game and the downpour expansion, and i will probably keep playing it further until i get to finish it if possible, until then, my looks on the game are not good\n\nand to whoever says skill issue, go back to your cbt session or whatever game you need to defend next", "timestamp_created": 1694878967, "timestamp_updated": 1694878967, "voted_up": false,

Starts out bumpy and confusing but only gets better with time. DLC more than doubles the content for a fraction of the cost. The game has come far over its development and it shows with the later content.\n\nWhile I recommend starting out vanilla be sure to check out the in game accessibility and mod options labeled Remix. If you want more, the workshop has many quality mods to help change the game to your liking or simply add more content.\n\n\nA HUGE pitfall the game baits players into is to play Monk first. The game has reputation of being unforgiving, they're the 'first' character on the list, why wouldn't you want a \"Significantly more peaceful one\"? Because the developers are liars. Compared to Survivor selecting Monk considerably nerfs a number of your stats in ways that would not be immediately apparent to the player. You are forced into a flight-over-fight play style while the world itself STAYS JUST AS DANGEROUS if you were Survivor. Many enemies, environments, and obstacles simply can't be ran away from hurting the average player's starting experience as well as many techniques available to every other single character will not cut it as Monk. All the while setting you up for failure in future playthroughs when playing as the more combat based characters as Monk's campaign discourages you from fully learning all of your tools at your disposal. \n\nThe trade off for Monk is that they take advantages the stealth and reputation system, systems that especially a new player would not be privy to unless they read the wiki beforehand. Even then every other character can also take advantage of said systems if abet at a slower rate (bar a specific DLC one).

The game doesn't use sprites or pre-rendered animations - the animations are run in real-time by code and react dynamically to the environment and world around you.\n\n[b] Survival [/b]\nYou play as a slugcat, a small creature low on the food chain, and are thrown into this dangerous world to survive. You must learn to use the environment to survive; by finding food and shelter, using the local fauna to help traverse the world, or learning how to out-manoeuvre the local predators.\n\n[b] Movement [/b]\nThere is a lot of advanced movement tech in this game. Heck, there's an 87 page long google doc detailing how to perform most of this tech. Strangely, you don't need to learn any of it. It's all just there to enhance replay value and speedrunning.\n\n[b] Adventure [/b]\nThe game is best experienced blind, there are a lot of wonderful things to find in Rain World; but if you are struggling to progress or understand what to do it may be worth looking up advice.\n\n[b] Co-op [/b]\nWith the Downpour DLC, you have access to local co-op (which can be accessed through remote play), and 5 new DLC campaigns all of which have unique characters and changes across the world. Some criticise the DLC for being more game-like and less immersive, but I never ran into this as a problem.\n\n[b] Achievements [/b]\nGetting 100% achievements was ... in some parts a frustrating experience. Some of the challenges in the arena were a bit annoying (although some of them were great!). Challenge 70, while cool, was very annoying forcing you to replay the slow and boring phases 1-3 to access the much more difficult phases 4-6.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nOverall, I had a fantastic experience with this game. Highly recommended if you love exploring expansive immersive 2D worlds with a great artstyle and design.", "timestamp_created": 1694784414, "timestamp_updated": 1696209378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146332337": {"recommendationid": "146332337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013924266", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 481, "last_played": 1694998695}, "language": "english", "review": "here lizard lizard\ncheck out my spear\n\nthats a good boy", "timestamp_created": 1694781452, "timestamp_updated": 1694781452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146331364": {"recommendationid": "146331364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826019922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 463, "last_played": 1695227610}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me do a triple axle back flip off of a 1-Inch high surface and land while stabbing eldritch monsters with a toothpick and while playing as a morbidly obese Cat That was also a slug and orange.

would've liked, but I wanted to return it.\nRain World is absolutely gorgeous and mechanically amazing but with how punishing and grindy at times (if you're bad, which you will be if you just installed the game) I could not absolutely bear to play it more than 2 cycles at a time and did not enjoy more than a handful of minutes of my total playtime.\nIf you like incredibly punishing games with simple but very deep mechanics that are satisfying to learn and master, with stunningly good NPC AI and complex, interesting lore, you'll love it, but if you're not a part of the small ammount of people that would realistically enjoy the game you will absolutely loathe your time with it.\nI don't recommend it to the majority of people, but I can see and understand where its fans are coming

A separate footrest for a chair is known as an ottoman, hassock or pouffe.\n\nThe chair is known for its antiquity and simplicity, although for many centuries it was an article of state and dignity rather than an article of ordinary use. \"The chair\" is still extensively used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings.\n", "timestamp_created": 1694687345, "timestamp_updated": 1694687345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146272186": {"recommendationid": "146272186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091516597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1772, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1700400638}, "language": "english", "review": "Slugpup", "timestamp_created": 1694686587, "timestamp_updated": 1694686587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146268869": {"recommendationid": "146268869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842502612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 9876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2749, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1700727161}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with amazing world building and lore.

If you were drawn into the worlds of Ori and the Blind Forest, or Hollow Knight, you will definitely enjoy this one as well. To describe it in few words, it is dynamic and powerful in presentation. Very highly recommend.\n\n\nAt Length: This game hits a lot of marks, and while it does have some shortcomings, they're overshadowed by the things it does right.\n\nWhat does it do right?\n\n- Procedural animation. A technique full of technical challenges to implement, but done so fantastically in Rain World. Every creature in the game moves according to how it's able to, rather than a pre-set animation. Creatures can lunge, flap, lose their grip on surfaces, ect. This will also have an effect on your Slugcat's own movement.\n\n- Environmental storytelling. Adventurous types will find plenty of ways to get lost, and along the way, see interesting sights and learn a little bit more about the world they inhabit. There are mysteries to uncover, but I won't spoil them here. \n\n- Music. James Primate and the rest of their team have created a soundtrack that not only supplements the environmental storytelling, but engages the player with the events on screen. The choice to make the music dynamic itself lends greatly to that effect. I often listen to the tracks while not playing. \n\n- Content rich DLC. Buy downpour with this game. It vastly expands the content of the original game in all aspects. More music, more areas to explore, more Slugcats, more lore. Do it. \n\n- Art and design. Rain World is a work of art in and of itself. There are places I needed to stop passing through and just soak in. There are moments when I felt overwhelmed. At some point I cried. In addition to evoking emotions though, I was also impressed by the range of designs of creatures and elements of the environment. Enjoy such classics like: bees that tie you down, and an insect half the size of a Toyota Corolla. \n\n- Skill and exploration are rewarded. The game is a journey, and not one just based on travel. You'll figure out what things means and how to use them, and it's a good feeling when you do. Knowledge and a practiced hand are king when it comes to survival. There's also cool little things to find throughout the world. Challenges and expedition mode add more levels of knowledge and skill testing.\n\n- Local co-op. Not a feature I make use of personally, but I see the value it in for others. Support games that bring people together. Jolly cooperation makes cold nights in the shelters better for everyone. Online co-op is not an official feature, but one that's possible through Steam Remote Play. Since that's a direct connect feature, you might experience some lag when the person you're connecting to is far away. \n\n- Community. The Rain World community kicks ass. So many talented folks, kind folks, supportive folks. Some of those folks went on to put their love and hard work into the DLC. The community is active and positive. Join the Rain World discord, there you can talk about your journey through the game, see the art that's posted every day, discuss lore, why Saint is the best Slugcat, or talk about mods.\n\n- Mods. In addition to an active community overall, there's also an active modding community. Turn a terrifying foe into a clown, add whole regions to your game, or find entirely new Slugcats with new looks and mechanics. Be sure to thank or support those good nerds that make the content. \n\nWhat does it not do right?\n\n- The game is unfair. That's not me complaining, there are points where circumstances align to destroy your Slugcat in sudden and sometimes funny ways. But sometimes it's just out of your control. It's the nature of the game, being as dynamic as it is. This might be cause for frustration among some people, and unfortunately, it's not helped by what I'll mention in the next section. However, it's an important part of overall feel of the game. I'll let you discover why.\n\n- Controls can be somewhat vague, and the immobile camera can cause lack of awareness beyond the edge of the screen. The controls for the game are simple, but there's a lot of different movements you can do. A series of buttons you press can mean something if you're standing on the ground, and something else when you are climbing a pipe. This usually isn't an issue until you're hanging over a pit. It's remedied with practice, calm input, or changing your settings. There are also audio cues that help with the camera issue. Additionally, quality of life mods exist for both of these issues.\n\nTo conclude: I cannot recommend this game enough. It's beautiful, there's cool game design elements to it, the story is evocative, the music invigorating. Creatures and places that firmly belong in our memory. A vast, mysterious, terrifying world to explore... and through it all, you. The humble Slugcat. Going WAWA and inconveniencing calculators. Only those folks who don't like platformers at all, or get incredibly frustrated easily, would I say your experience with the game could be hit or miss. But otherwise, buy it. Play it. Support it. Become Slugcat. Can you feel it? The spear in your little hands? Your body squirmshing through the pipe? The wag of your tail? The- no, get back... leave me... it's too late, I'm... the rains are coming... I must...  I...

The base game consists of three cats, one being easy mode (Monk), the base one (Survivor)  which i recommend playing unless u really have skill issue and then (i think) if u beat the game as either one u unlock one which is more speed run and survival based (Hunter). It took me personally 20h to beat Survivors campaign and it was really fun, i did resort to using a tutorial at some parts cause i felt mega stuck and i recommend u do the same if stuck but other than that just play the game, OR DONT PLAY IT AS U WANT! \nFrom there i tried the DLC adding 5 new slug cats with their own \"Powers\" quirks is if u will,\nGourmand, fat, can craft, can body slam enemies. Artificer, keeps getting hunted can EXPLODE!. Rivulet, super fast cat neat mobility but the RAIN comes sooner. Spearmaster, infinite spears, no mouth, eats with spears and Saint, Pacifist, long tongue and then God hood eventually.\nI didnt beat all the campaigns yet but the one i did play are super fun loved them, i did however try all the slug cats and each one is unique (except Monk he is just easy mode) and great fun. The world is huge and the art style is stunning, really pretty and fun game.\nSome downsides i do have to say is that the game can get u omega stuck and not soft lock but ur just lost u got no clue what u are doing, and thats normal i fixed that with a tutorial to get me back on track, and also the game is simply unfair sometimes lol and thats part of the charm but sometimes is SUCH bs.\n\nSimply, only get the game if u are intrested and are willing to push through and play it otherwise dont bother cause u will not enjoy it. I do recommend the DLC but get it only after you have completed Survivors or Monks campaign.

Hundreds of hours in this game and yet I still feel hardly qualified to recommend it to another person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s an incredible game. More people should play it. Should you?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the details. The pixel art looks incredible. The sound design is great. It\u2019s rare to see the full potential of procedural animation realized, but Rain World does it. Every part of this world looks and feels alive. The excellent AI of the game\u2019s various inhabitants contributes to that as well.\n\nThe gameplay is a more complicated topic. That\u2019s not a cop-out way of saying the game isn\u2019t fun to play \u2013 it is. But it\u2019s also infuriating. Death comes for you easily and often unfairly. It\u2019s not a roguelike, but if you can\u2019t stand roguelikes I would hesitate to recommend this game to you.\n\nThe controls are in a similar situation. They\u2019re not bad, and there\u2019s an incredible depth of skill that can be achieved with them \u2013 once you\u2019re done exploring this game on your own, check out the wiki\u2019s movement guides. I\u2019ve come to enjoy the controls, but only after a great deal of frustration.\n\nThis frustration is a core part of Rain World. You could not tell the story that the developer is trying to tell, could not provide the profound experience that Rain World does, without this frustration.\n\nAll the same, I\u2019d recommend to everyone that they enable the \u201cRemix\u201d plugin on the \u201cClassic\u201d preset immediately. The quality-of-life changes this gives are invaluable, and don\u2019t diminish the experience in any way.

If u tend to be someone who gets turned off by difficulty that isn't always because of a skill issue ala souls games and more because of a super complex ai system with a bunch of rng involved then maybe don't play this game or wait fr it to go on sale? It's definitley a little expensive for a game that the large majority of the people who bought it get stuck in the first area, BUT and this is super important if you're willing to stick 2 it's inconsistent difficulty you get one of the most uniquely designed games that has some of the most awesome n heart wrenching lore that's only made better by its incredible dlc (in which it's only issue is barring the only sense of control over the harsh enviornment in the new unique slugcats behind beating the game once with either the easy or normal mode characters which is already a task that can take 20-40 hours on a mostly blind first playthru) \n\nBut seriously go into this dam game blind because the way the whole world connects and has lore and design built around these big things that absolutely shall not be spoiled is so legendary no other game will ever give u such a dope sense of scale with it's world, obviously i'd say later in a first playthrough generally a couple small looks at a wiki are propably gonna happen, because the game can seriously be annoying in parts. Depending on how you see it doe it's very cool design because of how rng heavy it is, I didn't find any areas in specific to be any worse than others even with crazy creature and visual variety, so any big memorable stretches that were very hard to climb out of are almost always unique to the playthrough or player individually which makes it even more satisfying when you have an equal amount of moments where you have a massive stroke of luck or when you can make it through a hard area/situation by the skin of your teeth. And even if you do almost get softlocked by some rare but still annoying random combination of enviornments and creatures you can always use built in mod support or manually fine tune how difficult the game is (which is such an underrated feature games that have this are so awesome like og system shock) I generally say that its good to try and stick to the set difficulty but the option is always there and i can for sure say that for some super unlucky parts in my downpour playthroughs i maybe wouldve disabled karma requirments for a gate or something, no shame in it lol\n\nIt sounds like im giving this game a mixed review but na im only trying to seem reasonable to people who may struggle with this games difficulty more than me, I had a blast playing it the setpieces characters fun dlc slugcats and also super underrated and incredible music and atmosphere are awesome, plus as a last thing honestly the whole thing is so worth sticking through with the goal ofplaying the saint campaign in downpour, not to say that any other whole slugcat campaigns were bad actually they were almost perfect as well but god i think that whole indipendent story coming as the last time you experience the amazing world just hits so hard i cant spoil a single thing about the campaign because its perfe3ct anyways play this damn game pls !!!!", "timestamp_created": 1694055652, "timestamp_updated": 1696864700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145827389": {"recommendationid": "145827389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369557974", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 6627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 567, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1700721562}, "language": "english", "review": "i hated this game when i first played it. don't be like me. this game is an absolute masterpiece and to think of it as anything less is utterly criminal.", "timestamp_created": 1694053773, "timestamp_updated": 1694053773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145827004": {"recommendationid": "145827004", "author": {"steamid": "76561199140799529", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "playtime_at_review": 19486, "last_played": 1699924896}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite game.

MIXED review.\n\nI really wish I could love this game, we have had lot of wonderful memories together. The art, the music, the memories~ \n\nBut them I remember that every day it beats the piss out of me with its bare knuckles. \n\nReview at 22 hours in, still on my first run though this is normal from what I see. \n\nThis isn't a hard because its challenging, though it has it's moments. what it is truly; is a creators vision not aligning with game design foundations. It's a GREAT vision, and although I've cut my life expectancy in half from the blood pressure, I love the good that's in this game. The issue stands that there are some serious game design faux pas embedded in the bones of this. Extreme punishment for failure, poor signposting (not talking about yellow), crucial mechanics are not explained. Crucify me if you like for this, but it's also a wiki game; just because something *can* be discovered in the game, doesn't mean it *will* be.\n\nIf the goal was to create an immersive experience around being a powerless part of nature; frustration is the enemy of immersion. There are ways to punish and reward the player for engaging with your creation that don't cause them to be frustrated and \"switch-off\". Instead, it chooses to \"reward\" you with an opportunity to experience the game for longer than 15 minutes without giving your head another contusion.\n\nI will finish this game, and I plan to finish all the other stories as well; but it is a violently abusive relationship, and i can't in good conscience recommend anyone attempt to *play* this.\n\nWatch an experienced play through, preferably without commentary. Or turn on all the remix mods to say \"fuck you\" to the devs for designing the default experience around the highest levels of play. \n\nI love this game for what it does right, great experience, great art, design, soundtrack. Terrible game play.\n\n****\nEDIT\n****\nI just completed the survivors story and, now I can only push my last point harder. This game would have been far more enjoyable had I not gone in blind. \n\nThere were no answers in the core gameplay, you won't get your questions resolved.
