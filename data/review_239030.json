Your job is to review the documents of travelers and determine whether to allow or deny their entry based on an ever-changing and complex set of immigration rules and requirements.\n\nAt first glance it may seem mundane, but Papers, Please quickly becomes an extremely engaging and thought-provoking experience. The gameplay itself is quite simple - check documents, stamp passports, and detain those with discrepancies. However, you have to balance inspecting papers thoroughly while keeping the line moving quickly to avoid penalties. As each day passes, new rules and requirements further complicate matters. Difficult moral dilemmas also arise often - do you take a bribe to allow an otherwise unqualified entrant, even if it will help feed your family?\n\nThe visuals are pixel-art inspired and effectively convey the drab totalitarian vibe. The gameplay interface truly makes you feel like an inspector processing endless papers. The writing and storytelling are exceptional - even with minimal dialogue and exposition, Lucas Pope skillfully crafts a scenario that exposes many complex political and ethical issues.\n\nI'm blown away by how engrossing the experience becomes despite the deliberately mundane premise. It really makes you think about things like: how much personal freedom should we sacrifice for security or practicality? Where is the line between reasonable duty and oppressive bureaucracy? How far would you compromise your own principles if your livelihood or family security depended on it?\n\nIn summary, Papers, Please manages to transform an intentionally dull concept into a highly original, thought-provoking game. The deep themes underscore the skillful game design. I highly recommend giving Papers, Please a try for a gaming experience quite unlike any other.", "timestamp_created": 1700541858, "timestamp_updated": 1700541858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150519098": {"recommendationid": "150519098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198861496561", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 284, "playtime_at_review": 297, "last_played": 1700523351}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1700523326, "timestamp_updated": 1700523326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150518692": {"recommendationid": "150518692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407778509", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3128, "playtime_at_review": 3128, "last_played": 1700518193}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive, accidentally kept my computer on so now i have an obsurd amount of hours", "timestamp_created": 1700522656, "timestamp_updated": 1700522656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150507323": {"recommendationid": "150507323", "author": {"steamid": "76561199379861823", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 745, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1700507555}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1700507655, "timestamp_updated": 1700507655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150506581": {"recommendationid": "150506581", "author": {"steamid": "76561199553010303", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1700238112}, "language": "english", "review": "A really great, and well-built game.

This indie gem thrusts us into the dusty world of a border control officer in the fictional post-Soviet state of Arstotzka, challenging us to navigate a fine line between heart and ink pad.\n\n### Gameplay:\n\"Papers, Please\" is a moral puzzle nestled within a time-management game that unfolds as a bureaucratic drama. Each day brings new rules, new faces, and new dilemmas. As the clock ticks, we scrutinize passports, visas, and other documents to ensure only eligible individuals cross the border. Yet, in this world of stamps and forms, a story lurks behind every passport photo.\n\n### Graphics:\nThe pixel art is nostalgic and functional, contributing to the oppressive atmosphere that makes \"Papers, Please\" so unique. The color palette, primarily composed of grayscale, reflects the gloom of the bureaucratic jungle through which we must carve our path.\n\n### Soundtrack:\nThe music is a subtle masterpiece capturing the monotony and tension of life at the border. The somber, repetitive soundtrack is the perfect companion to the gray world of Arstotzka.\n\n### Humor:\nDespite the serious theme, the game is peppered with humorous moments often arising from the quirky interactions with the entrants. The dry, black comedy provides a welcome relief from the often oppressive reality of border officer life.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\"Papers, Please\" is a masterpiece of indie game design. It takes a simple concept and transforms it into a deep, emotional experience that challenges both heart and mind. As we stamp, check, and sometimes place our heart over the rules, we realize that \"Papers, Please\" is more than just a game - it's a glimpse into the human soul, captured in pixels and paper.\n",

Which I kind of wasn't expecting, I thought it might be way too stressful, but it really wasn't! Who knows if I'll play again for some more endings, but. Good good good.

After hours across several different runs, I'm just not cut out to do the paperwork fast enough. But I've been through more than enough and watched a few playthroughs to form an honest take over years.\n\nThe art and sound are enriching and really pull you in. With each cut-scene and unique interaction shining bright against the otherwise dismal and numb experience. Each day brings new horrors and adventure all the same as the noose of bureaucracy and corruption tightens around your neck - all from the view of your own static workstation.\n\nYou really get the claustrophobic feel that your country is slowly imploding and that even a mere checkpoint operator like yourself is going to get caught in the crossfire.\n\nTaking care of your family, having the option to help out random civilians, and splitting allegiances to outside influences and yourself make for several layers of intrigue that are built organically as the game ramps up the intensity.\n\nSome detractors call the game boring, and others say that it's incredible beyond compare.\nWhile certainly unique, the truth is that you won't be pining to continue the game after a few sessions - and won't be clawing to return to the experience until the novelty of its presentation has faded from the forefront of your memory.\n\nIt's a beautiful creation that stands out, but after a few bits it's basically over and you're going to move on.\nFor the rest of your life when someone mentions [i]Papers, Please[/i] you will be smitten with a vague memory of the endless onslaught of mental labor the game demands, and only recall in vivid detail the more outlandish moments of excitement.\n\nThe biggest strength of the game is that the creators somehow manged to take one of the most tedious and soul-crushing day jobs in real life and turn it into a tense, political, and thematic puzzle game.\nThe downside is that in spite of its earnest attempts to engross players with efficient use of budget and resources on the developing end, it's an inescapable foundation that the game itself is built on a tedious and droning activity.\n\nIt's absolutely worth the play, and if you can catch it on sale - it's something that deserves to be experienced.\n\nHowever, if you're on the fence or are having second thoughts - there are much better games out there, even though none of them could ever hope to be anything even similar to [i]Papers, Please[/i].\n\n~\n\n[h3]TL;DR[/h3]\n[b]6.5/10[/b].\n[i]Papers, Please[/i] is a [b]Well Made[/b] game.\nIt will give you renewed appreciation for life, freedom, and the job that you have - but it does so by instilling paranoia, panic, and self doubt all too well - with little juice to entice you to make a return once the iron curtain falls.", "timestamp_created": 1697664092, "timestamp_updated": 1697664092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

Does it convey the experience of interacting with a faceless bureaucratic machine? It definitely does. Does it present people\u2019s stories and force you to prioritize between them, rules and your own needs? Yeah, sure.

about a real job about checking documents would be boring but...\nIt's surprisingly fun?\n\nThis game is 10 years old already and despite that, it is very well-crafted and makes sense in everything it does.\nIt makes it feel like this is a real job which is fantastic because not a lot of games achieve it this well.\nIt also has a fairly simple story with 20 endings and an Endless mode on top of that which is a super cool addition to a game like this!\nIt is replayable, interesting, fun and has some very cool achievements.\nIt is also a very \"human\" game.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that it only takes less than 100MBs to download and you can run it perfectly fine in all devices.\nFor nowadays games you need 1GB at the very least and a good graphics card or lots of RAM, not with this game tho.\nIf you are looking for a simple game to play on a low-badget device, this game is perfect!!\n\nHonestly, I can't say many things I could say that could improve about the game, it has almost no flaws! :D\n\nIt is not a top game for me, but it is probably one of the best games on Steam.\n\nDEFINITELY recomended.\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1696924459,

The eternal question) chewing up your mistakes. And seriously, if whoever's monitoring that printer is so quick to catch your blunders, why aren't they working the counter themselves?\n\nAs part of your duties, you'll scrutinize passports, visas, and photos (although, let's be real, they're about as pixelated as a real-life human being standing in front of you). So, if you're up for protecting your country (and maybe dabbling in a bit of collusion with whoever you see fit), you'll find this game more amusing than a clown convention.

But be warned, this game isn't for the faint-hearted or those allergic to ink and paper cuts!\n\nAs an unsuspecting border control officer in the charmingly grim, Orwellian state of Arstotzka (try saying that five times fast), your job is to sift through an ever-growing pile of documents, cross-checking them with the precision of a hawk-eyed Sherlock Holmes. The aim? To catch those pesky rule-breakers trying to sneak their way into your proud nation. And let me tell you, folks, it's as thrilling as it sounds!\n\nEvery aspect of Papers, Please, from the drab, pixelated graphics to the haunting soundtrack, immerses you in the life of a humble paper-pusher. You'll find yourself developing a strange affection for your little checkpoint booth, despite the occasional terrorist attack. The characters you meet are just the icing on the cake - from the endearing, rule-bending Jorji Costava who just can\u2019t seem to get his papers right, to the shadowy figures of the rebel group EZIC.\n\nIn between checking passports and denying entry to dubious characters, you'll be making life-or-death decisions that will tug at your heartstrings. Do you let the mother with incorrect papers through to see her children or follow the rules? This is a game that truly tests your moral compass, often resulting in existential crises and bouts of hysterical laughter.\n\nPapers, Please is a paradox of a game. It's stressful, yet incredibly satisfying. It's bleak, yet oddly humorous. It's a game about bureaucracy that somehow manages to be wildly entertaining. It's the kind of game that will make you tell your friends, \"I can't go out tonight, I have to cross-check some immigration papers.\"\n\nSo, if you're up for the challenge, step into the shoes of Arstotzka's finest border control officer and join the thrilling world of passport-stamping action! Glory to Arstotzka!\n\nRemember, in Papers, Please, no visa stamp is too insignificant, no discrepancy too small, and no day complete without the reassuring thud of the denied stamp.\n\n10/10 would scrutinize documents again!", "timestamp_created": 1696375524, "timestamp_updated": 1696375524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147591457": {"recommendationid": "147591457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133777751", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1696371539}, "language": "english", "review": "not my type of game.\nfind errors in docs using rule book. rules keep adding. not fun.", "timestamp_created": 1696371681, "timestamp_updated": 1696371681, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403258651494979858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147589060": {"recommendationid": "147589060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327519211", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 896, "last_played": 1697512755}, "language": "english", "review": "Glory to Arstozka", "timestamp_created": 1696368214, "timestamp_updated": 1696368214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147588411": {"recommendationid": "147588411", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024036921", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 714, "last_played": 1696371673}, "language": "english", "review": "damn they do the wall thang", "timestamp_created": 1696367328, "timestamp_updated": 1696367328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147587736": {"recommendationid": "147587736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037195540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1697046845}, "language": "english", "review": "communism is fun", "timestamp_created": 1696366386, "timestamp_updated": 1696366386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147585728": {"recommendationid": "147585728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198448598579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 547, "last_played": 1696467380}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice chill game to pass the time with every now and then.", "timestamp_created": 1696363721, "timestamp_updated": 1696363721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147585515": {"recommendationid": "147585515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976059140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1696363559}, "language": "english", "review": "GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA.

attention to detail and occasional compassion. It looks simple and the graphics are deliberately course to give it a retro feel that makes you ironically even more involved.\n\nYou play a border guard on some East European border when the Warsaw pact was a thing and where your job is to allow people through who are supposed to come through and deny those who are not, according to rules set by your country each day. But sometimes you bend or break the rules to allow people in who ordinarily should not be allowed in.\n\nYour family is dependent on your paying the rent on the country-provided accommodation, paying for heat, food and medicine, You earn by letting as many people in, but you get fined if you let people in who shouldn't be allowed, or denying people who should be let in. Sometimes there are bribes  but should you accept them to feed your starving family?\n\nThe rules change daily and you have to pay close attention to what people look like, how tall they are, what they weigh, whether their documents are in order and what they say.\n\nIt's harder than it looks and more complex than the graphics indicate, and that's before you have to deal with terrorists and threats. Don't let your family die because you failed to do your job correctly.\n\nThis is a classic game.

"language": "english", "review": "Sinister, dystopian and highly prescient, Papers Please is a superb indie title, one that has a lot to say about border restrictions, self-interest and government corruption. You play an unnamed border guard in the authoritarian state of Arstotzka. It's your job to vet and stamp every individual attempting to enter the country, but your seemingly everyday role is complicated by ever-changing immigration rules, all the little details you can miss on entry documents, unexpected events and factions and the looming threat of imprisonment for slipping below the poverty line.\n\nThe simple interface has a lot of hidden depth; as you organise various documents and keep track of your border instructions, the game constantly preys on something we all possess: human error. In turn, this leads to a wide range of branching choices that take place over 31 days. Yes, you can choose to side with a hidden rebel faction that aims to overthrow your government, but that involves taking many risks, including the lives of your own family. Or you can be the most loyal and brutal enforcer of the bunch, abandoning any semblance of sympathy as you turn people away after taking their money or refuse to help those in real need.\n\nThe game is both unflinching and unrestrained in its depiction of totalitarian control and the way it layers so many choices into such a simple gameplay loop is brilliant. There's even one moment where you have to analyse vaccine certificates when a pandemic breaks out (Sound familiar?). Papers Please takes between 4 and 6 hours depending on how much you choose to experiment but it's a game that deserves your attention. Give it a go as soon as you can; you may find yourself questioning your own choices and morals on many occasions.", "timestamp_created": 1695926485, "timestamp_updated": 1696451871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7814788818359375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147216577": {"recommendationid": "147216577", "author": {"steamid": "76561199000365160", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1700253469}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is great i had a lot of fun its good game if you like playing job games", "timestamp_created": 1695915684, "timestamp_updated": 1695915684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147202028": {"recommendationid": "147202028", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152614119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 566, "last_played": 1695902994}, "language": "english", "review": "GLORY TO ARSTOZSKA!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1695903042, "timestamp_updated": 1695903042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147176479": {"recommendationid": "147176479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031067040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1777, "last_played": 1695868644}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Back to Pixelated Nostalgia:[/h1]\nFirst off, the game's crude graphics are like a blast from the past. They bring back that pixelated nostalgia that many of us grew up with. It's like a reminder of simpler times in gaming, and it's oddly charming.\n\n[h1]Complexity in Simplicity:[/h1]\nNow, the premise couldn't be simpler - you're in a checkpoint booth, stamping passports. Sounds like a breeze, right? Wrong! As the days roll by, the requirements get more absurdly complex and tedious. Your shifts may only last 7-8 minutes in real life, but trust me, it feels like a lifetime as you desperately try to avoid citations or worse. It's a game that keeps you on your toes and your mind racing.\n\n[h1]A True Gem with Achievements:[/h1]\nI can proudly say that I've managed to conquer all the achievements in Papers, Please. It's been a journey filled with frustration, triumph, and a whole lot of \"Why did I let that person through?!\" moments. But in the end, it's a true gem, and I've cherished every minute of it.\n\n[h1]A Little Less Replayability:[/h1]\nNow, there's an endless mode in there, but I'll admit it doesn't quite have the same appeal to me personally. After completing the game and its achievements, I felt like I'd seen all that glorious Arstotzka had to offer.\n\nIn conclusion, Papers, Please is a unique experience that combines crude simplicity with surprising complexity. It's a nostalgic trip down pixelated memory lane that keeps you on your toes and provides hours of gripping gameplay. If you haven't given it a try yet, I highly recommend diving into this intriguing world of bureaucracy and tough decisions.\n\nGLORY TO ARTSTOTZKA", "timestamp_created": 1695869125,

While you could just approve or deny everyone and call it a \"hard day's work\", the Arstotzkan Government will ensure that you're doing your job properly and allowing the right people through by penalizing you for messing up, preventing you from earning any credits for that particular person. The rules for processing people through the checkpoint start off simple, but gradually get more difficult as the game progresses and you have more documents to sift through. Thankfully a handy rulebook and inspection system will assist you in getting the right people in and keeping the wrong people out, so as long as you follow the rules, you'll be paid more than enough money to provide for your family and keep them alive and well.\nThings aren't all black and white, though. Throughout the game you'll be visited by members of a shadow organization, a likable smuggler with a love for Arstotzka, and others that make the approve/deny process more difficult than it typically is.\n\nAll in all, Papers, Please is a quality Indie title that is a must-have in anyone's Steam library. The game even has a cool little cameo in Please, Don't Touch Anything (Which I've previously reviewed), so you know this game made its impact in the Indie scene. Even 10 years later, this game is still a unique experience that I'd highly recommend to anyone with $10 to spend.", "timestamp_created": 1695587600, "timestamp_updated": 1695587600, "voted_up": true,

It's a dull job in a fictional, \"cold\" world with minimal aesthetics, strong dystopian atmosphere and oppressive music. Yet, the constant evolving gameplay mechanics, unexpected events, clever twists and most importantly the serious ethical dilemmas that you face transform its repetitiveness into a thrilling experience. \"Papers Please\" is politically cruel, but realistic enough to help people understand things that deliberately avoid.\n\n\nManometer: 9/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- Cool, minimal aesthetics with pixel graphics and hazy chromatic palette. The nicely designed booth, using only the necessary details, manages to create a sterile, strict, bureaucratic world.\n- Strong, dystopian and depressing atmosphere that will get you immersed right from the beginning.\n- Great gameplay concept and clever mechanics. The way that you try to fit all the papers inside the small booth, the regulations that you have to follow, the warnings that you receive transform a rather boring procedure into anxious duty. Also, the gameplay evolves. New rules, obligations, tools and unexpected events break the repetitiveness, giving the game constantly new interest.\n- It's political, opening up important social issues like immigration, borders' walls that divide people, power games between governments. Most importantly it makes you think about your personal role in a society or in your work. It puts you in front of some serious ethical dilemmas and you have to choose between following orders and common logic, between safety and putting your family into danger for the common good, between fair and unfair. You can try to change everything or just do your job. Everything it's up to you.\n- Great story with a lot of different endings. Some are really unexpected. There is plenty of replay value, if you wanna see them all. It's also nice that each alternative decision creates a new branch in the storyline so you don't have to play it from the beginning if you wanna try different things at some point.\n- Amazing, minimal, repetitive, almost oppressive music that fits perfectly to the concept and the overall vibes.\n- Sounds are simplistic but manage to create a raw, disturbing audio environment.\n- Smooth, responsive controls. Everything works fast and precisely.\n\nThe bad\n- A lot of the ethical dilemmas that puts you into get weaken by the design and the shallowness of the people that you have in front of you. They look flat, non expressive, they barely talk, they don't have a backstory. It's hard to treat them like real people or feel their agony.

The game presents a perfectly executed cold, harsh atmosphere. You barely see people overly happy or joyful, there's no music during gameplay and when there [b][i] is [/i][/b] music, it's almost never relaxing or calming. The colors are muddy and dark, furthermore, the pixel art has a sense of roughness, a complete departure from other pixel art games I am aware of. Whenever you interact with most people, there is no sense of camaraderie. You almost always feel alien to others, like they are just getting in the way of you being able to work properly.\n\nThe gameplay encapsulates this sense of dread, while also providing a unique twist to the puzzle/simulation genre. You go to work as a border control employee, which may sound boring on the surface, but there are several well done methods to keeping the playing experience fresh and entertaining throughout. You can find many wildly varying encounters, from a family asking to be let in even though they have wrong papers, to defusing a poorly made bomb. This comes with the fact that you have manage your expenses and keep your family alive with [b] your [/b] salary. Your performance not only affects you, but the people [i] around [/i] you too, further adding to the stress.\n\nHere is where I do agree with the main complaint, that being that the game is repetitive. However, that repetitiveness adds to the dystopian feel of the game. You are not [i] meant [/i] to enjoy going to work every day, doing the same thing over and over again, not to mention the amount of danger which you may encounter.\n\nNormally, you are required to follow orders strictly. But the game shines in moments where you are actively or sadly working against them. You have a suprising amount of control over not only yourself and your family, but the environment around you. You feel power over the people simply wanting to pass, but are almost powerless to the people ruling over you.\n\nNow, why did I title this review like that? Doesn't this game actively work against the player via stress, overwhelmingness and more? Well, that's because it has a sense of mastery and doing well and good (there's a difference between those two) pays off [b] heavily[/b], sometimes literally. You can memorize the best way of dealing with the overload of papers, you can find out patterns, and more. You progress not only in knowledge, but in speed as well.\nAfter 100% completion, I feel satisfied and recommend to anyone looking for new adventures in gaming.\n\n[b] To sum it up, this game is a perfectly executed dark, thrilling experience, with tons of detail and a challenging but satisfying learning curve.

He must choose who can be allowed in and who is not allowed to enter the territory. The fact is that the terrorists will try to break through by any means. Starting with forgery of documents and ending with a forceful break through the fence. Without a doubt the graphics are executed at a very poor level. But it adds a kind of zest to the gameplay for me. Reminds me of the days of d Dandy and Sega to be honest.\n\nThe game is difficult. In the first days you only check your passport. But then a bunch of documents are added fingerprints and so on. Develops attention to detail. After all it is necessary to analyze whether the code of the city in which the person was born (written in the passport) corresponds to the code from the directory. If it does not match then the passport is fake. It won't pass.\n\nIn addition, you need to act quickly. Your salary depends on the number of correctly passed people. We need to feed our family. You work well you move to higher-class housing. You work poorly there is no money for medicines a family member is dying.\n\nThere are a lot of endings in the game. I couldn't get to the very end. I didn't have enough willpower but I saw a few pieces. Your fate and family members depend on daily decisions.\nGot a bribe, got burned - shoot!\n\nIn general there are a lot of little things in the game that add variety to the process. Plus your decisions affect the further development of the situation.\n\nI remember one interesting character. From the very first day a homeless man came to the border. The first time he had a passport which he drew in a crooked handwriting on a piece of paper. Then every two or three days he appeared again, but the quality of the document improved. When it got to the point that he had a clean legal passport I still wouldn't let him in on principle. I know he's such a bastard he always wanted to get into my country, Arstotzka.\n\nOf course this game will not go to everyone.

Her ID card said she was only 161 cm.  I denied her and got fined for it b/c I was supposed to let her through.\n\nI even highlighted the discrepancies and interrogated them about these discrepancies.  They gave me obvious bullshit.  Every run is just a waste of time due to shit like this.  This is the ONLY gameplay mechanic, and it doesn't even work properly.  Game sucks, sorry.\n\nThere's also all kinds of stupid things they get you on.  I get fined for letting ppl through b/c their ID numbers are invalid or the issuing city is invalid.  You're supposed to memorize ID numbers and which cities issue each kind of ID card?  Are you joking?  There are like 8 different nations and each of them has multiple cities that issue IDs, nobody's memorizing that crap.  Oh yeah, and the font is ATROCIOUS, so it's hard to read names like Oli Aaraestraan, for example - and when you DO compare the name on his passport to the name on his entry permit, the \"different\" name will be Oli Aarasrtaan, with only 1 letter changed/removed.  So you can't just glance, you have to scrutinize and double check everything or you'll be unfairly punished.\n\n....Yet, for some reason I can't explain at all, I want to keep playing this ID-checking simulator.  I tell myself maybe I just didn't get to the point where I'm supposed to check the things that I checked, and that's why I was fined.  Maybe in a few weeks, I'll need to start making sure height matches?  It still probably sucks even if these issues were fixed.  Look at the positive reviews - they barely played the game.  I guess it's cool to pretend to like this one though?\n\nEDIT:  Haha, the other reviews talking about \"moral choices\" are really funny.  Imagine killing people in other videogames and thinking twice about simply doing what you're supposed to do in this game.  \"Oh you don't have a passport, but you need to get in to see your husband, really?  Hmm, this is a real tough one.  I don't want to get fined and lose the game, but I'm really attached to this ugly group of low res pixels that I just met... hmm... what to do?!\"  Yeah right, lmao.

You have to be quick but extremely vigilant about checking papers otherwise you will be penalized (after some warnings). You are desperately trying to get paid just enough to keep your family alive. You end up having to turn to other means in order to make ends hardly meet.

I bought this back in 2014 and never reviewed it?? Oh man, my apologies.\n\nYou play as a Soviet-era border control agent checking IDs and other government paperwork. If you think that coming home from a long day of work only to play a work simulator is crazy, you are correct. However, despite no longer being on anyone's clock, you can still earn a smile with this game that will make you think and test your analytical skill.\n\nIt's really a strange phenomenon: The thought that checking IDs all day could somehow make a satisfying game is outrageous but hey, it happened! \n\nTIP: The first couple days are a cinch. Well, the first day is kinda locked in (you'll see) but the nect couple of days are when you can make your most money that will carry you for the rest of the game. Here's how: since the only thing you're looking for is expiration dates, just keep the current day in mind (Nov 24, 1982 I think). Then, immediately glance at the IDs expiration and if it's after, Green stamp, before, Red stamp.\n\nYOU DO NOT HAVE TO VERIFY!\n\nThe verification mode is only for you (mostly as I believe it's needed to trigger something later) to use as a tool. You don't actually need to prove if their documents are legit or not! So zip through ASAP and you'll end the day with a little extra dough.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!", "timestamp_created": 1692661155, "timestamp_updated": 1692661155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Papers, Please is an unique game with unique mechanics: you are choosen via a job lottery to work as a border inspector. What starts out easy (just checking the passport and approving/rejecting it) will quickly become more complex, with work passes, access permits, ID cards to name a few. You will be called upon to verify many elements to prevent people crossing the border with false documents or introducing explosives and drugs.\n\nPapers, Please is not \"just\" a document management sim:\n\n- Family management: the money from your pay will be used to guarantee food and heating for your family members, therefore receiving work penalties will affect their health because you will not be able to meet the expenses.\n- Choices and consequences really matter and will lead to various ramifications and endings of the story.\n- Moral system: spouses are running away from a tyrannical state. The husband with the documents in order asks you to let his wife pass, who will arrive immediately after him, but she has incomplete documents. What will you do? Will you let her pass, getting the penalty that will put you in difficulty or will you carry out your work according to the rules and therefore refusing her documents?\n- Great variety of game events, situations and memorable characters that I don't want to spoil but leave you the pleasure of discovering as you progress through the story.\n\nI hope that developer Lucas Pope will introduce as update or DLC an endless story mode in the future, with randomized and procedurally generated events to spice things up once the main story is over (an endless mode where you will have to manage as many documents as possible within a limited time or without receiving warnings is already available). I know, I know, the game is ten years old now, but never say never :D\n\nI also recommend to see \"Papers, Please the short film\" on youtube, it beautifully manages to capture the atmosphere of the game and do it justice, albeit with a 10 minutes playing time.\n\nGlory to Arstotzka!", "timestamp_created": 1692043155, "timestamp_updated": 1692043155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767063140869140625", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144205529": {"recommendationid": "144205529", "author": {"steamid": "76561199382373585", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 398, "last_played": 1697037958}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game with a good price for the amount of content there is, I love the game play and the music is great 10/10 .

wc? Would it be clean enough for me to adventure in? What should I have for dinner? Did I feed the fish?\n\nSo I went to the store page, and stumbled across this gem. I thought I could use some simulator to escape my real life HARD decisions and relax.\nBut\u2026 Oh boy! I didn't know what I was really getting into!\nSo here I am preoccupied now about my month wage, if it could be enough to feed my now \nvirtual family, struggling with the cold environment. Making decisions as whether to buy food for everyone entrusted to me, or leave the mother-in-law I didn\u2019t want, to go into a little famine because my kid should take priority or that would be so inhumane\u2026\nAlso wanted to keep my soul intact, I didn't want a dictatorship to run the house, yeah the kid loved me and even drew me a few things with the expensive crayons I bought him as a birthday present but well\u2026 That led to turning off the heater as I couldn't afford more bills piling up. A bad choice indeed as even virtual humans can get a cold or even get constipated, with only me as the not so mighty head of the family trying to work harder and faster in god forsaken borders so I could afford the treatment desperately needed.\nThose crayons almost made me step into bankruptcy!\nBut in times of need someone can extend a \u201cfriendly\u201d hand at you! Meaning some extra income for your hardships to end, and greed over the next amount of cash of dubious origin.\nYeah, that was most of the mistakes every human could make. Or won't they?\nI can only say I tried to be a good citizen, not to take a peek over more than necessary in the frisks and try to stay glued to the law at all times\u2026 Keyword: Try!\n\nYeah I forgot to mention I sold my soul for money to a rebel cause that I am still not convinced if it was so much of a cause or just terrorism\u2026I'm still dwelling about that!\nMy only hope is if God will have mercy on me\u2026 Because this game surely won\u2019t!\n\nPlease do not abandon the queue and don't wander around!

The game is set in Arstotzka, a fictional country that is struggling to maintain its borders in the midst of a civil war. As an inspector, it is your job to scrutinize the documents of incoming travelers and deny entry to those who do not have the proper paperwork.\n\nThe game is simple to play but difficult to master. You must carefully examine each document, looking for any discrepancies. If you make a mistake, you could let a dangerous criminal into the country or deny entry to a legitimate citizen. The stakes are high, and the pressure is intense.\n\nBut Papers, Please is not just about making split-second decisions. It is also about the human cost of border control. As you play the game, you will see the impact that your decisions have on the lives of the people you interact with. You will meet families who are separated, lovers who are denied the right to be together, and refugees who are desperate to escape violence.\n\nPapers, Please is a game that will stay with you long after you finish playing it. It is a game that will make you think about the nature of borders, the meaning of freedom, and the importance of human compassion.\n\nHere are some of the things that make Papers, Please a thoughtful, provoking, and emotionally charged game:\n\nThe game's setting is a dystopian future where the world is divided into small, warring nations. This setting creates a sense of tension and uncertainty, which is heightened by the game's focus on border control.\nThe game's gameplay is simple but challenging. Players must carefully examine each document, looking for any discrepancies. This can be a difficult task, especially when the documents are in a foreign language or when the people presenting them are nervous or hostile.\n\nThe game's characters are well-developed and sympathetic. Players will meet families who are separated, lovers who are denied the right to be together, and refugees who are desperate to escape violence. These characters make the game's difficult decisions more personal and emotionally charged.\n\nThe game's ending is ambiguous and thought-provoking. Players are left to decide for themselves whether they have made the right choices and whether their actions have made a difference.\n\nPapers, Please is a game that is both challenging and rewarding. It is a game that will make you think about the world in a new way. If you are looking for a game that is thought-provoking, emotionally charged, and stunning, then Papers, Please is definitely worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1691694966, "timestamp_updated":

Dark colors convey the oppressive atmosphere of the character's life and job.\n\nSound effects and music are very limited, which again, immerses you in this oppressive world.\n\nGameplay is very addictive. It starts easy with a few things to consider, and progressively adds more elements and complexity, which is great. At first, you may think that the task is easy, accept everyone who meets the requirements, reject everyone who doesn't. But soon enough, you realize that it is not that easy, since there are many stories and emotions that make decisions much more difficult. In addition, not only the lives of the people you accept/reject come into play, but those of your family and your own. Besides your job, you must keep your family fed, warm and safe. Every decision will also influence the amount of money you get. So, there's a lot to consider and not a lot of time. You will be faced with a lot of morally complex choices. Although the gameplay gets a bit repetitive, when you manage to discover the little details that ease the checking process, you will master the game and become addicted to the gameplay loop.\n\nThe story is good, a bit sad and depressing, but fits perfectly with the tone and atmosphere of the game. There are multiple endings to discover.\n\nBesides the story, there's an endless mode with different options to challenge yourself.\n\nIn short, very strange and immersive game, expect to do a lot of thinking and making a lot of morally complex decisions.
