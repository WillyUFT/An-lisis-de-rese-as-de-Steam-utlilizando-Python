But on the other hand this means that the storytelling is entirely visual, and it really adds to the sense of exploration and discovery. Plus, the hand-drawn art style is very nice and definitely fits the vibe of the setting and storyline, both of which unfold gradually as you progress.\n\nSo even though it can be somewhat infuriating when you accidentally and repeatedly catapult yourself directly into an electrified barrier or laser, or fall out of a 20-story tree just as you reach the top, or miss your platform in the vortex cylinder and have to float all the way back up again... it's definitely still enjoyable, and all the different ways that the simple positive-negative basis is used to create puzzles, obstacles, and transportation are pretty neat. \n\nI'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys platforming games, though you'll probably have a lot more fun with it if you're okay with having to think strategically and don't mind figuring it all out as you go along.\n\n\n(And I reckon if Tesla were around for video games, he'd have loved it.

(Such was life in Teslagrad -- to be sung to Billy Joel's \"Leningrad.\")\n\nControls are few, with WASD for look/movement, space for jump, and arrow keys for abilities that you earn incrementally. Even in 2D, I'm not a strong navigator. (To this day, you can still catch me checking which hand's index finger and thumb make an L, because I get left and right confused sometimes.) Left and right arrow keys are magnetic polarity in this game, with one as blue and the other as red. On top of this, another arrow key toggles the magnet's mode (i.e., laser that player shoots or aura that surrounds player). So while the controls are few, I would say they're not necessarily simple: Controls coordination is part of solving the puzzles in this game.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are challenging and engaging. I'm not a strong electromagnetism thinker -- think I got less on an exit exam for my Physics II class than I did on an entry exam; it can be pretty counterintuitive stuff.  But the game's friendly \"per-room\" auto-save/checkpoint system makes it easy to experiment with the world and your character's abilities in order to find a solution. A majority of the game takes place inside a massive dungeon with a long shaft that about 100-ish rooms branch in and out of. (There may be more rooms than I think, because I believe rooms show up on the map only after you've visited them.) Progress for the most part is linear, but you can refer to the map to remind yourself how to get back to a room if you need to. And I needed to, to pick up some achievements, which (unfortunately, I felt) do not appear on the map.\n\nAchievements appear in the game as battery/scroll tokens that are \"off the beaten path\" of the game's typical linear progression. [spoiler]It's worth your while to collect them as you find them, though, because you need some to unlock the last part of the game.[/spoiler] This playthrough I wanted to play to the game's end, but I would play it again to collect all its achievements.\n\nAchievements also serve as one of the game's mechanisms for developing the story. Think I got this one about the same time as (and maybe even because of) [i]Limbo[/i] and [i]Inside[/i], which also have wordless/visual story development. For each achievement you collect, you get a card that unveils a little bit more about the story. These cards can be viewed together (in a screen near the map) to make a mosaic outline of the story. Story dev also happens in-game in several \"puppet play\" rooms that you come across while navigating the dungeon. I've only collected about half the achievements, but from what I could tell, the story is that [spoiler]your character belongs to a group of magicians who helped a king come into power by helping him succeed in battle, but they are now being hunted down because they refused to help him in other battles.[/spoiler]\n\nGame mood alternates between somber and cartoonish. The drawing of the playable character reminds me a lot of \"Calvin and Hobbes,\" some assets reminded me of [i]Rayman[/i], and the backgrounds look like they could have come from a classic Disney film. I thought I picked up a few cultural references too, to [i]Ghostbusters[/i], for example. Sound effects are well-chosen and I didn't mind hearing them repeatedly in rooms I had a hard time in. The soundtrack was good, not at all distracting, and sometimes very effective at getting you pumped up to tackle a puzzle/boss.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me in the credits is just how many alpha playtesters the game had. (Especially compared to the rest of the crew!) And it showed! I don't think I ran into any bugs in this game.\n\nI expected this one to take 5-7 hours but it took me about twice that. (I have 13 hours total, but one or two of those was from a partial playthrough a while back.) I may have been able to bring it down a little by collecting achievements as I saw them, because you have to play room(s) over if you don't get the achievement the first time round.\n", "timestamp_created": 1664083267, "timestamp_updated": 1664083267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122610587": {"recommendationid": "122610587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967449126", "num_games_owned": 2314, "num_reviews": 337, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 179, "last_played": 1663814598}, "language": "english", "review": "Teslagrad is the kind of game I wish Steam had a neutral option for in addition to thumbs up & down. I'll give it a thumbs up because while some aspects made me hate the game, most of my time was still enjoyable.\n\nThis is a puzzle/platformer with the emphasis more on the platformer. There aren't many enemies in the game and you don't get a way to attack until late in the game so you'll have to simply avoid most of them. This is a puzzle/platformer that emphasizes on collecting scrolls, the game's collectibles. The puzzles aren't overly difficult but some of the platforming sections can be. At times it's just challenging platforming but the controls can feel a bit floaty at other times and as a result, makes the mechanics feel like the problem, not your skill. Fortunately, those instances aren't too common.\n\nThe world is beautiful and it's fun to explore. After you complete climbing the tower which will probably take you 2-3 hours, you'll open up a lower floor. You need 15 scrolls to open that floor up so you can get to exploring, see which areas you missed, and grab some more scrolls to open up the path. There is a \"true\" ending after finding all 36 scrolls but after playing, I don't really have much desire to find it.\n\nFor the issues, some of the checkpoints are so poorly placed. Sometimes it takes time to set up a slow and tedious puzzle to attempt your jump. If that jump is very difficult to perform, you're going to be sitting there setting it up over and over again, taking your time because of how slow the game mechanics can be. One instance that was very tedious was late in the game when you had to roll a ball with your magnetic cloak. Rolling it off the platform above you took about 5-10 seconds because of how slow the ball rolls. That doesn't seem long, right? Well that jump afterwards was very difficult. I probably spent 5 minutes attempting that jump with 3-4 minues of that time just watching that ball roll on every reset.\n\nSome of the bosses were fun while others weren't. Particularly the boss that shoots the energy orbs at you. It just felt like total RNG to attack the boss because you had to pull the energy balls back at the boss with your magnetic cloak and they were very hard to aim. They also only lasted a few seconds each so sometimes they'd disappear right before hitting the boss. The last boss was also just frustrating and unfun with how quickly his attacks move with your dash cooldown sometimes getting you killed. One of the tedious parts of the boss fights was that you had to hit them 3 times each to defeat them. You'd have to avoid their attacks, sometimes up to a minute or two before you get an opportunity to attack, then you can hit them once. The problem is that for every boss, the first two attacks were always easy. The last attack was hard to hit without dying. So you'd find yourself repeating the same 2-3 minutes for the start of the boss fight and if you're having trouble on the third, die, and repeat, sitting there getting frustrated and bored.\n\nFortunately, there are 5 bosses and only 2 of them really felt tedious and unfun. The general exploration and puzzle solving was fun and I did enjoy most of my time in the game. It's just after completing it, while not seeing the \"true\" ending, I just have no desire to keep going to see it. Beating the game with the minimal scrolls collected only took about 15 minutes and the game wasn't bad in that time but not bad isn't good enough for me to want more. \n\nThe game is pretty interesting if you want to pick it up on a sale or see it in a bundle if you're interested in puzzle/platformers.

Inside he discovers series of inventions, starting with a pair of gloves, that allows him to manipulate magnetic fields. As the tower is filled with various challenges centered around magnetism, he works his way up to discover the truth behind the invasion and find a way to stop it.\n\nAs you can guess based on the above description, the plot is a standard fare for video games: there\u2019s a bad guy, stop the bad guy. However, the story exceeds in the way it\u2019s told. There\u2019s no dialogues throughout the game. Instead at specific sections of the tower you\u2019ll enter various theaters where puppet shows are played, revealing bit by bit the backstory; you can either watch or ignore them. Furthermore, you can collect various scrolls hidden around the tower that provide additional info. The way storytelling is handled means the player not only can completely ignore the plot if they\u2019re not interested, but can also adjust their own difficulty to an extend as the scrolls often require solving more challenging puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of the puzzles, they\u2019re brilliantly designed and challenging. This isn\u2019t one of those games where you can leisurely work on the solution. No, the protagonist dies in one hit, so between rare enemies and numerous hazards you need to always think and act fast. If that sounds like a recipe for a frustrating experience, it isn\u2019t. Tight controls, quick pace and checkpoint at the start of each room means that in the case of death - and those will happen regularly - you never loose much progress.\n\nYou can\u2019t attack regular enemies until you pick up you final upgrade, but thankfully they\u2019re fairly scarce. However, you can and have to fight during boss battles. Yes, there are boss battles. I wish more indie games featured those.\n\nThe bosses work as a check-up on how well you mastered abilities at your disposal like boss fights in all well-designed metroidvania titles; whatever is the newest tool you acquired, that\u2019s what you need to use against each baddy. And they\u2019re tricky too, forcing you to learn their pattern before you can defeat them.\n\nHard but fair. Beautiful and creative.

It is at times a charming platformer, with nice artstyle and atmosphere, which can suddenly become tedious and frustrating for no reason. \n\nFirst the good points - it runs natively on Linux, I was able to get 144fps without much strain.  The atmosphere and art of the world is quite mysterious and is nice to look at.  The mechanics that are added open up new areas of the map as you gain new abilities.  There are puzzles to progress through areas, and they are fun to figure out.  Some are well done and clever, some feel shoddy and chancey.  \n\nBut where the game lets you down: The mechanics are added, sure, but the game does a poor job (almost zero job) of introducing them and telling you how they'd be used.  One mechanic didn't even work as it had no buttons mapped to it... I had to go into the controls and map a button to it to use it.  So weird. \n\nAlso, there are sudden difficulty spikes in the middle of normal areas which become very tedious very quickly. That isn't helped by somewhat [i]intermittently[/i] buggy mechanics. Certain button presses would suddenly not register, or a blink would not happen due to a very slightly angled part of the floor. This was extremely frustrating at critical moments during boss fights when a 'thing' ought to be happening, but didn't.  \n\nIn most games there exists the concept of collectibles, which are almost always optional.  This game has those too, except you find out at the end that 15 of those are mandatory.

Given that there's instant death, when I know beat every step and have the skill to do it, that's when a boss should end. Instead you get bosses where they do the same 4-5 step phase 5 times in a row, all exactly the same (or sometimes slightly faster) and if you're slightly out of line once you go back to the beginning. I figured out the puzzle, I even solved it 4 times, but I'm still repeatedly sent back.

First boss fight, while easy, made me wonder if the game was going to get way harder. This was primarily due to the one hit kill mechanic in the game. The next few were easy. Final was a bit of a challenge, but overall, not a difficult game. Took me about 6 hours to 100% with looking up a few scrolls.\n\nI like the idea of this kid becoming a badass with science gadgets. A very non-traditional hero. The story was interesting and I like the way the scrolls provided a bit of additional information.\n\nThe music in this game is good.

Button tutorials were not clear when getting new items. And my cloak buttons were not bound by default and I had to turn them on. My controller works seamlessly with 99% of games without having to do anything, so I was kind of surprised. Only joystick or directional pads can be enabled, so I had to manually override the joystick.\n\nOverall, this is a great game and worth picking up if you like platformers with very light puzzle solving and light metroidvania-style gearing up.

Controls are a little clunky and unreliable in certain situations. To discuss problems with the game, I must mention spoilers, so proceed with caution. \n\n[spoiler] This is one of those games that isn't really that long (which is fine by me for a puzzle-oriented indie game), but has difficulty spikes every so often, which make a blind playthrough longer. I know a number of  games of similar style that make you do some fetch quest at the end to force you to go back through the various areas and explore, but I find that this just breaks up the flow of games, especially in Teslagrad, since the map itself is fairly linear, and doesn't really offer that much in terms of exploration because of its puzzle-oriented gameplay. The 15 required scrolls feel pretty unnecessary, other than to show off how the beams and cloak are OP in some puzzles. Honestly, the game could be better off with just the optional 36 scrolls and the alternate ending (but I found that this extra ending wasn't a great payoff for going the extra several miles, especially since I didn't really understand the significance of it, but that could be because I didn't watch most of the stage puppet show things throughout the game). Boss fights feel fairly balanced, except the last two kind of seemed like massive difficulty spikes when doing a blind playthrough. Once I figured out stuff, these fights were almost completely muscle memory, but the difficulty was compounded by unnecessary issues that are mentioned below. So far I mentioned subjective matters, so I will switch gears to some more objective issues.\n\nThere are two major problems I have with this game: 1) when dashing across a hazardous (but 'dashable') barrier, while moving left or right and/or jumping, sometimes the game lets you live, but other times it just kills you. In either case, I can see that the character clears the barrier, and yet is still burned to crisp for no reason (this is especially common in the last two battles). This makes the maneuver risky, since the outcome is inconsistent. This is why I avoid jumping or pressing left or right when dashing (it guarantees survival across barriers if you time things correctly). But this strategy has its own problems, because it limits the time you have to move off of the ground in the final boss fight with the king, a battle in which it is critical to move swiftly to avoid crown beams and the spinning swords, which occupy most of the arena. 2) Speaking of the king fight, today I encountered a glitch in which the crown got stuck on the left side of the arena with its beam active (and the game got soft-locked), so I spent some time dodging the swords and looking at the king's frozen angry expression before offing myself on the beam to restart the fight. [/spoiler]\n\nMake no mistake, I like this game because it is a really creative idea that sells itself well throughout the first half of the game. I have been meaning to finish it in the past several years because I felt that it deserved some attention. I found similar technical issues in other indie games such as Super Daryl Deluxe, which had some glitches that diminished my overall perception of the game (coincidentally, one of them was also a soft-lock in the final fight). These are inspiring and creative indie games that could use another patch or two. I am not aware of any newer releases from your team, but I imagine I will take a look at more of your work in the coming days, since this game managed to grab my attention. I hope this somehow helps, even though it has been a number of years since the initial release.

I started playing it on a whim, and keep coming back to it to experience its beauty another time. In more detail (some minor spoilers ahead):\n\n1. )   The bosses have a major learning curve (one boss comes to mind that has 3 unique phases and no \"checkpoints\" during the fight). In my experience, if you are able to complete a boss fight, you usually have learned the boss's moves and phases to a degree that the boss won't pose too much of a problem. I am not exceptionally gifted at platformers, but the fact that one specific boss [spoiler](Guerickes Orb)[/spoiler] took me more than 2 hours out of my 10 hour initial run speaks to the difficulty of the boss fights. The payoff is an incredible feeling of satisfaction once you manage to defeat each boss.\n\n2.)   Although the one-hit-kill mechanic is certainly controversial and makes the boss fights exceptionally difficult, in my opinion it makes Teslagrad more unique in a better way. This mechanic forces you to plan your course of action, whether you are dodging electified boxes flying through the air or attempting to get a Volt Walker into one of those big, lavaproof robots. This is exemplified by Grues, which appear as the sole aggressive enemy in the game. As you cannot withstand even one hit from a Grue, you are instead required to avoid them, which contrasts with many Metroidvania games I've played. This gives the silent protagonist a different playstyle.\n\n3.)   Teslagrad's gimmick is magnetism, and it does an excellent job of theming platforming and its classic and new Metroidvania abilities in a magnetic steampunk feel. In no way is the magnetism mechanic perfect, but it is unique, well implemented, and exceptionally enjoyable. The magnet-fueled cloak ability is by far my favorite of all four abilities, both because of its role in the gameplay and that it is very enjoyable to use. \n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend Teslagrad more to anyone who likes unique, enjoyable platformers. Its story, told mostly through wordless puppet shows, is a delight on the surface and quite fascinating if one enjoys digging into game lore. The one must-do in my opinion is collecting all the scrolls, as the process of backtracking to collect all your missed scrolls gives you an appreciation for the mechanics of the game. Though your journey through the Tesla Tower is arduous at times, it is absolutely worth it for the joy that this game brings. \n\nTLDR Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1624825780, "timestamp_updated": 1624825780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94475451": {"recommendationid": "94475451", "author": {"steamid": "76561199176591923", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1687662786}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a wonderful game from beginning to end.", "timestamp_created": 1624770240, "timestamp_updated": 1624770240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94257846": {"recommendationid": "94257846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991952668", "num_games_owned": 4741, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1624521277}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolute masterpiece and a wonderful romp from start to finish, Teslagrad's unique setting and a \"show, not tell\" approach to lore and storytelling will captivate and engage you.

Perfect, even if the collectables are minimal and very tricky. (Wordless story? Eww. Words are good. But fine, to each their own; they convey the story in their own way, and I suppose this approach saves on localisation costs.)\n\nBut wow, this game is so unforgiving. Everyone else has mentioned the boss battles, and yes, you will die 20, 40, 100 times on some of the bosses. The lack of any concept of hit points is certainly baffling. \n\nBut it's not just the bosses that are ridiculous. There's plenty of other platforming sections which are just super hard and require absurd precision. You need to make a jump, holding right all the time; set your polarity to blue at the start of it, less than halfway through switch your polarity to red, then use ability 2 less than a second into the jump. You need to do a magnetic version of log rolling, while doing magnetism-assisted power jumps then use an ability to skip through instant death electricity beams; and you need to do the whole thing fast.\n\nI love platform puzzlers, and this is... enough of a platform puzzler for me to play to somewhere past the third boss... but it is more of a precision platformer than a platform puzzler, and that's what doomed it for me.\n\nRecommended if you have a controller, superb platforming reflexes, a taste for puzzles, and the patience to put up with dying hundreds of times. Otherwise... it has some lovely ideas, and the puzzles are good, but it's more frustration than it's worth to get from \"I know what to do\" to \"I [i]finally[/i] managed to do it\".", "timestamp_created": 1618435412, "timestamp_updated": 1618435412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620863974094390869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89735607": {"recommendationid": "89735607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010484104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 289, "last_played": 1617584609}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1617580084, "timestamp_updated": 1617580084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89515625": {"recommendationid": "89515625", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066715917", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 549, "last_played": 1659291565}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a platformer game.

Of course, that means you won't exactly be enjoying the sights, as you flee for your young life from the soldiers that suddenly come breaking down your door. The long abandoned great tower that once was home to the electricity wielding Teslamancers may seem like a sanctuary, but it has its own secrets and dangers...but also rewards for those able to overcome its challenges. \n\nMerging two-dimensional platforming with  logical conundrums, Teslagrad presents itself as a \"puzzlevania\", and while nothing in it is particularly unique or revolutionary, it does present a mostly enjoyable experience in a well-done hand-drawn animated style. But the key word in that sentence is mostly. \n\nOn the positive, I genuinely enjoyed the puzzle side of Teslagrad. Built around the simple principles of magnetism, using polarity flips to attract or repel not only blocks, but also yourself, there are a surprising variety of challenges with an almost perfect learning curve, as though I did not need to use a guide to progress through the story or find all 36 achievement scrolls, I definitely had to hunt and think to earn them all. So this half - which I would consider the actual soul of the game - is well done.\n\nI do have to say though, the store description is a bit misleading about the other half. I bought Teslagrad expecting a metroidvania, but it really isn't one. Yes, it has room to room progression, and earned ability upgrades that alter gameplay, but it is highly linear, and the very limited number of abilities are hard-locked into that line. The only time I ever left linear progression was to backtrack for achievement scrolls that were unattainable until some ability was added, but that isn't free roaming exploration, it's just a \"ha ha, you're going to have to come back for this later\". Furthermore, for most of the game you have no way to attack or fight enemies. Instead, the puzzles are accented, and often directly combined, with a medium-difficulty hardcore platformer, where all you can do is dodge hazards and/or enemies and failure to execute perfect mechanics leads to instant death, as your character cannot take even a single hit. This means that in addition to figuring out the steps to complete the puzzle, you then need to actually move through the room, often with little margin for error. You get infinite lives, and respawn at the start of the room you died in, so usually this isn't horribly punishing. But for boss fights - particularly the last two - this does become a recipe for frustration, as the only way to learn the attack patterns is to succumb to them, over and over and over until you actually learn what to expect. This isn't just about reflexes, in some instances you need to learn where to be at certain times to not be caught in a trap that is unavoidable by the time it can be seen. Personally, I found these last two bosses \"cheap\", and more frustrating than fun, and without much sense of accomplishment once I cleared them. Hitboxes often feel off, amplifying these issues, and in general, I don't think this kind of unforgiving precision fits in what is (and should be) at its core primarily a puzzle game. \n\nSo in short, not the greatest game I've ever played, but worth a run through at the asking price. Just know that if you're not both willing and able to execute the mechanics, you may end up having to ragequit.", "timestamp_created": 1597984698, "timestamp_updated": 1598294351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529703021049499512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74626675": {"recommendationid": "74626675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083942593", "num_games_owned": 1411, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1597895633}, "language": "english", "review": "I really tried to give this game a solid chance. Played it the whole way through, got every achievement. It just wasn't worth it. Honestly, for the first half, I was going to give it a fair \"meh\" leaning more into the negative side of things. The last few puzzles and bits threw it so hard into \"god I despise this game\" that it was honestly shocking.\n\nA big problem with this game is that it is, obviously, a physics game due to how it uses magnets, and the physics are...finicky. Really finicky. There were many times where I thought something absolutely should've been fine to work, and instead I sat there trying five-ten times just to get one thing done because the physics were having none of that. \n\nAnd oh my god, it did not pay off to have a mini-teleport effect in the game. It's quite annoying because of the way it functions. It essentially allows you to hop forward a few steps, which is usually fine...except it doesn't tell you where it's putting you, which can lead to you ever so slightly under/overshooting things. This wouldn't be an incredibly big issue in my mind if it weren't for how precise the game expects you to be in some parts. There is one puzzle in particular (which is actually the puzzle that drove me to change my rating to negative!) that detracts SO MUCH from the experience because of the lack of clear visibility on where the teleport is going that I couldn't help but be surprised that the creators genuinely thought the puzzle was a good idea to put into the game. For those of you who already played the game and are reading this out of boredom or otherwise, yes, I am talking about the electric barrier \"maze.\"\n\nI also, generally speaking, think the game turned more from interesting puzzles to cheap, annoying bits that served mainly to waste time. (Particularly evident with only the first boss really being any sort of \"puzzle\" and the others all being much more standard \"dodge hit, take your own shot\" types) It doesn't help that if you screw something up, you need to expect that you'll be backtracking. This includes in boss fights, because hey, guess what, you have one HP. That's it, you get hit once and you're done. Boss fights tend to also include cheap shots in them so you're basically guaranteed to need to restart at least once just from a surprise shot added into the second or third phase of a fight. But even in normal gameplay, you should probably just be prepared to fall off of something because you just barely mistimed your teleport, and now you'll just be redoing an entire section. Hope you wanted that.\n\nThe story is very generic as well, definitely nothing to write home about. Not a big deal in a game like this, but I figured I'd note that yeah, there is one, and yeah, it's really just nothing special. It doesn't help that if you want the full picture you absolutely have to get all of the collectibles in the game.\n\n...Well, that's what I'd like to say, but if you look at the store page for this game, it absolutely tries to brag in an incredibly obnoxious way about how good the story is without even needing a single line of dialogue.\nSo yeah, it's a generic, semi-walled off, boring story with nothing unique about it. I felt nothing for it.\n\nHonestly though? The biggest problem with this game? Even at the start, I wouldn't say I was incredibly impressed with the puzzles, but the further I got in the game, the more I thought I could just be playing something better that I actually enjoyed. Like this game offered nothing that I couldn't get somewhere else, and I wouldn't be bored/mildly annoyed while doing it. And because it was just pushing out more and more finnicky puzzles, it just got more irritating without any satisfaction of thinking I did well.\n\nI see this game is considered \"very positive\" on steam, and I get it! I can see how someone could like this. It's certainly not for me though, and I would keep in consideration that the game does have fussy physics and a much poorer latter half to it, coupled with a weak story that doesn't particularly invest the player in progression.\n\nThat having been said, I will also point out this game is incredibly short, with a lot of my total time on the game being spent on me being...mostly stupid (as well as time tabbed out talking on discord). I would definitely put that in mind considering that this was my first time playing the game and I only have this much time spent on it with a 100% completed save file. There are gameplay videos on youtube of people getting 100% in the game in roughly an hour without speedrunning. It's just...really short. It's not an expensive game by any means, but I'm putting this out here right now for anyone on the fence involving the length of the game.\n\nI also went through some of the other reviews before finally posting up mine, and a big complaint I saw over and over again is that the game does not make it clear that you HAVE to get a good chunk of the collectibles or you are just hardlocked out of the final boss unless you start backtracking through things. I didn't really think about this problem since I'm a completionist anyway, but yeah, I can see how that's extremely insulting and comes out of left field, especially with absolutely no indication about where any of the collectibles are.\n\nProceed with caution getting this game. The bad part will likely come for you after the refund window is over.

In the case of Teslagrad, combat was almost entirely replaced with a puzzle world that keeps the exploration, item based progression, and atmosphere of a metroidvania; this effectively keeps the genre fresh for players like me.  Beyond what Teslagrad does for the metroidvania genre, the game stands on its own two feet without pinning it to a tag. The puzzles are clever and have alternative methods to obtain the many collectables. I have never played a game where every optional collectable the player acquires is its own Steam achievement: it makes the collectathon exponentially rewarding. I have plans to do the collectathon but this is where I have some minor issues with the game. Teslagrad is very very short: I beat the game with half of the collectables in four hours. I really could not believe it when I looked at my play time afterwards. Obviously my hours will increase as I do the collectathon but that is a ridiculously short game. However, if you noticed how I described the length, Teslagrad did not feel short. I found it slightly tedious at times because any wrong move into a hazard means instant death and starts the player at the beginning of the room. I want to reinstate that these were only minor issues and Teslagrad as a whole gets my recommendation to puzzle game and metroidvania players.\nThe bosses were suited towards the game wonderfully. Most of the games I have been playing and reviewing lately have had combat, but Teslagrad is a puzzle game. The bosses in Teslagrad are in a similar setting to Yoku\u2019s Island Express but I believe Teslagrad achieved more rewarding and intense boss fights by far. The bosses may be puzzles but they are scary; it really is like picking apart the move set of a Dark Souls boss but rather than openings for hitting them\u2026 they are openings for the puzzle.  The bosses are not overwhelmingly difficult but that is a great move on the design because the player dies in one hit. There was only one boss I would say is sub-par but that is it: the bosses were all unique, fun to fight, and admittedly scary. I think this game is a real sleeper for boss fighters out there and is worth a try as long as you remember Teslagrad is not a combat game; it is a puzzle game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1592457323, "timestamp_updated": 1592457323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70177946": {"recommendationid": "70177946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024998390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1148, "last_played": 1591075527}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun mechanics and good difficulty, was never frustrating to solve any of the puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1591075629, "timestamp_updated": 1591075629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70173640": {"recommendationid": "70173640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255650041", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1591235997}, "language": "english", "review": "Good artwork and really cool mechanics.

Game mechanics are really unique and fun to play around with. A little short, but with a cheap price tag that isn't too terrible. The game feels like a weird mix between an action platformer and puzzle platformer. I liked the majority of the game, but now some reasons why I don't recommend the game. \n\n-You die in one hit, which makes boss fights a huge pain. Especially when the first thing the boss does when it goes to a new stage is instantly kills you. This makes you have to redo the whole battle. Not a fan.\n-Because some of the puzzles take well timed and accurate input when stuck on a puzzle for a little while it felt like I was just not able to make the right actions to complete the puzzle because I was a little bit off from reaching the goal. But that wasn't the correct solution and I was spending time trying to complete a puzzle the wrong way because I thought I was just not good enough. Normally puzzle games have an obvious solution that is wrong which makes you rethink the puzzle and teaches you something about the game, but since this game needs good timing and accurate platforming this moment of \"oh, I'm doing this the wrong way\" never came for me. \n-The dash is soooo unforgiving. No invulnerability frames after the dash which led me to dying countless times from only slightly miss-timing my dash. \n\nUltimately, I am not the type of person to like punishing games, which is why I didn't like the end of this game. Got to the last boss and gave up because the fight didn't feel challenging and rewarding, it just felt challenging.

Yea, mostly. \nIs Teslagrad an enjoyable experience? Yea, [i]mostly[/i].\nWould I recommend Teslagrad? Yea, [b]mostly[/b].\n\nBefore I get properly started with the review, I just want to say that I went into Teslagrad expecting it to be a metroidvania. \n[b]Teslagrad is not a metroidvania.[/b]\n\nTeslagrad is a platformer, leaning towards puzzle-platformer, with 5 boss fights thrown in for good measure.\nHowever, Teslagrad's first noticeable shortcoming is its controls. I play with a controller (and, as such, can't speak for the keyboard controls) and not being able to switch between the left analog stick and the d-pad to move in a game like this felt absolutely awful. Playing with the joysticks made the character feel way too floaty and imprecise with their movements, however using the d-pad worked out well instead, making the character feel a little more responsive, which was good.\nIt's second big flaw, in my opinion, are its boss fights. They're just not particularly good, honestly. They come out of absolutely nowhere (as there isn't any combat at all in the entire rest of the game) and they aren't particularly memorable ~ I just 100%ed the game in a single sitting and I had to google how many bosses there actually were because I could only remember 3 of them). The most memorable boss, for me anyway, is probably the first boss ~ simply because the encounter basically came out of nowhere while I was just looking around mindlessly.\n\nHowever, if you go into the game with the right expectations, Teslagrad can be a pretty decent time.\n\nIt's not particularly long (it took me a little over 7 hours to get 100% completion and that's including a little time spent afk), but I personally think it was a good length for what it was. [This also gets a strong recommendation for an easy 100% if anybody cares about that.]\n\nTeslagrad's puzzles and platforming revolve almost exclusively around magnets. You're either making two objects attract/repel each other, or you're sticking yourself to a block, or you're being repelled by something.. That's pretty much it. And, while that might sound like a criticism, it's actually not. Because of the game's short length and that fact that Teslagrad's puzzles/platforming sections have a steadily increasing difficulty curve, Teslagrad feels like it's focusing on trying to do one thing really well, rather than lots of things poorly.\nThe platforming and exploration in this are definitely the high points for me.\n\nThe game's visuals are nice. They didn't leave a very strong impression on me, but I also didn't encounter any graphical glitches or bugs in my entire time spent playing with it.\n\nCome to think of it, I didn't come across any bugs or glitches during my entire time playing. So the game gets a 10/10 on reliability (at least from me).\n\nOverall I'm glad I played Teslagrad.\nA decent game, and an easy 100%.\n...Let down a little by some dodgy boss fights.\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1581799687, "timestamp_updated": 1581799687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63394932": {"recommendationid": "63394932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314704504", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1692926372}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego muy hermoso, realmente vale la pena, puedes morir de formas muy absurdas, lo que te har\u00e1 re\u00edr y sentir frustraci\u00f3n.

It has the all the makings of something decent (not great, decent), but it's also full of all kinds of little design screw-ups that collectively tried my patience to its breaking point. I was close to the end, so maybe I'll pick this back up and finish it after I've cooled down for a while, but Teslagrad has not been a fun experience for me. \n\nThere's no health bar; if you get hit at all, you're dead. This is supposed to be offset by the fact that your character respawns infinitely at either the beginning of the newest room you entered, or at various invisible checkpoints were the room is especially large and filled with frustrating puzzles. Which brings me to the next thing: this game is advertised as a Metroid-style experience. It isn't. At all. If someone took the barest hint of a Metroid template and made a puzzle game around the mechanics of electromagnetism over the top of it, that's what this game is. \n\nAfter a short intro sequence where you run away from some soldiers, you enter the tower of the Teslamancers, at which point you work (and it *is* work) your way through a series of puzzle rooms that form a serpentine path that criss-crosses the tower's central shaft. As you make your way through these rooms, you will sometimes be challenged to find a way to reach scrolls which are typically placed in hard-to-reach places. You have to collect at least 15 of these to open the gate to the final area. Also, if you don't get *every single one of them*, you can't get the true ending. For some of them, if you miss a very narrow window of opportunity to collect them, you have to go through the entire area they're found in to get the same narrow window of opportunity again. \n\nI've barely scratched the surface of all the little frustrations that are packed into this game.

The game always throws new things and new equipment at you with each of the major areas, so the puzzles never got dull.

And I did enjoy how the game told a complex story without a single line of dialouge without having the plot being overly confusing. The story is simple, yet engaging in that way.\nBut, there was one major gripe I had with Teslagrad was the sound design. The soundtrack is either incredibly dull or non-existent in some areas. Sometimes the only noise you'll hear is the ambient electricity noises and that gets excruciatingly boring, especially because you may spend a lot of time in some areas. And the actual noises of the game don't seem to have that oomph to them. Like Celeste's death sound is that big \"BTTT\" and Teslagrad just has a minor \"woosh\" of a death sound.

Check out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nI don\u2019t usually talk about visuals in my reviews, primarily because readers can make their own judgements on that topic just by checking screens of the game, but for this game I think there\u2019s a relevant analogy. Personally I love [i]Teslagrad\u2019s[/i] hand-animated style \u2013 just the visual aesthetic is inviting and the animations only get more creative toward the end of the game. However one of the first things that struck me starting this game was how bland the sound design is. Your story opens up with your child protagonist running from fascist government law enforcement, and it\u2019s weirdly silent. What could have been an exciting chase scene to set the tone for the rest of the game instead felt confusing to me; it was a void in the presentation juxtaposed against what would otherwise be beautiful. This dissonance between artistic elements is unfortunately like all the other elements of the game as well. The core gameplay \u2013 like the art \u2013 is clever, unique, and praiseworthy. Some of the content design however \u2013 especially the bosses \u2013 are lacking, or perhaps simply inappropriate. Just like how some people who play their games with the volume down might not be as bothered by the sound design, many will be willing to overlook [i]Teslagrad\u2019s[/i] weaknesses and enjoy this game fully. Others might find themselves throwing their controllers in frustration and lamenting what could have been. \n\n[i]Teslagrad[/i] is more similar to room-based puzzle games like [i]Portal[/i] or more appropriately [i]Supraland[/i]. Your goal is to simply move to the next room, but the method to move forward involves puzzling together environmental elements using progressively more complex gadgetry. All of the puzzles in the game are centered around magnetism. Positive and negative magnetic energy is represented by red and blue colors, opposites attract and same colors repel each other.  Manipulating these properties lets you float blocks into position, or even fly through the air yourself. \n\nPhysics based puzzlers like this live or die on the level design, and thankfully for [i]Teslagrad[/i] this is the best part of the game. Combining the Puzzle Platformer with Metroidvania style ability upgrades is proven once again to be a fantastic way to keep things fresh and exciting. Each zone has you mastering ideas and gadgets, allowing you to move forward into the next area with the next new idea layered on. Because of how progression works, the game is fairly linear, but you are rewarded for going back to previous areas with new skills. Ultimately, in fact, you HAVE to do this a little bit. After you\u2019ve collected the final power-up you\u2019re presented with a gate that requires you to find around half of the game\u2019s optional collectables to progress. If you\u2019ve played [i]Metroid Prime[/i] and you hated the last-minute artifact hunting in that game, it\u2019s a lot like that. I personally like exploring around, but in general doing it through puzzle platforming without a lot of short cut mechanics mixed in isn\u2019t really my cup of tea. You get a much better ending if you collect every single item in the game, but personally I was done with it after the bare minimum. If you\u2019re astute you may not have to explore at all to achieve at least this. \n\nThe controls in [i]Teslagrad[/i] have a high potential to be frustrating, thanks to having to keep track of what switching colors is going to do to your character, but for the most part the game keeps to one type of magnetism at any given time. There\u2019s a bit of a missed opportunity there to [i]really[/i] challenge the player with these mechanics, but there\u2019s also the occasional puzzle that makes you grateful that they never did. One or two of the later puzzles felt less like I was solving the thing and more that I was playing an insane pachinko machine except with a confused boy inside of it. It\u2019s entirely possible that my perceived solution wasn\u2019t what was intended by the developers, but nevertheless my experience in some parts was more messing with the controls rather than guiding my character through a puzzle. This reliance on player dexterity over intellect might catch some players off-guard, especially if you were expecting a more brainy activity based on early impressions of the game. \n\nThe biggest reason twitch-based control becomes an issue later in the game is that you always die in one hit. In the regular puzzle levels this isn\u2019t a big deal since checkpoints are plentiful, but when you have to fly up an elevator shaft dodging spikes or especially with the bosses, this one-hit death rule completely changes the mood of the game. The bosses especially feel completely out of place. They play out much more like those arcade quicktime event games, like [i]Dragon\u2019s Lair[/i], rather than a puzzle platformer. I personally thought some of the bosses were really clever, but having to repeat the entire sequence from the beginning because of one mistake got old really fast. It just seems completely unnecessary to make it so punishing \u2013 even giving the player one extra chance would have changed the entire experience. And, of course, the last impression the game leaves on you is a long boss fight using these mechanics. It\u2019s not that boss fights like these can\u2019t be fun, it\u2019s just in the context of a puzzle platformer it kind of forces you to play a game you might not want to play when all you really want to do is have fun with magnet puzzles. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re aware that this game gets a little punishing later on, I think you\u2019ll still find an overall enjoyable experience. [i]Teslagrad[/i] is both beautiful and unique, two traits that make it worth considering alone. But like how its sound design doesn\u2019t match up to its magnificent animated visuals, you may find that the gameplay clashes with itself just a little. If the ideas were separated into two different games they both might have been great individually, but as-is it narrows the niche of players that will wholly enjoy every element this game has to offer. What\u2019s left is still a very much above average indie title, it just falls a little short of \u201cgreat\u201d, in my opinion.\n\n3.5 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1574080368, "timestamp_updated": 1577369233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584854304790496826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56351226": {"recommendationid": "56351226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998212097", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1422083453}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous game.\n\nGenius narrative structure.\n\nGreat platformer.\n\nAmazing experience.", "timestamp_created": 1572750611, "timestamp_updated": 1572750611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56314260": {"recommendationid": "56314260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088779168", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1573233890}, "language": "english", "review": ".-", "timestamp_created": 1572721154, "timestamp_updated": 1572721154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55806802": {"recommendationid": "55806802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998073017", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 615, "last_played": 1531240887}, "language": "english", "review": "Great adventure!", "timestamp_created": 1572102089, "timestamp_updated": 1572102089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55557098": {"recommendationid": "55557098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838857505", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1565172566}, "language": "english", "review": "gooooood", "timestamp_created": 1570825892, "timestamp_updated": 1570825892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55313737": {"recommendationid": "55313737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198934227421", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1654377959}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little game, played about half way on PS3 then started again on PC.

The storytelling is amazing, I love background storytelling. The more attention you pay to scribbles on the wall and the posters around the place, the more you understand what's going on.\n\nThe controls work well, though controlling your movements when pushing or pulling off magnetic blocks can be a bit iffy. It's hard to tell which direction you're going to fly off in or how far you'll go.\n\nThe concept itself is interesting also, using magnetism to navigate and solve puzzles.\n\nSo why can't I recommend it?\n\n[h1]The boss fights.[/h1]\n\nThis is a PUZZLE game. Where the majority of the time, you get to scope out a room, figure out what to do, plan your attempts, then keep at it until you get it.\nBut the boss fights? Twitch-based action gameplay where you have maybe 0.5 of a second between phases to dodge the attack you didn't know was coming. Many of the boss fights don't even involve the magnetic mechanics. It's just getting close or behind them, and whalloping them, then dodge all its attacks until you can hit it again.\n\nIt's just so jarring to the puzzle gameplay elsewhere to see the game's own mechanics ignored the moment a boss shows up. A couple of them do involve making use of the magnetism, but the further into the game you go, the more they get ignored and the more twitch reactions become your way to win.\n\nThis is the one that bothered me the most. Puzzle games, with puzzle mechanics, need puzzle solutions to encounters. Not action punch/shoot the boss.\n\n[h1]Lack of puzzle variety[/h1]\n\nMany of the puzzles involve blinking through a barrier, and hanging off the ceiling by attracting yourself to the magnet above. It's the same thing throughout the game, the same few puzzles.\n\nThis isn't sooo bad, I just wanted this mechanic pushed further. More variety in how you can mess with magnetism to get through rooms.\n\nThere were a few rooms that had interesting elements, such as moving a ball around using your own magnetism, whilst you pushed off to reach higher areas. But these rooms were rare. Most common were straightforward blink through the gate and hang off the ceiling rooms.\n\n[h1]The Scrolls[/h1]\n\nI don't mind optional pickups like the scrolls. I don't mind a true ending being locked behind collecting them all.\n\nI do mind the final area of the game being locked behind a minimum number of them when nothing was said throughout the game to inform me of this until right at the door to the final boss' area.\n\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nThis is not a BAD game, in many ways it's very good. But the sameyness of the puzzles combined with the non-puzzle-like bosses I consider to be such poor design I can't in good conscience recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1562323438, "timestamp_updated": 1562323616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634225666522979736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53467201": {"recommendationid": "53467201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394732752", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1562215484}, "language": "english", "review": "This looks like a Platventure on the surface, but it's mostly linear.  Every room is its own puzzle to solve, and over the course of the adventure, you get a few upgrades that let you solve new puzzles, reach new areas, and sometimes traverse old areas much more efficiently.  The only real backtracking is if you want to grab all of the collectibles, which neither myself nor the entire Internet can reach a consensus as to whether they're supposed to be scrolls, batteries, or cylindrical tarot cards.  I guess batteries would make the most sense, since you use magnetism to solve almost every puzzle; most of your upgrades revolve around this principle.  This leads to some extraordinary boss fights, as well; each of them is very clever and challenging.\n\nThe game's biggest problem is the physics engine.  If they'd gone with something a little more video-gamey, it would've been fine, but this is a more in-depth physics engine.  That might sound like a good thing, but the problem is that there are a lot of random elements to everything.  There are a few challenges that only require you to know what you're doing and have the reflexes to do it, but there are several that have a strong element of chance to them.  I've even seen some pretty skilled-looking players' YouTube videos, and even they struggle with a good handful of them, so I don't think it's just me.  This applies to boss fights, as well; clever as they are, all it takes is one errant newton to screw you over and put you back at square one.  Thankfully, every room is a checkpoint (some have several), but a few of them really drag on.

There are a lot of different, interesting puzzles, with magnets as the main mechanic. The game keeps adding new mechanics to keep things fresh, and it works. There's no hand-holding in this game, which means you always figure out the puzzles by yourself, thus making them even more satisfying.\nThe animation is great and the music is great as well. The rooms are varied and beautiful, and make me feel sorry the story doesn't live up to them.\n\nNow, the bad parts. I have a lot to say here, but it doesn't mean it's bad enough to ruin my experience.\nThe physics of the game can get in the way of the game, occasionaly. This problem really shows at puzzles like the production belt part and scroll #15. This can lead to some puzzles being more of a struggle against the physics engine than anything else.\nThe open-level design is really pointless, besides getting the scrolls (collectibles) you missed, and it could easily have been fixed with a level select or a teleporter room, instead of the loooong elevator shaft. There aren't any interesting connections between the levels, and the few bad and long puzzles really stick out when you're going back through them. It's unfun to re-solve puzzles you already did.\nThe story isn't told through dialogue, it's told through cutscene rooms where there are plays in the background and the collectibles. The creators seem to be very proud of this, but on the whole it doesn't add much to it. it just means you can skip it for the most part. It isn't even that unique or interesting, it's simply a 'chosen hero' story with a corrupt king to destroy.  All this story does is give a setting for the game, and although there is an attempt at explaining what, how or why all of creatures, mechanics and bosses are there, for the most part it's nothing more than a picture of them being made or found, usually for no reason.\n\nThe bosses, like the game, are a mixed bag.

The visuals are amazing, the story pretty great considering there are no voice actors, the music is really good. The issue is the programming and the choices for the game. The bosses look great, but are not intuitive what so ever and the first one is almost as much RNG as it is skill and not in a good way. The bosses become a game of see attack, die to attack, respawn get to point where you died dodge attack get killed by next attack repeat. Mind you this is not because the bosses are particularly cheap or are even any amount of hard its more so that most of what they do is completely unexpected with almost no time to react the first time they do any particular attack. After that first failure you'll probably be good, minus a few questionable hitboxes slippery controls and the constant wait to get back to a point where you left off. \n\nThis really is shown when you fight a three phase boss because if you die at any point in any one of the three phases, its back to the beginning. On top of this, the game it self is not worth 100%ing, its not particularly hard to its just tedious with all sort of perfect jumps and timing needed in a surprisingly slippery game.\n\nAll in all however i would recommend this for the reasons i said at first, the visuals are great and creative the story is good enough and the music is pretty good, none of these things are the best ive ever seen but its hard to think of a game that can be so consistently above average in so much, even if it falls in a few other categories. \n\nIn short: if you are easily annoyed or hate bad mechanics look up the bosses when you get to them in game or dont get the game at all, but over all I do think its worth it.\n\nQuick edit, I took a quick look at the other reviews and I'm quite surprised people had issues with the puzzles, none of them were really that hard and generally if i made a mistake i knew it was my fault.

I mean I've gone through and just about finished the entire game, only stopping at the final boss because there was a good chance I'd just smash my controller into a thousand pieces. I feel a little bad, because the game is presented so well. Nice animations, a subtle but fitting soundtrack and some great non-verbal storytelling.  The mechanics are very interesting on paper, and there's a lot of cool puzzle design ideas. I wouldn't have collected every scroll and solved all the puzzles if Teslagrad was straight up a bad game. But there's multiple fatal flaws, any one of which would have me hesitant to recommend this to others and all of which put me firmly in team thumbs down.\n\nFor starters, the best platforming games make it clear that when you die, it's your fault (ESPECIALLY platformers where one hit means death, like this one). You missed a button. You jumped too far. You reacted too slowly. Teslagrad has extremely \"floaty\" and non-deterministic physics, which means this is almost never the case. Whether it's because your blink button just didn't work (as it often does), or a hit box seems off of where it should be, it always feels like Teslagrad's engine screwed up, which always makes me feel like why am I still playing this game.\n\nMomentum in the game is bizarre; if you're in a blue field, in theory the blue button should force you up, and the red button should suck you down. But if you're already moving downwards, the blue button does literally nothing. You need to give yourself upward momentum (eg jumping) and then hold down the blue button to continue flying upwards. And if you hit a wall or slow down for an obstacle, you'll sink back down. So many movement puzzles ended up with me throwing myself into these fields over and over, hoping this time the exact nanosecond I jumped would make a difference.\n\nOn top of this, a handful of segments feel like the game is a direct insult to your time. Let's talk about scroll 30, an infamously difficult challenge that even the developers feel is out of place for the game (according to the forums at least). Basically you need to hit a button to make a scroll rise quickly up a tower, then fling yourself upwards and blink through a series of instant death obstacles to beat it to the top. If you're too slow, the scroll whizzes by into a pipe (of course not stopping for a second) and you need to go back down and try again. \n\nTo even get past the maze took me thirty or so tries, and I wasn't even close to catching the scroll. I practised, practised, practised (thirty more tries) until I could almost make it to the top at full speed, and eventually did so. But my fleeting sense of accomplishment was quashed, when the flipping scroll just never came up through the tube. I assumed it despawned because I moved too far ahead? Imagine how I felt, after finishing a ridiculous challenge, only for it to not count. It didn't count the second time I did it either (ten more tries) or the third, thinking that maybe I just missed the scroll or didn't wait long enough. I realized I needed to arbitrarily slow down so I didn't outpace the scroll, but not too much because you can't regain upward momentum. It was tedious and frustrating, and made me furious, but I stuck with it because it was the last scroll I needed and how could the rest of the game be worse than the optional content?\n\nThen I got to the final boss, couldn't get a single hit on him, looked it up and saw I needed six hits on him, all without being hit once. So now I have the bizarre paradox of a Steam game with 100% achievements, that I actually haven't (and won't) finish.\n\nIn short, Teslagrad feels like it's stuck between emulating Super Meat Boy and Braid, but doesn't have a solid enough platforming base for either. It's not a bad game! Honestly if you have it already it's worth trying. But if you don't have the patience for frustrating physics and random giant difficulty spikes (like me!) you'll probably end up dropping it too.", "timestamp_created": 1552401974, "timestamp_updated": 1552401974, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580088019371032715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49501294": {"recommendationid": "49501294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975193106", "num_games_owned": 1336, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 827, "last_played": 1488569400}, "language": "english", "review": "Oyunun iyi oldu\u011funu belirtmek ve \"olumlu de\u011ferlendirme\" yapmak i\u00e7in k\u0131saca bunlar\u0131 yazd\u0131m.

Although, this made the battles more intense and defeating them more envigorating. The platforming/puzzle aspect was perfect IMO and only one collectable was frustrating to backtrack for.

Basically, there are blue and red magnetic poles, with attract the opposite color and repel their own color. You use this to manipulate blocks and eventually, even yourself, as you climb up the mysterious tower. \n\nIn addition to the puzzles, the game also has a really interesting story/mythos. As the name \"Tesla\" might indicate, it's based in a world that may suggest a steampunk feel, but uses electricity in a pseudo-fantasy setting. What's also interesting is the way in which this backstory is presented, both through the game's secrets/acheivements/collectibles, and through puppet-style stageplays in various locations within the tower. \n\nThough I did enjoy this game, I have to point out some personal critiques:\n\nFirst, the game is very short. Granted, that's not a huge deal: not all Metroidvanias have to be 40 hour behemoths like Hollow Knight. But this probably has the record for the shortest Metroidvania I've ever played (Hue, the second shortest, took me about 7 hours to beat). I beat the story in about 5 hours, and that was with a lot of dying during the bosses. Which brings me to the more important point...\n\nSecondly, the bosses feel very cheap. There is no health mechanic in the game, so if you take any damage at all, you die, And for the most part, that's fine: Hue is also like that. It makes sense in a puzzle game, because they want you to actually figure out the way to get through the level safely, not sacrifice health to get through a tough part. However, for Teslagrad's bosses, it means you have to beat them without taking any damage. Compared to bosses you see in games like Hollow Knight, Guacamelee, or Sundered, they're not especially hard, but they took me a fair amount of tries, just because I might mess up on one part, and then have to start over again. Maybe if you'rereally good, it may not be an issue, but I did find it to be fairly annoying at times.\n\nAll in all, though, I had quite a bit of fun.

I did not expect that, Teslagrad. \n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics are cartoony and look great. I liked the way the main character looked in particular.\n[*]The puzzles make for a good challenge. I really had to think outside the box a couple of times but I never got stuck for long. \n[*]Storytelling is done without talking, but occasionally you run into a \"theater room\" that tells you important things of the story.\n[*]The equipment items that you collect are original and a fun improvement to your gameplay every time.  \n[*]The OST is pretty good.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game is super short! Just when you've gotten all the upgrades, all that is left is [spoiler]2 bosses which have just a few linear screens in between them[/spoiler] and you're done. This was really a massive dissapointment as you get a really cool upgrade at the end.\n[*]I thought there would be lots of areas to explore because on the steam store screenshots & trailer the surroundings seemed very different every time, but it turned out that what you see is literally 1 room and then the next one has a different theme. Same goes for puzzles; most of them were really well thought and had unique things to keep in mind, but they literally used it once.  \n[*]There is also a system in place where you have to find all of the 36 hidden scrolls throughout the game map for a special ending. Right before the end of the story, the game forces you to get at least 15 of them (if you put in a small effort, chances are that you already have enough by the time you get there). I feel like this a very cheap way to extend your playthrough's lifespan, and even then I finished the game in 3 hours. \n[*]This game has a metroidvania tag but it really barely is a metroidvania. It's a linear ride until you get near the end of the story where you have to at least 15 scrolls before you enter the final rooms, and at that point [spoiler]you can go back through the entire castle with all your upgrades at once to get all 36[/spoiler]. I would expect that a decent metroidvania has far more backtracking and deeper branching paths than this (paths do branch sometimes, but very shortly up to the point that you rarely even leave the room). There is no health system that you can find/get upgrades for, no extra ammunition/mana/energy resource upgrades as those systems are not in the game. It's just uselesss scrolls that you look for as a bonus, so finding one doesn't even feel rewarding.\n[*]Some of the game's mechanics don't always work. I even got stuck at some point where the puzzle bugged out and I has to restart the game. \n[*]Speaking of restarts, I had to restart twice because the screen stayed black after death. I could still move and hear various elements around me. \n[*]Bosses are literally a game of memory. They have 1 pattern and when you see it the first time you are very likely to die ([i]no telegraphed moves here, is this your way of making things harder?[/i]), then the second time you adapt and get further into the battle. Rinse & repeat and the boss dies eventually. It would have been a much greater challenge if a boss at least randomizes it's moves a little. \n[/list]\n\nSeeing how many positive reviews this game gets I didn't see it coming that this game would actually be such a dissapointment. \n\nWas this review useful to you?

More story appears as you explore some of the abandoned areas of the castle.  At first, I admit, I didn't think there was anything particularly special about the story... but I was caught off-guard by a plot twist and a couple moments of character developments that really helped drive home the game's melancholy mood.\n\nThe sense of sadness that grows in subtle ways throughout the game ended up being my favorite part of it.  The puzzles are great, the player character's powers are really cool, and the boss enemies are well-designed, so there was already a lot to love.\n\nDespite all these great features, the mood is really what left me loving the game.  I wasn't even aware of it for probably the first 2/3 of the game, but when it hit, it really got me.

The hand drawn art, effects and music all mesh together excellently and the silent story told through lore was done very well. By the time I completed the game I knew the history of different kingdoms involved and how the main character played a part. I played this with a friend watching and he was very captivated by the mechanics the whole time. I will be honest, the game didn't do as much as I hoped with the polarity mechanic by the time it was finished but that's just because the developers at Rain did such an excellent job with showing me all of the possibilities the game already has and making me want even more Telsagrad ideas for a sequel or DLC.\n\nGoing into it you should be aware of two things.\n\n1. This game is physics simulated leaving it to feel way more floaty than I wished, this means that many things can be down to bad luck with many unsatisfying deaths that couldnt have been prevented in that given dice roll. However if you are mindful and careful on how you use the polarity then things become much more predictable it's just much too sensitive for it to be very pick up and play. I didn't 100% the game but I got a good chunk of it completed about 90%, but thats not without a good chunk of it being trial and error. A few areas I can pinpoint to having being stuck in for a long period of time just due to how slippery physics are and I needed to find the exact right way to approach it, but the overall experience was well worth it to overcome these big hurdles.\n\n2. This mixes casual puzzle platforming with hardcore old school reflexes, So your dexterity and quick thinking will be tested. The shift is most apparent when you're fighting a boss. The first time I encountered the bosses I felt like it was out of place due to the difficulty spike but became more accustomed to it over the course of the game ramping up with more challenge in the later levels. I  just wish it had a better balance to the learning curve instead of a big spike with each boss. If you don't like oldschool games that force you to memorize patterns then you won't like these parts of the game.

Teslagrad is a Metroidvania, with some puzzle elements thrown in. The puzzles are action focused. Those that prefer more straightforward gameplay. Will not enjoy Teslagrad\u2019s more timed puzzles.\n\n Pros\n-The Graphics, when you were not in the dark dungeon, this game is gorgeous. Beautiful artstyle. Especially when you reach the greenhouse.\n-The story, On it\u2019s own it\u2019s rather generic. But how it\u2019s told, gives so much more power to it. [spoiler]I loved the little theater rooms, You can skip them if you like. The one that made me smile was ironically around the saddest play. When I saw the old man that chased me from the start, was emotionally moved by it.[/spoiler]\n-The Gameplay, with an exception of the end. I didn\u2019t get stuck on a puzzle, they were not the hardest to figure out, but again it\u2019s how it\u2019s performed, that makes it fun. \n-Getting to the top of the tower. With the Tesla beam. \n-Backtracking wasn\u2019t bad. Infact coming back to a zone with a new ability, made it seem new again. Plus you don\u2019t have to backtrack to an area you don\u2019t like at all. You only need 15 scrolls. To reach the final boss. [spoiler]The best feeling in the world is using the staff on the dark creatures.[/spoiler]\n- The world building is the best I've seen. When you look back on the Tutorials of this game, They become apart of the world. Yes they taught you, but it makes sense even looking through the eyes of the boy you play as.\n\nCons:\n-The bosses were hit and miss. \nThey were to challenge you in mechanics you\u2019ve learned. However 1 is luck base, and the final boss is boring + difficulty spike [spoiler]He has two attacks that stall you, they don\u2019t change, they are easy to avoid, and they can happen a random amount of times. The Hard part is The second and third phases of the crown. Standing in the corner waiting for the crown to zap, and then shocking away from the blades, it\u2019s hard. And the first time that bubble struck, I could see my guy, so I thought you were dead once it touched you.[/spoiler] \n-THAT DUMB ELEVATOR SHAFT! Though it\u2019s a unique way of handling a hub. Once you realize you have to go up extremely slow. It becomes a chore. \n\nConclusion:\nTeslagrad was memorable. not always for a good reason. I don't regret playing it.

Unfortunately for me, I was wrong: to me, Teslagrad ends up feeling much more like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV.\n\nThe puzzle design is fine - I actually liked the magnetic puzzle mechanics themselves, and wish they were used a bit more interestingly. There's plenty of potential, with robots and enemies and all kinds of mechanisms scattered throughout the game. But the puzzles don't really get more interesting or clever as the game goes on - instead, the game increases its challenge by requiring increasingly precise timing and control to actually execute on the solution to each puzzle. Checkpoints are not particularly generous, either, which makes the many sections with deathtraps especially irritating.\n\nI hate this kind of game. I'd much rather spend ten minutes of my time figuring out how to solve a puzzle than spend five minutes trying to execute the precise timing of a solution I figured a few seconds after encountering the puzzle. I persisted because the pacing of overall progress feels so quick - it feels like the kind of game you should be able to get through in an afternoon or two of practice.\n\nUnfortunately, after completing four of the five boss fights, the game asks you to rerun through the entire game to find 15 of the previously-optional, hard-to-reach collectibles. Without them, you can't reach the final area. I already had 7 and this was still irritating to do, and the game smugly suggests you really ought to collect all 36 collectibles in order to get the proper ending, though at least that's mercifully optional.\n\nIf you love platformers that require very good twitch skills and pattern-learning in order to succeed, you might enjoy this; for an indie game, it's decent if unremarkable in technical and artistic terms.

I will say that I found this game to be played best with a controller.\n\nPros:\n- mechanics are unique and fun to play around with, especially as you progress. This game had me going \"wow, that's cool\" at every progression.\n- fun plot, world-building overall\n- unique map that becomes more interactable overtime\n- physics is generally solid\n- every new section or boss is unique and reminds me a lot of both Zelda games in how you use new powers to fight or progress in an interesting way, and Souls games in that literally everything kills you (except fall damage apparently).\n\nCons:\n- once you get to a certain point in the game, the rest of the content is hidden behind a fetch quest that I just couldn't get behind. It would've been fine if it were to fetch things in a new location, and that would've been both doable and unique, but instead you end up going through the same area you've been through before, and it's not very enticing.\n- there were a few gameplay ticks that I had trouble with. For example. if you bait one of the bosses to a certain spot and don't move too much, the boss just doesn't do anything.\n- Some of the controls weren't pre-mapped to my controller, which I only found out because I spent 5-10 minutes after getting the first item learning how to use it. To be fair, it shouldn't have taken me that long to realise that none of my buttons aren't working, but it was a little strange that they weren't. The only reason I could come up with is that the game's controls are fairly unique, so they should be mapped to what the user likes the best, but if that was the case it should've been explained that way.\n\nWith all that said, that is essentially everything that's wrong with the game.

The setting \u2013 despite all of its electricity and wild inventions \u2013 is just a red herring. No, this game's appreciation of science goes deeper than simple aesthetics. At a fundamental level, the only way to best this game's challenges is through meticulous experimentation. \n\nDeath is instant from any source of damage and results in a respawn to the beginning of the room with no other penalty. In the early game this isn't really noticeable. If you were having any trouble making it through a room, it just meant you hadn't really learned the lesson it was trying to teach you yet. Once dangers start to appear more quickly than one can react, however, you're encouraged to die constantly and to use your mistakes to painstakingly memorize patterns rather than to use the cleverness or calm observation that suited the first two-thirds of the game.

The problem about this level is that it requires superhuman precision 'push' and 'pull' (due to in-game physic and magnet simulation) or U will falldown on the way and have to do everything again.\n\nAnother problem is that some puzzle is 'memory maze puzzle that kill U if U go the wrong way cause respawn is faster' kind of puzzle.

At certain point he realizes that he was fooled and turns agains the King[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]At the very end of the game you see the cat. Depending on the ending he's either going to sit on a pile of money in Kings castle, or near mother's house.

No heart (Rayman or other \"lives\" style), etc.\nSo... when You did a mistake You are dead. And You can repeat the last passage of the game again.\nDuring gameplay it isn't so bad.

Teslagrad se caracteriza por centrarse casi exclusivamente en su jugabilidad, dejando el desarrollo de la trama a lo que extraigamos de la sucesi\u00f3n de los escenarios, de las huellas dejadas por otros personajes que en ellos podemos encontrar y de lo que los pergaminos secretos que vayamos encontrando nos cuentan de una forma gr\u00e1fica y muy resumida pero tambi\u00e9n muy concisa. Esta trama casi subliminal puede parecer insuficiente al principio, pero pronto el juego hace que te aprecies lo satisfactorio que resulta interpretar cada una de las se\u00f1ales que se van desvelando entre puzle y puzle hasta darte cuenta de que la trama tambi\u00e9n forma parte de un puzle m\u00e1s grande a completar a lo largo de todo su desarrollo. En cuanto a la trama en s\u00ed misma, tampoco es muy complicada, pero, a rasgos generales, se nos presenta un conflicto entre una orden con poderes especiales perseguida por un r\u00e9gimen tir\u00e1nico con reminiscencias sovi\u00e9ticas, al negarse la primera a colaborar con las ansias expansionistas del imperio del segundo. En este punto entra en juego nuestro protagonista (\u00bfel peque\u00f1o Nikola Tesla?), que deber\u00e1 adentrarse en la torre Tesla, \u00faltimo reducto de la orden, como \u00faltima esperanza de \u00e9sta por restablecer la paz una vez reinante en el imperio gracias a los poderes de la electricidad y el magnetismo heredados de sus antepasados. Si bien, como puede verse, no destaca en demas\u00eda por su originalidad al tratarse una vez m\u00e1s de la lucha del bien contra el mal y contra la opresi\u00f3n y el genocidio por motivos belicistas, lo cierto es que se sigue con inter\u00e9s, m\u00e1s a\u00fan cuando, como ya se ha explicado, forma parte indisociable de la jugabilidad del t\u00edtulo.\n\nTal vez el punto fuerte de Teslagrad y por el que quiz\u00e1 llame nuestra atenci\u00f3n en un principio sea su singular apartado gr\u00e1fico. Todo en el videojuego, desde escenarios hasta personajes y efectos, est\u00e1 dibujado a mano, lo cual es de apreciar porque es perfectamente notorio todo el trabajo que en \u00e9l se ha volcado. Es cierto que no es el \u00fanico juego que opta por esta forma de expresi\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica y tampoco es el que mejor la implementa (ciertos elementos, sobre todo en escenarios, se encuentran dibujados con algo de dejadez y poca definici\u00f3n), pero eso no quita que sea un t\u00edtulo agradable a la vista y con un enorme trabajo detr\u00e1s. La paleta de colores escogida en cada momento y el tratamiento de la luz en efectos y ambientaci\u00f3n nos har\u00e1n sentir completamente esa aura sovi\u00e9tica impl\u00edcita en cada rinc\u00f3n de la torre Tesla.\n\nRespecto al apartado sonoro, Teslagrad posee unas cuantas piezas que en momentos clave resultan agradables de escuchar, pero lo cierto es que la m\u00fasica en el resto de momentos no es sino un acompa\u00f1amiento ambiental para ponernos en situaci\u00f3n y que, por ello, pasa un tanto desapercibida. Esto no es un punto negativo, porque logra su objetivo de servir de base a la exploraci\u00f3n, pero tal vez se eche en falta alguna composici\u00f3n memorable que retumbe en nuestros o\u00eddos tras acabar la aventura. Los efectos sonoros, de igual forma, acompa\u00f1an de forma correcta las acciones de nuestro protagonista y su entorno.\n\nPor \u00faltimo, el apartado jugable, si bien no es original por basarse en los principios de un g\u00e9nero ya asentado como los \"metroidvania\", lo cierto es que est\u00e1 muy bien planteado y, aunque en ciertas ocasiones pueda resultar un tanto desesperante, no hay nada que resulte imposible tras el inevitable proceso de prueba y error y, gracias a \u00e9l, tras el aprendizaje de las mec\u00e1nicas de los desaf\u00edos que se nos plantean. De esta forma, todo el mapeado se nos presenta como un gran puzle que deberemos ir resolviendo por tramos hasta conseguir un nuevo poder que nos permita alcanzar nuevas zonas, en este caso nuevas alturas de la torre. Estos poderes se reducen a un n\u00famero de tan s\u00f3lo cuatro en Teslagrad, pero son m\u00e1s que suficientes en todo el desarrollo y no dan lugar a la repetici\u00f3n de situaciones puesto que, si bien con una base com\u00fan, deberemos utilizarlos de forma adaptada a los cada vez m\u00e1s exigentes rompecabezas propuestos. Su uso, al igual que ocurre con la disgregada trama, puede resultar confuso al principio puesto que no se nos da indicaci\u00f3n alguna de su funcionalidad o de su modo de empleo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de unos esquemas que, m\u00e1s que ayudar, confunden. No obstante, son tan simples que tras una breve y aleatoria pulsaci\u00f3n de botones nos haremos casi por completo con su control. Recalco aqu\u00ed \"casi\" puesto que para la aventura principal este nivel de dominio resulta suficiente, pero para la consecuci\u00f3n de algunos de los secretos se requieren habilidades no explicadas y cuyo desconocimiento puede llegar a frustrar al jugador, cosa que deja una mala impresi\u00f3n y una sensaci\u00f3n de dejadez por parte de los dise\u00f1adores. A pesar de todo, los distintos poderes responden bastante bien (aunque la inercia del personaje a veces resulta excesiva) y nos invitan a resolver cada situaci\u00f3n, como ya se ha comentado al principio, en base a la electricidad y al magnetismo. Podremos as\u00ed cambiar la polaridad de determinados elementos para abrirnos paso a trav\u00e9s de los escenarios, evitar obst\u00e1culos y trampas mediante la levitaci\u00f3n magn\u00e9tica y la teletransportaci\u00f3n (a la velocidad de la luz en este caso para no abandonar las referencias a la electricidad) y usar todo el poder que nos confieren los rayos tesla para combatir a los pocos enemigos que nos encontremos. Es \u00e9ste \u00faltimo otro aspecto a comentar ya que se fomenta la exploraci\u00f3n frente al combate y pr\u00e1cticamente en toda la aventura estaremos solos hasta que hacia su desenlace encontremos algunos \"enemigos regulares\"; pero, hasta entonces, \u00fanicamente tendremos que hacer frente a enemigos finales que nos pondr\u00e1n las cosas bastante dif\u00edciles pero que presentan unas mec\u00e1nicas bastante originales en base a rutinas que podremos aprender para derrotarlos con relativa facilidad tras varios intentos. En resumidas cuentas, Teslagrad hace de la jugabilidad su principal baza, tardando un poco al comienzo en resultar interesante pero torn\u00e1ndose pronto en una experiencia muy satisfactoria en este aspecto.\n\nPor todo esto, estamos ante un videojuego sencillo pero que logra engancharnos sin remedio al plantear un desarrollo siempre gratificante pero no por ello f\u00e1cil, aderezando adem\u00e1s todo con una trama impl\u00edcita que logra suscitar nuestro inter\u00e9s y mantenerlo hasta el final.

Set in a steampunk inspired vision of medieval Europe, players assume the role of a young boy who must uncover the secrets of the abandoned Tesla Tower and fulfil his destiny to become the last Teslamancer.\n\nGameplay is focused around the concept of using electromagnetism to solve puzzles and explore your surroundings. Players can charge environmental objects into one of two distinct magnetic poles (blue or red). Similarly charged objects will repel each other, while opposingly charged objects will attract each other. Players will also encounter oscillating electromagnetic fields which follow the same game mechanics, and can be used to propel players both horizontally and vertically in order to reach new areas or avoid hazards.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively linear, with each section of the tower needing to be completed before you can unlock the next. However, you will often find yourself gaining a new ability which can then be used to access previously unreachable areas or collectables. This backtracking is done with relative ease and does not normally feel too laborious.\n\nLight combat elements are present, but for the most part you have little means of defending yourself. Instead, emphasis is placed on using your powers to avoid and outsmart enemies. Even the boss encounters have a heavy focus on evasion and retaliation through indirect means.\n\nTeslagrad was developed using the Unity game engine. Graphically, it uses over 100 hand drawn illustrations as background artwork. These colourful environments are beautifully crafted and provide a charm that perfectly complements the steampunk setting. The 2D character sprites are decently animated as well. The soundtrack also deserves an honourable mention as the music has a whimsical tone that helps sell the concept of this fantastical world.\n\nWith regards to storyline, Teslagrad is fairly unique in that there is no written or audible dialogue in the entire game. The plot is conveyed purely visually in the form of short exposition theatres and collectable scrolls found throughout the game. As a result the story is quite simplistic, but it still provides an innovative and effective narrative that conveys all it needs to.\n\nTeslagrad is a short game that can be fully completed in less than 10 hours. The later puzzles do become a bit more complex, and some of the optional collectables are quite well hidden, but there is nothing that cannot be solved without some patient experimentation or exploration. \n\nThe only main criticism I have is the boss encounters. All of the bosses follow set attack patterns which you need to avoid before you can retaliate. However, as the game instantly kills your character when hit, boss fights quickly devolve into a tedious process of trial and error as you slowly learn how to dodge each attack before promptly dying to the next one. It feels quite out of place when compared with the more logical puzzling encountered in the rest of the game.\n\nOverall, Teslagrad is a decent puzzle platformer with intuitive controls, some innovative mechanics and engaging puzzles. It is a charming game with beautiful scenery and sound, all set in a fantastical world filled with interesting contraptions and strange creatures. It is a short diversion that manages to provide just enough entertaining gameplay before outstaying its welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1496931709, "timestamp_updated": 1497033236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867071270942687988", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32208559": {"recommendationid": "32208559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969749884", "num_games_owned": 2420, "num_reviews": 1422, "playtime_forever": 9928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 994, "last_played": 1524678025}, "language": "english", "review": "Teslagrad is a brilliant Platformer which does not have to hide behind Braid, Limbo, PID and others.

I just happened to figure out you could punch down because it was never explained.

Unfortunately I can't recommend it because it is a platform/puzzle game that heavily relies on it's mechanics ... and that would be amazing if it's mechanics were solid, but they aren't. It only took till the second boss to sour the game for me. Not because the game is \"Challenging\" either but because the botched mechanics make it unfair.\n\nThe puzzles/platforming in this game is superb and easily the thing that hooked me into it. The bosses are where it all falls apart. They give you these great mechanics for the puzzles and platforming and then try to use those same mechanics for boss fights. The main issue is that the mechanics are not precise or precision perfect as they should be for boss fights. In the second boss fight I ended up dying from sheer failed mechanics over anything else.\n\nThe phasing is by far the worst offender. Whether it fails to work properly, or just the inability to control your exit in any meaningful way, causes many unavoidable deaths. Again in the platforming parts it's a minor annoyance that is forgivable for the rest of the enjoyable platforming bits ... but when put into a boss battle where one mistake causes you to have to redo the entire boss fight (which are frustrating in the first place) and it will cause even the patient of players to rage quit.\n\nI tried this game first on PS Plus for free and loved it enough to buy it on PC ... now I regret that purchase, if I had played just a tiny bit longer on PS4 I'd have seen the glaring flaws and saved myself some money.

So let's give it one, why not - Teslagrad is a littleboyinascaryworld'emup, or a LBSW for short. As it goes with games of this genre, you play as a quiet little innocent boy thrown into a very scary (mostly because it's so frustrating to navigate) world which he explores to find its dark secret. It's also all very cinematic and you'll be chased by a bunch of nondescript bad guys. Sometimes it gets especially dark and becomes slightly horror-like, but don't worry, you'll never see child guts even if the implication is extremely strong.\n\nHere's the thing though - unlike most LBSW games, Teslagrad is actually quite challenging, and not just for the usual reasons (where the fuck do I go/how the fuck was I supposed to know to do that). It's a pretty tough platformer. It also serves as a model example of why most LSBW games aren't tough platformers. Their little boy player characters control too cinematically (read: tons of input lag as they try to put their little legs in order) to allow any precise movements. And to throw you another curveball, Teslagrad has a bunch of these electricity repulsion/attraction mechanics that are mapped to the keyboard in a frankly bizarre fashion. I had to remap everything except WASD and I still struggled wrapping my head around doing all that electromancing stuff in realtime as the game demands (especially during boss fights)(yes, it's a SLBW with bossfights).\n\nIt also uses aforementioned repulsion/attraction mechanics for puzzles, but that was actually fun so I don't know what to diss here. Most puzzles have just one solution, that's kinda bad. Kinda really bad, thinking about it.\n\nIf you're a fan of BLWS games, though, this one does the job just fine. It has a cryptic story told through the environment, it has the cool cinematic \"little boy looking off to distance\" moments, it has creepy old men trying to grab you, you get to zap them with a giant laser gun (oh wait that's not a SBLW thing is it), it's all handdrawn and nice and pretty, the music is great and it'll be over in 5 hours.\n\n[h1]Actually, there are worse ways to spend 2\u20ac.

Until it gets the QoL updates, I'm not recommending it.\n\n[h1]Artwork: 9/10[/h1]\nTeslagrad has an art style that really fits it and is executed well, even though the animations are usually without any visible transitions in between. It is also missing idle animations, which makes the game look boring when you're just trying to figure out a puzzle.\n\n[h1]Controls: 1/10[/h1]\nI have only been able to play the game using Keyboard and I can say the following: Don't play it with Keyboard. Teslagrad is plagued by many of the issues that usually appear when the Keyboard controls weren't thought out too well. Inputs are delayed, randomly not registered and often actually don't do what you actually pressed (Jump+Up+Blue randomly turns into Jump+Blue with an Up registered a frame later). I think it does offer you to rebind the keys, however that would not help as the issues are in the game itself.\n\n[h1]Gameplay: 4/10[/h1]\nTeslagrad mixes puzzle platformer with combat, however it only nails the puzzle platformer part. The combat part is completely unnecessary, especially the no-checkpoint one-hit-death policy that bosses have will mess your day up. What you thought was going to be a 20 minute boss fight can (and sometimes does) turn into an hour of you messing up just a tiny bit because the hitboxes of the characters and attacks aren't right and extend further than the shown images. The game was mostly linear in it's experience, but even with the linear experience there's no learning curve at all. It felt pretty much random how difficult a given area was going to be.\n\n[h1]Story: There was a story?[/h1]\nI think the story went a little something like this: [spoiler]Father leaves kid at mothers home, some king invades country, kid needs to escape, runs into a random tower, picks up random artifacts that grant some sort of power, gets brutally murdered over and over because of the no-checkpoint one-hit-death policy, and then something happens[/spoiler]. I wouldn't consider that actual story, more like background that is intended to give you a sense of direction and urgency.\n\n[h1]Overall score: 19/30 Points[/h1]\nNot recommended unless you enjoy a game that has messed up hitboxes, a one-hit-death no-checkpoint policy and repeating boss fights over and over again until you get nightmares from them. I hope that the developers learned from this game and implement better mechanics in their next game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485540729, "timestamp_updated": 1485540729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525441586971282959", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29475580": {"recommendationid": "29475580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105998446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1485316272}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un plataformas de puzzles de los que no se olvidan.

Even you may hate those frustration stuff, I still recommend you take a try.\nOh, and one last note: Always try collect the scrolls when you see them, most of them don't need a special skill which is obtained later to get.

Picked up this game during the 2016 Winter Sale for .99 cents after trying the demo on Steam (warning: if you play the demo, it has separate achievements, and they don't carry over to the full version, though your saves will; if that matters to you, you'll need to make a new save to re-earn those achievements in the full game).\n\nAs someone who disliked [i]Limbo[/i] and found [i]Braid[/i] underwhelming, [i]Teslagrad[/i] was the sweet spot for me between puzzle-solving, platforming, and repeat-until-perfect gameplay.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\n[i]Teslagrad's[/i] story is told through visuals, either in the form of scrolls (which you collect to earn achievements) or through in-game reenactments in a literal theatre. It's simple storytelling but very effective. The more scrolls you earn, the more the story unfolds, and the number of scrolls you collect affects the ending you get. Without spoiling too much, [i]Teslagrad[/i] tells the story of the rise of an evil king, his abuse of power, and the player's quest to end his reign. That's oversimplified, but the visuals do a great job of putting emotion behind this tale which my review can't do justice to. It's minimalist in the best ways possible.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nAt first, I compared the platforming to [i]Little Big Planet[/i] because at times it felt a bit floaty, especially in areas where you use polarity to float and jump. It's tighter than that, though...I'm going to say the best comparison would be [i]Super Mario Bros. 2[/i]. You use electricity, polarity, and teleportation as your means of getting through the various rooms. It lacks the combat of your standard metroidvania, but there is quite a bit of backtracking if you want to obtain all 36 scrolls. The game demands perfection; a generous checkpoint system means that trial-and-error is the defining mechanic. There are a handful of sections where this is frustrating, but I never felt like the solutions were *impossible*, you just had to learn the patterns. In that sense, boss fights remind me of [i]Mega Man[/i] though not as derivative as that may sound.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\n[i]Teslagrad[/i] has that familiar Unity-engine look and yet has a dark, surreal quality that sets it apart from other games in this genre. The red and blue theme is paired with the grays and browns of the factory and machine rooms to create great contrast. The game is not demanding in the least, nor does it need to be, and yet manages to satisfy with a beautiful art style that helps to tell the story without a need for exposition. My only complain was that some puzzles were intentionally obscured by darkness, and although you could attract the equivalent of fireflies to provide a modicum of assistance, it seems like an artificial way to make certain areas needlessly difficult. Not [i]Limbo[/i] levels of darkness, mind you, but in a few rooms that made them stand out to me as places to which I did not want to return.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b]\nThe music and sound effects are unobtrusive and do a nice job of complementing the gameplay. Machines whir, electricity crackles, and magnets hum in a satisfying way. The song at the endgame (at least, in the 'perfect' ending) is a wonderful way to conclude the game. Overall, nothing to complain about here.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nFor .99 cents, you can do a lot worse than [i]Teslagrad[/i].

I found myself trying to dash away from a bosses attack only to die from the cooldown still -- well -- cooling down.\n    [*] The game is short, there is a secret I have yet to discover, because it requires you to collect all of an hidden item.

You watch a few speechless scenes throughout the game, and you can find some collectibles which are just small drawings of events. It is mainly up to you to piece things together as you want.\n\nWhile some people seem to hate that aspect story-wise, I don't think that it detracted from the game for me at all. The biggest portion of the game is the mechanics. As you go running around rooms of a big castle tower, you will find new items that unleash electricity-related powers. You can change certain electricity-powered items to different polarities, simply shown as red or blue, which will allow for things to attract or push away from each other. You can hang onto ceilings or walls, shove yourself away from them, pull items towards you from far away, and many other things by using different power-ups with your magnetism.\n\nThe visual drawings for the game are beautiful from my perspective. So many rooms in the castle are interesting (for instance, the tree room), with nice colors and effects. The game might seem 2D from stationary screenshots, but the game is actually 2.5D as things will change perspective and motion when you're moving around, giving the perception of depth to the rooms properly. Lighting effects from the electricity and fires, enemies like the grues... everything is nice. I love the looks of this game.\n\nFor the audio, it is somewhat varying. The sound effects fit all of the actions in the game, whereas the music is more of a quiet background for the majority of your playing. I thought most of the rooms seem quieter music-wise, except for bigger scenes or puzzles, which is not necessarily a bad thing. If you play through the castle with nothing but sound effects, I imagine you will feel a little more chilling than when music suddenly comes into the game.\n\nThe actual delivery of the game reminds me of Castlevania, which I'm sure other people have said, although it is a more linearized version. What I mean by that is: there is only one real direction to go in the tower, and that is up. The only way to continue upwards is through a singular specific set of rooms for most of the way. However, there are a lot of side rooms, hidden puzzles, a few places that need backtracking to get through (though not that much, thankfully).\n\nThe exploration still felt fun, however, as each new chunk of the tower gives you a new environment, typically with new types of puzzles and possibly a new power-up for your character to use. Each chunk of the castle also ends with a boss fight, which many people seemed to crazily complain about for this game.\n\nTo address the boss fight complaints: I did not have anywhere as much trouble as some people claim they did, though I will agree that there are better ways the boss fights could have been done. Each boss took less than 10 minutes for me to complete, with the exception of the last two bosses in the game, though those were maybe 15 minutes each. The main problem of the bosses are that they are identically repeated patterns that require memorization (except for the final boss who uses moves in random order). But because you cannot know their patterns or moves in advance, each new move will easily kill you, causing you to restart the fight. Then it becomes a cycle of \"Work until a new move. Die. Work until the next new move. Die again. Rinse. Repeat.\" But it did not anger me for too long, so I think many people's complaints are over-the-top as the fights should not have been game-ending.\n\nIn any case, this game is a great package. I honestly think many more people should experience it because it gives off a nice, interesting personality as you play through it.\n\nI highly, highly recommend buying and playing Teslagrad.", "timestamp_created": 1480796729, "timestamp_updated": 1480797012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571218430995941162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28089659": {"recommendationid": "28089659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005427249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1486603430}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1480476219, "timestamp_updated": 1480476219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27988808": {"recommendationid": "27988808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046567139", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 430, "last_played": 1483978279}, "language": "english", "review": "The only game in which i have all the achievements, and also the only game that starts with a young boy being chased by some scary (r.a.p.i.s.t??)-guy. 10/10!", "timestamp_created": 1480364023, "timestamp_updated": 1480364103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497237563133239746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27907501": {"recommendationid": "27907501", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968547326", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1480296557}, "language": "english", "review": "A clever puzzle-platformer ruined by five-minute-long, one-hit-death, pattern-memorization bosses that infuriate and only serve to pad the game length.\n\nThere are only five bosses in the game, but they will easily account for half of your playtime.

Go back and do it all again.\n\nFurther padding the game length, the last area is gated by the seemingly-optional collectibles. You won't be able to reach the final boss unless you've collected nearly half of them. It's not hard, but if you weren't expecting it, it's a real kick in the teeth. Good luck backtracking; there is no way to see which areas still have collectibles.\n\nIf this game were just about the fun magnetism mechanics, I would have had a lot more fun.

In an already saturated genre, Teslagrad aims to distinguish itself using the game's magnet mechanics. The protagonist can pull himself towards a faraway magnet and conversely force propulsion if he is standing on a magnet to leap large distances and heights in order to navigate and progress through the game world.\n\nThe biggest strength of Teslagrad is the balance between puzzle and platform aspects of the game. By using the tools the protagonist obtains as the player progresses in the game, both puzzle solving and quick platforming skills are required. The game does not have health and the protagonist dies instantly upon contact with the game's harmful obstacles. Thus the aspect of timing is crucial in many of the game's puzzles to progress to the next screen. The difficulty curve to progress is mild but it is raised for searching for the 36 collectables in the game, for both puzzle solving and platform skills. Speaking of difficulty there are handful of bosses in the game which the difficulty spikes for all of them. However those challenges are not impossible although for most players, it would take multiple attempts to take them down.\n\nThe controls are very crisp and responsive. Jumping feels good without being too floaty or limited. The default keybinding is slightly odd to get used to but it is fully rebindable with keyboard and gamepad.\n\nThe game's visuals are handdrawn in pencil and crayon. The art assets are relatively plain and unobtrusive to allow focus onto the gameplay. There are few instances of impressive art in the background. The game does not limit itself to certain colour palettes and various primary colours are used. This helps the player to distinguish what is in the foreground and interactable from the background art.\n\nMusic is mostly well-composed ambient with more intense orchestra coming in for the boss battles. Effects are well placed as it adds the steampunk nature of the tower atmosphere.\n\nOverall, Teslagrad would be a worthy game for library of puzzle-platform fans.", "timestamp_created": 1480168239, "timestamp_updated": 1480168239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561879754066467285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "27594823": {"recommendationid": "27594823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983726857", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 313, "last_played": 1410099638}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it.\nGood Art.

The mechanics and pace of the game are great. One thing many modern platformers lack is a good, steady pace, and this game nails it. The story is also presented in a subtle but effective way. The story was very enjoyable. \n\nI got 100% in about 5 hours, so if you're looking for a game that is dozens of hours long, this may not be for you. I don't have time to dump into a very deep game like Crusader Kings II, so I'm glad there are games like Teslagrad around. The only thing I didn't like about this game was the cool down on the  **spoilers teleport move**. If I could see the cool down or it was somehow conveyed visually, that would also be acceptable.

There's a difference between needing to be good, and needing to be lucky, and unfortunately Teslagrad's gameplay is often the second thing.

But pretty quickly it becomes apparent that the game is pretty pointless to play without a controller, so points lost for that. The mechanics also start off being fun, but later tools are dodgy at best. The cloak mechanic is downright inconsistent and unreliable in it's behavior for anything more than basic attraction/repelling. Later level design just feels like the designer wanted to throw a bunch of really impossible stuff in just because it was the end of the game. The parts that are impossible just make the game downright boring. Sure, throw in the hard stuff; but learn to balance it. The trial-and-error/rinse-and-repeat method is terrible. These developers clearly have no idea about balancing gameplay with challenge, and the number of people frustrated with the end game shows it. In addition, there are too many places where I got stuck permanently (sometimes without even the ability to escape by death), which mostly occured because direction in the game was sorely lacking. If you get stuck, you either have to die, or replay from whatever arbitrary point you may have last auto-saved, which could be 5 minutes or 15 minutes back. All this points to a game that looks cool, but who's developers obviously lack skill and experience in good game design.

Unlike in most platformers where you complete one section after another in a linear fashion and you never go backwards, here you have one giant platform network which you have to explore. New areas are cut off by electric barriers which will kill you if you touch them (eg try to jump a gap and land on it) but death is irrelevant as you respawn nearby. You'll often find yourself going back the way you came to search for a route to new areas. You can check your general whereabouts with the Map button which shows you not the whole map but just a few local sections so you can get your bearings.\n\nYou play as a young boy who, at the start of the game, has to outrun a scary-looking man chasing him into a big tower. Early in the game you pick up a blue and red glove. These are used to punch blocks and barriers which gives them +/- magnetic polarity to attract them or release them to open passages, crush enemies etc. A bit later you acquire the 'blink' ability which teleports you a short distance, allowing you to get past electric barriers and jump gaps which would normally be too far. There is a lot of jump+blink necessary to traverse high+wide gaps. Later still there is a red/blue cloak to be acquired, I know this because there's a controller option for it, but I haven't reached that stage yet.\n\nThere are what you could describe as cutscenes occasionally. As you pass a theatrical stage the camera zooms in to view a medieval play performed by cardboard cutouts featuring kings, knights and princesses. They don't give any clues to the puzzles but they are very charming and entertaining. As I understand it, they depict the storyline of the game and how the boy is involved, but you don't find this out until the end (which I'm nowhere near so far).\n\nNow and then you run into a boss. There's no shooting weapon so the first time I met one I was a bit baffled. I just ran and dodged and punched some boxes which launched up into his mouth and he eventually died. Strange (in a good way) to fight a boss without shooting.\n\nHidden throughout the game in hard-to-reach areas are 36 scrolls to be collected, each unlocking a Steam achievement. You can progress without collecting them, and to all intents and purposes they don't seem to have any use at all. However, having done a bit of research I discovered (before I started playing, yay!) that you need 19 of them to fight a boss towards the end of the game. There are many complaints about people not realising this and having to go all the way back to collect scrolls.\n\nIt's possible to play with keyboard but a controller is an absolute must. The character drifts a tiny fraction on landing at the end of a jump and this does cause some frustration at first, but after a while you get used to it and apart from that the controls are natural and responsive.\n\n[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]\n\nThe artwork is superb, plenty of 2D eye candy and interesting scenery changes. Music is also pleasant and has character; good sound effects. All in all a very satisfying environment.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nPuzzles are tricky enough for a good challenge but it's not hardcore. Controller skills come into it as well, but most of the challenge is in the maze aspect of the game, finding your way around and working out solutions to get through to new sections. For me the overall level of difficulty was just about perfect.\n\n[h1]Perfomance[/h1]\n\nI played on both Linux (mostly) and Windows. It was consistently smooth, no glitches/stutter/lag at all, and the game seems very solid and stable in general. All screen resolutions are available - I played in fullscreen. Controls are fully configurable in-game, which is good because I did need to set up my Steam controller properly before I started. The game auto-saves, there are also a number of manual save slots and everything is uploaded to the Cloud, so no danger of lost progress.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nIt has the big 3: Achievements (36), Trading Cards (14) and Steam Cloud.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThe puzzle platformer genre is crowded but this stands out as one of the best I've played. The sense of freedom and exploration, constantly discovering fresh puzzles, bosses and cutscenes, is wonderful. If you like platformers then I strongly urge you to buy this, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Great value for the amount of content too.\n\n[quote]This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

I'll start out with what makes it great. The artwork kind of put me off at first, but it is actually really nice and unique. Kind of reminds me of braid. The \"magnet\" mechanics, didn't impress me at first, but the developers explored a lot of really cool uses and puzzles implementing them. \n\nThe problem with this game, however, is in the incosistancy of the gameplay. The actions feel very sluggish, which would be fine if this was a puzzle game. However, there are several bosses in this game that are just extremely frustrating when you have a delay on your jumping. In addition, the delay on the dashing feels more equiped for a puzzle game than an action platformer. The puzzles, despite being unique, never really go out of their way to stump you and feel more like action-y challenges, which of course would be fine if the mechanics were more tuned to an action game. The biggest flaw of this game is that it can't decide if it's an action game or a puzzle game. Of course, both of them can exist in the same game, but this game draws a very big line between the way the game plays and the way it makes you play it. In addition, throughout the game, there are enemies that will kill you if they touch you, sending you back to the beginning of the area. Towards the end of the game, you get a gun like device, but again, the response time on it is very sluggish, you can only aim in cardinal directions and you can't move while using it, resulting in many frustating deaths. I don't mind frustating games, I love super meat boy. The difference with this game, however, is that the controls aren't tight enough that I feel like the death was my fault, and as a result, I don't feel like I'm learning and getting better at the game.\n\nOn a side note, I saw a different review that said that the story in this game was a perfect example of \"show, don't tell\" in a story. I couldn't disagree more. With regards to a game, what that phrase means to me is that a game is able to describe a universe simply through the environment. Dark souls is a perfect example of this. Teslagrad, however, literally shows you backstory by way of \"puppet show\" when you reach certain rooms. You walk into a room that looks like a theater, and suddenly you are greated with dull puppet exposition on an even more boring story. Just because there are no words does not mean it isn't exposition, which in essence is the opposite of \"show, don't tell\".\n\nSo that's my rant. Despite all of that, the game is only 10 dollars, which is a great price for what you are getting. This game had a lot of potential and missed out on controls, but it is not a bad game at all. The bosses are extremely frustrating (read: not fun) and the enemies seem misplaced in this game, but it is definitely worth 10 dollars. \n\nI'm marking my recommendation as a \"No\", but at the same time, I don't regret buying it at all. \n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros: \ngood atmosphere\nfun magnet mechanic\nevery upgrade makes the game more fun\nthe main elevator hallway makes for a cool linking overworld\nthe artwork is great\n\nCons: \nThe mechanics are too sluggish for an action game\nThe puzzles are too action based to be a puzzle game\nThe music is meh, imo\nInstant death on touch, sending you to the very beginning of boss fights and difficult rooms\nBosses are cool, but not fun to fight due to sluggish mechanics\n\nAll said and done, I would buy it again, but I would still come and rant about what could have been the best action/puzzle platformer since braid", "timestamp_created": 1475208413, "timestamp_updated": 1475208413, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25736496": {"recommendationid": "25736496", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996050208", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 840, "last_played": 1475050445}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of the best Puzzle + Platformer games I've ever played.

The major problem is that you don't know what cycles these bosses have or what their next phase will be once you damage them, so you often end up using trial and error.

I DO agree that the game can be quite hard, but I absolutely say that it is forgiving in that when you die (and you will) you just go back to the start of the room/section you are in. You are back in the action quickly and ready to try to learn from your mistakes (or not)\n3) Annoyed with needing to collect enough scrolls to get to the final section?

Let me preface with the fact that I love 2-D side-scrolling puzzle-platformers - I grew up in the 80's with hard gameplay and wonky controls. Any game with a Metroidvania feel, I'm in! I thoroughly had a blast playing through Cave Story+, Valdis Story, Unepic, Chronicles of Teddy (and others outside of Steam like Axiom Verge, Strider, Shadow Complex, etc.).\n\nFor some reason, I thought this was going to be that same side-scrolling platformer with a Metroidvania twist - Wrong! It was trying to be Swapper or Abe's Odyssey or Limbo - Now, being compared to these games is not a bad thing at all. However, Teslagrad falls miles short of the caliber of the aforementioned. Just going to list my Pros and Cons below and a quick summary...\n\nPros:\n- Art style - It is a beautiful looking game\n- Boss battles were pretty nice - However, this has a con - see below\n- When I finished and never had to play it again...\n- That's all\n\nCons:\n- Horrible controls...played with the Xbox One gamepad - the game allows you to bind movements to keys. Super laggy - I have a pretty high-powered gaming rig and monitor - no lag on even the twitchiest games. It really drove me to a point of frustration.\n- No voice acting or script - just unspoken puppet shows and cinematics. Hey, my favorite game of all time, Super Metroid, had absolutely no written or spoken directional clues in the main game, however, it did it right - this game - blah.\n- I said I enjoyed the bosses - yes, I did. I felt they were well-fleshed and inventive, and they cleverly used the mechanics of the game. I didn't get to experience what I found through YouTube to be the last boss. After defeating the giant eye, the penultimate boss (which was enjoyable), I was just kind of dropped in a pit. After some searching, I found a room directly opposite of where I headed first that alerted me that I needed to have a minimum number of a certain arbitrary item in order to pass the gate to the final boss. Now, at that point, I'd already had enough of the game (in only about 4 hours); no way was I going to grind back to search for them. And, the menu doesn't even show how many of the item you have in your inventory - This design forces you to go out into the Steam achievements and count them...ugh. The game doesn't even really have a menu-based inventory. The map sucks too.\n\nIn summary, even for $10, I wouldn't recommend buying this crap. Pay a couple bucks more (or a few), and enjoy all the games I suggested above. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking of Guacamelee, a game this game tried to kind of emulate in a way - get that game. Beautiful graphics, great story, compelling gameplay, and a fruitful end. Take care...\n\nAddendum: Must be a glutton for punishment...either that or it's just my OCD. I went back and ground to get the extra couple ridiculous items to unlock the door to final boss. Boss was ok. Again, the lack of responsive controls was a bit of a detriment...especially when blinking (teleporting). Spoiler: Another con...and, this is just my personal gripe with the whole hipster fascination with cats. What is with indie dev hipsters and the inclusion of weirdo cat characters? This awkwardly placed cat in the endgame cut scene completely went against any content previously seen in game. Just cringy. Again, buy a better puzzler or Metroidvania...better yet, go back to the original and play Symphony of the Night or Super Metroid.", "timestamp_created": 1472610280, "timestamp_updated": 1472618568, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470841675996780396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25248346": {"recommendationid": "25248346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001614017", "num_games_owned": 1140, "num_reviews": 197, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1470280695}, "language": "english", "review": "I am giving this game a negative review for one reason and one reason only: I found the game neigh unplayable when trying to play with just a keyboard.

The gameplay is solid, the art is wonderful, and the game itself can get challenging yet never impossible.\n\nThe start might be a little confusing, as it does not tell you anything. You start off just running from your home in the town Teslagrad towards the tower, because you're being chased for some reason. Once at the tower you will get your \"weapon\" and the game actually starts there. Using the power of electricity you will go through the tower to unravel the history of it and Teslagrad, solving electricity based puzzles to progress, finding upgrades to help you further on. Every so often you will come across a theater that will show you more of the story, explaining what is going on and why you're there.\n\nThe game is metroidvania style, where you sometimes have to backtrack once you get a new powerup, so you can get objects you couldn't get before. This only is needed a few times though, and most of the game is straightforward. There are hardly any enemies in the overworld, most of it is puzzlebased, but the few bosses you will encounter make up for the lack of enemies and are probably the biggest challenge of the game, besides some of the hidden scrolls you could find.\n\nThe achievements are linked to each hidden scroll you can collect, and the 36 scrolls complete the story in a tarot deck style. If you want the full story, you have to find all 36 scrolls, and that will also open up the true ending. Some of these can be very hard to find, or really tricky to obtain.\n\nMy main complaint is that the game is too short for me. I would have loved it to be twice as big. I 100% the game in less than 10 hours, so I don't feel like I got the worth out of the full price.

Hard, but rewarding. It has most if not all basic qualities that define worth-playing game. Good art, interesting puzzle mechanic and decent soundtracks that match the situation.\n\nThe game is pretty challenging for platformer, and there's no difficulty setting, so one for all pain. Unless you're a seasoned veteran, you'll die alot since one hit from enemy or dangerous objects will kill your character. Thankfully the checkpoint is usually saved at the beginning of each room, so even when you die doing a puzzle again and again you don't need to backtrack alot. There's a problem with some incredibly hard to think puzzles that I had to resort to video walkthrough to find the solution, and of course the bosses' mechanics are quite challenging - you need to build the bosses' attack patterns in your memory and adapt to it. Overall, game mechanic can be frustrating, though, and annoying, but when you beat it you'll feel satisfaction.\n\nThis game mechanic and platformer genre in general require gamepad. It's not necessary, but you'll be thankful if you use one. Xinput is supported natively so you'll have no problem with most gamepads. For Dinput, as always, you can use x360ce. The controls can be awkward and take some training first, but if you can't keep up with default settings, there's an In-game function to remap key assignments.\n\nTeslagrad as a product seems polished, it even has Linux + Mac builds.

The games that we feature within this program are those that are much beloved titles or are highly wishlisted or just never received the type of recognition by the gaming press or Steam players. If you have a game that is from 2014 or earlier that you would like to see featured on Steamified either post in the disqus comments section below or submit your suggestions on our Steam group forums. I cannot make any guarantees but I will promise to get into contact with the developers and to show them your interest in having their game(s) featured and if they agree then we will feature them for you.\n\nThe very first game in our Steamified Revisits series is Rain Games Teslagrad. It was released back in December of 2013 and has remained one of the most criminally underplayed games in the entirety of the Steam catalog. This is such a shame because the title fared reasonably well with the critics scoring 77/100 on Metacritic and 78/100 on Game Rankings. The highest number of people that have ever played the game simultaneously on Steam is 169. It\u2019s a much better game than that and as a result is one of the driving forces behind the new Steamified Revisits feature of the website.\n\nSo what is Teslagrad? It\u2019s a puzzle-platformer that also fits within the metroidvania genre. It tells the story of a young boy whose exploratory behavior gets him mixed up with a long-forgotten conspiracy involving the king of the land who rules with an iron fist. The knowledge that the boy possesses could change the course of history for his land. Of course, you will not know this at the beginning of the game. Rather what you are told is that men dressed in red and looking mighty official are after him and that the boy is attempting to escape on what appears to be a cold stormy night that no boy should be outside in. Throughout the course of the game the developers do a superb job in telling the story in a minimalistic manner as there are never any words provided of the written or of the spoken kind and you are given just enough that you\u2019ll want to play on and discover more of the story until it plays itself through to its compelling completion.\n\nAs there are no words in the game greater importance is placed upon the art direction. Thankfully the visual presentation of the game is absolutely superb. The hand-drawn environments are among the best that I have seen. The lighting effects have been perfectly designed and serve only to contribute beneficially to the game without ever detracting from the experience \u2013 a critical balance that is so very difficult to get right. The audio too is among the game\u2019s great strengths which may be difficult for some to consider given there is no voiceover work. The visual presentation is based upon a steampunk world.\n\nAnother critical component of any puzzle-platformer is the level design. Rain Games have you covered here.  The game has been designed almost flawlessly with the opening levels of the game serving as a tremendous tutorial to the game without being overtly difficult or easy. The puzzles fit nicely within the spectrum of the game and are well designed and possess a high level of execution.\n\nTwo of the criticisms that I\u2019m willing to lay upon the game is that I wish that the devs had spent a little more time in determining the layout for the controller. Some of the important options lack a button. Yes, you\u2019re able to customize the options but unless you\u2019re someone who checks every option before getting started you will not notice this until you\u2019re left wondering what on earth you need to do. The other critique that I have of the game is that the controls should have been made to be a little tighter. Occasionally you\u2019ll have to redo a small section of the game because you\u2019ve died through no real fault of your own.\n\nHowever, in all, Teslagrad truly is a game that should have been experienced by far more people than have played it. It\u2019s one that is bound to provide several hours of entertainment.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to [url=http://www.steamified.com/]Steamified.com[/url]\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified]Steam group[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1459006619, "timestamp_updated": 1459006619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588499724864959717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22030553": {"recommendationid": "22030553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064783185", "num_games_owned": 840, "num_reviews": 267, "playtime_forever": 512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 512, "last_played": 1458854752}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Teslagrad es un gran juego estilo metroidvania, con el objetivo de subir la gran torre Tesla.

Por lo tanto, podriamos decir que Teslagrad est\u00e1 claramente influenciado por la saga Zelda que se caracteriza por ese aspecto.\n\nLas razones de porque ataca el ejercito al pueblo no est\u00e1n muy claras al inicio del juego, pero poco a poco se ir\u00e1 desvelando mediante una narrativa visual, es decir, observando los escenarios y objetos que mediante ilustraciones que narran esa historia.

The only minior quibble I have is with some animation sequences for some boses, making the boss non-interactive until the animation is complete felt confusing when first encountering the boss and in those instances I would have perfered an animation overlay compared to removing the interactive layer.\n\n7/10 Gameplay: This game is HARD, it requires perfect timing and complicated button sequencing that will make you play that level over and over and over and over and over... until you get it perfect. The game does have some anoying moments and learning the boss sequences by trail and error can be impossible without doing it 100 times over. The scrolls are great and add some story but not enough that you need to collect them which is good, finding them is not so good as you have to back track a lot to find rooms can't be opened until near the end of the game. I would recommend a guide for the tougher bosses and scroll locations because it is still difficult to get them even if you know where they are.\n\n\nTOTAL: 7/10\n\nFor the cost asked it is a good value!\n\n\nNote:\nThe difficulty of this game will vary a lot compared to how good you are at platforms so I will try to list some games you may be famillar with and my difficulty rating for them to get an idea of how hard it would be for you.\n\nEASY:\nA story about my uncle\nTrine 1 + 2\nGrow Home\nGunpoint\n\nHARD:\nFly'n\nSuper Meat Boy\nTeslagrad", "timestamp_created": 1457408875, "timestamp_updated": 1457409518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21678235": {"recommendationid": "21678235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134526278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1866, "last_played": 1583098364}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was a blast to play through.

I almost didn't have the patience to get to the end of Teslagrad. And that would have been a terrible shame, because it's a beautiful and intelligent game from start to finish. It just does one thing wrong that nearly killed the whole experience for me, a thing that you really need to be prepared for if you want to see the rest of what it offers.\n\nTeslagrad is unsurprisingly set in the city of Teslagrad, a sprawling, steampunky place with one hell of a tower in the middle of it. You play a small boy of auspicious ancestry who flees capture one night to find himself in that very tower. This is where most of the game will take place, with you working to unlock the upper floors as you find new abilities to advance. The theme of the game is magnetism, so your powers will allow you to attract and repel objects to great effect. It's a neat, tricky gimmick with some clever puzzles, but it's a very directed experience with few branching paths and no sequence breaking.\n\nIt's not a long game, either, clocking in at around three to four hours from start to finish. There are secrets to find, however, in the form of 36 scrolls (also the game's only achievements). You'll have to do some searching and some challenging puzzling to find them, and you need 15 to get to the endgame anyway. There's an alternate ending if you find them all so there's a few more hours of magnetic wizardry if you want, but it's hardly necessary. The actual platforming handles well, aside from a bit of that floatiness that tends to plague indie platformers. It's nothing damning, and it does allow for some fun physics shenanigans in a few of the puzzles.\n\nYou'll also face off against a few bosses, and this is where the game nearly lost me. Like the rest of the game, the bosses are clever and beautiful and challenging, but one little detail transforms them from climactic battles to infuriating slogs. You see, you have no health in Teslagrad. One hit kills you, usually starting you back at the beginning of the room. Coupled with bosses that have challenging patterns that must be memorized, this is a recipe for intense frustration. You might have to repeat a pattern three or four times as it speeds up and gains new hazards, and one wrong move will see you starting from scratch. Some of the puzzles are equally lethal, the standout being an anti-gravity ascent through a field of electricity that took me dozens of tries.\n\nThere is a very real possibility that Teslagrad will make you rage, and it's such a tragedy because the game is otherwise brilliant. The art style is gorgeous and animated in incredible detail, the story is excellent (told through charming puppet interludes), and the setting is a real stand-out amidst a sea of steampunk dreck. I have to recommend Teslagrad for its many strengths, but there's no shame in checking out of this one when it gets too tough.

I went in expecting a metroidvania and got a platforming puzzle solver game instead. Although I was surprised, the game exceeded all expectations for me. \n\nThe entire game has no dialogue and the story is gathered from grabbing these battery shaped objects throughout the tower you are climbing. You solve puzzles with the power of polarities and some teleport magics. The puzzles are fairly simple with a few difficult ones here and there but the true challenge is solving the puzzles to grab the batteries for more story. Enemies are fairly rare and you will most likely die to the environment rather than being attacked by anything.\n\nBosses however, are the games absolute strongeset point. Given that you die in one hit regardless of the situation certain bosses become very difficult as they require accurate jumps, reactions, and knowledge to overcome. You will die probably a minimum of three time per boss. The later ones will cause slightly more headaches as the patterns have surprises added in. The game is difficult by no means and repeated attempts will probably result in victory.\n\nThe music is pretty good with some influence from Russian culture. The art is also quite pleasing to look at. My one gripe about the game is that navigating up the tower you are climbing to collect batteries you have missed is a huge pain. At the end of the game, you are required to have at a minimum of 15 batteries so for those who wish to avoid backtracking up a long climb I would recommend you collect 15 before the end of the game. The game also seems to use an excessive amount of power for what is present in the game. I'm not sure if it is the Unity engine or bad coding practices but my processor was certainly doing some work running this despite being a fairly good processor.\n\nI would recommend you buy the game and give it a run through if you enjoy puzzle games somewhat akin to portal levels of thinking and thrilling boss fights. I'm sure the game would be much longer than the three hours I spent on it if I actually made an active attempt to find all the batteries. Running through the game took me about 3 hours with some time spent backtracking for the 15 batteries.", "timestamp_created": 1453257482, "timestamp_updated": 1453257482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20612500": {"recommendationid": "20612500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012453161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1279, "last_played": 1453109103}, "language": "english", "review": "Short Version:\n\n[list]\n[*] If you're a patient person who likes looking at pretty pictures, you will probably love this game.\n[*] The atmosphere is awesome.\n[*] Use of a gamepad is recommended.\n[*] I hope you like magnets.\n[*] There are diverse puzzles of widely varying difficulty/fun level.\n[*] It's unforgiving.\n[*] Boss encounters will make you hate your life.\n[*] You gotta get all of the achievements for a more satisfying ending.\n[/list]\n\nTo state the obvious first of all, this game is very charming.  The graphics and music are cute and very pretty, so pretty that a good chunk of my time in-game has been spent taking screencaps of the lovely environments and the adorable player character.\n\nThe pretty backgrounds and objects aren't strictly for show - with no dialog whatsoever, the story is told through the environment.  You can piece it together by looking at optional puppet shows that play in the background of various rooms, scattered propaganda posters, signposts, graffiti, murals, wreckage, statues, hidden rooms, and even the achievements.  Some people might find it a little disappointingly vague, but I think it adds to the mystery of the setting and enhances the \"lonely\" atmosphere (I mean, you ARE mostly alone in a huge tower).\n\nThe controls are simple - your standard movement, jump, and pause/map/achievement-checking buttons with 4 special ability buttons.  I would recommend using a gamepad if you have one (I don't), as a lot of the puzzles require a great deal of precision that's difficult to achieve with a keyboard.  The game auto-saves whenever you enter a new room, which is great because you'll probably die a lot.  Thankfully dying in this game isn't met with a lot of fanfare and you're quickly dropped back where you entered the current room.\n\nEach puzzle is quite different.  They vary wildly in difficulty and fun-ness, although there do seem to be a few that are universally reviled (the notorious \"Scroll #30\") and some that are universally loved (hamster wheel room!).  While the game definitely doesn't focus on combat, there are 5 boss battles.  I found myself dreading the boss encounters, which sort of added to the narrative: you are playing as a mostly-defenseless little kid, so it makes sense for these huge machines to curbstomp you.  That said, the bosses are unforgiving and will make you hate your life.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game and will probably replay it quite a bit if only to take in the gorgeous atmosphere again.  I have 2 tips for anyone about to start the game:  1, use a gamepad, and 2, get all of the achievements before you go to the final boss.  The final boss is a huge pain and the \"normal\" ending isn't really worth it IMO.  Finishing with all of the achievements gives a better ending and lets you restart the game with all of your special abilities from the very beginning.", "timestamp_created": 1453150847, "timestamp_updated": 1453150847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538043498992919922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20607622": {"recommendationid": "20607622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017601629", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1453760710}, "language": "english", "review": "Very original and entertaining game, with a classic but solid story and really good game mechanics\nWho would imagine Electromagnetism would make for such a good game?\nChange the charges for jumping, attracting and repeling, activating mechanisms etc\nAll the classic platform game mechanics (and more) with a really unique touch \nThe music and visual design russian-europe-steampunkish really submerge the player into the game\nAlso, I have to mention the travel is not linear, many times the player will suddenly find himself entering a level he already explored, or discovering new levels in already explored zones\nAs negative critic I would say sometimes the physics are a little bit unpredictable and you might fly in a direccion you didn't expect to go (But that's also funny in certain situations, and overall the physics are pretty solid)\nSummarizing, very unique and enjoyable game I recommend to everyone!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453134476, "timestamp_updated": 1453134476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20589679": {"recommendationid": "20589679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056000019", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 624, "last_played": 1453041715}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh this game.. if only had a narrator' would be awesome!\nstill 'tis nice Platformer-Puzzle game wih verrrry hard bosses :P (hah! no kidding)\n\n---info---\nClever puzzles but require patience to master your abilities \nBeautiful art and fine sountrack\nSmooth animation \nMagnetic mechanics everywhere!\nFree roam in Tesla Tower \n\nVisual representation of the backstory (puppet theaters, and ancient scrolls)\nVerrry hard boss fights to the point you might not procceed\nTwo endings based on how much ancient scrolls you found (some spots are very hard to access)\nAll achievements are based on how much ancient scrolls you found\n\n\nQuick tip: re-map to dpad at some spots if you play with a controller\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453053945, "timestamp_updated": 1453053945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682970285415649414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20584586": {"recommendationid": "20584586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009661980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59, "last_played": 1453038144}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzels are ok, but the controls and hitbox of your character are juuuuust off enough to make it very annoying.

As for the gameplay itself, the bulk of it is puzzles, some hard and some easy, most of which focusing on the use of magnetism to progress. The layout of the map is reminiscent of metroid games, and thanks to how they split the areas up, it is easy to backtrack and find missing scrolls. The hardest part of the game for most is probably the 5 bosses, the final boss is considerably challenging, however all the bosses have patterns and it shouldn't be so hard once you figure them out. The bosses do feel dissonant from the rest of the game, some meld well like the 2nd boss, which is the most puzzle like in my opinion, whilst other bosses are more luck/skill based like the 1st and 3rd bosses. \n\nOverall I'd say the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, more for those who want 100% completion.

Generally I've tried to avoid the Steam review system, as despite the best efforts of a great many reviewers the big blue and red hands at the top of each label each review as calling the game GOOD or BAD. There is little room for subtlety in such a system, and while many reviews list both good and bad qualities of a game and insist that certain tastes and demographics should definitely avoid / immediately buy the game, the specter of the big, colored hand trumps the text of a review.\n\nBut Teslagrad, though.\n\nThis is a game which I have absolutely no trouble in plastering a big, blue hand on. Were this just a series of puzzle rooms with no connecting narrative, I still would have had a blast playing it. Maybe it wouldn't have possessed me to sing its praises in a review, but I would have finished it. As it stands, Teslagrad is one of the great meldings of narrative and gameplay to exist in the modern age of gaming. Teslagrad's is a story (nearly) without words, a story told through the environment and the somewhat optional collectibles. The few and far between mechanical puppet shows which play out are the closest the game comes to an exposition dump, and they are short enough to not impede enjoyment and completely skippable besides. The story is not that complex, but it is different enough from the usual fantasy offerings that it was a reasonable part of my motivation to finish.\n\nVisually, Teslagrad is pretty damn tops. The character designs are simple, cartoonish and pleasing, while the environments and bosses have what I feel to be the perfect degree of detail and fidelity to fit in with the tone of the game. Had this come out in a time before every other indie game of note was a stylistically striking platformer I might gush more about the graphics, but our cup runneth high enough that I wasn't as impressed as I might have been.\n\nThe mechanics and feel of Teslagrad compliment the game perfectly. While gameplay concerning blue and red magnetic polarities is no longer a particularly novel concept, the execution of the puzzles and the way that they tie in to the story and world make up for this game coming too late for the idea to be novel. The puzzles never become too hard, and while it's possible that you will be tripped up at several points it will most likely be due to platforming difficulty rather than the inability to wrap your mind around a puzzle.\n\nWhile there are faults in Teslagrad, none are so glaring as to ruin or even mar the experience. The game is slightly short, though this could be said to be to its advantage, as it never overstays its welcome or stretches itself too thin. One or too puzzles almost necessitated deaths to learn how they worked, and while trial and error is not an inherently bad method of teaching the player there was at least one occasion where I felt cheated into a death that the game could have been designed for me to avoid. Finally, without spoiling anything, the final boss could have been handled better. Their attack pattern and design didn't quite meld with prior revelations about the character and the end result is just a boss that feels designed as a generically powerful figure than the unique character he was subtly built up to be.\n\nIf forced to attach a number to the game, I would give it an 8/10. For context it is one of my new favorite games, but the parts that fail to shine as brightly hold it back from a higher score. Having said that, absolutely play this. If you enjoy puzzles and and platformers, or even just wish that more games had narratives that were married tightly to the gameplay, this is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1452213904, "timestamp_updated": 1452213904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546827793121337891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20384973": {"recommendationid": "20384973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021360090", "num_games_owned": 1514, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1447151177}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick Review : This is a great game if you love puzzle platformers .

The puzzles are interesting with the polarity mechanic, for sure. Enjoyable, overall. The boss battles are a little bit...unforgiving. You die in a single hit (from anything), meaning you have to restart the boss if you get hit by anything at all. Personally, I thought this was a good thing. However, I've also played all three of the Metroid Prime games, so I'm used to tougher bosses.

The game took maybe 7 hours of investment from me, so it's a shorter game if you know how to handle it.

All the screen shots are special rooms you stay in just long enough to grab an item or get a bit of back story.

El objetivo del juego es investigar una (gran) torre en busca de pistas sobre el paradero del padre del protagonista. Esta torre est\u00e1 dividida en zonas con varias habitaciones interconectadas. En algunas de estas habitaciones obtenemos objetos que nos permiten manipular la electricidad. Durante la aventura utilizaremos estos items en diversas zonas (hay backtracking) para superar los obst\u00e1culos que nos impiden seguir con nuestra b\u00fasqueda.\n\nHay jefes finales y tiene algunos momentos de acci\u00f3n intensa pero [b]el 80% del juego consiste en resolver peque\u00f1os puzles saltando y manipulando corrientes el\u00e9ctricas.[/b] En general [b]estos puzles no son dif\u00edciles y pocas veces te vas atascar en ellos.[/b] Algunos pocos s\u00ed requieren razonar; muchos se pueden solucionar mediante ensayo y error. De hecho, vencer a los jefes es mayor reto en la mayor\u00eda de las ocasiones. La moderada dificultad de los puzles limita las frustraciones y favorece un ritmo de juego \u00e1gil.

I won't be spoiling the story, so I'll rather talk a little about how the story is presented. Teslagrad does not use dialogue or text, but rather shows the story instead of telling it. There are rooms with distant stages, and you are presented by a scene from a play. Again, no dialogue, it's just motions and actions. This is the main way of storytelling. There are also a number of somewhat hidden scrolls, that add to the story. Again, these scrolls feature no text, just pictures. This way of storytelling can be confusing at times, but nonetheless, is a nice touch and something different.\n[h1]Game play[/h1]\nThe game play is quite enjoyable. The controls are solid, and easy to get used to. Teslagrad focuses mainly around puzzle solving. The puzzles it revolves around, are similar to magnets or charges; opposites attract, like (charges) repel. You have various tools to help aid you through areas, such as the Magnet Glove. With this, you can change some objects to the desired colour; blue or red. Blue on blue repels, red on red repels, red on blue attracts, etc. The puzzles don't drag on, and don't feel like a chore to complete. The game also features boss fights, five in total. They are very difficult, due to the fact that if any hazardous thing touches you, you die. This goes for anything in the game, not just bosses. They aren't impossibly hard, however they can be rage inducing at times. Once defeating them, it's very rewarding. This can be seen as a pro or con.\n[h1]Graphics and Music[/h1]\nRight off the bat, you'll notice the animations are smooth and slick. The textures are sharp, and the overall art style is beautiful. The music is simply excellent, and creates such different atmospheres for each area of the map. Not much left to say.\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nTeslagrad is a well made puzzle platformer. With clever puzzles, and rage inducing bosses, this game won't lose your attention. If you're interested, definitely try this out.

You have a fairly big map with different areas to explore, gaining several abilities as you progress that let you reach previously undiscovered places.\n\nThe puzzles mainly revolve around magnetism, as you could guess from the game. It bares some similarities with the game \"Magnetic By Nature\", but, while that game has more ... imaginative puzzles, Teslagrad is more polished, and it stands out with its awesome artstyle and unorthodox story-telling. \n\nI haven't found most puzzles to be too difficult, nor the physics to be too unpredictable. Sure, there were a few times that the game was a bit frustrating for [i]execution[/i] rather than [i]solving[/i] a puzzle. But the difficulty was just right, for the most part. \n\nThe artstyle has got to be one of my favourites aspects. Reminds me quite a lot of older, hand-drawn cartoons, and it works surprisingly well with a few modern touches in the lighting effects.\n\nThe music was also really good! Unfortunately, it was a bit sparse, and the sound designed lacked in several occasions. Boss fights especially... while trying to carry a bit more impact by stopping the music right after the fights were over, the game felt a bit empty, while leaving the impact behind. Not something that is easy to explain... PID was great in this regard! Using the music's intensity to carry a given vibe.\n\nWhen I mentioned \"unorthodox storytelling\", I meant the way that the game presents its backstory. There are 36 scrolls hidden in the game, which are usually harder to spot or get to. Most of them, you can see, being alerted to it if you want to get it. Some were completely hidden, sometimes by abilities which you did not have, at the time...\nMore on that next, though!\nThese scrolls are just little cards (almost postcards) with very simple, but representative drawings of this country's history. It shows how things evolved from medieval times to the more developped world, and then crumbling world. I found it really cool, and it certainly gives players the chance of exploring the world by searching for scrolls... twofold.\n\nThe only problem, as I said, is the gated scrolls. As a result, you'll have to go back right after/before the final boss, and go through the [i]whole[/i] game again (-- with all of your abilities and the map explored, though! Still, you'll have to solve many of the puzzles again, even knowing the solution). In more combat-oriented games, it's a great technique! It lets the player feel overpowered by going back to old, previously difficult places. \nIn a puzzle game, traversal is rather annoying.\n\nRegardless, most of them are well in your grasp, less than 10 (if that many) requiring backtracking.\n\n\nNot much more to say about it. The game is beautiful, and the puzzles are pretty well designed.

Keep in mind that the game doesn't keep track of lives/deaths and you'll get through it without getting too frustrated. None of the jumps have been 'just barely' the right distance, probably due to grabbing the ledge. The game is well balanced as a platformer puzzle game, it has the right amount of plaforming challenges requiring some thought to solve.\n\nI've just gotten past the second boss.  The most common complaint i have read on line is that the bosses are too tough; i would disagree.  The first two bosses did take a couple tries, but it felt like the right amount of frustration (you wouldn't want it to be too easy; If you didn't want to put in any effort you'd put on a movie) and neither were going to cause a rage quit. They were both a part of the puzzle, just solve their pattern, while some people find it their least favorite part, i have found the first two bosses to be very enjoyable.\n\nGameplay is solid.\nIt supports controllers, even in the menu, so you can start the game pick up the controller and you're good to go.\nIt plays fine with keyboard if that's your preference.\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, so you can see screenshots/video and determine for yourself if you like it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448157312, "timestamp_updated": 1448157312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19204391": {"recommendationid": "19204391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041762979", "num_games_owned": 3464, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1448157393}, "language": "english", "review": "Appealing music, gorgeous art style and unique game mechanics.

I personally am horrable at platformers. I haven't ever beaten Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie cause of how bad I am at platformers. While playing this I did encounter some ragey monments Mostly with one of the late bosses but thats good in my option. \n\nThe main Machanic of this game is how magnets work, You coolect items through out the game that can change the polarity of certain mobs or platforms. You can ether repel by making your self and the object the same color, or attract by turning yourself and the object into opposite colors. I personally have never seen a machanic used in a game and it worked amazingly well then what I was expecting. The developers did an amazing job to get the physics realistic and plausable.\n\nThe story is easy to follow even though there is no voice acting. You are a boy that is escaping from bad men and you make it to a tower and you have to make it to the top. But what makes the story telling interesting is through out the journy you encounr puppet theater that begin playing the backstory through paper puppets. It was a very interesting and  well designed way of telling the story with out words but with the music and art.\n\nGoing on to the music and art. Honestly the music and art have got to be my favorite part of the game, as I stated I am not good at platformers so I can get easly angry at a level. The music kept bringing me back honestly, each level had its own sound that matched the stage perfectly. For example there is a stage tht is simular to a boiler room there was a metal sound incoperated into the song to make it feel like it was being played in a room filled with pipes. Then a sage that had many plants in it I belive it was the level with a large tree had a more upbeat tune that reminded me of legend of zelda with the lost woods. It was very well orcistrated.\n\nThe art is simple yet had massive amount of detail. The charater and objects had a simpler design compared to the backgrounds but that made them pop out alot more then having both extremely detailed or had the charater detailed and the background plain. It was pleasent to the eyes as well. I have sensitive eyes so bright lights and very white bacgrounds make me sick or give me a headache and i encounted none of that while playing. \n\nI highly recomend you play this game. I belive its on steam and on psvita. I played the steam version and used a controler. I highly recomend you play with a controler as well.

Other than the post-game clean up, I don't recall ever seeing the same exact puzzle or room layout twice.\n\n[b] Art: [/b] This game is beautiful. Although it's a somewhat cartoonish art style, it really worked for this title, especially when things took a turn for the dark.\n\n[b] Story: [/b] Teslagrad manages to tell a really great (and sad) story without ever saying a word. Seriously. It's all done through the gameplay, creepy cardboard puppet shows, and music. It's refresing, attention grabbing, and just pretty freakin cool.\n\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] Not too hard, not too easy. The boss fights are by far the hardest parts of the game, but they feel really great when you finally figure out the patterns and emerge victorious\n\n[b] Length: [/b] A common problem with indie titles is that the game either drags on too long or ends to abrubtly. Teslagrad does neither, and could probably be finished in under 4 sessions. The game can take longer if you choose to collect everything (which I recomend, the \"scroll\" puzzles are awesome), but it still feels pretty good.\n\n[h1] Good and Bad: [/h1]\n\n[b] Controls: [/b] The controls are really good for about 90% of the game. Going through rooms, solving puzzles, flying through the air, and all sorts of other things are great and feel good. The problem comes when you get to boss rooms.\n\n[b]Bosses: [/b] The boss fights are all pretty original, which was a nice surpise. The controls (mentioned above) can make them quite frustrating at times. It's hard to really explain, but the bosses can be a bit hectic and hectic + the control desgin don't merge super well.\n\n[b] Autosave Points: [/b] Your best friend and your worst nightmare. I had a primarily good experience with the autosaves, but there were a few times [spoiler] like at the top of that damn tower [/spoiler] where they makes your journey much harder.\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\nSpoilers\n\n[spoiler] [b] Final Item: [/b] In metroidvainias the last item you get basically grants you full access to the map or an overpowered weapon of some kind. Although it does become the method of attack for the rest of the game, it originally gave me an \"oh, that's it?\" feeling. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] [b] Ending: [/b] I got the special ending, which you unlock for getting all the collectables. All I know is that I ran back to my home and saw my mother and then it went straight to the main menu. I didn't really know what to expect, but I don't think that was it. Unfortuntely, that's probably my biggest qualm with this game. [/spoiler]\n\n\nIn final summary, I do indeed recomend the game.\n\n\n\n[spoiler] The king is a dick.

This is [b]MY[/b] opinion of the game, people can have a different and / or similar view of different elements of the game.[/i]\n\nI recommend this game for people who doesn't get raged by dying a few times in every room you enter. This game is a combination of both puzzles and action as you try to get through this castle like fortress filled with traps and things that really.. REALLY wants to kill you! So far I've only obtained [spoiler]2 gadget-ish abilities[/spoiler] and getting this items with almost no clue what-so-ever to do is actually rather fun! Not knowing where to go and not learn why until you've went there makes this game a very interesting game so far with the story.\n\nGame play can be all from standing still, looking around the room thinking of possible solutions to get around in the room to the next area, to quickly do impulsive choices while being chased by things that want YOU as their breakfast, the atmosphere is a combination of something sad, horror and motivating as you fight through skeleton-filled dungeons and bosses made out of the weirdest machines.\n\nThe art-style is VERY UNIQUE and quite astonishing after a while. When I first booted the game up, I kinda felt like this was some kind of homemade IOS store game, but soon realized this game has a beautiful and great graphics as everything has this hand-drawn looking textures with A LOT of background and misc. items in the environment.\n\nNow the game does involve some dying for all of us, I don't think there are that many of people who NEVER DIED playing this game. It did bother me first with the encounter of 1:st boss, as I died multiple times which got quite annoying... also, the story could be difficult for some to understand, I kinda got it but I would guess some wouldn't, ass it lacks most voices and text, as everything is in pictures on the walls. The objective and map functions isn't as obvious as they should be and using the map was even weirder... you got it after a while but at first you just felt clumsy trying to use it, and similarly with your ability to change gravitation... arrow keys?? How about 'mouse'... heard of it? Sure I get it would be weird for [spoiler]multiple abilities on the mouse[/spoiler] but I guess there should be a way to solve this.

You are\u2026 a boy, who is running away from\u2026 some bad guys. You are the last heir of Teslagrad, a bunch of\u2026 people in pointy hats who seem to harness\u2026 electricity? But not just any electricity \u2013 two colors of electricity!\n\nA game focused on navigating a 2D environment and finding secrets in the form of hard-to-reach scrolls, over the course of the game you gain the ability to punch to change the colors of blocks, surround yourself in a field which causes you to be repelled from or attracted towards blocks of the same/opposite colors, a flash-step horizontal teleport which can take you through most things, including some designated walls, and eventually a staff which can kill enemies and change block colors at range.\n\nThe entire game is set in a pretty tight little environment, a tower which has a central pillar you can use magnetism to travel up and down via a colored field beam. As the game progresses, you go through a number of themed areas and fight a series of bosses. Death is generally fairly cheap, starting over at the last checkpoint, which is in every room, and often after most significant obstacles within a room as well \u2013 though there is the occaisional exception.\n\nOn the whole, the game is centered around a variety of platforming puzzles which rely on your special talents. Some of these are reasonably creative, but after you gain the first three items, you go through several consecutive areas without unlocking anything new. While these areas are decent enough, in the end some of the puzzles do start to feel a little samey.\n\nFortunately, the game is fairly short \u2013 100% completion took me 5 hours according to Steam\u2019s internal clock \u2013 and the game does present some real challenge without being daunting. That being said, it is very simplistic and minimalistic, and while the graphics are attractive enough, there\u2019s nothing in this game which really goes above and beyond \u2013 just a bunch of platformer puzzles which are decent enough, but never really cross the line into exceptional.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel like I wasted my time with this game, but at the same time it is hard for me to recommend anyone else spend their time on it; while it is decent enough, its lack of actually excelling in any way means that there are other, much more memorable experiences you can have. The story is very bare-bones and there is pretty much no real investment in it, so all there is is the puzzles \u2013 and while they\u2019re okay, it just does not excite.\n\nPros:\n\n* Decent puzzles.\n* Decent challenge level.\t\n* Decent bosses.\n\nCons:\n\n* Minimalistic story which creates no emotional connection to the action in the player.\n* Minimalistic design starts to hurt a bit towards the end as the puzzles start to feel a bit samey.\n* Does not excel in any real way.\n", "timestamp_created": 1447762909, "timestamp_updated": 1447762909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461711704730987549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "19121217": {"recommendationid": "19121217", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983127140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1447713494}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 200 games and rarely bother to finish any.

The few powers felt useful and were taught well by the rooms they preceded, without any superfluous poorly implemented extras.

Que conste que lo he terminado, y me parece un plataformas con puzles y unas mec\u00e1nicas interesantes que puede que valga la pena jugar (o probar al menos), pero que me ha dejado un regusto amargo, motivo por el cual no lo recomiendo.\n\nLa sensaci\u00f3n al terminar el juego es de que est\u00e1 desaprovechado, de que daba para m\u00e1s pero que se queda en menos de lo esperado (al menos yo esperaba m\u00e1s de \u00e9l para ser un juego indie con cierta fama). Las mec\u00e1nicas en el plataformeo y los puzles est\u00e1n bien, art\u00edsitcamente es bonito, pero falla en otros aspectos que empa\u00f1an el resultado global.\n\nPrincipalmente falla en el contenido, que para mi gusto es m\u00e1s bien escaso, y sobre todo en algunos detalles que no est\u00e1n nada pulidos. Entre ellos tengo que destacar un punto del juego que para m\u00ed lo rompe y que es el principal motivo de no recomendar el juego. Y es que, a pesar de que la dificultad general del juego no es alta, hay una parte hacia el final del juego cuando hay que subir hacia arriba del todo de la parte central de la torre usando el torrente de corriente azul en la que hay que sortear obst\u00e1culos el\u00e9ctricos y cuya dificultad es disparatada en comparaci\u00f3n con el resto del juego, ya que el margen de error es escas\u00edsimo y hay que hacerlo del tir\u00f3n (y adem\u00e1s r\u00e1pido si se quiere conseguir uno de los pergaminos). Esa parte sencillamente no ven\u00eda a cuento, desentona con el resto del juego y por un momento Teslagrad se convierte en VVVVVV o Electronic Super Joy en una sucesi\u00f3n de prueba y error hasta que consigues llegar arriba o mandas el juego a tomar viento. En definitiva, un fallo flagrante de balance de dificultad que para m\u00ed ha empa\u00f1ado mucho la experiencia.\n\nOtra de las cosas que no me ha gustado es la nula narrativa, que le resta mucha personalidad al juego. Lo \u00fanico que sabemos del personaje o su mundo es por detalles de los escenarios y por unos teatrillos que hay en ciertas salas. Tampoco me han gustado algunos detalles del control (por ejemplo, si est\u00e1s en una peque\u00f1a pendiente hacia arriba no puedes usar el destello hacia adelante) o algunos bugs que me han ocurrido (por ejemplo, el boss final se me qued\u00f3 atrancado en un ataque), y tambi\u00e9n lo sosos que son algunos de los bosses, el rid\u00edculo boss final entre ellos.\n\n\u00bfRejugabilidad? Pues no demasiada. El \u00fanico coleccionable del juego son unos pergaminos (36 en total), que son los 36 logros que tiene el juego y de los cuales son necesarios 15 para poder acceder al boss final y pasarse el juego. No s\u00e9 si al conseguir los 36 pergaminos se podr\u00e1 ver un final mejor pero, en definitiva, no me parece un juego para volver a jugar a no ser que seas un enfermo de los logros.", "timestamp_created": 1442193850, "timestamp_updated": 1442194174, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479638636112213135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17962356": {"recommendationid": "17962356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996277708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1441836104}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful tale about family, war and betrayal.

The backstory and plot was beautifully told with absolutley no dialoge.  The visuals draws you in, and they are all you need.  I wish there were more hand drawn games like this.\n\nThe game is a little shorter than average of its genre, but still long enough to enjoy the journey without feeling like the game was short. The game paces very well with blending between the puzzle and action parts. There wasn't any repitition or filler. \n\nThe bosses were creative and are very action oriented. There were very enjoyable to play. Personally though, I would have enjoyed a boss or two that were more puzzle oriented.\n\nThe minimalistic style music was on point. The tone changed smoothly with what was going on in the game.  I would rank it under Bastion and Transistor.\n\nI don't have really any complaints.  The puzzles, while a bit tricky, arn't overly hard.  I did beat the game on Keyboard without any issues. Only one or two sections gave me trouble that made me wish I had a controller.

While Konami and Nintendo used to produce some high-quality adventures, we're now relegated to the indie sphere to find any kind of action/adventure game in the vein of those classic series'.\n\nTeslagrad may not be the most diverse of it's kin, but it certainly earns a recommendation for it's quality and simplicity. You play as a boy who has dominion over electricity. This allows him to change the polarity of certain blocks, blink through thin walls, magnetize to specific blocks and shoot electric beams.\n\nThis all unfolds through a castle that subtlely reveals the story behind your character. You jump through obstacles, avoid enemies and death traps and collect capsules to clear up some of the backstory. This isn't too far removed from something like Symphony of the Night, often feeling like a spiritual successor at times.\n\nThe art style is very expressive and feels extremely fluid. It lends a sense of smoothness to the gameplay that always empowers you. Even when repeatedly dying, you never feel like the deaths were your fault.\n\nThat is, until you hit the boss battles. For everything the game gets right about standard platforming, someone forgot how to make bosses interesting. Taking a page from Super Meat Boy, these bosses employ a one and done style of battle. One hit and you restart the whole ordeal, regardless of length.\n\nIt gets super bad towards the end where you are required to hit the bosses a total of 9 times. Going through the motions of a 5 minute boss battle to fail at the end is almost enough to make me hurl a controller through a window. If it weren't for the wonderfully built castle, I'd have given up after the second boss.\n\nGetting through those roadblocks does feel rather satisfying and buckling down to overcome a fierce adversary is always a treat. I just wish more could have been done to alleviate some of the repetitive nature of those encounters. At least the platforming is always throwing new tricks your way.\n\nInterestingly enough, the achievements seem to matter in this game. There is one linked to each scroll you can find in the game. Finding all of these will give you the \"true\" ending. It's refreshing to play a game where, even without knowing what the achievements are, you end up collecting them all out of sheer fun factor.\n\nAt the end of it all, I really recommend this to people who are dying for another Metroidvania game. There are a few newer ones that may have more developed mechanics, but simplicity is always appreciated, in my opinion. I like having as few barriers in my way as possible when playing something.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1437681644, "timestamp_updated": 1437681644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17147187": {"recommendationid": "17147187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095720042", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1438220194}, "language": "english", "review": "I really want to like this game.

I had gone into the game expecting \u201cBraid with magnets\u201d and Metroidvania-style exploration. Instead, I got a Super Meat Boy clone with long, frustrating, unforgiving platforming segments and annoying trial-and-error bosses. The magnets are mainly used as a means to traverse death gauntlets, often with twitch-action polarity shifting. One wrong move and you\u2019ll either die, or fall down a long way and be forced to climb back up. The magnet puzzles themselves are pretty bland and uninspired physics puzzles, and ultimately pointless. The level design is about as linear as a Super Mario Bros. level, and all four of the important powerups are placed directly in your path. Backtracking is only required for 100% completion (or if you happened to not find at least 15 of the 36 collectables to unlock the door to the final boss). Overall, it failed to meet just about all of the expectations I had for it.\n\nWhat redeems this game is the atmosphere, art style, and storytelling. There are no words or dialogue at all; this game tells quite a fascinating and unexpected story through the environments, characters, and pictures alone. The hand-drawn art and backgrounds are all beautiful to look at, and there\u2019s no shortage of good music, both of the catchy and atmospheric variety. Perhaps it's style over substance, but for me it really worked.\n\nOnce I attained 100% completion and reached the best ending, I looked back upon the game and realized I was glad to have played it. It was a real emotional journey. There\u2019s nothing at all awful about the game, it\u2019s just average in a lot of ways. The difficulty isn\u2019t actually all that hard, it\u2019s just frustratingly out-of-place, and skill eventually did take over and help make the experience more enjoyable. And despite the lackluster puzzle design, there were some instances of great ideas in there; the secret scrolls were highly satisfying to find and collect. With minimal hints and hundreds of mistakes, I got 100% completion in less than 10 hours.\n\nSo, after much deliberation, this gets a thumbs-up from me.

Since this game features monsters that run around in the dark and kill you called \"grues\" I think we can safely assume this game has all the nerd cred it needs and we're looking at the latter use of Tesla's name.  Now don't take that as some snarling criticism of Teslagrad.  Despite having nothing else to do with Tesla, dropping his name in the title does set you up for abusing wondrous electricity and magnetism based powers amidst an oppressive Eastern European backdrop.  It certainly delivers on that count.\n\nI'm going to assume you've already watched the trailer and been wowed by how good looking this game is with its smooth, forceful, hand-drawn animations.  It's certainly a beautiful game, but don't let that vibrant animation fool you.  This is a grim game about grim Eastern European seeming people doing grim Eastern European things with lightning!  And as somebody with a grim Eastern European family, I knows from grim Eastern European things (not with lightning though, that's new).  Teslagrad tells a basic story, but it does it elegantly without a single word of spoken dialogue or cumbersome written exposition.  Once again, this game is a stone-faced immigrant staring you down, and made all the more unsettling by inhabiting a world that looks like it was drawn by Walt Disney.\n\nYou've seen the trailer, though (or you need to just go do that already), and are already sold on the aesthetic of this game.  So let's talk gameplay.  Teslagrad is a bit of a Metroid game and a bit of a puzzle game and a bit of a precision (i.e. frustration) platformer.  You'll notice I said Metroid and not metroidvania.  The Castlevania games have always been a bit more combat oriented and Teslagrad features almost no combat.  There's a tiny bit toward the end and you kill some bosses in round-about ways, but for the most part Teslagrad is all about exploration and evading hazards.  And, remember, this is a grim Eastern European game with ligthning so everything including the floors want you dead.  And don't think they will go light on you because you are playing an adorable child!  There is no food for adorable children, only being lightninged into ashes!\n\nWhen I said frustration platformer up there, I do mean that.  Teslagrad is absolutely unforgiving with the timing you require to navigate its many hazards, and not just for optional secrets.  Combine this with some imprecise mechanics (especially when magnetizing yourself to float), and I will bet many boiled cabbages you will not be able to beat this game without sighing, growling, or outright screaming \"BS!\"  So before you pick up Teslagrad, best make sure you're strong like bull and smart like tractor, or at least possess adult reflexes and patience.  That said, the game is pretty liberal with checkpoints.  Stick an incinerator on the end of your most barf-inducing carnival ride and you'll have an idea of the speed with which your ashes will be scattered.  But then you just pop right back up at the start of the room or right after the last ridiculous challenge you overcame.\n\nOverall, Teslagrad is a great looking game with a large environment to explore and a wide variety of puzzles that make use of simple, elegant mechanics.  It would be nice to see an easy mode where the timing on some of the challenges is relaxed, but hey, in mother Teslagrad you must work hard at pixel forge for many achievement. \n\nIn other words, it's difficult, but satisfying.

On your way you get haunted by some sort of soldiers until you get into some sort of castle or something where you soon find a mysterious golden glove that allows you to change the polarity of certain metal boxes etc. which you encounter on your way, so they react magnetically to each other. This allows you to solve various puzzles to continue on your way. Shortly after you get to a tower containing a blue something which looks like an excursion funnel of Portal 2 but only moves you while you're of the same polarity as that thing. One way of achieving that (and at the moment the only one) is by touching a special flower on the ground of the tower. Then you're moved upwards by that funnel thing, allowing you to get to one of the entrances which are located at both sides (in terms of 2D graphics) of the tower's wall. Now you begin solving various puzzles to get higher in the tower and eventually reach it's top, while encountering various bosses and finding various other \"helper items\" (like the glove) on your way. And when you get higher, you also come across some theatres telling you about the history of the land.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nAs mentioned above you have to solve various puzzles, mainly using magnetics but also buttons, funnels like the one from the tower and small robots which can reach smaller places, press buttons and have other side-effects - all in all it's a bit like Portal without Portals and the 3D. The puzzles are all well-balanced in terms of difficulty - you have to think a bit about them, but you don't end up being frustrated and looking in the internet for the solution. The bosses are a bit harder, but basically it's just about figuring out how they work, and then you just have to try a few times until you get good enough to beat them, making them challenging whithout being frustrating.\n\nThe basic controls are A and D for moving left and right as well as Space for jumping. The various actions of the \"helper items\" are triggered by the arrow keys and can be directed to the character's top or bottom using W or S. You can also view a map (showing only rooms which have already been visited) by hitting Tab. All in all the controls are comfortable to use, and if you're dissatisfied with them you can also change them. The only thing that annoyed me is that the game did not really introduce the map as a feature, I just discovered it accidentally when I found a secret and the game displayed a little information together with \"Tab\" as the key to view the secret (they can be viewed by hitting the right arrow key while in map view).\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nAs others wrote before, the game has quite beautiful, handdrawn graphics with fluid animations. And really, there isn't much more to say about this.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe sound effects resemble the mechanics of the game well, but there is nothing special however. The music however is very beautiful and has a sad touch. During the boss fights I find the music to get a bit mechanical, and in other games this would probably be a deficiency for me, but in this game it actually works, mostly since most of the bosses are mechanical as well.\n\n[h1]Stability / Technichal Realization[/h1]\n\nI found Teslagrad to work very, very well, at least here on Linux. Everything runs smooth and without flaws. I didn't discover anything to blame the game for in this category.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nTeslagrad is one of the games which tell their story without words, and especially the intro does that very well, since this part in which you mostly run away and [i]experience[/i] the story flows directly into the part in which you actually [i]play[/i] the game. However the story is not the main focus of the game (which are the puzzles), and therefore it (the story) is not quite a big masterpiece. However the other parts - the well-balanced puzzles and the nice graphics and music - are all very good and together actually make a game which is a lot fun to play, challenging but not frustrating. Also I find the game to be very well-priced at ~10\u20ac, so all in all I\u2019d definitely recommend it to all fans of puzzle games.\n\n[h1]Evaluation[/h1]\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]Category[/b][/td]\n        [td][b]Relevancy[/b][/td]\n        [td][b]Rating[/b][/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]20%[/td]\n        [td]75%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]20%[/td]\n        [td]98%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]20%[/td]\n        [td]100%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound[/td]\n        [td]20%[/td]\n        [td]100%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Stability / Technichal Realization[/td]\n        [td]10%[/td]\n        [td]100%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Cost/Benefit[/td]\n        [td]10%[/td]\n        [td]100%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]Total[/b][/td]\n        [td][/td]\n        [td]95%[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1423858759, "timestamp_updated": 1442017313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559647738933563232", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14444016": {"recommendationid": "14444016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076760731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 478, "last_played": 1441116435}, "language": "english", "review": "Its so tuff, I cri evrytme.", "timestamp_created": 1423818842, "timestamp_updated": 1423818842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48543122410774231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14440150": {"recommendationid": "14440150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090958540", "num_games_owned": 1240, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1423702243}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bonito y divertido plataformas en el que tendras que darle un poco al coco y tener cierta habilidad, sobre todo si juegas con el teclado.\n\nRecomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1423790727, "timestamp_updated": 1423790858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14436129": {"recommendationid": "14436129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076099664", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 356, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 527, "last_played": 1423674389}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este Juego tiene una simple historia la cual no tiene subtitulo 0.0 porque no cuenta la historia solo la muestra cuando llegas a los salones de presentaci\u00f3n con una forma titiritera, fuera sido bueno que lo fuera puesto a medida pasaba pero digamos que es diferentes a cualquier juego que he jugado con campa\u00f1a, no me gusto mucho la historia estuvo m\u00e1s o menos, tambi\u00e9n fuera puesto algo en el mapa para saber donde estaba las cartas 0.0 porque darle la vuelta a todo ese mapa con esos rompecabezas y repetir se hac\u00eda tedioso pero los rompecabezas hay como 2 jajajaja te hacen explotar la cabeza, y el jefe ultimo 0.0 joder XD ni se diga de ese as\u00ed que si es algo desafiante por eso lo Recomiendo\n\nVoces: Ninguno\nTexto: Espa\u00f1ol\n\n****An\u00e1lisis*****\n*Jugabilidad: Bueno\n*Un Jugador: Bueno\n*Campa\u00f1a Horas: Bueno\n*Aventura : Bueno\n*Graficas: Bueno\n\nCalificacion: 7\n\nNota+Definicion: 10=Obra Maestra, 9=Excelente,8=Muy Bueno, 7=Bueno, 6=Medio Bueno, 5=Mejorable, 4= Mediocre, 3=Malo, 2=Muy Malo, 1=Inservible", "timestamp_created": 1423675414, "timestamp_updated": 1608911515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482374787330627441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14432530": {"recommendationid": "14432530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178525214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1424166357}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautiful, satisfying platformer with a focus on puzzle rooms and minimal combat.

Throughout the game there was very little combat and more of a focus on story, setting, solving puzzles and avoiding hazards. And now, to the break down!\n\n\n\n[b][u]THE GOOD[/u][/b]\n\n[b]PHENOMENAL Story telling through Art and Music[/b]\nMuch like the opening scenes to Pixar's \"Up,\"  the story is painted for you through the use of images and music only - there is no dialogue! Instead, Teslagrad's expressive art style, the 'cut scene' sequences, collectible scrolls and notes scrawled on walls tell the story of how a once great society of inventors met their unfortunate end at the hands of a selfish and bitter king. A+\n\n\n[b]Sharp Physics[/b]\nThe platforming mechanics and puzzles involve a lot of magnetism based effects and it all felt very precise. Your abilty to super jump, levitate and fly all seemed very consistent for the most part (unlike some physics engines!) and collision detection was particularly detailed and precise. There were only a couple of times when things were moving too fast that I wasn't sure if there was some muddled reactions happening... but otherwise each detail, from the corners of ledges to the speed of levitation, all felt incredibly smooth. \n\n\n[b]Clever Puzzles[/b]\nWhile some of them took me a while to grasp, or were physically demanding to complete, the puzzles (mostly) felt challenging and fun. There weren't too many times I found myself completely bewildered or frustrated... so Teslagrad's developers win more brownie points for making their puzzles fairly intuitive. \n\n\n[b]Flow of Motion/Noticeable Power Curve/Did I mention the physics?[/b]\nSince the physics of the game were so on point it gave you a great sense of flow throughout the game and heightens the sense of freedom over the environment... Particularly as you gain your power ups. You REALLY notice the difference toward the end of the game. \n\n\n\n\n[b][u]THE BAD[/u][/b]\n\nHonestly, not too much to say here. I either loved or hated everything in this game, so thinking of 'meh' complaints was tough.  If I had to say anything, I'd mention:\n\n[b]Timed Puzzle of DOOM![/b] \nSo, arguably the most difficult part of the game for me, involved flying upward on a magnetic 'updraft' as fast as possible through a series of electrical beams in order to get to the top before a quest item became unavailable. It was extremely difficult.  But that seems like a personal complaint rather than a design flaw. \n\n[b]Sneaky Camera Angles[/b]\nMaybe twice in the whole game, it felt like the game was being deliberately abusive when it came to their forced camera angles. Typically the camera is focused on whatever you can see in front of you. However, for what I assume are cinematic reasons, your POV would shift in to focus on something plot-worthy. 99% of the time this was fine because you were somewhere safe, you expected it and you could walk away from this auto-focused location without issue. But once in a while, your focus would shift in such a way that you couldn't see a guard running at you (you only face gaurds twice in the game, btw) and you'd be insta-gibbed. Very sneaky! Very spiteful!\n\n\n\n[b][u]The DOWNRIGHT UGLY[/u][/b]\n\nSo, two points of contention. Two things that the game should have done, but failed miserably.\n\n[b]Forced Hidden Collectable Quest[/b]\nI don't mind collecting trinkets (in this case scrolls) as a bonus, or for achievement or what not. But for god's sake don't force me to do it! There comes a point in the game where you can no longer progress until you have collected so many of these freakin' scrolls that are hidden throughout the game levels. There's still one more boss to defeat, more story to uncover.... but you have to pass through the gate with so many of these damn scrolls in your bag before it lets you through. Of course, this could have been avoided if....\n\n\n[b]Communicate, Communicate, Communicate![/b]\nIf I'm forced to play hide and seek through the ENTIRE GAME MAP... at least throw me a freakin' bone as to where these things can be found! For a game that communicates its story, SO FREAKIN WELL, you'd think this would be a non-issue. Clearly someone missed the memo. \n\nIn fairness, I collected approximately 90% of these things because their locations were obvious... it was just a matter of having the right tools and figuring out the platforming puzzle. But the other 10% were blatantly hidden offscreen in secret zones, or through passages that blended in with the scenery. After about an hour I decided to look online for the remaining locations. All in all, not the end of the world... but it would have been nice to have some sort of indicator on the map, or a tone, or light or something that would mark a location as important to guide me back to it. Those other 90% were somewhat fun to collect since I had to explore.... but those last 10% were infuriating! >_<\n\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game with a fantastic story line!

Please bear with me**\n\nTeslagrad is an amazing platformer where one uses numerous objects with their own special abilities to make it through various puzzles. Before buying the game, I played the demo. The demo, though, doesn't really show one enough of Teslagrad and its elements going in. Thus, besides how much I've enjoyed it, I've decided to write a review.\n\nJust to give a quick overview of a non-gameplay related aspect, this game is one played in silence; in which there aren't voices. This, though, leads to an amplification of the game's story. Either way, adding voices would do little more than take away the adventure and prevent one from noticing the very fitting and melodic music.\n\n\nTeslagrad is a real mix of three aspects: intuitive and trial-and-error puzzles, coordinated and reflexive platformer action, and exploration.\n\nPuzzles: Teslagrad's main view isn't solely focused on puzzles. I'd learned this after buying the full game. One could argue that every room is a puzzle, and that's true. Teslagrad, though, is a linear game and most of these can be discoved with quick intuition. If you're a puzzle fanatic and are looking for a game with a Professor Layton type of challenge, this isn't for you. These puzzles can also be melded with quick reaction, and the bosses are puzzles in themselves; trying to figure out how to defeat them and the best way. You will also die over and over again to find answers.\n\nPlatformer action: This is especially seen from the implementation of bosses, many of which took numerous tries to defeat. Many of the puzzles and bosses require quick intuition (such as evaluating jump height and distance), coordination with numerous fingers, reflexive actions, such as to dodge attacks, and memorization (mainly of boss moves and how to defeat them). To look objectively, the boss fights are repetative, though: you dodge all of the attacks, you preform a certain action/counterattack, the boss becomes faster and/or has harder to dodge attacks, and repeat two more times.\n\nThe adventure: This is by far my favorite part. The story is very heartwarming in certain parts and leaves the guessing about the backgroung story. There are thirty-six scrolls scattered in hidden locations throughout the game, each telling part of the story. The story sequence, though, cannot be obtainable in temporal order unless you restart the game after beating it, leaving one continuously wondering about the plot. The ways that these scrolls are hidden also requires active thinking and guessing as to where they might be. It also requires planning combinations of certain moves to get to their locations.\n\nAll in all, I lreally enjoy Teslagrad, my first-ever attempt at making a review is getting too long, and I think it doesn't suit all audiences based on their \"gaming-values\". 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1420587647, "timestamp_updated": 1420587980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13799637": {"recommendationid": "13799637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037190486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1496541154}, "language": "english", "review": "platformer, pretty fun actually, just know the fysics of magnets and you should be fine, tho the game gives good challenges even when you have all the power ups.

But then I was introduced to the first magnetic mechanic and all I could think was \"wow, this is really cool.\"\n\nThat's something I kept thinking again and again as I got higher in the tower that houses the game's levels, with each new area bringing with it a new twist on mechanics I, for whatever reason, had mapped out in my head before even pressing start, It continually and cleverly subverted the concepts I've come to associate with games of its ilk, smartly introducing new mechanics that build upon those that come before, while simultaneously developing a rich medieval steampunk world for me to get lost in.\n\nThere's not a single line of dialogue in Teslagrad, be it written or spoken or even just a tutorial, and yet it manages to create this abundantly interesting narrative of a kingdom obsessed yet terrified of technology, and the power it brings with it. Paintings, reenactment cutscenes, and pieces of the environment are used to tell this story subtly, in a way that hides most of its simplicity and had me wanting to find out more about it up until the very end.\n\nSimilar methods are used for each gameplay hook, most of which involve manipulating magnetic polarities. Tools are trickled out to you and then liberally experimented with before giving you another to try and work with, which creates an invisible learning curve as you apply what you already know to the new obstacles placed before you. Teslagrad is always conscious of making sure you understand it, and giving you time to figure things out without punishing you for mistakes or taking too long.\n\nThat is, except for the boss fights. Though they're likely the coolest moments in the game, these few encounters are rife with tedious and agonizing trial and error death loops, with one hit kills and the complete lack of checkpoints causing them to go on far longer and be much more annoying than they otherwise would be. It's not even that many of the bosses are that hard to defeat once you understand their patterns, but they're so pattern based and often consisting of numerous different parts that you're left with no choice but to die over and over until you've memorized their every move and can play them back exactly. There are a handful of moments like this in various puzzles throughout, which stand out all the more starkly because of how well the rest of the game avoids falling into the same traps.\n\nThe inconsistent difficulty was rather a lot more frustrating than I'm making it out to be, but that should also say something about the quality of the game outside of those moments, which I was enjoying so much as to push through the times I was ready to snap my controller in half and curse my reflexes to hell. It's a gorgeous, clearly guided journey in a genre that's become more and more uninspired and cluttered, positioned awkwardly among its less impressive peers that will likely cause it to be passed over in the deluge.

It's not that I wouldn't recommend it, it's just that this game might disappoint you. \nBecause of its art style, I thought that it would match it with its gameplay's genre, such as it being a 2-D puzzle platformer. And it is, but... It's also a rage game. A die-and-restart-until-you-win-in-one-run-er, with some vertical if-you-fall-you-have-to-go-back-all-the-way-up-again levels, on top of having a ton of random-obstacles-or-projectiles-which-can-only-be-dodged-after-you-die-finding-their-functions filled sections. It's not that it's bad (well, though I'd like to say that, it left me with a stale frown during the second boss fight), it's just that it doesn't match up at all with its story's theme or art style. \nOh yeah, those two parts are pretty good. You play as a highly flammable kleptomaniac who is being chased by Santa Claus and his gang of Russians through a tower filled with aliens and robots, with abilities Magneto would probably be used to make a pun with if I knew more about DC Comics or whatever. The story's alright, and its world is pretty logically put together, but it doesn't have anything too great to marvel at. Marvel. Wait a second... \nAnyway, to put its presentation quick, the art style met my expectations, but the soundtrack isn't that memorable. And finally, as I said before, even though I've marked this review as not recommended, it still has its good points gameplay-wise. The mechanic to manipulate magnetic energy is really unique, and can confuse you as you forget whether blue+blue=attract or blue+red=attract, or maybe I'm just an idiot. And even though it mostly has elements from the rage-game genre, it's also a puzzle-platformer which has metroid-like elements in its level design, making it a pretty unique experience. It isn't entirely a puzzle game as its art style implied, but it's still good.

So this mostly consists of objects getting magnetically attracted to or repelled from each other.  The game has many varied puzzles and endbosses with the magnetism mechanic. Many times in Teslagrad I encountered an endboss or obstacle and I was like; 'This has to be impossible! I probably have to travel back to get better unlockables.'But, in those moments, I would finally see how you have to do it. This makes you feel smart and satisfied. And made me say; 'Wow, this is really well thought out!' I should also say that there are parts where the gameplay blends in well with the music and the story. To be fair, I didn't really care about the story. So the little animations in the background were just nice looking images, for me. The only parts of gameplay I didn't really like were at the beginning, where you were unable change the magnetism. Those parts felt forced. The game has a nice handdrawn style which reminds me of the game [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/]Braid[/url]. In my opinion, the game is good until the end. The only thing that annoyed me is that you have to find 15 collectables for the final endboss. So I used a community guide map to find the last ones to reach 15. Shame on me. Overall, the game really well polished. The only bug I encountered was at the final boss of the game.

You end up getting three distinct abilities in the game, but two of those take up two buttons each (positive and negative magnetism), which ended up proving a challenge in some areas.\nPart of that challenge comes from the fact that you have one life, no health bar. There are boss fights in the game, and though the first three passed by fast and easily, the last two felt rather punishing because it wasn't always clear to me how to deal with certain attack patterns and upon failing to understand them, I'd immediately have to start from the beginning.\n\nBut again, these are minor frustrations. For how frustrating having to restart a boss fight because of one single mistake could feel, they still were very fun. Especially the fourth fight was one of the most satisfying and well designed bosses I've come across in a while and kept throwing surprises at you.\nThere is some backtracking involved if you want to go for a 100% completion (and I would recommend you do, it's definitely worth it!), as is the norm for metroidvanias. But by the time you reach that point, you'll be able to do so very fast. Furthermore, the collectible items are hidden in a fair way - there are no walls you can unexpectedly pass through; instead clear but subtle visual cues tell you where to look or attempt to go.\n\nFinally, I feel I should adress that I've called the game an action platformer rather than a puzzle platformer. The reason for that is that though occasionally you'll need to turn on your brain when trying to figure out how to get to places or defeat a boss, the puzzles never felt like the focus to me (unlike in games such as Braid, Fez or The Swapper) - even having figured out the solution, you still need to have the dexterity to pull it off too.\n\nBut yeah, if metroidvanias are your kinda thing, get Teslagrad. It's atmospheric and gorgeous; and though it's a bit hard at times, it's also very satisfying and fun. To some, it might feel too short, to me its length (~7 hours) felt perfect.

The game also does an excellent job of telling it's story through the environment and is surprisingly emotional for having no voice acting. The game controls tightly, and magnetic puzzles are a nice change from the moving around boxes puzzles you see in too many games. The progression of puzzles is excellent and the game does a great job of teaching you. The combat works surprisingly well and the bosses, while hard, feel like a natural extension of the game using all the puzzle mechanics you've gotten used to. Teslagrad is oozing with polish and it's a real shame it hasn't gotten more publicity.

The cards are not collected in the order of the story however, and so we learn bits and pieces from different parts before we can connect the dots. Although slightly confusing, it didn't really affect much in the game (I just love stories).\n\nThe mechanics are utterly simple, so after a bit they fade into the background. Your fingers just know what to do after a point. I was extremely pleased with the challenge the game provided in terms of gameplay. It constantly forced me to improve my skills, learn by trial (and death), jump just a split second later, drop a few pixels lower, time it -just- right. Not once did I mind having to start over after I died, because I really enjoyed it, and my death had usually taught me something helpful. It felt like old-school games, where you had to actually try hard to get past some spots, and there was just no way around it, or any consolation prizes. If you wanted to do it, you had to get better at it. There were not many enemies to fight, but the puzzles to be solved were interesting enough to keep me occupied, and the boss fights were entertaining and rewarding as well.\n\nThe game played quite lightly. One day I had to keep pausing, or alt-tabbing to attend to other things, and it remained responsive, smooth and didn't burden my laptop at all.

Simple yet engaging, the exploration is deeply satisfying if you love platforming and puzzles. You can even increase the replay value by collecting all the tarot cards hidden in hard-to-reach places.\n\nStill, there is one [b]major[/b] issue. The game is hard. Not \"I wanna be the guy\" hard, not even \"Super Meat Boy\" hard. It is simply \"old school\" hard. Every room will come with a few deaths, every boss will have to be carefully studied, every pattern analyzed. That would be the [i]good[/i] kind of hard.\n\nThe bad kind of hard is the philosophy of the one-hit kill. I am not a huge fan of \"variable health\" in platform games but a two or three strikes approach gives a little room for error while maintaining tension (Spelunky for instance). Here, one slight mistake or one tiny timing imprecision and it's back to the start. For a room, it's okay. For boss fights, it becomes borderline rince-and-repeat tedious if you're not patient/dedicated/born with lightning reflexes. You can also regret the small use of checkpoints (especially during the first final boss which is known to make grown men cry). But there is a reason why the lack of margin of error is detrimental to this game.\n\nWhich brings us to the worse kind of hard, namely letting a physics engine handle key elements instead of using scripted behaviour. Do not misunderstand me, the engine is solid but it introduces randomness (even in some boss fights) leading to your doom not by lack of skill but by lack of control, precision or just luck. Of course, this is a core part of the game, but this plus the one-hit kill principle sometimes seems ridiculous.\n\nTo give you an example (spoiling the method for the first boss), [spoiler]one boss fight consists of charging blocks that the enemy will swallow. After a certain amount, it will try to burn you, killing you if you are not on the edge of the platorm, but not too far as not to be thrown in a furnace on one side, electrocuted on the other. At this point, you could have a perfectly good boss fight. Unfortunately the blocks fall randomly and are handled in a \"realistic\" fashion sometimes piling up and blocking your way getting you killed[/spoiler].\n\nHowever, this should not prevent you from buying this game, far from it. The experience is amazing and the art (design and animation) memorable. If you like platforming, add this to your library this instant.

People seem to like it because the fights are easy maybe, who knows, maybe because its pretty, either way the controls suck.\n\nThe dev is very active and helpful on the forums so +5 for that.\n\nRating:  5/10  Value:  $4.99", "timestamp_created": 1409469472, "timestamp_updated": 1409469570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53179168701171875", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11905783": {"recommendationid": "11905783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035289665", "num_games_owned": 1893, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 807, "last_played": 1409294697}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game.

Even if you are on the fence about the length of the game, I highly recommend you give it a try. This is one of the better games that I have played in a while and it speaks volumes about the capabilities of the independent developers. This is the kind of innovation that the gaming industry has been missing.\n\nThe game starts off really simple. You play as an unnamed boy taken to the streets after an invasion of red shirts. In the beginning, you are quite powerless and all you can do is run from the invaders while learning the platforming elements in this game, but eventually you reach the gates of a mysterious tower. From there, you gain your first ability and the rest of the game revolves around solving puzzles with magnetism (the two polarities are represented by red and blue). \n\nThere is a bit of initial adjustment to the mechanics (I personally was wanting to match colors when the situation needed opposites), but everything feels completely natural after the first thirty minutes. There is some really good level design here because despite having little prompt on what each ability does or what your goals are, there is little question on what you have to do. For new abilities, the game essentially traps you in an area whenever you get a new ability and the only way out is through using that new ability. It is so much more enjoyable to learn through doing rather than watching or hearing an explanation of what your new powers allow you to do. There is also a very long sequence involving hamster wheel-like contraptions that is very intuitive and epitomizes the great level design in this game. This is the way that games should be.\n\nThere is a nice mix of simple and difficult puzzles, so you never feel as if you are stuck. The more difficult puzzles are enjoyable to figure out and you'll find that some of the puzzles aren't necessarily restricted to one solution. I often found that I initially found my way through a room in an unintended way upon visiting a room a second time. It is actually really fun to revisit older rooms with all of your abilities unlocked since you aren't bound by the restrictions you once faced.\n\nThe first boss fight is simultaneously epic and disappointing. The atmosphere combined with the music is very ominous; however, you might find yourself thinking, \"That's it?\" It may be an easy fight, but the first fight is mostly designed to adjust your thinking in how you fight the bosses. They are puzzle boss fights much like the rest of the game is puzzle platforming. Your character isn't all that powerful, so it is necessary to think about how you approach a boss fight. Past that first boss, every other boss fight is satisfactorily difficult. There are no checkpoints midfight. If you die, you are absolutely starting at the very beginning of the fight. This game's boss fights are the best area of this game and I wish there were more bosses. Honestly, that's the only change I would make to this game. Usually, I feel like games have too many bosses, so this game definitely is doing something right with the boss fights.\n\nThe lack of a lives system or something of that nature might seem too forgiving at first, but the game appropriately spaces checkpoints. They never occur too soon and a few take a while to get to. When you die there is a very brief cut to black and then you usually start at the beginning of a room or puzzle sequence. There is some trial-and-error, but the average player probably won't be dying repeatedly in a single area (thankfully, the boss fights are the exception).\n\nThis game has some incredible set pieces and the hand drawn art is really beautiful. The blue and red polarity motif is extremely helpful at guiding your way through the different areas. The layout of the game won't change for each playthrough, but this is a welcome drawback for the level of detail that goes into each area. If you like to explore in a game like this, there are 36 hidden collectibles spread throughout the game. For a lot of other games, I've found that developers are too sneaky about where they hide collectibles and it is usually ultimately impossible without consulting a faq or wiki, but the locations of most of the collectibles is pretty intuitive in this game. There are a few really hard to find or hard to reach collectibles, but you should be able to find them without assistance if you are trying to find them all (and you are rewarded for finding them all, but I won't spoil how). \n\nThe collectibles are just one way in which the story is told in this game. The collectibles tell the story through pictures. There are also little theater rooms scattered about the game that slowly reveal what has happened in this world. Much like the rest of the game, these parts are unvoiced (and there really isn't any text in the game aside from menus). Aside from that, the art direction really helps you understand what is happening in this game's world.\n\nFor those wondering about controls, I played this game a bit on a keyboard, but I found it to be uncomfortable. I recommend using a gaming controller (I used a Dualshock 4 for the majority of my playthrough). The game was a lot more enjoyable once I made the switch over.\n\nThis is just such an incredible game and just reading a review doesn't do it justice. I can't recommend it enough. This will definitely be a studio to keep an eye on.

Infuriating at times, but overall very pleasant puzzle platformer. Well worth the time spent, I'd say, especially if any of the gripes below doesn't sound bad to you..\n\n What I liked:\n\n - Lovely art design, backgrounds, animation and music. Production values are overall very high, only a step below UbiArt games, I'd say. Very reminiscent of Braid, I'd say.\n - Good puzzles, solvable without resorting to outside help in most of the cases. Definitely nothing as obtuse as Gateways final puzzles.\n - Interesting player abilities. Can't really say that having magnets and Dishonored Blink was innovative, but the way they were used and interacted with each other very much worked in the game.\n - Controls were very good, even if the jumping was a tad too floaty for me. Would be a much bigger problem if the game had a bigger focus on platforming, but given that it was 80% puzzles, I can't really complain.\n - Metroidvania-lite concept with no forced backtracking - only some of the secret scrolls required revisiting areas, everything else could be done by the first visit.\n\n What I didn't care for:\n\n - Boss fights, or rather lack of checkpoints during boss fights. Main character doesn't have any sort of health meter/shield, so the second you touch any of the hazards, you're brought back to the beginning of the fight. Which gets a tad annoying if said fight has several stages with new, random hazards added in the later ones.\n - Few instances of physics not working consistently - I had worked out a few puzzle solutions, given up on them as non-working after a few tries, only to check online and find that I had the good idea, but one that requires blind luck to work out. This is only true for a few scrolls, nevertheless should not happen.\n - Lack of proper map - the game marks your location, sure, but doesn't allow for map scrolling and doesn't mark the collectibles you discovered but haven't solved yet. Which makes the whole map pretty useless.\n - The achievement system used by the game (1 for each of 36 hidden collectibles) could do with a revamp - you can 100% the game well before finishing actual playthrough. Would be lovely if the devs added at least a 'Finished the Game\" achievement.\n - Weird performance issues - I don't have the fastest computer, true, but still, would not expect the game dropping down to 30 fps in few areas. Really noticeable when most of the game is silky smooth. I've also had the game crap out on me three or so times - game logic was still running, but the game stopped updating screen.

During the first couple of minutes of play, I was severely impressed by the highly detailed art style and lovingly rendered animation.  This is, quite frankly, a great game to look at.\n\nGameplay wise it is a well pieced together 'gimmick' physics platformer, with the flavor this time being electromagnitivity.  Platforms and other obstacles are overcome by either positively or negatively charging elements in the world or even yourself after a certain power-up is attained.\n\nI've always had a big soft spot for metroidvania gameplay, mostly for the exploration aspect, but most especially for the moments when you've aquirred all of the power-ups in the game and, while going through the earlier parts realize how simply things are overcame, either through the skills you've gained throughout or the power-ups you've been equipped with.  \n\nTeslagrad accomplishes this in spades, teaching you the 'hard' way how to do things; considering that you are punished for taking a single hit.  That's right, insta-kill is everywhere and it's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen.  That being said the developers do an excellent job of placing invisible checkpoints before each challenge, giving you the chance to experiment with very little annoyance of having to slug through five minutes of repetitive action.  Most of the time at least.  Bosses, on the other hand are unforgiving in that regard, often taking place over different 'phases'.  Oh, you died during the last phase?  Well you shouldn't have a problem doing the first two phases over and over again then.\n\nAt times frustrating, Teslagrad is great about the sense of satisfaction that comes with accomplishment; the feeling of finally getting through a particularily difficult skill-based challenge is a source of joy and never feels under-sold.  This isn't Dark Souls, but it isn't exactly Baby's First Platformer.\n\nThe story is told purely visually with no dialouge or narration whatsoever.  The closest clues you receive are adorable cut-out puppet theater snippets scatered throughout the tower and collectible scrolls litering the levels which require a certain amount of cunning and determination to receive.  \n\nIn all, I clocked in a day's worth of gameplay from beginning to end- about the same length of Braid, which felt like a major source of inspiration.", "timestamp_created": 1404510658, "timestamp_updated": 1404510658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11065376": {"recommendationid": "11065376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007654268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 162, "last_played": 1404648760}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've been playing in 2014 so far !", "timestamp_created": 1404468884, "timestamp_updated": 1404468884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11065033": {"recommendationid": "11065033", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996467316", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 461, "last_played": 1404596585}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice puzzle + platformer", "timestamp_created": 1404466833, "timestamp_updated": 1404466833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11044798": {"recommendationid": "11044798", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964098736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1404370267}, "language": "english", "review": "A puzzle platformer game that mostly depends on magnetism.

You will not be disappointed with this title.\n\nIt does have it's flaws. For example, the character you play as dies by one hit of any enemy or lethal obstacle. During Platforming Segments, everytime you die, you end up in one of the games (thankfully plentiful) checkpoints. During Boss Segments however, if you die, you have to start the whole fight from the very beginning. This is a pretty regular thing in platformers, but the thing is, one hit from literally any attack of the boss, will cause your character to die. Meaning bosses take a bit longer than they should until you get their patterns just right. This does become a bit tedious with a certain boss.\n\nThen there's some physic shenanigans, but those are actually part of what makes some of the puzzles in the game genuinly difficult, but not impossible to solve.\n\nThe thing I loved about this game is that it tells it's story with no dialogue, what so ever.

Plus, Mages with Tesla-inspired powers/weapons, who wouldn\u2019t want that?\n\nThe Steam page doesn\u2019t lie though that some of it\u2019s puzzles are keyboard-smashing frustrating, although it shouldn\u2019t be so proud about that\u2014they were frustrating not because I couldn\u2019t figure out the solution, but rather because the solution was difficult to put into action, being either so tedious or requiring more precision than at least my controller afforded me. I think all of these puzzles were towards the very end of the game for the most part, and didn\u2019t occupy the majority of my experience (the vast majority of puzzles were really fun to think through). One last frustrating thing is the \u2018one hit, you\u2019re dead.\u2019 For the most part this isn\u2019t too much of an issue, and you always start at a safe point (typically the beginning of a room) when you die, but let\u2019s just say there are very specific points in the game where starting over again and again is really annoying (spoiler: [spoiler]the last two boss fights[/spoiler]), and it\u2019s be a lot nicer if there was a \u2018three strike\u2019 system or something like that.\"[/i]\n\nLooking back probably five months after I beat the game, I'm still excited for learning more about the world in future installments (which I believe the dev team has mentioned they have in store).

Your town, Electropia is overun by The Corrupt Kings men, and it's up to you to bring The King down, who hides in the Storm Palace.\n\nThis game is done simple, but effective. Your progress is impeded until you explore for power ups such as the glove, that changes Positive and Negative which helps you manipulate magnets to lift doors, the Boots that shoots you forward like a bolt of lightning which helps you cross long gaps, etc.\n\nLess is More is a theme with this game. You start by running from home to a palace where you are chased to, and it explains the story with theatre (That you can choose to watch. It's optional). Other than that, you are solving puzzles and you quickly learn how to make progress. To go UP. During this time, you find scrolls that vaguely tells you the story, and seems like a collectable until you reach the final part of the game, where you need a minimum of 15. I don't know about anyone else, but I had 20 scrolls when I got to this part of the game, and it elongated the game for me knowing that I may need to get all the scrolls. If you rush through the entire game, you'll surely miss scrolls. It's a game that you can play at YOUR pace. \n\nThe scenery, the music, the subtle story telling, the Less is More emphasis, everything was made very well, but because of this, the only reason you have to play this game for more than 20 minutes is the art since it slowly teaches you everything you need to do over time and it's understandable if you get bored of this concept over time. This game didn't have an instruction manual that'll tell you the story and what abilities will be available to you over the game like Super Metroid. You're going in blind, hoping for an enjoyable experience. From first hand experience, I did find this enjoyment.

Through the pouring rain, a face can be seen peeking from the bundle; it's a young child. The man leaves the boy with a woman, [i]his mother?[/i], and leaves for parts unknown. Time passes, the boy grows, he is still but a child. Men come. They come for him. They force their way in, but the boy has already leapt through his bedroom window, onto the rain slicked rooftops. He runs. They chase.\n\n\nThe opening moments of Teslagrad set a tantalizing stage for what is to come. Dark and alone, silence from all but the storm and the racing footsteps of your pursuers. Upon reaching the tower, the promise of a grandiose adventure is all but assured. for all of its visual splendor, and the mystery surrounding the world, in the end, Teslagrad emerges as a beast only slightly greater than the sum of its often lacking parts. \n\nThe tower you will explore is filled with wondrous architecture, artwork and snippets of a tale of partnership, a burgeoning lust for power, and betrayal that followed. You'll discover more of the story of Teslagrad as you climb the tower, solving increasingly complex puzzles. Unfortunately, this complexity often comes more from the mechanics, than from the puzzle's ability to test your wit. The theme of Teslagrad is magnetism, and you soon earn greater abilities in pursuit of its control. Puzzles typically consist of moving blocks or repelling your way higher. Issues arise in that everything has its own physics, and pieces that you may need to move a specific way can be difficult to place, and not for lack of trying. Later puzzles even rely on your ability to repel yourself off of moving objects. Now while this sort of thing is of no real concern in a title such as Portal, in Teslagrad, the danger is far more apparent, and being hit even once will kill you and reset the portion of level that you're in. \n\nIn the majority of cases, this isn't a serious problem, as there are often checkpoints near more difficult segments, and even the most frustrating puzzles shouldn't occupy your time for more than twenty minutes. The real trouble occurs during any of the number of boss battles in the game, all of which suffer the dreaded [i]three hits to kill motif[/i]. Should any of these bosses' attacks hit you, it's back to the very beginning of each fight, leading to frustrating exercises of trial and error. The bosses can take up an unhealthy portion of your time in Teslagrad, and this is especially true one of the last bunch, who fails to exhibit a truly discernible pattern, due to the game giving physics to every moveable object. \n\nEven with the frustrating boss encounters, and sometimes irritating puzzle design, the sheer beauty of the scenery often manages to quell the rising feelings of annoyance. As you progress, you will be treated to story elements in the form of short puppet plays, all of which lack dialogue, but are arguably stronger without, anyway. The mystery of your predicament is the greatest driving force in Teslagrad, as without it, I imagine many would quit at one of several specific points I can recall.\n\nLastly, as I feel it should be mentioned, the metroidvania aspect, and how much it pertains to the gameplay as a whole. You can go back and explore any room you've been previously, and there are indeed hidden pathways and secrets. These secrets come in the form of collectible cards, of which you will need to find 15 to even complete the game. And when I say \"complete\", I mean reach the credits, because to find the true ending, you must collect all 36 missing cards hidden all throughout the map. This sounds fun, and in most Vania style games, it is. But in Teslagrad, many poorly designed puzzles are not meant to be run backwards, and this can make exploration difficult.\n\nEven as I complain of the gameplay elements, I still look fondly on Teslagrad for its story, visuals and unique attempt at magnetic manipulation, as flawed as some of it may be. And while I've beaten the game and seen the vanilla ending, I'm sure I will spend an equal amount of time gathering the remaining cards to see what secrets might be waiting for me at the end. I wholeheartedly recommend Teslagrad, flaws and all, for its incredible visual design and world that is far too grandiose and exciting to be brought down by the occasional, but potent, frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1402037001, "timestamp_updated": 1402090594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.63054656982421875", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10351157": {"recommendationid": "10351157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054713049", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 684, "last_played": 1401932819}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first heard about Teslagrad, I was excited; a dystopian-style story about a boy who lives in a world greatly influenced by Nikola Tesla's ideals and inventions. Beyond this, I had no opinion or thoughts. Really, it just seemed like a cool idea to me at the time.\nThen I got the opportunity to buy and play the game. Initially, I was disappointed. Even after I lowered by childishly-set standards to some more realistic ones, the game seemed clunky and unnecessarily unforgiving. The mechanics start bare-bone--far more than the average game--and this was a little off-putting. However, despite the lackluster first looks, the story possesses a bit of charm and reveals itself to be (possibly) much larger and deeper than what it tells you, and this successfully keeps me interested.\nAfter playing the game for an extended amount of time, the mechanics changed for the better (as games usually do) and the storytelling changed for the worse (as games usually don't). More options to solving problems become available the farther the player gets through the game, and although the variation of problems to solve is a bit dry, it holds its own for a game of its size and scope. Unfortunately, especially in the middle 75% of the game, the story is practically non-existent, only being available through collectible scrolls (which, I might add, are somewhat difficult to collect). Tidbits of the overall plot can be inferred by curious landmarks and etchings throughout the journey, but these provide only a slight amount of the story.\nIn the end, Teslagrad allows itself the lee-way of scarce storytelling due to its eccentric nature, and again thanks to its nature it thrives as a tenant of the indie genre. In this review, I did not mention the art nor the story because neither are outstanding or poor. just regular.

The presentation is fantastic; the art and the music are great, the way the story is told works effectively enough as well. The puzzles are generally very well crafted though there is the occasional slip into tedium, but not very often, though often enough to be noticeable. The puzzles never really repeat themselves over the 3-4 hours it takes to complete the main game, so there's plenty of variety even if the end result is a tad on the short side. I also wish there was a bit better way to navigate around the map, as the central tower helps but can still result in a fair bit of time spent getting back to some rooms when looking for the secrets. The secrets themselves are also generally well-handled, never overly challenging though a few of them rely on luck due to the physics. \nIf I had to call out one especially weak part of the game though, it's certainly the boss fights. They're not really that hard, no, but the problem is that you end up dying repeatedly trying to learn what all the boss does, because if you don't know what's coming often you won't have the time to react. The final boss is probably the only exception to this but replaces this instead with tedium; one phase is hard to figure out but trivial once you know what to do; one phase basically exists to kill time with attacks that are incredibly easy to dodge; and one phase can get you stuck in an impossible situation the third time it repeats if you're unlucky enough. The flaws of the game aren't enough to bring it down entirely as the majority of the game is quite an enjoyable experience, but it does knock the game down in my favor a small degree.

For a Metroidvania, this is a no-go, as you have to rely on your map ingame, to see, where you are and where you want to go.\nAlso mapping your controller buttons feels unintuitive when they're called JoyA8+ or JoyB2, yet this is a minor flaw. Native controller support came in with a patch and works quite well!\n\nThese flaws might be present, but overall the sensation of exploring the tower, finding new abilities and scrolls without the interruption of annoying \"Press A to jump\" tutorials prevails.

I suppose unless you release on the consoles today, you\u2019ll be forgotten. This is a PC exclusive title as of this writing. I'll be the first to admit it\u2019s easy to pass over yet another Indie puzzle platformer, but Teslagrad stands out from the crowd. The game looks so good I can barely believe it was made by a studio this size. It\u2019s hard to not praise the visuals when they\u2019re as good or even better than something straight from Ubisoft\u2019s UbiArt Framework games, (Rayman Origins, Valiant Hearts, Child of Light)\n\nEven more impressive is the depth to every visual you see. Teslagrad follows the old adage of, \u201cShow, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d. In fact there\u2019s not a single word of dialogue throughout the entire game, yet you\u2019ll uncover the history and story entirely through its artwork.  Artifacts and paintings adorn all the rooms and help you paint your own picture of who you are, and why you\u2019re here. Broken equipment, and death still lingers in the tower, from a battle not too long ago.\n\nRight away you\u2019ll be thrown into the deep end and forced to survive a series of difficult platforming sections. You will soon be complimented by an assortment of gear which you\u2019ll use to manipulate the world around you. Puzzles take the form of Red vs Blue magnetic fields, and you\u2019ll often be forced into interweave the puzzles with precision platforming. I was stumped more than once throughout the game, and have had quite a few sections with 30+ deaths. While it\u2019s not another Super Meat Boy, this can certainly be a challenging game at times, which will test your patience. \n\nChances are if you ever read my review it\u2019s because Teslagrad will be on sale at 85% on some Steam sale long down the road. It\u2019s honestly too cheap. They could have released it at $15 or even $20 for the amount of work and polish put into it. Definitely an underrated gem.", "timestamp_created": 1391651687, "timestamp_updated": 1391651687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502504885196685791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8976364": {"recommendationid": "8976364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032526643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1391282327}, "language": "english", "review": " Teslagrad is a game we first came across at the recent Eurogamer expo in London. We were drawn to it by its unique look and the fact it seemed to be full of clever play mechanics and traps. It\u2019s now finally with us and we can explore the mystery of a small boy with magnetic powers escaping into a castle after being chased by some Rasputin-esque looking pursuers.\n\nThe game has a style that though familiar we haven\u2019t really seen before. The Soviet influence reminds us of steam punk animations and fairy tales from the Eastern Bloc and it works perfectly to set up a mysterious and unique atmosphere. There is also very little text with the story and controls explained via drawings and animated theatre puppets. The silence further intensifies the mystery (even if the lack of tutorial is a little confusing).\n\nThere is gamepad support but you\u2019ll have to set it up manually. Again, this can be a little odd at the beginning of the game as you don\u2019t really know what half of the commands are. Once you get it sorted out though it\u2019s a much easier way to play as you\u2019re going to need very quick reflexes to get through.\n\nTeslagrad is a difficult game and it requires sustained amounts of quick thinking, jumping and precision placement to get through most sections. Most of the time you are trying to avoid dropping onto spikes or electricity but there are also some shadowy beasts and mechanical enemies to avoid from time to time. You don\u2019t really have any offense so you\u2019ll be darting past them and running away a lot.\n\nOur little hero is far from powerless though and you\u2019ll soon find the equipment that gives you the use of a unique set of powers. First off you\u2019ll get the positive and negative magnetism glove. This allows you to change the charge of magnetic services and blocks. This means you can get blocks to move or fall, or use opposite charges to propel yourself up tunnels or across chasms. The next thing you\u2019ll find is the ability to \u2018blink\u2019 or teleport a short distance. This is vital for passing barriers or dodging enemies and moving electrical fields. Before long you\u2019re having to bounce around and blink all at once in sequences that require constant movement. It\u2019s tough and challenging and certain sections will be repeated over and over and over.\n\nDying is perhaps where the biggest weakness in the game lies. The controls can feel a little twitchy at times and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been so frustrated by a character auto-climbing up a ledge they\u2019ve grabbed onto. Death can also feel unfair with the blink ability very difficult to judge while in motion. What compounds the issue is that if you miss a jump or die, there are times you\u2019ll have to repeat quite a large section to get back to where you were. Don\u2019t even get us started on some of the bosses that just never seem to die either.\n\nFrustration aside this is a very clever and well crafter game. You do get used to the controls and both the level and graphical design is of a standard that makes you want to persevere and get to the next section. The constant climb up the castle and gradual revelation of the mystery within it are engaging and will likely keep you striving until you reach the end. There will be some gamers who just won\u2019t be able to cut it though and that\u2019s a shame as this is a beautiful fairy tale that you really should try.\n\nOverall 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1391543490, "timestamp_updated": 1391543490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500040888786315918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8959913": {"recommendationid": "8959913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117034966", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 650, "last_played": 1391849517}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game that reminds me of Metroid.

I remember first seeing Teslagrad on multiple websites such as RockPaperShotgun and Polygon back when the game first showed up but back then I didn't really payed much attention to it. Teslagrad takes you to a soviet-esc setting as you play as a little boy running towards a big tower and it's in that tower where the magic will happen. The graphic style is absolutely gorgeous and the animation qualtity hits just the right spot for me. The soundtrack is engaging and charming and has it's amazing moments at key points of the game. The plot is very mysterious but as you progress everything slowly starts making sense as, one of the really cool things about it is that there's no dialogue or text in the game so the story is told basicly by what you see and what the game shows you. Besides the standard jumping, Teslagrad puzzles are solved by changing the polarity of certain magnets, red or blue, later on you acquire a cloak which will let you manipulate gravity to some extent like using the opposite color to propel yourself into the air and eventually you'll also gain the ability to flash, or teleport, the way you're facing. All of these represent a very important role in the puzzle solving. When you're inside the tower you basicly need to solve various puzzles located on rooms on both sides of the tower in order to unlock the next level of the tower, until you eventually reach the top and in the end you end up facing your nemesis. It's also worth mentioning the game has 2 endings, one which is always achieved and the second one which people like to call \"secret\" or \"real\" ending and in order for you to get this ending you need to collect all 36 scrolls that are spread throughout the entire tower.

Teslagrad's shining star is Game Design. All of the gameplay is created with 2-3 core mechanics and magnetic physics laws.

You're doing the same thing over and over, yelling at the screen, trying to figure out this puzzle that people have probably solved in a matter of seconds. Well, Teslagrad does things right to make this sweet little puzzle game flow just right.\n\nLets talk about the puzzles. Are the puzzles hard? I haven't even finished the game yet, and I can tell you, yes, the puzzles are hard. Sometimes it's logic puzzles, what goes where, what do you do, how do you use these new mechanics you just discovered. Sometimes it's reaction puzzles, a race against time, split second movements and challenges, punishing you if you hesitate or even think too long. Sometimes, oh sometimes, it's both. And these puzzles always feel new and fresh, while being introduced at the correct time, slowly introduced to you, developing your skills so, when faced with a puzzle, you know you CAN do it if you just figure out how. This slow build up actually rather fits with the story.\n\nThe story. Not many puzzle games really put much thought into their stories. It's just something to drive the action along, it's silly or laclustre. Usually, games don't actually try to portray a story using only visual clues while keeping the entire game silent (in terms of voice acting at least). In Teslagrad, you won't struggle through massive cutscenes of exposition where one person talks at you about the world just to try and flesh out the game. Yes there are, as I like to think of them, \"background shows\" in certain places, where you see the history as a silent puppetshow, but if you want to you CAN ignore them and they never feel intrusive.\n\nOn a more personal plot, the character develops with you. A silent protagonist is wonderful to project onto, and that is what you can do best with the main character. He learns as you learn, he make mistakes as you make mistakes. Without a single line of dialogue you can't help but sense a kind of developing strength in him with every overcome challenge. The character themself doesn't get more powerful, you don't have offensive attacks, but you as a player get smarter, so the character on screen feels stronger. It's rather wonderful.\n\nI will be fair. There are a few bad parts of the game, there always will be. Sometimes the bosses suffer from a lack of explanation, and yes, there are bosses in this puzzle game. They are most likely some of the worst moments of the game, but that doesn't make them as attrocious as that sounds. They just don't have the fluidity and strengths that the rest of the game has. Even then, their difficulty makes you feel truly stronger once they are defeated. I never found the bosses a deal breaker however, I was just glad to see the back of them.\n\nI have read, in other reviews, that the collectibles I have been snatching up as I play, are actually somewhat necessary to finishing the game. Some see this as a bad thing, I'm a little hesitant to support this idea in the game, but I would also ask this. Why weren't you going for them in the first place? I saw a collectible and went for it for the challenge, to see what this little secret was. If you don't go for at least the occasional collectible... you're not really testing yourself. That is just what I wished to say.\n\nIn conclussion... buy this game if you want something fun, cheap, and honestly puzzling without being being so punishing as to seem impossible. This game will become hard, there is no denying that, but you will learn, you will develop.

I could not have been more wrong, and I'm so glad to have this as part of my library now.\n\nThe traditionally hand-drawn artwork and ambient music is combined wonderfully with silent storytelling, to create a very charming world. You play as a young boy that starts off escaping from an invasion and onto a journey inside a mysterious tower. There's a slightly haunting atmosphere that develops as you continue to explore and uncover the story of a twisted King and what had transpired in the past to lead up to this point.\n\nThe platforming is simply gratifying. You use electromagnetic powers to dash, float, and climb your way through the fascinating environments. However, although there is little backtracking in the main game, completionists should be aware that if you wish to collect all the scrolls scattered around, it's quite unfortunate that the map is so unhelpful.\n\nThe controls feel very polished and responsive, and even though some parts (mainly, the unforgiving boss fights) had me borderline frustrated at times, there were no cases where I felt like I didn't know what to do to succeed. The puzzles are interesting and challenging, constantly pushing players to test the limits of what's been learned.

It is obviously all hand-drawn and is quite beautiful. However, as it stands, it is plagued by so many gameplay issues that it just isn't fun.\n\nThink of Metroid, in that game, you have at least somewhat some freedom to explore. In this game? Strictly linear. Also, backtracking is pointless and you might do it inadvertently when the one path to continue is undiscovered, wasting A LOT OF TIME FOR NOTHING.\n\nAlso, the puzzles are very annoying. VERY annoying AND frustrating. You die in one hit. You then need to redo ALL the blighted platforms all over again, or redo the damn repetitive bossfight pattern all over again. And again. And again. Until 1- You trial-and-error memorise the movement patterns PERFECTLY and avoid the myriad of one-hit deaths or 2- You yell f*** it and stop playing this unfun and boring game. It's not challenging or intense like Dark Souls, its just frustrating, feels broken and tedious. To be honest, the bosses just really feel out of place here. This is a puzzle game, so combat feels weird and clunky.\n\nAs for the music, while it is pretty at first, the tracks are very short loops and you'll be darned fed up real quick after you're respawned at the beginning of the section for the damned 10th time. And its a bit strange how some areas are devoid of music, then you enter a new area and TADAH a melodic tune. Why not have a unique tune for each area? Or a more elongated and captivating tune? And as for the sound effects... just meh. The Fox McCloud dash is a really cool feature, but the electric SFX really annoyed me. Is it enjoyable to have electric noise constantly in a game? The answer is simply, NO.\n\nAs much as I appreciate art in games and I highly promote it, I also cannot recommend a game that fails on so many levels to give a fun or interesting experience. You might be more patient than I, but if you don't have a lot of time to respawn countless times, or you don't have a controller, give this game a skip. At the very least, buy it when its on sale to encourage this developper to make a new game that surpasses this one's many flaws.\n\nSo yeah, 5 points for excellent art, 1 point for cool dash feature and some few fun puzzles, but -4 points for frustrating gameplay, repetiveness and control wonkiness and complete linearity despite a big metroidvania map structure.\n\nFinal note : playtest your game and find those sections that piss them off.

Outland, by Housemarque also use the same mechanic as well for their game. What makes Teslagrad different from the latter titles is that the game is not a shooter, but a platform puzzel game using electricity and magnetism to get through stages. The futher you go along, the more your reflexes gets tested, so does your thought process. And believe it or not, it happens rather quickly than you think. Now, on to the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros-\n\n-Amaing artwork and animation. Never seen anything like it using the Unity engine. The backgrounds have a watercolor feel to it.\n\n-Great use of SFX and music. Everything fits with the world, and well mixed.\n\n-Great use of the save feature. It leaves you where you left off.\n\n-Stage design. very well design, and it doesn't feel boring and uninspired.\n\n-Cons\n\n-Controls feels floaty at times, but not annoying\n\n-Camera. It needs to be pulled out. In certain areas, you'll have no idea where to go becasue you can't see the stage at times. You only can pan up or down, but not left or right. This becomes an issue after the second boss fight. You encounter a room where you can see futher ahead and not know when to jump off. And by jumping off randomly, you'll encounter death.  \n\nWith all that said, this game is amazing, and it was the best way to start the New Year for me.", "timestamp_created": 1388831631, "timestamp_updated": 1388831631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500017702579498291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8520116": {"recommendationid": "8520116", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971950119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1388945364}, "language": "english", "review": "A nod to the olden days of pixel perfect gaming.\nImmediately upon starting Teslagrad evokes a notion of nostalgia. The controls are simple, but robust. You never blame the game for dying. The art is magnificent and full of little gems.

Although I got a feeling of satisfaction when i finally beat them, they ended up feeling too repetetive in the long run. Especially since some of their cues were a bit hard to read at times and the different phases of each boss came pretty abruptly, which made it hard to adapt and evade on the first try. \n\nThe story is sparse, but cute. If you dont pay attention to it, it seems non existant. However what is there, is very well made, very clear and very enjoyable. \n\nAll in all, Telsagrad is an incredibly good first title from Rain Games.

It's got a gorgeous hand drawn art style, solid platforming (I especially like the tele-zap boots), and interesting puzzles and boss fights. You are a boy in a town being invaded by a red army, fleeing across rooftops until you enter a mysterious tower, which you must face many a challenge to reach the top and get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding it. \n\nThere's no text, the story is neatly rolled out over the game via paintings, automated plays, and just by observing the beautiful environments around you. It's a great example of how a story can be told through other more interesting means than by walls of text or dialogue. While it's style reminds me of Braid, there's a big contrast: Where Braid seemed to keep it's convulated story in little rooms between levels to glimpse at (\"pretentious\" comes to mind), but Telsagrad has a fairly simple story told piece by piece until you get to the part where you come in.\n\nThe gameplay consists of platforming and using your magnet powers to solve physics puzzles. You unlock more powers which results in new more challenging puzzles. You can punch blocks to change their polarity, (negative or positive) teleport a short distance, and take stock of your own polarity. The possibilities here are fully explored with the large amount of puzzles.  The bosses in this game can be puzzles in themself and really try your skill at your newly gained abilities throughout the game and are satisfying because of that.\n\nMy only real problem was the diffulty and redudance of some areas. While there are plenty of checkpoints, you die from any damage. Expect to do some areas a lot of times. And sometimes just falling off means trecking back a distance. And some of the bosses are controllers snappingly frustrating. Since there are no checkpoints during bosses, and they in themselves are puzzles, you'll die figuring out how to counter their next move. This lead to numerous deaths and a lot of frustration. But this is definitely not a deal breaker.\n\nIf there's any justice, Telsagrad will get a spot in the lime light with the other indie champions like Fez or Limbo, because it deserves it.

The art and animation are some of the most superb I've seen in a 2D platformer. It's also challenging, a rare treat for a 2D platformer at this point I think.\n\nThe developers took care not to let tutorials break the flow of gameplay. Most information the player needs to know, either about the controls, story, or world is conveyed through the back and foregrounds. That\u2019s something I greatly appreciate and wish more developers attempted.  \n\nIt has an adequate world to build on that is extrapolated on just enough to keep it interesting and fresh. It's not very long, maybe about 6 hours if you're taking your time, a little longer if you get all the extra items. \n\nIn addition to all that, it has a very catchy soundtrack that doesn't get old regardless of how often you have to reattempt a puzzle.\n\nIn spite of all that, I can't see the game remaining very memorable. Its charming as hell, but for one reason or another it doesn't have staying power. \n\nIf you like 2D platformers, you\u2019ll probably enjoy this, but I imagine your feelings will end up similar to mine, eventually.\n", "timestamp_created": 1387437019, "timestamp_updated": 1387437019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500017702579498291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8110014": {"recommendationid": "8110014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008062676", "num_games_owned": 860, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 133, "last_played": 1400048364}, "language": "english", "review": "Full Video Review at http://www.youtube.com/BrbteabreakTV\n\nhttp://youtu.be/YkAn7JhISaA\n\nOutstanding art, kickass soundtrack, solid controls, awesome game mechanics, and did I mention a bit of science thrown in for good measure? Well that's Teslagrad, a 2D puzzle platformer where you use magnetism and other electromagnetic powers to explore the Tesla tower.\n\nGo buy this game, if you for some reason you're on the fence at spending $10 on this awesome game keep on reading.\n\nPuzzle platformers usually require 1-2 unique elements to help separate itself from its competitors, now while Teslagrad has these unique elements; it's the cohesion between all these elements which pulls the game ahead. You have to use all your abilities in order to solve the puzzles, which increase in difficulty and scale as the game progresses. It's in a Castlevania style and you can backtrack whenever you want, which you need to do if you want to get 100%. Backtracking is not a daunting task as you may think as the levels are constructed in a way so that the 2nd time through with your new abilities you can explore new areas and have an easier time getting through some of the puzzles.\n\nThe storytelling is also a strong point, with no spoken dialogue and no text the storytelling is done visually. While these are usually hit or miss in Teslagrad case it\u2019s a hit and lets you have a unique experience.\n\nThe art style is something you have to truly see in action to fully enjoy, it's a mix of steampunk and realism, with many of the buildings giving this mid 1800s feel. Animation quality for the most part is high and they seem to match the time in which the game is set.  It boasts amazing lighting effects which are seen as you use your electromagnetic powers, or fighting a massive furnace trying to burn you to cinders.\n\nNow while there's no deep options menu the lighting effects can be toned down which is where most of your performance issues will arise, it's also not capped at 60FPS (THANK YOU!!!) and runs fairly well even on my toilet of a machine. Keys are fully rebindable and it supports a gamepad. \n\nThen we get to the soundtrack, which is kind of amazing. These simple compositions choreograph amazingly with the backdrops; they're disturbingly beautiful as they give you this eery feeling while still being a treat for the ears. The sound assets are just as strong and certain sounds such as rain, which may be in the room next to you can be heard and increase in volume and intensity as you approach it, small things like that add to the atmosphere of Teslagrad.\n\nHighly recommended for all puzzle platforming fans and it should still peak your interest even if you're new to the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1387410784, "timestamp_updated": 1391436714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59820711612701416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8104817": {"recommendationid": "8104817", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986311722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1387223038}, "language": "english", "review": "Teslagrad by Rain Games is definitely one of the tightest platformers I've played in many years. Right off the bat this game strikes me as a high quality game. The visuals reminds me of Braid, which sets me in the mood straight away. The art through out the whole game is just stunning. The artist(s?) is working in harmony with the overall vision of the game it seems. It's subtle, not too detailed to maintain the cartoony style of it and the animations are AMAZING. I can't stress the animations enough. Right after I have started a new game, it very smoothly transitions me into the game, and after about a minute the amazing animations of the creepy, small red dude BLOWS me away. KEY FRAMES GUYS.\n\nThe gameplay itself is challenging. I think the mechanics are very nicely presented to the player. The mechanics are simple in design, which allows for SO many opportunities when it comes to level design. And this is where the level designers have done an excellent job. It's a lot of fun doing the puzzles that are presented because the levels are structured in such a nice way. The mechanics are playing with each other. Often you'll see these tiny magnetically charged creatures wander around, and just by seeing the direction at which they are headed, one can figure out the puzzle even before they have gotten to their destination.\n\nA lot of content as well. And a LOT of cudos goes out to the game designers who have designed the boss encounters, because they are AWESOME. Challenging, and always taking the mechanic exploration to a whole new level. JUST at the right time for me personally. You manage to get me sufficiently involved and known with the mechanic, and then presenting a boss encounter to me. This way, I'm familiar with the mechanic, but not familiar enough to beat a boss at the first try. This requires skill as a designer, and you, my dear and fellow designers have MADE IT.\n\nGo buy this game. Go play this game.

Extremely dissappointed that the laser array at the top of the elevator is active ALL THE TIME, even after the obnoxious eyeball flies right through the damn thing. I was expecting to be done with it after I got the scroll, but that switch only activates the scrolls elevator, not the lasers. Which is ridiculous.\nBirdboss was nice up until the bombs. I especially liked the part where you zap inside it and punch its heart, and then it gets struck by lightning. The bombs though... Why are they homing timed bombs that explode on touch? I could understand any two of those, but all three is just being a dick, especially with that explosion radius.  \n\nI can only hope that you don't have to do the entire eyeball boss from the start if you mess up on the frankly idiotic segment where it manages to still attempt to kill you in freefall, and I can't help but think that whole part was only added so you're not watching it and the character fall for a solid minute and a half because there is nothing worth seeing all the way down.\n\nAll in all it seems like it's one of those 1 hitpoint games just because the added difficulty of a health system would be too much work, or making the animations of the character getting zapped but surviving would diminish the oh so very very dramatic storytelling.\nMore than a little let down that you can never on any occassion make two enemies different polarities and watch them try to untangle themselves, or at least change one polarity and make your own match so they struggle with an invisible wall\n\n\n\n\n\nNot worth full price, 50% or below is probably more accurate.

That's right Teslagrad is a knowledge based puzzle game that is all about trial and error, and if you think you'll get through this game without much of the error part, you are wrong. Simple as that. But as you upgrade your science based super powers the reward becomes well worth all of the frustration.\n\nGraphics\n\nTeslagrad as a very unique art style that mixes an eastern europe setting with a little steampunk meets Tesla action.And Though \"graphics\" aren't the strongest point of the game I will say that the engine's use of physics of Teslagrad give it an unmistakeable charm.\n\nAudio\n\nFrom the music to the electric buzz of the tesla coil barriers the sounds in this game are spot on! and I didn't feel like I over-reacted one bit in having turned the master volume all the way to 100%. Now, there's no real dialogue in the game and the story is told through some pretty awesome puppeteering sections, but the lack of voices adds to the charm kinda like the old Pixar  films from the early 90S.\n\nGameplay\n\nRemember what I was saying about Falcon punching? The reason for that is that Teslagrad is knowledge based game without many clues (though their are some) to help you along. The only way to truelysucceed is by trial and error. I bring this up because some people don't particularly like that style of game play, but if you are willing to give it shot and stick with it, you will not go unrewarded.\n\nVerdict\n\nFor me the game is a definite buy, and I don't regret the purchase at all, and even though I bought it on the release sale for 20% off, that lasts until Dec 20th buy the way. I feel like I would enjoyed the game non-the-less and been satisfied by the normally $10 price tag.

Also it has great boss battles even thought there is only a couple they are very memorable.

Rain falls in torrents, molten steel glows ominously in the depths of the tower in which you explore, and electricity crackles and hums. It's a world of mechanical beasts that can destroy you in a moment, of dangerous traps and puzzles, of strange gadgets and weird machinery, and at the heart of this world is you and the Tower\n\nFleeing into this mysterious Tower, you'll work your way through its many rooms and floors, each offering new and inventive puzzles and obstacles to surmount. The game doesn't waste any time in throwing complex platforming puzzles at you; within the first 30 minutes or so, you'll already be equipped with a gauntlet able to reverse an object's polarity and blink boots that allow you to teleport a short distance. The puzzles and platforming all revolve around utilizing and switching between magnetic fields, causing objects to attract or repel. In this way, you turn platforms into barriers or elevators, move along ceilings or float over gaps, and more. Surviving the challenges require both puzzle solving and tight platforming as you time teleports between moving hazards or switch your own polarity to navigate around electric barriers. Hard to reach batteries offer replay value, as there's usually an optional extra challenge between you and the collectibles.\n\nI'm only about two and half hours in at the moment. If there was one minor flaw, it would be the lack of checkpoints in boss fights. While these fights simply revolve around pattern recognizaton and aren't that lengthy, it can be annoying to die and have to start fighting a boss from the beginning. But the boss fights themselves are fun and varied and use the mechanics in cool ways. Controls are responsive and simple, WASD to move, Space to jump, arrow keys to use your abilities. But from those simple controls, Rain Games has crafted a fun and challenging puzzle platfformer that not only offers exciting gameplay but a fantastic art style as well\n\nI'll update this review as I progress", "timestamp_created": 1386959876, "timestamp_updated": 1387743749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 513, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.962511777877807617", "comment_count": 42, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1171, "total_negative": 243, "total_reviews": 1414}, "cursors": {"AoJw+oXQ9sICccTRHg==": "Thu Nov 23 14:31:55 2023"}}
