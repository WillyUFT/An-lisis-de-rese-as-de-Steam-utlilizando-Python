Here it's even more pronounced, because on one hand you have some really nice puns in the flavour text of items, on the other some mechanics/keywords are described downright wrong (misleading). Speaking of puns, there is an amount of poop/fart jokes which might raise an eyebrow, but it fits okay with the overall lighthearted theme.\n\nThe game itself is a slow burner... which might be said about most horde survival roguelites with metaprogression, but this feeling is somehow stronger here. If you stick through the first few hours though, hopefully you'll start to discover there is an addictive and decently designed experience to be had here. Achievements are less difficult than what the descriptions sound like and don't require much farming. There is effectively only one kind of map with no features other than trees; on the flip side the amount of weapons to choose from is huge.

However it isn't because it's a bad game it's for the poor translation and English support making it difficult to figure out some of the things you need to do and the fact that the developers uploaded the games soundtrack to youtubes content ID system so most videos that could help you get taken down. \n\nThis is another survivors clone with the twist being that everything is like 2.5d, The weapons and synergies are okay if difficult to maintain and upgrade the ones you want to keep. The characters are all unique and have their own little 2 page comic story. The music isn't terrible and I didn't find myself getting annoyed our muting it in the 22 or so hours it took me to 100% the game. Some replay-ability via endless mode. Lastly the game is done (I believe) It isn't in early access and the developers haven't mentioned future updates (though they did release a post completion content update a few months ago). That may not be important to many but it's nice to be able to say you're done and uninstall a game and not have to reinstall it half a year later because more content was added and now you don't have full completion. In the end despite being conflicted I'm going to recommend this game if you like the survivors / bullet hell style of game play but I also recommend waiting until it's on sale, plenty of other games in the genre will give you more play time for a lower price point.

The sense of progression is also sorely lacking, it feels more like getting your *** kicked over and over and over again rather than getting somewhere, even if you win. That's not to say that the game is too difficult but more like there are \"stat\" checks more than anything else. \n\nAlso some abilities feel extremely weak among other things. It also sucks to not really know what combines into what with so many abilities that are already in the game and heaven forbid trying to save up for the most expensive abilities that you get later on. I don't think I've ever been able to afford them without using debt and that's not always a good idea because the RNG rerolls are COMPLETELY random. Now hear me out, you might be saying that they are supposed to be random, but no game is ever truly random. There will be code that is in the background to steer the game closer to giving you what you want to use but oooohhhh boooyyy not in this game.

The RNG is too strong. In order to upgrade, every slot is just a gotcha machine. You spend gold to refresh what you can get... it's not bad if the options are limited. But no, there are too many options, making trying to roll the one you want very difficult.\n\n2. There's no Combo-book like VS or any way to check the combos you discovered. Yes, even if you somehow experimented and found the combos that work, you better memorize them all because the game never tells you anything.\n\n3. Sometimes you keep rerolling the same 10-15 powers instead of all the powers (like 30-40). This makes it very painful because you spent like 100 gold rerolling them only to find the game refuse to give you anything else other than the ones you don't want/need. The Devs  NEED TO look into the RNG mechanism since this is their main mechanic.\n\n4. Either you over-power the mobs, or they over-power you, there is no in-between, especially on higher difficulty.\n\n5. The dmg tick way too fast for our characters. You try to get through a few mobs in front of you to grab the money? There goes your entire shield and half your health! Maybe give us like a 0.1 sec i-frame after getting hit?\n\nNormally for games like this I'd check back and update my comment/recommendation... but for this game I'm not sure if I'll play it again because playing it feels more like gambling than actually playing a game.", "timestamp_created": 1679634617, "timestamp_updated": 1681976011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629685401916503906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135279501": {"recommendationid": "135279501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420384025", "num_games_owned": 2094, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 899, "last_played": 1700635326}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a value for money & fun game although English translation has yet to be fully completed. \n\nUpdate: 26/3 Seems like its fully translated.", "timestamp_created": 1679628887, "timestamp_updated": 1700635342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562170028686523438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135228442": {"recommendationid": "135228442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044246844", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 834, "last_played": 1698663985}, "language": "english", "review": "Very few items are not yet translated, good time killer.", "timestamp_created": 1679575031, "timestamp_updated": 1679575031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135214844": {"recommendationid": "135214844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047194644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1679678426}, "language": "english", "review": "nice chill game", "timestamp_created": 1679557085, "timestamp_updated": 1679557085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135202818": {"recommendationid": "135202818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017129288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1681519917}, "language": "english", "review": "Would not recommend for english.

Not much balance in attacks and weapons, some are a million times better than others.\n2. Most of the characters are kinda \"meh\"\n3. Most character music is really short, so you get a little 30-second loop of music that plays every single run forever.\n4. Bugs, lots of bugs. The most annoying one is that when things get hectic enough, the game just gives up trying to play audio, so you can't tell when you're getting hit, it's just a dull kind of noise that plays instead of audio, kinda sounds like water.\n5. The talent tree is just a square, and everything connects to everything else, so there's not much customization on the part of the player, just a \"buy everything one by one and max it out\" wall.\n6. Controller gameplay ignores Steam's built-in deadzone, so unless your controller is made by God himself by hand, you're going to walk around randomly, you're going to jitter, you're going to move right into a boss's face, and the crypto \"skills\" all become worthless (they require you to stand in place.)", "timestamp_created": 1677823383, "timestamp_updated": 1677823383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508816123008728027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133957358": {"recommendationid": "133957358", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037235412", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1922, "last_played": 1685875205}, "language": "english", "review": "love the game, 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1677821779, "timestamp_updated": 1677821779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133920796": {"recommendationid": "133920796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078489826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 183, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1681329181}, "language": "english", "review": "It's very pretty for a VS-like.

There are three cooldown reductions: spells, summons, attacks and only one can be lowered to 25% (maximum number). \nThis \"railroaded\" my runs into focusing on attack, summoning or casting skills. But I didn't mind, especially since the characters signal pretty heavily what they're going to rely on through their stat bonuses and unique abilities. \nUnlike VS, skill combinations aren't optional. Every one offers huge bonuses that scale up at higher tiers. Each tier unlocks more skills and skill combinations. There's a lot of choice and it's fun to test new skills and discover strong combinations. \n\nThe skill names and descriptions are \"localized\" to reference jokes and memes. They didn't bother me, although some might not like it. There also is a lack of sound effects, this is a minor negative that wouldn't matter in every other VS-like, but since NWTL's art and graphic effects are so high quality it stands out a bit.\n\nIt's a good-looking, competently made, not-EA VS-like game with a fitting pricetag.

I dislike comparing one game with another but for the sake of similarity I ultimately love NWTL way more. \n\nAll of the characters feel different and even the builds feel different when you're using it on another character. They've got their own playstyle that caters to specific builds more or less like Gunfire Reborn just in 2D. I haven't gotten bored of the game yet after 7 hours in and I'm loving all of the characters. \n\nThe ONLY complaint I have is that my game freezes consistently and I have to close it to restart a run, I'm not sure if that's a bug or not considering my craptop is worthy enough to play this effortlessly. \n\nFor $5 with a bunch of replay value?

The talent meta-progression is way to fast. You won't play the game long enough if it goes that fast. A bit more grind would be good\n2. The story needs a english translation too\n3. I would love to see more meta progressions. Gamers like to have progression through different mechanics. It would be nice, if you could increase this, and add more unique meta progression and not just a talent skill.\n4. The music is nice and matching the game\n5. All core mechanics like auto aim, controller support, and auto attacks are working fine. \n6.  Otherwise the game is pretty nice and has rare mechanics like forging weapons/skills to new skills.

With a large pool of skills to choose from, each run presents a new opportunity to create the ultimate build and fight your way to godhood.\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience : [/b][/h1]\nOne of the standout features of Noobs Want to Live is its cast of multiple unique characters. Whether you prefer the sword master hero, the fireball totting maiden, a mechanically adept summoner, a great yellow canine who literally creates gold, or the master of bacon, there is a character to suit every player's style. Each character has their own unique set of skills, strengths, and weaknesses, making the game a fresh and exciting experience with each playthrough.\n\nThe game's graphics add to its overall appeal, with finely crafted cardboard cutout characters giving the game a unique and fun feel. As players progress through the game, they'll encounter monsters and obstacles that will put their skills to the test. They'll need to use their skills to blow up the screen with fireballs and black holes to survive and progress.\n\nOne of the game's key mechanics is the ability to master specific skills that create powerful synergies with one another. Peachville is not a town where 1+1 equals 2, it equals at least 4.5. Players will need to figure out which skills synergize well with one another to cause mayhem and destruction to progress through the game. With a large pool of skills to choose from, players will need to experiment with different combinations to find the perfect build for each character.\n\nThe game also offers players the ability to reroll their skills for a chance at an even more powerful build. Players can spend gold to reroll their skill selections, with each upgrade potentially taking them from a weak and vulnerable character to a powerful hero. Additionally, players can gain meta-progression in the shape of talent points to make their runs easier as they progress through the game.\n\n[h1][b][3] Verdict : [/b][/h1]\nNoobs Want to Live is a game that offers players an exciting and fresh roguelike experience with unique characters and powerful skill synergies. Its fast-paced gameplay and ever-changing builds make each run a new and thrilling adventure.

The art is really cute and colorful, a contrast to the darker and grimmer works and the retro feel of pixellation, and I enjoy the fun the developers are clearly having with the \"story\" comics, the names of weapons, and the nature of some of them, like a sheep that poops landmines for your enemies to step on.\n\nGameplay wise, it's interesting, but a bit of a mess with readability and tutorializing. Instead of gaining new weapons when you level up, you collect a currency, Silver, and then buy upgrades. You aren't stuck with a single upgrade, and can switch to different types of upgrades, depending on RNG, which means that you can use several different types of synergies or switch earlier ones to different upgrades that aren't available in the initial rarity tiers.\n\nThe problem is, it's hard to understand without any tutorials. I struggled to figure out I needed to buy upgrades, I wasn't aware that you have to play RNG to upgrade one spell in the same slot, and that there's so much Gold, a second currency, because you might need to reroll, reroll, and reroll, until you get that one upgrade you want to keep a synergy you like.\n\nStill, if it's improved, made more readable and explained better, I see it as an interesting direction to go in the Survivors-like, with the constantly changing arsenal and resource management, with not just having to rely on level ups.\n\nI can't explain it properly, it's not that complex a system, but like I said, difficult to explain for first timers.

If you liked VS, you might be looking at purchasing this differently stylized version of the game.\nIt's priced in the same area as VS and has many of the same elements that VS has and thus you may feel you'd have a similar experience. Let me break down how I feel about NWTL in its current state.\n\nI've played it a good chunk yesterday and today and I already can see certain things that VS has done right that NWTL hasn't (yet?). Confusion and excitement.\n\nGames like these can be VERY confusing. There's so much flying around on the screen that it's hard to tell whats friendly and what isn't. What you can walk through and what you can't. With VS I thought sometimes things can be confusing and wished it were better but in NWTL it's far, far worse. \nIf you play summons for example, anything you summon looks the same as the enemies, your brain can't immediately tell that it won't hurt you if you walk through it. You'll find yourself moving around your own summons and this hurts gameplay.\nThings you can and can't walk through are more discernible in this game so you don't need to worry about that as much.\nALERT areas can be confusing if they're also your own. You'll think you can't be in the area or you'll take damage just like the mobs, but this isn't the case. The devs need to work on showing the player what is friendly and what isn't so we can make better judgments while playing.\n(Another thing i'll throw in here is that the death animations are too long and you end up not realising you can walk through something \"dying\" because you still think it's alive. It should either disappear quickly or reduce in transparency to show we can now move through it, may i suggest a very transparent ghost animation?).\n\nExcitement is another big thing here. While I think NWTL has cool sounds and music, something VS had was excitable sounds. When you picked up gems, it felt strong. It felt addictive. In NWTL this isn't the same. I pick up the silvers and golds and while I know I now have more, it feels slow and doesn't feel exciting to go and get them. We all know in VS we've risked it all for a singular gem, in this you don't get that feeling. \nThis is something that's difficult to get right, i know, and perhaps VS just got lucky but I do feel like the sounds in this need to be tweaked to be more exciting.\n\nOVERALL though, I still want to play the game. Would I recommend the game? Yes, yes I think i would. There's a lot this game has to offer and can be separated from many of the other VS clones out there and i'm curious to see what else it has in store for me but for now, I do find it slower and more boring than VS and hope that with more playtime, it really ramps up and that they make changes to my suggestions to keep me coming back for more.\n\nThe art style is AWESOME.. I love it and clearly the art direction was a high priority from the start, I wouldn't change it one bit!\nGive it a go!", "timestamp_created": 1676406068, "timestamp_updated": 1676406068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776624679565429688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132852224": {"recommendationid": "132852224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014030361", "num_games_owned": 828, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 363, "last_played": 1682652644}, "language": "english", "review": "skin unlocks worth the price alone. hubba hubba.", "timestamp_created": 1676404372, "timestamp_updated": 1676404372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451807230710983276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132847265": {"recommendationid": "132847265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137916109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1676399911}, "language": "english", "review": "the enemy sticks to you so you can't barge through hoards it will instantly kill you ridicules mechanic when it comes to these games", "timestamp_created": 1676399990, "timestamp_updated": 1676399990, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405381292104721069", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132839387": {"recommendationid": "132839387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061821556", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1676478898}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought it for the hot catboy", "timestamp_created": 1676391084, "timestamp_updated": 1676391084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618577122688293457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132836504": {"recommendationid": "132836504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166544452", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1679756772}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game, great art and music.
