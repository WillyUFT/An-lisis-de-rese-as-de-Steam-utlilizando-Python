"playtime_last_two_weeks": 394, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1700686699}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game in so many ways, the story is great, the characters are endearing at times and somewhat superficial in others but that would be expected from androids, the dialogues are engaging and unexpected sometimes and the voice acting is perfect, the futuristic setting is well conceived, the ambient lighting and sound effects all very good and the graphics are great, the environment physics is a bit lacklustre but serves the purpose\n\nMy only strife with the game are the god damn command prompts flashing in front of you for no apparent good reason, why not have keys assigned for the basic functions at least?...\n\nAt the beginning I thought, well, maybe this is part of the setting, as an android, the software is probably adapting to the environment and it will eventually go away and you\u2019ll know exactly what to do, but no, and the issue is, everyone else in the game seems to know exactly what to do in the split second they need to do it, but you, the player, are constantly being flashed with command prompts that keep changing for the exact same actions\n\nI mean, playing as an android that was assigned police duty, you would assume it had some sort of self-defence training at least, right? \nNo, wrong, it can\u2019t even move one arm after the other if not for the god damn prompt that flashes 1 second after it was needed, like, \u201cYOU NEED TO PRESS D.., no sorry too late, YOU NEED TO HOLD E NOW, ho no, not anymore, YOU NEED TO FRANTICALLY AND REPEATEDLY PRESS S NOW\u2026 you dumb ass\u2026. ho there it goes, you should be jamming the left mouse button, you\u2019re dead now, sucker!\u2026\u201d\n\nA damaged escort android knows how to run, jump, punch, duck, stab, choke, on the split second, but the state of the art android assigned police duties under your control, needs the constantly changing, for the exact same actions, flashing prompts to even move left or right, sometimes with symbols that you need to figure out what they are before you can even use them\n\nSo, what is the direct consequence of this? You need to repeat the same level, called chapters in the this game, over and over and over until you get it right, so, you are actually playing an arcade game in which you need to play the same level countless times until you get it right\n\nYeah, I know, you\u2019re advised to follow the story no matter what happens, but the outcome is exactly the same, you\u2019re being constrained just because you\u2019re the player, every single other android, deviant or not, seems to be able to move the left or right arm as they wish, the player can\u2019t, unless there\u2019s a prompt for it\n\nSo, the outcome of the story depends much less on your decisions than it depends of how well you can master the game interface, what\u2019s in question are not so much your moral choices but much more your capacity to adapt to a conflicting game interface\n\nConsequently, out the window goes the fluidity of the story or the love you had for any of the characters, because, when you have to play the same scene for the seventh time just because of the god damn prompts, just so you get it right, being the alternative, to let them die because you don\u2019t want to fight the controls, you begin to question, what else could I be doing right now?...\n\nPart of the issue stems from the fact that this is a port I guess, in a console, you have a limited amount of keys you can use, but playing on a PC, you have far more options for controls so you leave the weird actions for secondary keys and kind of use the same ones for the basic functions for almost every game because you can, so, when a prompt flashes with a key that is not expected for such an action and sometimes the complete opposite for that same action on a regular game, it\u2019s just confusing.\n\nYes, I hate consoles!\u2026.\"waves the geriatric arm at the screen while shouting, DAMN KID TOYS THESE DAYS!...\"\n\ud83d\ude0a\n\nEDIT: I also want to add that, the story is cute but makes no sense whatsoever, they are androids, fitted with the state of the art AI, that decided to rebel against humans by, guess what, fighting like humans, yeah, they go around throwing punches, firing weapons and planting bombs, which we have no clue whatsoever how they got then in the first place, instead of just using the AI to outsmart everyone and hack their way across every system, which is something the game makes sure to tell you right from the start, that it is something they can easily do\u2026.", "timestamp_created": 1700656437, "timestamp_updated": 1700736132, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498404592275619507", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150976250": {"recommendationid": "150976250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130775899", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 344, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1700705991}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my all-time favorite video game stories.

have a lot of quick time events and you have many decisions whereby you change the story.)\n\nDifficulty: For some quick time events you have very little time, but it is possible\n\nGraphics: 10/10 (My graphic points are based on the graphic and what year the game was released. So for example if the game is from 2010 and the graphics are good for 2010, it's a 10/10.)\n\nSounddesign / Music: 10/10 \n\nDuration: One Story Run: 10h - 15h\n\nReplayability: Yes because there are many different endings\n\nPrice: Game: 39,90 (Absolutely Worth it\n\nAdditional comments:\nDuring you play the story you can play as 3 different characters who have very interesting backstories.

Engaging and Thought-Provoking Narrative:[/i] Detroit: Become Human presents a captivating and thought-provoking storyline that explores complex themes such as identity, discrimination, and the nature of humanity. The branching narrative allows players to make choices that significantly impact the story, leading to multiple paths and endings.\n\n[i]2. Stunning Visuals and Cinematic Presentation: [/i]The game's graphics are visually stunning, with highly detailed environments and realistic character models. The motion capture technology used for character animations adds a level of realism and immersion to the game, enhancing the cinematic experience.\n\n[i]3. Strong Character Development:[/i] Detroit: Become Human features a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique storylines and perspectives. The game delves deep into their backgrounds, motivations, and struggles, allowing players to form emotional connections with them.\n\n[i]4. Player Choice and Consequence:[/i] The game's emphasis on player choice and consequence is a standout feature. The decisions made by players have a significant impact on the story, leading to different outcomes and branching paths. This adds replay value and encourages players to explore different possibilities.\n\n[h2] Disadvantages:[/h2] \n\n[i]1. Dialogue and Writing:[/i] While the game's narrative is generally well-received, i have found certain dialogue and writing aspects to be inconsistent or clich\u00e9d. This can occasionally detract from the overall immersion and impact of the story.\n\n[i]2. Limited Gameplay Variety:[/i] Detroit: Become Human is primarily focused on storytelling and decision-making, which  not appeal to me seeking more traditional gameplay mechanics. The game relies heavily on quick-time events and exploration, with limited combat or puzzle-solving elements.\n\n[b] But In conclusion, My personal opinion of [b]10/10[/b], i enjoyed and satisfacted of with the game.

I do recall having trouble with the controls during the first reconstruct sequence. It just got stuck, couldn\u2019t do anything and stared at a still imagine while frantically pressing buttons with the game taunting me by showing \u201cpress \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 keys\u201d.  \u201cwhoa, is this game going to be this difficult the whole time\u2026\u201d  is what I heard my mind tell me, then promptly decided to implode once I saw the word TUTORIAL on the side of my screen. After a small hour I simply fixed the problem by skipping that reconstruct and moving onto another reconstruct scene which did work. *shivers*\n\nBesides the small mishap at the start which sadly cost me an hour of my life (mostly due to my own stubbornness) this was a great game. The graphics were amazing. The story was intriguing and never made me feel bored (which is quite a feet). I felt genuine heartbreak when something bad happened to my characters (except Kara). Overall, I was impressed. The story was in depth and thought out. I liked the whole your actions have consequences memo it\u2019s trying to sell.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this is a game I would recommend my mother, my friends, my dog, my children and my grandparents and, of course, my pet snail to play. I would give it a perfect score story-wise. Even if some cutscenes did make me feeling like I was on typing dot com I still did manage to enjoy the game even with my severe dyslexia. :D\n\nDefinitely worth it. Really makes you think about the world and society as a whole. I liked how the socioeconomic situation in the game reflected our past world history in a weirdly twisted and gut wrenching way (positive as I think this was the intended feeling by the clever makers of this game.) \n\nConclusion:\nVery fun game that makes you think and stuff. Good world building, good story, great game mechanics (except the first reconstruction scene.)

You don't really get to shoot anyone or aim or do anything. You run through a bunch of scenes and like resident evil cut scenes, you will need to push various buttons to get through the scenes. Story was awesome but very short in my opinion. I beat it in about 10 hours and replayed a few chapters to see what could have happened. You can replay a bunch of times and try different choices with different endings but ultimately the game doesn't feel very engaging. I am more of a shooter/adventure type and though the story was great and kept me hooked, the game play felt boring. Graphics are excellent, audio is on point. I did not run into any crashes or glitches in the game (I saw some third party software for download for this game due to \"dev's not fixing known software issues\").

I did so, and I found it VERY appealing. The decision making, the graphics, the storyline. It's all perfected in a way you ever wanted. \n\nWhen reading the game description on Steam I though at first: alright, here we go again with futuristic CGI cutscenes and some generic, cheesy sci-fi storyline. Oh boy, little did I know I was soooo wrong.\n\nThe graphics are the best I have ever seen. From details on the character to the environment. The music is as if it came straight from an AAA movie. Voice actors are also *cheff's kiss*. \n\nI read the game has around 80 different endings? I can believe that, as after every mission you get to see a flowchart of all the decisions you took and could have taken (greyed out). You can replay the missions separately, or just start a whole new game. If you combine every possible ending for each mission times the number of playable missions & characters... You could get up to 80 different endings, yeah.\n\nIf you ask me, this is a very underrated game, worth its full price (even though I paid 50% due to a sale). Also: Hank you are a beautiful moth#rf#cker. \n\nI found this a very unique experience, never have I played such a game before. \n\n***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS, DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS***\nThe only negative thing I can share is the sudden \"hero\" capabilities of Markus. How did he end up getting the ability to transform androids into deviants with just a touch? I get he is the leader of Jericho, but godlike functions out of nothing? Maybe I'm ignorant and I gotta replay the game to find out, hehe. \n\nOh and also: every time you upgrade your GPU drivers, the shader compilation at the start of the game needs to re-run.

recommend the game is it tells an interesting nonlinear story through stunning pictures. Especially graphics are quite impressive, with high polygon models, detailed textures, lots of specular shaded surfaces (like rain puddles on streets) and shadows. Lots of detail must have gone into the NPCs and player models too, for faces, skeletal animation  and cloth physics which makes them look very realistic - but which maybe causes performance dropdowns especially in scenes with many NPCs.\n\n'Quicktime events' which are a central gameplay element (besides some main characters special skills) are a bit a matter of taste.

adventure), and oh boy it delivered. I feel all sort of emotion when playing this game, the characters are amazing, the plot is interesting, makes you always want to know what's going to happen next, and what will it be if you do something differently. The story of each chapter is very detailed, like anything could happen, looking at the flowchart, the branch in the story are huge, and even tho you can get the same ending with other player, the way and the journey to get to that ending could be much different than the others. I would recommend playing in \"experienced\" difficulty even in your first time playing because it will give you much more immerse gameplay, making the situation feel more intense due to more complex QTE, shorter time to make decision and a time limit on missions, I think playing in this difficulty will make you feel the story better. Overall a great game, won't regret buying this, and looking forward to the future games that the developer will do in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1699422049, "timestamp_updated": 1699422049,

Es el 4\u00ba juego del estudio Quantic Dream ( quinto si tenemos en cuenta The Nomad Soul) y para m\u00ed es la culminaci\u00f3n de lo que aprendieron con Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain y Beyond. \nLa historia se desarrolla en un futuro dist\u00f3pico donde los androides, fabricados para servir a los humanos, comienzan a adquirir conciencia y emociones. Asumimos el control de tres androides diferentes ( Markus, Connor y Kara), cada uno con su propia historia y luchas personales. Estos personajes est\u00e1n muy bien desarrollados y te involucran emocionalmente en sus destinos, haciendo que cada vez que tomes una decisi\u00f3n temas por su porvenir. \nGr\u00e1ficamente, Detroit: Become Human es impresionante. Ya me lo pareci\u00f3 en su momento en PS4 y lo sigue siendo ahora en PC incluso 5 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s en 2023 que es cuando lo estoy rejugando. Los personajes y entornos est\u00e1n bellamente renderizados, lo que contribuye a la inmersi\u00f3n. La actuaci\u00f3n de los personajes es impecable y el doblaje a espa\u00f1ol es sublime.\n Detroit: Become Human es un t\u00edtulo excepcional para aquellos que disfrutan de las narrativas interactivas y las exploraciones de dilemas \u00e9ticos. La atenci\u00f3n al detalle en la construcci\u00f3n del mundo y los personajes, junto con las decisiones morales impactantes, hacen que este juego sea una experiencia inolvidable y para m\u00ed, el juego m\u00e1s redondo de Quantic Dream hasta la fecha.", "timestamp_created": 1699316877, "timestamp_updated": 1699316877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149678169": {"recommendationid": "149678169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418900643", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1425, "last_played": 1699314451}, "language": "english", "review": "A very intriguing 8 hour interactive movie with familiar actors and later changeable story line.

And then the experience continues based on Your decision and you must live with it, right or wrong. And the decisions that you must make....do you lie to further your investigation or not....do you stop Todd or not....do you shoot Chloe or not.....do you save Hank or not.....do you choose non-violent or violent protesting.....on and on and on.

The Futuristic Blade Runner vibes also enhance the Gameplay.\n\nThe only con is how the control works at start. It took me around 10 minutes to understand how  to use the control. \n\nApart from that, I think the company Quantic Dream has made an insane achievement in makign such a game with so much immersion.\n\nJudo to Director/writer : David Cage for his incredible work.

Some of them are not obvious.\n\nGenerally, It's a bit of a simulator of a few different development paths:\n- African dictator armed with guns (an alternative ending)\n- Pacifist hippie (an alternative ending)\n- Near East terrorist with nuclear armament (an alternative ending)\n- Betrayed s.... doll, AKA Connor (a side alternative ending)\n- Hitman guy from Hitman games (AKA Connor the Undeviated) (a side alternative ending)\n\nI think they did a surprisingly good work on... the game menu. It's the first time I ever saw an interactive game menu with the narrator trying to break the 4th wall this way.\n\nAlso, the game looks surprisingly good. It's not only a few years old title from the consoles, it's also been ported to PC and it looks and plays really good (including Linux, where it runs flawlessly). The city and design are not lacking anything at all.\n\nGet it on a discount, because the game is short. Besides that - I think it's worth a try for the story and unique gameplay experience.\n\nI wish the choices were slightly more versatile and not tied to 2-3 different endings. There could be an additional political ending or a government infiltration mission. If they (androids) could imitate voices and camouflage then making their way into a military base or breaking into a broadcast tower to spread the \"virus\" could also make a much more interesting option than either of the \"kill or die\" approaches.\n\nI also think that the developers wasted some potential. Cyberpunk universe has proven that the \"future\" could be about androids but also about implants, shift in culture and public laws. I can't imagine people would own own androids made in their image, but not be capable of hacking them, modifying them to bypass the law or using them in various twisted ways, other than just typical labour...\n(the story could introduce the \"mutation\" as a security glitch introduced by modders or androids that broke down and went through self-repair, the RA9 idea with the religious theme is IMO lacking and not making much sense)\n\nCould be just my fantasy, but I can totally imagine a self-destructing android hacked to blow up...\nThe main story has a reasoning to it, but it would not be the case realistically.

Walk for 5 minutes, get to intersection... have to wait 3 more minutes for my light to turn green... another 15 minute walk to \"pick up pain\", another 15 minute walk back to bus.\nMost of the \"game\" isn't a game at all... it's just a set of disjointed cut-scenes that are interrupted every 5 seconds to make you press some random button.\nImagine watching a movie, and 5 seconds in, you have to Press D, 5 seconds later you have to hold E, 3 seconds later while STILL holding E, you have to hold D, 4 seconds later, while *STILL* holding D and E, you have to click and move mouse upwards and hold all that for 5 MORE seconds.  Then 5 seconds later... You get the picture.\nAnd we're not even talking about combat QTE... We're talking a 15 step process to wash F'n Dishes.  Just let me press a button, ONE button, and play the \"washing dishes\" cutscene... Oh, and after the \"pick up paint\"... you're a *completely* different character cleaning up some scumbag drunk's sh**hole\n\nIt doesn't matter how good the story is, if the storytelling is this horrendously bad.

The graphics are incredible, story is captivating, lots of controls but guidance on what to use when (I have only played a few chapters so it is possible at some point guidance is removed and must rely on memory for steps).  I am currently playing in the easy mode, so more story rich.  This is easily one of my favorite games thus far.  My only qualm is that because of the density of the games components there are times it freezes.  This is not often and typically the game saves so when you restart there are few steps to redo.  Overall I am very impressed.  I have a top of the line gaming system (within the less expensive range) so top of the less expensive category.  Therefore if you have a medium to high range gaming system, it is possible the game will not freeze at all.  It is definitely worth the price, especially on sale and as your decisions throughout the game determine multiple possibilities and endings, I can see myself playing \"Detroit: Becoming Human\" multiple times over again.

Al principio me compr\u00e9 Detroit en oferta, y aunque los 20\u20ac que cost\u00f3 dolieron al principio, no podr\u00eda estar m\u00e1s feliz de haberlo jugado.\n\nCreo que es un juego que vale la pena experimentar al menos una vez [b]SIN SABER NADA DE \u00c9L[/b]. La experiencia se vuelve much\u00edsimo mejor cuando no sabes qu\u00e9 acciones te llevar\u00e1n a qu\u00e9 situaciones. En parte es similar a Undertale, ya que tras tu primera partida te \"desensibilizas\" y eventos como [spoiler]la muerte de un personaje[/spoiler] resultan menos chocantes. Incluso tras la primera partida, vale la pena rejugarlo una o dos veces para experimentar las rutas m\u00e1s importantes [spoiler]como Connor m\u00e1quina/divergente, la protesta pac\u00edfica o revoluci\u00f3n violenta de Markus o ser detenido por el FBI como Kara cuando Jericho es asaltado.[/spoiler]\n\nPor poner un ejemplo de lo que dije antes: [spoiler]en mi primera partida mat\u00e9 a Connor sin querer con Markus y me impact\u00f3 tanto que la tuve que recargar, sin saber que en realidad no es un suceso demasiado importante para la historia. Sigo sin saber qu\u00e9 pasa, \u00bffunciona como una segunda oportunidad para que Connor se mantenga como m\u00e1quina en vez de divergente, ya que normalmente reaparece como otro modelo cuando muere?[/spoiler]\n\nLa \u00fanica pega que le podr\u00eda poner al juego es que, si puedes, lo juegues con las voces en ingl\u00e9s. Los labios de los personajes est\u00e1n (l\u00f3gicamente) solo animados a ese idioma, y no es que est\u00e9 muy bien cuadrado el doblaje espa\u00f1ol a los labios.

Each character's journey unfolds against the backdrop of a society grappling with questions of sentience, freedom, and the human condition.\n\nThe narrative is the crown jewel of Detroit: Become Human. With branching storylines and multiple possible outcomes, it encourages players to explore the consequences of their choices. The weight of decisions is palpable, and the game masterfully immerses you in the lives of its characters, making each choice a moral dilemma. The depth of storytelling here is simply unparalleled in the medium, addressing topics like prejudice, oppression, and the price of freedom.\n\nThe character development is superb. As you control Connor, the android investigator, you're challenged to hunt down deviant androids and confront your own identity. Kara's quest to protect a young girl in a cruel world is a heart-wrenching tale of motherly love, while Markus, the leader of the android rebellion, carries the weight of a revolution on his shoulders. The performances of the cast, especially Bryan Dechart as Connor, are nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nDetroit: Become Human is also a visual marvel. The game's detailed environments and lifelike character models make it one of the most visually stunning titles of its time. The world-building is immersive, and the little details in each scene contribute to the overall experience.\n\nOne of the most innovative aspects of the game is its flowchart system. After completing each chapter, you can see a branching flowchart that reveals all the choices you made and the potential outcomes you unlocked. This feature not only adds to the replayability but also allows you to appreciate the complexity of the narrative.\n\nWhile the game does an incredible job at storytelling and character development, some may argue that it sometimes feels more like an interactive movie than a traditional video game. However, the cinematic approach is one of its strengths, immersing you in a thought-provoking and emotional journey.\n\nIn conclusion, Detroit: Become Human is a monumental achievement in video game storytelling. With 10 hours of gameplay, you've only begun to scratch the surface of its branching narrative and the moral quandaries it presents. It challenges the boundaries of interactive storytelling and grapples with profound philosophical questions. Detroit: Become Human isn't just a game; it's a mirror reflecting back our society's own struggles with identity, freedom, and humanity, and it does so with brilliance and nuance.

But sometimes that chimpanzee farts and it's funny even if he doesn't understand why and sometimes that chimpanzee touches on something fascinating. He doesn't do anything with it, as he is only a chimpanzee, he just moves back to banging away on the keyboard again but you now can't take your eyes off of him in case he does something else interesting.\n\nDetroit: Become Human had a huge amount of potential and touches on something compelling but unfortunately falls back to the safety of cliches. Overall i enjoyed the game but only in the same way i enjoy Nicholas Cage films, this game is not Blade Runner, it is not written by Philip K. Dick, you do not need to play it multiple times to understand everything.\n\nDavid Cage's next game will be about Nicholas Cage and his pet chimpanzee that is also his dead daughter or wife or something.

I am already a big fan of these story, decision oriented games where simple options overtake the actual gameplay. I know these aren't everyone's cup of tea and those that don't enjoy these types of experiences are completely justified, however I always end up having a great time with them. So if you have a similar taste for these narrative games, I think you will enjoy it too.\n\nI am always easily fascinated with branching plots and seeing where my decisions take me, and then I also like going back and trying to achieve different outcomes and scenarios. While nothing presented here was perfect and with a rather topical subject matter like robotics and artificial intelligence/sentience, I was still quite wrapped up in the story. I can't say I agreed with every ideological approach being presented in many of my story lines, but I was still moved enough by keeping things purely fictional in my head and enjoyed how everything was presented here as if it was just a television series or movie.\n\nLike many others, I also have the fears of artificial intelligence taking over, becoming misaligned with our needs, and possibly fooling us into thinking it shares our values, and my fears were brought up very frequently in this game and it did hinder my experience a bit because of the negative view it was giving me of the real world. However I do supposed that an argument could be made about how giving me this effect means this is profound storytelling, but for me it just instilled more unease into my daily life which I am not after in my video games. I still can't fault it too harshly though since that is the subjective approach they clearly wanted to take with this game, and they have every right to tell the story how they want.\n\nAside from my ideological diatribes above, I liked all the other aspects of Detroit: Become Human. I enjoyed the characters, I had fun seeing how my actions changed their opinions on each other and their current stakes, the graphics were gorgeous, the music and soundscapes are a great wallpaper to help set the mood/tone, and I thought the acting was charming. I am also always impressed with the writing and acting in these branching games because I do start thinking of how many possibilities had to be taken into account and acted out. The controls were also easy enough, though I did play on the default \"Casual\" setting, and I am not entirely sure how it should become more difficult on the \"Experienced\" setting.\n\nIn the end I loved my time with Detroit: Become Human, I liked the world that it put me in when I wasn't thinking about any real world projection, I liked the decision making and its possibilities, I appreciated the presentation and style, and if any of these factors sound enticing to you, I would recommend giving it a chance. Like before I know these storybook type games are looked down upon by many, and that's fair, but I'm casual enough to enjoy that time. Also my distaste for the current possibilities of artificial intelligence does taint my views on the themes a bit, but I still liked the decisions I made with these androids and getting to see what future I created for them.

If there were a way to hold this as a 3rd person or 1st person POV I'd be far more inclined to enjoy this, but if you're moving forward and the camera switches to parallel, you now need to move left or right. All of that is done without notice so you always end up turning around or bumping into a wall. It distracts so much from the story as a result.

Each of these paths are precipitated through either the dialogue system or through action using quick time events.

it doesn't feel intense, but abstract and confusing, awful controls and even worse movement and camera.\nPlot is decent (sometimes enthralling, but YMMV), but the implementation of consequences that degenerate the plot (especially if on desktop) over infuriating gameplay mechanics worsens enjoyment (you should lower by one difficulty level if you're on desktop if you don't like QTEs), some interesting possibilities are not fully explored and dialogue options can be misleading on a few occasions. \n\nThe topics of the game are poorly researched, especially on sociology and psychology (there'd definitely be a lot more humans on the android side, especially early on in the game, what with how the androids look human, and all of this goes on in a USA that appears to be a functioning democracy... are we supposed to believe that with a vanishingly few examples, that humans will hang out with creatures that look exactly like them except for some LED, and act like good servants, children and even lovers? Humans will form bonds with animals and even inanimate objects that give them no affection, and with androids looking less different than historically racially segregated slave societies, there'd be a lot more outcry than for other slave owning societies which often freed, or even fought civil wars to free them.\n\nThe authors are clearly not futurists (it's not that they bend facts like setting the game far too early for the sake of it feeling relevant, but that they seem outright ignorant of basic ones like the economic, humanitarian and environmental importance of space exploration to Earth (without it we'd be much poorer, rural and poorer countries areas would be more impoverished and vulnerable due to lack of weather and environmental satellites and spin-off technologies), they don't understand basic military or policing tactics, and just generally get a lot of technology wrong. They're not historians either, as there's a very factually incorrect statement in one game ending, it's obvious not even a single search and wiki click was prioritized when writing this game. It's all put into the feel, which at least they manage very well.\n\nOh, and the game takes itself extremely seriously and is therefore ENTIRELY UNSKIPPABLE, and you're not even allowed to fast move/jog anywhere unless it's a few special scenes. You may do chapters over again, but you've got to remove files manually with File Explorer to make save files, and there's only a few checkpoints, and even if you remove the files the game has a second way of saving game data, so your new save gets messed up. \n\nThe strong parts of the story are very strong, and that's why I showed this game to others and found out about the save files, but if you haven't gotten into it then just watch an LP, it's not worth your money or full game time.", "timestamp_created": 1696814109, "timestamp_updated": 1696818347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147895818": {"recommendationid": "147895818", "author": {"steamid": "76561199518479163", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 883, "last_played": 1699907639}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable\n", "timestamp_created": 1696803962, "timestamp_updated": 1696803962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147894736": {"recommendationid": "147894736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865518391", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1854, "last_played": 1698448058}, "language": "english", "review": "cool game", "timestamp_created": 1696802335, "timestamp_updated": 1696802335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147892243": {"recommendationid": "147892243", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235051938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 656, "last_played": 1697385715}, "language": "english", "review": "very good, markus and cooper story sucks, love alice and kara. it takes forever to finish though, 10.9 hours in and still not done. god help us all", "timestamp_created": 1696798794, "timestamp_updated": 1696798794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147891025": {"recommendationid": "147891025", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228233849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 605, "last_played": 1696858513}, "language": "english", "review": "game been crashing alot of time i use rx6600 ryzen5600 16gb ram  it says     \"Your graphics card encountered a problem with Detroit:Become Human (VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST).

The only true shame is that I don't have the mental fortitude to replay it - which is a shame really, as this is the pinnacle of interactive storytelling.\n\nThe heart and soul of Detroit: Become Human lie in the choices you make. Every decision truly matters, shaping the course of the narrative in ways that constantly surprise and captivate. The game's ability to make you question your beliefs, ethics, and moral compass is truly remarkable. It presents you with complex dilemmas, forcing you to weigh the consequences of your actions and confront the blurred lines between right and wrong. The narrative is a breathtaking journey through a near-futuristic Detroit where androids yearn for freedom and humanity grapples with its own prejudices.\n\nThe voice acting is top-notch, with characters that feel alive and authentic. The performances breathe life into the android protagonists, making it easy to empathize with their struggles. Each character's journey is filled with depth, and the game's ability to make you care about their fates is a testament to the exceptional storytelling.\n\nOne aspect that deserves special mention is the soundtrack. The music in Detroit: Become Human is more than just background noise; it's an integral part of the experience. The soundtrack sits perfectly with every scene, enhancing the emotional impact of each moment. It's a symphony of emotions that guides you through the highs and lows of the narrative.\n\nBeyond the stunning visuals and gripping story, Detroit: Become Human delves deep into ethical quandaries. It challenges your beliefs and forces you to confront difficult questions about artificial intelligence, freedom, and the nature of humanity. These ethical dilemmas are not just thought-provoking but also add layers of complexity to the game's world.\n\nIn conclusion, Detroit: Become Human is a THE GAME in the world of interactive storytelling. It's a game that will linger in your thoughts long after you've completed it. What I found really intertesting is the development of main menu character whose emotions and increasing doubt you can spot on each pore of their face as you progress the story. While I may lack the will to replay it immediately, I know that the memories and emotions it stirred will stay with me forever. If you're a fan of narrative-driven games that make you ponder the choices you make, this is an absolute must-play. Detroit: Become Human is not just a game; it's a profound and unforgettable experience.\n\nP.S.\n\nI highly recommend unlocking gamedev diary / additional content once you're done with the game -- you will appreciate the art that much more.", "timestamp_created": 1696764195, "timestamp_updated": 1696764195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147859924": {"recommendationid": "147859924", "author": {"steamid": "76561199018627228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 886, "last_played": 1696763732}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1696763747, "timestamp_updated": 1696763747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147859462": {"recommendationid": "147859462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203414156", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 682, "last_played": 1697411536}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, would recommend playing it!", "timestamp_created": 1696763118, "timestamp_updated": 1696763118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147848550": {"recommendationid": "147848550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198899302298", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 683, "last_played": 1697025226}, "language": "english", "review": "Back when the game came out I didn't have a PC that could handle any game at all so I only reduced to watching gameplays and DBH held my heart since the day it came out.

Set in a futuristic Detroit where advanced androids exist to serve humanity, the game explores complex themes such as artificial intelligence, ethics, freedom, and the nature of humanity itself.\n\nOne of the standout features of \"Detroit: Become Human\" is its branching narrative, where your choices have a profound impact on the story's direction and outcomes. This creates a high level of replayability, as your decisions can lead to various endings and character fates. The game's choices are often morally ambiguous, forcing players to grapple with ethical dilemmas and consider the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe game's visuals are stunning, with lifelike character models and meticulously detailed environments that immerse you in its world. The motion capture and voice acting are exceptional, making the characters feel real and relatable.\n\n\"Detroit: Become Human\" also excels in storytelling. The game offers multiple playable characters, each with their own unique perspective on the android-human conflict. The intertwining narratives keep you engaged throughout, and the character development is impressive, allowing you to form deep connections with the protagonists.\n\nHowever, some might find the game's pacing a bit slow at times, as it prioritizes narrative depth over fast-paced action. Additionally, while the game's exploration of complex themes is thought-provoking, it can be heavy-handed in its delivery.\n\nIn summary, \"Detroit: Become Human\" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning narrative-driven game that excels in creating a branching storyline with real consequences. It's a must-play for fans of interactive storytelling and those who enjoy exploring ethical dilemmas in a futuristic setting.\n\nA solid 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1696597425, "timestamp_updated": 1696597425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147733749": {"recommendationid": "147733749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078683793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 703, "last_played": 1696591143}, "language": "english", "review": "Periods of extremely low frame rates in pretty much every chapter.

The voice acting is top notch and unfortunately there are some graphical issues to my GPU that I had to downgrade the version of it just to play this game. But overall a great experience.\n\n[POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD + Personal Take]\n\nThis game story revolves around a story where androids grows sentient and want freedom of their lives, and equal rights. What makes this game emotionally heavy for me was the fact that I can simply just close my PC and look around me, and the same treatment happens in our daily lives, although not directed towards androids.

The opening of the game was very suspenseful and learning how to play detective as Connor was super neat. The story has 3 main character arcs all being dramatic and dynamic in its own way. The flowchart maps out all my decisions, and the choices I make impact the story in several ways. The visuals and story-design were very well executed. At times it was like I was watching a movie, and sometimes it even felt like I was playing a horror game! Overall beautiful game, with great audio and background details.

Overall, highly recommend the game, just not on PC!\n***EDIT: Unfortunately, I have had to change my review to NOT RECOMMENDED. Do not buy this game on PC. In addition to the constant crashes, I got up to the final chapter and the game gets a black screen. I cannot continue. I cannot finish the game.

issues, I feel like the story can treat the player like they're very stupid sometimes, but it's still well worth playing.

It sounds clich\u00e9 but for more than a few situations you really need to stop and think before you act.\n\nAlso, the flowchart feature with global & friend stats is fantastic and should be in every game in this genre. Making a terrible decision and then seeing that as little as 2% took the same path as you is a truly brutal feeling that I haven't felt elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1695083329, "timestamp_updated": 1695083353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146560812": {"recommendationid": "146560812", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095400904", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1125, "last_played": 1695847191}, "language": "english", "review": "is cool", "timestamp_created": 1695078605, "timestamp_updated": 1695078605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146559333": {"recommendationid": "146559333", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007500897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 728, "last_played": 1695157241}, "language": "english", "review": "Decisions, decisions.

I can't fathom how the game made no connections to the beginning about his remorse or what not. the choices you make doesn't change the characters themselves either. they are the same character even if they kill people like it's nothing... the writing is absent in many parts of this game and I truly didn't enjoy most of this game because of this.\n\nthird part\n\nthe game is never clear on anything. there was a garage scene with hank where I tried to uncover what I missed before so I played that part 3 times till I figured out that game allows me to go back after wasting enough time. player doesn't know this. so even if I don't want to capture the fugutives I still will because simply, there is no telling to the audience. they could have easily put a timer there to let us know. I don't even want to remember how many times I accidentally interacted with the object that would finish the sequence before I collected all the evidence. \n\nOptimization\n\nI played the game with rtx 3060 which didn't exist the time this game came out and I had difficulties getting 60 fps. the game is optimized very poorly. no to mention the game crashed 2 times and lost me my saves and forced me to fix it in the middle of the episode...\n\nthis game was the most expensive game on quantic dream and I do enjoy some of the deep meanings in the game such as marcus picking 3 books in the start of the game. the names and their meanings and how they relate to the story was a masterful touch.

Quantic Dream, the developer behind this interactive narrative, has crafted a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience that raises the bar for storytelling in gaming.\n\nFrom the moment you start the game, you are instantly drawn into a dystopian Detroit of 2038, where advanced androids exist but are treated as second-class citizens. The game's plot revolves around three android protagonists \u2013 Kara, Connor, and Markus \u2013 each with their own unique storylines and perspectives, offering players an opportunity to explore the intricate web of choices that shape the outcome of this beautifully crafted world.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its exceptional attention to detail. The meticulously designed environments, lifelike character models, and stunning cinematography create a visually stunning experience that is as close to interactive cinema as gaming gets. The motion capture performances of the actors, especially Bryan Dechart as Connor, are outstanding and help create a deep emotional connection between the player and the characters.\n\nDetroit: Become Human's gameplay centers around choice and consequence. Every decision you make, whether it's a dialogue choice or a crucial action, has far-reaching consequences that ripple through the story. The game's flowchart system allows players to see the consequences of their choices, providing a sense of agency and encouraging multiple playthroughs to explore different outcomes. This makes each playthrough feel unique and adds to the game's replay value.\n\nThe storytelling in Detroit: Become Human is nothing short of extraordinary. It delves into complex themes such as identity, free will, and the consequences of our actions in a world where the line between human and machine blurs. The narrative tackles real-world issues with grace and intelligence, challenging players to consider the moral dilemmas that arise throughout the game.\n\nThe music, composed by Philip Sheppard, enhances the emotional impact of the story, creating a rich, immersive atmosphere. The sound design and voice acting are top-notch, contributing to the game's overall excellence.\n\nIn conclusion, Detroit: Become Human is a triumph in interactive storytelling.

The story is captivating, the visuals and graphics are eye-catching, and they really immerse you in the experience. The multitude of decisions available to you is a fantastic feature, allowing you to replay the game and choose different paths. Personally, I enjoyed watching this game as much as playing it.

Become Human, what a beutiful and well optimized game this is, playing this game for the first time will actually shock you by how well optimized and polished this game is. I mean yeah sure, this game was a playstation exclusive once upon a time but has now made it's way to pc which i love. I have watched so many youtubers play this game and maybe a lot of people will say \"well you are spoiling yourself, good job!\" this is not the case with this game, the possibilities and endings in this game are not just generic \"oh here is your new ending cutscene like dying light 2\" this game is just more than that, the endings are pretty much endless as long as you get all of them ofc.\n\nStory: The story is probably one of it's main selling points, it's a story set in 2038 where humans have created such things called Androids or robots if you will, but then one day something snaps inside of them and they want to change and stop being endless slaves for the humankind.\n\nCharacters: Connor is one the three main characters in this story who's part in the story is to find the leader of an illegal organization of who'm the Androids created and meanwhile deal with the worlds kindest nd most broken lieutenant there is to clear police/fbi investigations. \nMarcus is our second main character, his story begins by showing us the way he lives and that's by taking care of an old man named Carl but later on something bad unfolds, as Carl's only son intrudes the house while they were gone and tries to steal money from his father.\nKara is our final main character, a father orders this Android so she could be his maid and also take care of his daughter while he isn't at his house or just doing better stuff according to him (red ice). but then something bad happens in the household and this father is so mad because his daughter is not doing as he says, and things unfold very quickly. Kara's story is all about taking care about someone she loves and cares about, and someday be in a much safer place that ain't Detroit.\n\nGameplay: the gameplay is amazing and astonishing, it makes sense why this was a ps4 title, if you play the game with a mouse and a keyboard you wont get what i'm talking about, but if you play it with either a dualshock or a dualsense you are in for a treat, ain't gonna spoil too much thought.\n\nGraphics: the visuals uuhhhmm, what am i even supposed to say? this game is quite old, it released back in 2018 and this is by far the best lookin game there has been out since then, now it's 2023 and no game yet has managed to look like that, and not even come close to either the visuals or acting\n\nVerdict: Detroit Become Human is a game that is worth every euro you put onto it to buy it, aand trust me! you won't be dissapointed since the game has so many endings, the main story is about 12 hours long when you play it the first time and probably even up to 50 if you do all the endings and achievements.\n\nStrongly recommend this game!!\n\nDetroit Become Human: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694028281, "timestamp_updated": 1694028281, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466193199157715", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145807706": {"recommendationid": "145807706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879862839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1950, "last_played": 1686511408}, "language": "english", "review": "I literally fell in love with this game.

Connor is my favorite character in the game, he's so cool and sweet. But all the characters has so much to give! They almost speak with their eyes throughout the whole game.

[/b]\n\nI'm currently writing this review immediately after I finished the game's credits, and it's hard to even know where to begin - I do feel that, after completing a full playthrough of D:BH, I feel completely satisfied with how my choices weaved the game's ending; even if the outcomes experienced by the main characters weren't exactly ideal. In every high-stakes situation, I felt as though the game truly put me in the driver's seat to alter the entire course of events from that point forward. Some consequences of my actions were completely predictable, others caught me by surprise. There were actually moments that I audibly said, \"Holy shit, did that actually just happen?\", because the choices I made forged an unpredictable branch to move the story along.\n\nOn a graphical level, the game is beautiful. I never played D:BH when it first released in 2018, but even at release I was well aware of game media buzzing about its looks. The game has seemingly endless moments that make players get an itchy screenshot finger - my sole 9 hour experience alone pushed me to snap 12, mostly of Markus! I'm sure when I go achievement hunting in the future for 100% completion, I'll rack up more damage to my screenshot folder in that regard.\n\nThe game is a bit clunky in some respects, especially when it comes to fidelity of movement. There would be instances where I'd see an opening in a crowd of people, for example, and whichever character I was in control of would proceed to get boxed in by static NPCs. There were player animations that made navigating crowds [i] look [/i] more fluid than what was actually the case. I probably didn't do myself any favours by playing with mouse and keyboard, so I'll definitely be giving controller a try when I pick this up again. The story itself was also clunky in some spots, if that makes sense. A couple of the twists revealed to me in my game felt a bit forced, and I feel like the writing's overall strength took a hit in some areas due to the plethora of outcomes and events that had to be devised by producers. These couple of awkward twists felt like a one-size fits all approach to give every story path its own action/emotional peak, even if one wasn't really required to advance your story.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something casual, but not cozy. D:BH's cinematic nature lets the player sit back and watch events unfold in many spots, but it also keeps you on your toes with quicktime events and dialogue timers. The game will constantly make you question the morality of your actions, as well as the actions of those around you in the story.

"language": "english", "review": "At first I thought this was going to be a horrible game to play due to the play mechanics: Press a button to get the character to see what it can interact with or move the mouse a certain way, just to get the character to do something. But a little ways into the game, I noticed that I had a great many choices sometimes for how the game took shape. I could do or not do certain things depending on my choices, and I had a lot of choices I didn't even know I had until the end of a chapter during the review. This is an extremely re-playable game because of that because you can go back and see what difference different choices would have had.\n\nThe story you are being told is a really good story too. Not at first but again, a little ways into the game it really picks up. It isn't a \"this happens and then that happens\" kind of story either. It is a story about valid and deep moral and philosophical choices. It makes you think about why would you want to make certain choices and not others. Sure you could get through this game without thinking, but why would you want to do that?\n\nTo make this game even better, you get \"bonuses\" for playing the game, things like music tracks and videos related to the game story. This just adds to the overall experience.\n\nIf this game were made into a movie, it would be an awesome and great movie. I dislike movies in general but if this game were made into a movie, it would be worth it. I would watch it in a theater and I would buy it on Blu-ray, and it would be my first- or second-most favorite movie of all time. In hindsight, I think that wouldn't be possible since it would go against the purpose of the game to allow different endings for different choices.\n\nThere is a problem with this game though, the problem being the unspoken philosophical rule that to be \"just a machine\" is inferior to being human. The authors of the game imply that empathy is a feeling and machines cannot have feelings, and that only humans can have feelings (and by logical extension therefore animals cannot have feelings). But humans evolved from animals and there is nothing that humans have that animals don't also have a template for us having, including feelings of empathy. Sure much of what animals have is more rudimentary than it is in humans, but nevertheless it is there. Evolution is logical and non-randomly results in the mechanical progression of life built upon what came before it, so in a way, animals and humans are biological machines. So what is wrong with being \"just a machine\" then? So I have a problem HONESTLY answering any questions in the game related to being \"just a machine\" because it can't be done.", "timestamp_created": 1693088002, "timestamp_updated": 1693585330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145087192": {"recommendationid": "145087192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018604493", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1887, "last_played": 1693243302}, "language": "english", "review": "e bun", "timestamp_created": 1693085909, "timestamp_updated": 1693085909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145083640": {"recommendationid": "145083640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198965636308", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 700, "last_played": 1694131270}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1693081772, "timestamp_updated": 1693081772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145080141": {"recommendationid": "145080141", "author": {"steamid": "76561199471979741", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 985, "last_played": 1693076657}, "language": "english", "review": "I love how your choices always matter in this game; and how it affects the ending in future chapters. \n\nThe graphics are beautiful and the storytelling itself is emotional and immersive.
