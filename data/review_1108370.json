Many of the negative reviews point out how \"unfair\" it is, and they don't treat it properly. This game is HARD. But you never have to rely on any sort of randomness to win. There's always something you can (or could) do to make the outcome different.\n\nThere is no easy mode. Once you get the gist of your captain, the pollution 0 becomes quite simple and easy, but you must know what you're doing. And even then, you have the increasing pollution to keep the game challenging, and even more the nightmare mode for some real pain.\n\nYou have to balance your economy and your ability to defend yourself while still enhancing the city to be able to deal with the following waves. And this is essentially a game of combos. If you pick a little bit of everything to experiment with all the stuff, you are going to lose. And most, if not all, of the mechanics are viable for a core strategy. But you have to commit to them. As you progress into later waves, you must have a heavy synergy strategy, or else at least be only with extremely good cards, getting rid of everything you started and got early too.\n\nThis is a very challenging game that can get you many, many hours of fun. If you're in for comboing and getting challenged, I definitely recommend it. If you've never played another rogue-lite deck-building game, I'd recommend another one first before trying this one out (like monster train, griftlands, slay the spire, there are many) because getting the hang of the deck-building basics while getting pressured by the RTS aspect of this game could prove a little overwhelming, even with the extreme slow down given by the game (or full stops) in some decision moments.", "timestamp_created": 1697480979, "timestamp_updated": 1697480979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148155115": {"recommendationid": "148155115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019426604", "num_games_owned": 539, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3745, "last_played": 1697225895}, "language": "english", "review": "You like Tower defense ?

Well you would be wrong because for whatever reason things such as a MOAT can only be placed WITHIN your walls making it make absolutely no sense, this applies to all traps as you cannot place ANYTHING in front of your walls without another wall in front of that.\n\nThese problems have not been fixed/changed over the years this games been out.\n\nThe game has 20 \"ascension\" levels and not even halfway through it seems to be borderline impossible to win without extremely good luck that you could have instead used to win the lottery.\n\nThis is literally a game for masochists only, because you will lose alot, and most of the time it will not be because of something you did.

An interesting attempt to combine different genres, unfortunately the stereotype hits pretty fast.

One character gives you resource according to number of buildings, another requires you not to lose units and another yet has you wait till your ratizens finish a chore, but ultimately, you always spam cards as fast as you can, amassing resources and spamming units to both sides of your city.\n\nThe game tries to offer tactical aspects of various support characters, abilities and attack modes, but in typical tower defense style, once the enemy arrives it's just a hail of hitpoints being lost on both sides. It's hard to notice if you're losing any units and once the enemy breaks through first line of defense, it's usually game over.\n\nWhy a positive verdict?

This is not a bad thing by itself, but it becomes so when the design behind what you cannot control is poor.\nI just can't stand seeing ranged units in front of walls, so that if you don't send back each individually, they simply die extremely easily. Or being unable to deploy units in any way to defend your castle once the wall has been destroyed etc.\n\nIt seems little, but when you spend a long time in a run, and you lose all the progress because the game is not well done, and you cannot control things yourself to avoid it, it becomes frustrating and unfair.\nI also believe the balancing leaves very much to be desired. Its unreasonable to be able to win the first run with the basic leader, with basically no idea of what to expect, nor how things work, but lose so many with new unlocked characters. They simply have some dependencies that if the run doesn't get running, gives you no chance at all.\n\nThis leads me to my last point. The rng.\nI should say that it doesn't always have a big role, but it is again, with certain characters that have extremely tight dependencies with some resources, such as population, that the game may simply not allow you to play at all.\nIn my opinion, the player does not have enough resources to consistently get into the game, even if adapting its playstyle. This often happens with run-type games, but this one specially is severely damaged by it. In others, you feel weak and it is not very satisfying, but it only means that you'll need to try harder, but it still depends on you. In this game, precisely because you have so little control on the low level control, it feels that you are completely unable to play, only that you slowly suffocate until you eventually lose.\nIt's just that the amount of options the game gives you are not enough to prevent this. You have just a few chances to get useful cards, and if you don't, you'll likely never recoverd.", "timestamp_created": 1678618331, "timestamp_updated": 1678618331, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487046629190444946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134443583": {"recommendationid": "134443583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050454152", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1680134567}, "language": "english", "review": "They are not rats, they are mice.

Kingdom games are the closest thing to this, but you build structures/spawn units using cards. This game is quick-paced, doesn't have as many resource management chores (compared to Kingdom) and I found it engaging.\n\nThere's lots of variety provided by 6 classes, but as is with most deckbuilders, there's not enough to make different runs with the same Leader/Class feel different. The reason for that is there are many cards giving the illusion of many options, but most options are useless even for basic victory.\n\n[b]Not Tower Defense[/b]\nThe way to tower defense victory is pathing and using correct mix of AoE, Direct damage and CC. The way to Ratropolis (a DECKBUILDER) victory is building a kingdom (and slim deck) with many synergies with 1 or 2 things. \n\n\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay(8/10)[/h1]\nMain thing this gameplay has over similar deckbuilders is it doesn't require many calculated/precise actions, which makes it quick-paced. It takes about 20min to learn the basics of each class and from that point I found myself quickly performing most actions on autopilot. It's a positive for me, because micro-managing every point of damage(common in deckbuilders) becomes tedious too fast.\n\nCore systems (I recommend watching first 5 minutes of ANY video) to get \n[list]\n[*] You start in a camp with main building and 2 walls. If main building takes a few hits - you lose.\n[*] Use cards (and pay gold) to spawn troops, build buildings (buildingss once per card), activate temporary buffs and such.\n[*] Build walls to get more territory to build in (and fall back to, if outer most walls falls).\n[/list]\n\n[b]Classes/Leaders[/b]\nThere are 6 \"Leaders\" to play with and they play drastically differently. Also each leader has male/female versions, which have different starting kits (sufficiently different).\n\nFor example (overview for few classes, I suggest going in blind):\n[spoiler][list]\n[*]General is more classical troop/army-focused class. Male and female are only marginally different.\n[*]Merchants get access to mercenaries (temporary troops), and some tools that scale with amount of gold you have or Taxes(passive income). Male has access to infinite gold and female does not, which leads to completely different playstyles, while cards are mostly the same.\n[*]Builders get access to ways to build, move/remove, upgrade and protect buildings. The deck consists of defensive structures (like fire towers, trebuchets, traps, etc) and structure manipulation tools. These can beat the game in tower-defense style, without using troops much.\n[/list][/spoiler]\n\n[b]Biomes[/b]\nAs you start the game, you pick a biome to build your settlement in. With this you choose 2 things: enemy types (their strengths or your own problems), bonus you're getting after waves (building upgrade, troop defense or card cost reduction cards). Different biomes can be better or worse with specific leaders/playstyles\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] \"Progression\". You get XP for leader you play as, which unlocks cards/relics to find in future runs. I don't like this type of progression in general (it's just a push to grind), and this game doesn't make it very exciting as most unlocks are boring. If nothing else, I'm thinking of the drop pool gets diluted by useless options.\n[*]Can feel unfair / poorly balanced at higher wave count.\n  [list]\n     [*] Most cards are useless. For instance this game features status combo mechanics, which are difficult to execute and don't scale at all. \n     [*] Very few tools/combos are capable of scaling with enemies when going for high wave count. Around wave 50 even basic enemies wipe out strongest defenses unless you have a specialized build. Some bosses are difficult to kill even around 30th wave as their HP is crazy high. \n     [*] Around wave 60 (earlier on some biomes) walls become useless as enemies are capable of tearing them down in about 3 seconds.\n     [*] Some enemies bypass walls and disable your buildings (essentially disabling your ability to defend or deal damage). You can fix them, but it feels like a chore. Those enemies ALSO have crazy HP at higher waves, so it's not easy to get rid of them.\n     [*] All ways to victory at high level are through cheesy infinite scaling and not strategy.\n[/list]\n[*] Sound needs some tuning. It's very loud by default and when there are multiple enemies attacking something, it's just annoying to listen to.\n[*] Poor resolution support.\n[*] Bugs/Crashes. I only had problems on 1 run, but it was my longest run (trying for 120 waves) with crazy amount of bugs. I had to save scum like crazy to work around those bugs and complete the run. \n   [list]\n      [*] One event kept crashing the game consistently, when I tried to trigger it. I don't know what it was, I had to skip it.\n      [*] Later the game crashed as it couldn't handle many crabs attacking buildings. It took me a while to figure out and even longer to work around. I had to save-scum to let those buildings die BEFORE too many crabs spawn. \n      [*] The game then proceeded to spam with null pointer exceptions (still about Crabs), until the very end of the run. Thankfully it was text and did not crash the game.\n      [*] At some point I lost all my troops because they decided to move out of OP turret range. That is bad because the turret can kill and troops only defended walls that die in seconds. Another savescum restart.\n      [*] As a cherry on top, after every crash I had to reset resolution, because the game does not support ultra-wide and on restart it gets all stretched.\n[/list]\n[/list]\n\nFor what it's worth, I reported the biggest bug and devs started looking into it within like an hour of me posting it and replied asking for logs in 7 more. I often report and check other people's reports on games I find problems with. It's very rare for devs to respond at all regarding a released game. I respect their diligence.\n\n\n[h1]Achievements(5/10)[/h1]\nMany of them are generic chores, that pretty much just pad the game.\n[list]\n[*] Beat Pollution 20 (equivalent to Slay the Spire ascension)\n[*] Beat a game with every class in every biome\n[*] Beat a game under specific conditions (like without using non-melee units; without upgrading cards; without going over 1000 gold; without getting relics)\n[*] RNG achievements (get 3 specific relics; get 10 relics in 1 run, etc)\n[/list]\nVery few of these are challenging, but many of them require a dedicated run (or in case of RNG many attempts).", "timestamp_created": 1672958743, "timestamp_updated": 1673859826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130220889": {"recommendationid": "130220889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039887317", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2129, "last_played": 1612639728}, "language": "english", "review": "Good fun.", "timestamp_created": 1672953751, "timestamp_updated": 1672953751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130204709": {"recommendationid": "130204709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004913329", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 6012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4409, "last_played": 1678552388}, "language": "english", "review": "Rats!

So many major updates.\n\nHonestly I've played almost every deck builder steam has to offer and this is the best one tied with STS, Monster Train, and now Ratropolis. 6 different classes each with 2 subclasses, each class deck and class leader plays incredibly uniquely. There are many different ways to build each class and its just insanely fun figuring out how to get each deck running in a broken combo to beat the game. And trust me you will need to do something broken to beat the game because its HARD. Each run is such a fun challenge and it feels extremely well balanced, easy beginning, intermediate middle, and really hard lategame. They've made every class feel like a unique puzzle to solve in many interesting ways.\n\nRuns are about 60 minutes long and you start crafting your deck up from scratch and also building a town with your deck. Enemies come in waves and you can either defend with guys and buffing your guys or with towers(mainly builder class). A new fun pollution mechanic since I've played where you can increase the difficult I believe 20 times, and if you beat a run making it to wave 30 you can go endless and continue to have fun.\n\nI think the main takeaway of what makes this game unique and deserve to be praised along with STS, or MT is 2 things; balance, and unique classes. The challenge in every run is there, and feels balanced, and is very very fun to see if you make it to the end. Alongside the balance each class feels extremely unique with their own radically different playstyle, and the amount of smart design that goes into being able to make that is very impressive.\n\nI hope the team who made this game makes more games because they are capable of making incredible quality and I would love to see what they do on the next game, even if its not a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1672629526, "timestamp_updated": 1672629526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129821986": {"recommendationid": "129821986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120346876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1065, "last_played": 1699208986}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty good. You get to build your town using cards you obtain. You use cards that are buildings as a one time use card, which brings an effect like \"Drawing an extra card when you re-roll.\" You use rats as pawns to defend your base, like buying monkeys (tower defense) from Bloon Tower defense. And other cards allow for special effects that can support the mechanics of the game like adding buff to your rats or healing them. \n\n One criticism I have about this game is if you level up your rat you unlock more cards. The problem is that there is a less likelihood of getting the card you want since there are more cards in the pool as you keep leveling. So chance and rng are a great factor in this game the more levels a Rat has. \n\nA wish I would have for this game is, there should be a custom mode where you can add conditions for this game. Maybe a sandbox would be good to have.

The merchant give you a fast monopoly on gold, quick redraws and more spending gold for the trader. The general allows you to have increasing more ratizens for huge armies. The builder especially is my favorite since they give you a lot of building options and defensive structure. The scientist adds a unique approach to the game with the science structure and ability cards with an added scrap card that can be a bit tedious to deal with but balances out with other ability cards. The shaman is my least favorite consider how much soul is require to basically everything you do, and yes souls is the highest contributor to the best troops you can summon when playing the shaman, and I know there are some players who understand the shaman ability to change the course of the battle. The navigator is rather spin on chance and guarantee success. I do enjoy those motar rats the navigator have on deck. Those are by far the most op units I have ever had. The game play is card base so many people will have to shuffle through and cycle through multiple redraws in order to get the right card to summon their defenses, abilities, troops, structures, support structure, etc. Leaders ability also effect a player game play base on each leader and what type of environment the players chooses to play in. It is a great minigame when bored at the office or mobile devices. I would like to add that the new female leader you add to the game is quite unique maybe not so much for the female shaman, but all the same with their own twist the leader ability. Oh one last mention their is also advisor ability which are passive ability that either have a constant effect or a single use, but some are more rare than others and some are more useful than others. All the more reason why some people would enjoy this game. Here is the part where the other me will have to disagree. The game does have some technical difficulties like troops that within the first two inner walls on your game will tend to move on their own when you double click and select one group to move to another wall. I assume that your screen was too close to adjusting both side as apart of one group and they act a single unit. I wish there was a click and drag box to designate the select group to move to a design location, and please change shaman ability to something more adjusting.

Today we\u2019ll be looking at \u201cRatropolis\u201d a curious combination of deckbuilding, side scrolling and strategy game that I noticed watching one of my favorite creators.  I\u2019m very much a fan of any strategy game but wasn\u2019t sure this game was for me, what did I decide?  Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nThe Plague Cometh:  This game was very fun, fast paced and the gameplay loop is enjoyable.  The audio is done well (though like most games like this I turned it off after a bit).  At the core this is a line defense game (similar to tower defense) that uses a deck of digital cards to summon your rats, buildings and special effects.  You want to expand to have more room to build but expanding too far can make your two lanes impossible to defend.  You have multiple decks and multiple enemy factions to play against.  There is a lot here but once you\u2019ve played a handful of games you pretty much have seen what this game has to offer.\n\nRats with Wings:  If I had to level any real criticism it\u2019s that this game didn\u2019t grab me, sure it was fun but after playing for two hours I really felt I had seen everything I needed to see.  I didn\u2019t have any urges to come back despite the very well done animations and gameplay loop.  Mechanically I did feel that it kind of devolves into \u2018play all the cards\u2019 where the focus seems more on placement and deckbuilding and less on the actual cards being played themselves.  There were only a few cards I felt I had to think about playing them.\n\nThis is an odd one for me.  The game isn\u2019t bad, quite the opposite.  It just didn\u2019t grab me.  I\u2019d recommend this game to anyone who loves deckbuilding games or just wants a game that can be played while waiting for a \u2018main game\u2019 or friends to come over.  In some ways it feels like this game is built more for mobile than steam, and I say that with no venom.

I haven't unlocked all the cards but I think your endless mode options are pretty few, which in a deck builder is pretty lame.\n\nProbably the worst aspect is the user interface though; it's not good at all.\nYou can push-pause the game, but you can't interact with most elements while paused, or even examine your cards; tooltips will only appear if you mouse over something while unpaused, and then you can pause to read it, the same is true of cards 'popping up' so you can read their text.\nMoving units can be done in one of three ways; move all units from one wall to the next wall left/right, move all units from one wall to a targeted wall, or move one specific unit (which you can't select while paused and are usually moving around and stacking up with one another making it hard to click exactly the one you want) to the next wall left/right. This makes moving your army around a huge pain in the ass.\nThere's a lot of little annoyances with it that are hard to remember and describe, but the UI is just very unpolished suffice to say.\n\nTL,DR: Overall I mostly like the game, but it has some serious flaws. If you like these sort of games you'll probably have a good time for quite a while, but it won't take long for the novelty to wear off.\nAlso documentation (in game and out of game) is very poor; there's no event log in game, military cards have some 'hidden' stats (movement speed, attack range, etc.), I'm pretty sure one card has a straight up unmentioned mechanic because something weird was happening with it that I couldn't otherwise explain, and wiki / guides are very incomplete and outdated.\nALSO also, why are the mutant rats that caused the apocalypse, and the only presented story of the game, the least of your worries?

There's interesting strategy to do here, but the game demands you be fast.\n\nAfter every wave, a treasure chest drops that will give you get an upgrade (choice of 3) and....you have to go click on it within a few seconds or you just don't get the upgrade. Merchants show up to town to sell you new cards... you have to go physically click on them within a few seconds or you can't use the merchant. Buildings give you a benefit once every minute or two...you have to scroll to them and click on them to use it. You can redraw your hand as often as you like...pay gold to redraw or wait a duration to redraw for free...so how fast you make gold and deploy troops and etc depends entirely on how fast you play cards....while doing all the other things... most timed things have a prompt on the HUD that you can click on and scroll the screen directly to them, but while trying to do all the things in this game, it's easy to not even see it.\n\nThe game takes place on a side scrolling 2d plane, and you expand horizontally as the game progresses. You get attacked from one or both sides, and being able to micromanage depends partially on how fast you can click and drag to pan through your city...nothing like a minimap or a scroll bar...so either you go at the edge panning speed (can't be changed) or you're doing a bunch of annoying mouse movement...it's hard on the eyes too constantly scrolling back and forth.\n\nYou can pause, but it freezes the game, you can't input anything or even mouse over your cards to read them. You can get slow motion, as much slow motion as you want, by clicking and holding a card, which is an awkward way to give the player access to time to think, since you also can't mouse over other cards while you're holding one.\n\nI managed to beat it once, the base difficulty was trivial when I picked a faction that suited my playstyle.

Hab\u00eda que encontrar un hueco en el que disfrutarlo jug\u00e1ndolo de seguido.\n\nSiempre tengo en mente a Slay the Spire cuando compro un juego de cartas. Como referente del g\u00e9nero, espero que los nuevos juegos que adquiero se parezcan en cuanto a esa experiencia de vicio insano que te impide dejar el juego hasta que lo completes, perdiendo las nociones b\u00e1sicas sobre espacio y tiempo en el trayecto.\n\nHe de decir que cuando inici\u00e9 Ratr\u00f3polis y le dediqu\u00e9 las primeras horas, no me daba la sensaci\u00f3n de que este juego fuera a cumplir con la anterior promisa.\n\nY es que, tomando como referencia a StS (Slay the Spire), a primera vista, son juegos muy distintos.\n\n \ud83d\udc00En primer lugar, porque Ratr\u00f3polis es un juego de defensa de torres. Es decir, nuestra misi\u00f3n no es ir avanzando por un mapeado aleatorio e ir derrotando enemigos y jefes, no. Aqu\u00ed hemos de sobrevivir con \u00e9xito ante oleadas de enemigos que quieren atacar y destruir nuestra ciudadela habitada por simp\u00e1ticos y afables roedores. Para ello, utilizaremos una serie de cartas de distinta tipolog\u00eda.\n\nPodremos construir edificios, colocar combatientes ratas y lanzar poderosas habilidades. Todo esto, mediante un coste econ\u00f3mico (no, aqu\u00ed no hay man\u00e1) y un coste en personal rateril. Como es l\u00f3gico, siempre comenzaremos con una \"baraja\", que podremos ir ampliando mediante eventos, tesoros que surgen tras derrotar oleadas, y en el mercader, que de vez en cuando, se dejar\u00e1 ver, montando su pollino, en el centro de la ciudad.\n\nUn concepto sencillo, pero que esconde una dificultad de ejecuci\u00f3n exitosa tan alta que cada partida se convertir\u00e1 en un aut\u00e9ntico reto.\n\nCon estos mimbres, no parece a priori un juego parecido a StS, pero con el paso de las primeras partidas podremos observar similitudes con la obra maestra referente en el sector.\n\nY es que pronto descubriremos que podemos utilizar 6 personajes, cada uno con sus cartas t\u00edpicas y sus \"barajas\". El mercader inicial dar\u00e1 paso al general, al ingeniero, al cient\u00edfico, al cham\u00e1n y al navegante.\n\nCada uno posee unas mec\u00e1nicas \u00fanicas que al ir descubri\u00e9ndolas, el jugador quedar\u00e1 cada vez m\u00e1s prendado con el sistema de juego y querr\u00e1 experimentar con las decenas de opciones que surgen tras cada construcci\u00f3n.\n\nTambi\u00e9n tenemos la opci\u00f3n de contratar consejeros. Estas egregias ratas nos otorgar\u00e1n poderosos beneficios. \u00bfPuede sorprendernos que 3 de los 4 personajes de StS sean \"consejeros\" de Ratr\u00f3polis? Uno de los m\u00faltiples gui\u00f1os que el juego se guarda bajo la manga.\n\nLos modos de juego son sencillos: 3 biomas distintos, con opci\u00f3n de elegir al comienzo de la partida.\n\nPara superar una partida, hemos de sobrevivir 30 hordas. Si queremos desbloquear los logros, esto se multiplicar\u00e1 otras 3 veces, para tener que superar 60, 90 y 120 hordas. Ser\u00e1n partidas intensas, y que necesitar\u00e1n la precisi\u00f3n cirujana: un solo error lo mandar\u00e1 todo al traste.\n\nComo en StS, cuando acabamos con \u00e9xito la partida, podremos subir el nivel de \"poluci\u00f3n\" hasta 20, donde ir\u00e1 aumentando la dificultad.\n\n\n\nCon todo esto, y sobre todo gracias a su propia impronta, Ratr\u00f3polis se convierte en un juego que, probablemente, te acabe viciando hasta el mismo nivel que StS. Acabar\u00e1s dando vueltas, una y otra vez, se convertir\u00e1 en ese reto que te autoobligas a superar y que no parar\u00e1s hasta lograrlo. Y esto merece los 7,49\u20ac que piden en oferta por \u00e9l, incluso los 15\u20ac sin oferta no ser\u00edan una locura. Digno de menci\u00f3n es que el juego est\u00e1 disponible en Android (se vende en la PlayStore de Google) , y que es totalmente compatible con SteamDeck, donde un servidor ha terminado un par de partidas.\n\nPorque a fin de cuentas, el que suscribe lo ha completado en 100 horas repartidas en 2 semanas de juego. Ha cumplido con creces lo que esperaba cuando lo adquir\u00ed.\n\nPor tanto, es un juego que sin duda alguna recomendar\u00eda a cualquier jugador que haya disfrutado de StS, o de cualquier otro roguelike de construcci\u00f3n de barajas, o en general, de cualquier juego de cartas.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1656059747, "timestamp_updated": 1656059747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117431373": {"recommendationid": "117431373", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985809272", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1645693331}, "language": "english", "review": "~OVERALL RATING~\n55%\n\n~ SUMMARY ~\nI like the idea of a deck-builder/city builder hybrid, but I just didn't find Ratropolis interesting enough to continue after ~3h.

But if you lose them, you've most likely lost the game already unless you can get your army from the other side of the wall. Good luck if you're currently being attacked on both sides.\n- Learning the cards/buildings/leaders/etc. in addition to mechanics like ratizens can make it confusing for absolute beginners.\n- I feel most Skill cards are underpowered, especially so because you'll use offensive ones only when there are enemies and at the right moment.

The next time I got to wave 120 I was afraid to go any further just because of crashing. The stages are not balanced either but oh well.\nI enjoyed every minute of this game for the most part. \n42 / 46 achievements awesome.

Casual gamers will be turned off by the challenge of jugging both aspects of the game, but there is an appeal to gamers who enjoy a face-paced cerebral game.\n\n--------\n\nWhat do you get when you mix Slay the Spire and Kingdom? You get Ratropolis, whose cutesy facade which conceals a challenging deck-building strategy game.\n\nKind of.\n\n...Wait, you haven't heard of Kingdom (2015)? Kingdom: New Lands? Kingdom: Two Crowns? No? Tsk, tough crowd. \n\nAnyway. Both aspects of the two married genres are important. You'll need to master both: \n1) The strategy layer (economy, population, armies, a bit of positioning) \n2) The deck building (combos, scaling to late game)\n\nEach (successful) run takes about an hour. \n\nIn spite of this game originally being a mobile game, this isn't really a casual game. While the early waves in each run start easy, less prepared gamers may quickly be dismayed as the enemies scale incredibly high by the late game. Mastery of each leader's main combo is essential to win.\n\nThat however is also the game's main flaw, in my opinion. There are main combos using basic cards for each leader which are totally necessary to win.\nExamples:\n1) The merchant leader's main tactic is to fuel his economy with labor combos then buy stupendous number of mercenaries.\n2) The general leader's main tactic is to grow his troops with a steady supply of experience, and so his main tactic is summoning extra enemies and earning extra bounties from each enemy.\n3) The shaman's main tactic is to sacrifice lots of throwaway troops for money and power, then quickly refill her ranks with graveyards.\n4) We don't talk about the Navigator.\n\nThe issue is that there is just one general main tactic for each leader. Once you've figured out how to run the main tactic for each leader, the difficulty curve drops like a rock. It's a \"right, that's what I was supposed to do with this leader\" feeling. Kind of like Kingdom, really.\n\nCertainly a game worth trying out. Just, take a moment to overview the glossary so that you know how cards are meant to combo together when you find you are stuck.\n\nSqueek.", "timestamp_created": 1646641695, "timestamp_updated": 1646642213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565124690532684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111339899": {"recommendationid": "111339899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347112044", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2578, "last_played": 1646178168}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed quite a bit", "timestamp_created": 1646179065, "timestamp_updated": 1646179065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111203300": {"recommendationid": "111203300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072862697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2036, "last_played": 1646089138}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun little mix of spire and kingdom", "timestamp_created": 1646008830, "timestamp_updated": 1646008830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "111197965": {"recommendationid": "111197965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122045183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1658437213}, "language": "english", "review": "Massively underrated game.

It is inconvenient to control the move of the soldiers. You can only select soldiers one by one or select all soldiers in one wall and command them to move to another wall. I suggest that players should have a list of soldiers if he clicks one wall, and the game can be pause in order to select soldiers he wants to move. Another problem is that once one wall is collapsed, you cannot move your soldiers towards that direction, which means that the game is at the end of one of initial walls is collapsed even if you have solders in the other direction. \n", "timestamp_created": 1644743740, "timestamp_updated": 1644743740, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "110009111": {"recommendationid": "110009111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012784015", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1298, "last_played": 1644617084}, "language": "english", "review": "The more you \"level up\" your leader - the weaker it becomes, cluttering the pool with useless unlocked cards and not increasing the shop / reward size to still be able to choose normal ones.

It\u2019s unique blend of deck-builder and tower defense has kept me coming back for more. The game is straight-forward & easy to learn, yet difficult to master. UI is intuitive and provides all relevant information to the player. Animations and SFX are very well done, and excellently supports the artstyle. \nThere is meta-progression by earning xp as each of the six leaders in order to unlock more cards. In addition, after one has beaten the game once, pollution is unlocked where each subsequent victory will add an additional modifier making the game more difficult (ala [i]Monster Train[/i]). There is also a feature that allows one to continue playing after having beaten the first 30 waves as a new leader which triggers again after each additional 30 waves survived (the leader choices are random, no additional xp will be earned, however).\n\nAlthough the re-draw timer has been brought up by some as a negative, it truly does add an entirely different dimension to the game, and I believe that it is a generally positive addition to the game. In most deck-builders (e.g., [i]Monster Train[/i], [i]Slay the Spire[/i], [i]Guild of Dungeoneering[/i], etc.), one needs to be certain that they are making the best play, and a timer simply does not belong. However, in a tower defense, time is just as much a currency as gold. Having a re-draw timer applies pressure, and instills a sense of impending doom - which I believe adds to the immersion in this post-apocalyptic world our little anthropomorphic rats must survive within. The hordes are drawing nearer by the minute, and the ratizens must rush to the defense of our city!\n\nMy main gripes with the game are the initial difficulty curve, the lack of maps (there are only 3), and the tediousness of achievement earning. Firstly, it seems that an early victory is extremely difficult without unlocking certain cards for each leader. Although, some leaders are easier than others (The General should have been the first unlocked leader, not the Merchant). Secondly, a campaign would be a very welcome addition to the game, and would easily allow the developers to add in a few more maps. Lastly, some achievements are simply a slog (survive the 120th wave), irritating as all hell because of uncontrollable factors (achieve victory while never exceeding 999 gold) or are RNG based (have x, y, & z advisor). \n\nOther than those minor criticisms & quibbles, I truly enjoy the game, and wholeheartedly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1638273140, "timestamp_updated": 1638273140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582047939300537109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104770882": {"recommendationid": "104770882", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997492564", "num_games_owned": 560, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1649540912}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game to relax and enjoy a good gaming session!", "timestamp_created": 1638230478, "timestamp_updated": 1638230478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104636405": {"recommendationid": "104636405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016689527", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1698637087}, "language": "english", "review": "cute game though i kinda wonder why they use the baby murloc noises for some of the rats", "timestamp_created": 1638147862, "timestamp_updated": 1638147862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104584506": {"recommendationid": "104584506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102491822", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "playtime_at_review": 2012, "last_played": 1700149885}, "language": "english", "review": "ze best", "timestamp_created": 1638123049, "timestamp_updated": 1638123049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104528443": {"recommendationid": "104528443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073298523", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3322, "last_played": 1695995637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego muy divertido, perfecto si quieres desconectar un rato pero no te gustan las sesiones de juego muy largas. \nAunque las premisas son muy sencillas (tienes una baraja de cartas que contiene distintos tipos de cartas (unas dan dinero, otras edificios, unidades...) resulta un reto.

For example, I found the General to be the easiest, and the Builder is easy in concept (though I've yet to actually win with him).  On the other hand, the Scientist baffles me as he has multiple cards that rely on or manipulate *other* cards.  I found it too much to keep track of and figure out on top of real-time enemy waves.\n\nI think some of the issues come down to having to work around multiple limitations:  having enough gold, having enough population, and getting the card(s) you need when you need them.  Combine that with the sharp jump in difficulty for later waves, and it starts feeling like you never have enough resources to actually win (regardless of how well you *think* you're doing in a given run).\n\nIf I could give it a neutral review, I would.

I had a good bit of fun trying out Ratropolis, however it's unlikely that I will play many more than the ~7.5 hours I've played as of posting this review. \n\nFirst things first, Ratropolis is a unique combination of several different genres. Coming straight off of Slay the Spire and Monster Train (two deck-building roguelites, for those unaware), I was intrigued to play 'A fusion of roguelite, tower defense, city-building, and deck-building!' Those [i]are[/i] all accurate descriptors, and I think the [i]idea[/i] behind Ratropolis is truly solid. For me, however, the fun ends only shortly past the novelty of such different genres being combined. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with Ratropolis is its timer. This is of course necessary to allow for the tower defense elements (which run in real-time) to be able to function. Unfortunately, however, this means that the speed with which you play your cards is a legitimate factor for how well you do in the game. While most other card games (at least the ones that I've played) reward you for playing the correct cards in the correct order, Ratropolis doesn't really function in that way. In order to get a new hand, you have three options: wait out the timer, pay gold (one of your important resources), OR find a way to go infinite and bypass the timer entirely. Let's quickly go through each of these options.\n\n1. Wait out the timer -- This comes with some obvious downsides. Any time spent waiting is time you're not playing cards, meaning you're missing out on possible gold, citizen, and unit generation. This is obviously not ideal.\n\n2. Pay gold -- This option is fine early game, when the cost to reload your hand is <50 gold, and you aren't spending your gold on a lot, however the amount of gold it costs increases with every wave and quickly becomes hard to keep up with. Generating several hundred gold [i]per hand, every hand[/i] seems like quite a feat, especially since in the later parts of the game you'll likely be spending a lot of gold to get units down constantly. I don't see this as a viable long-term strategy, however it's possible there are legitimate ways to do this that I'm overlooking.\n\n3. Go infinite -- The final option, and the one that really ruins the game for me. Thin your deck to ~5-7 cards and find a combination that allows you to generate money, then redraw the money generation card + the card you played to draw in the first place. The animation time of playing / drawing cards becomes a legitimate factor, so you really do want to narrow your combo down to the fewest cards possible. Unfortunately, this option seems to me to be the only viable strategy that allows you to keep up with the ever-increasing difficulty of the enemy waves. \n\nGoing infinite is, in my mind, the absolute last solution a deck-building game should encourage, as it removes the thoughtful planning of turns and limits you instead to mindlessly playing the same couple cards over and over and over. On top of this, I think it's particularly silly when a game's goal is to side-step game mechanics. \n\n[b][REVIEW FINISHED][/b]\nWhat follows are a couple possible solutions to the problem that may be worth exploring for future games that attempt this theme. \n\n1. Remove the timer entirely, and instead place a limit on the number of turns that can be played between waves. This would, of course, require cards and buildings to be designed with this system in mind. The way you play cards [i]during[/i] waves would have to be overhauled as well; maybe you would be unable to play cards during waves, or you could have a separate battles-only deck that [i]does[/i] rely on a timer between getting new hands -- I don't know. This solution would (ideally) remove speed as a factor, and encourage a more 'traditional' style deck-building play, where you carefully plan the optimal route for a given turn. \n\n2. Remove, or at least heavily discourage the possibility to go infinite. At the very least, this means removing the ability for cards to draw themselves (as in, a 'draw two' card adding itself back to your hand if you have only one card in your discard pile). This would likely require some work done to balancing the amount of cards drawn from card effects, as well as the amount of money you can generate in a turn, and the cost of performing actions like redrawing and playing units.

It is a bit of a rough and frustrating initial surprise as a new player after purchase and may also be a turn off for some.

The downside of this is that the more interesting cards tend to be too hard to use in these loops and so generally get culled.  Sure you can try to use them, and you can get them to work but it just won't work as well as your tight 5-10 card loop.\n\nRatropolis really isn't any different in this regard.  What makes it stand out a little bit more is the other factors of the game that make it an interesting package.  i.e. the economic, town building and tower defence elements.  These make it interesting enough to push past the generally negative aspect of card based games.\n\nThe biggest negatives is the RNG.  I'm generally not that opposed to RNG as a mechanic in games.  I find it amusing how plenty of people won't play games that use percentages, such as the Xcom games because they can miss with a 95% chance to hit (lol).  The RNG in this game is next level.  From the direction the enemies come from, the enemy types, the strength of the waves, the availability of cards from vendors or building, the actions you can take at the end of each wave, the advisors you get to choose, etc, etc.  If you hate RNG, don't play this game!!\n\nOther than that it's a good little time waster.", "timestamp_created": 1619668435, "timestamp_updated": 1619668435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585559487342834473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91086123": {"recommendationid": "91086123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054887190", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1620902083}, "language": "english", "review": "so far so good", "timestamp_created": 1619666756, "timestamp_updated": 1619666756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473684221506118774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91083582": {"recommendationid": "91083582", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990904971", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1619661241}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de 2020 sin compatibilidad con ultra wide por mas simple que sea deber\u00eda ser compatible", "timestamp_created": 1619661357, "timestamp_updated": 1619661357, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.370370358228683472", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91081062": {"recommendationid": "91081062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074932114", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1619386437}, "language": "english", "review": "Certainly wasn't a bad game, I'm just not into TD-style stuff, and this was a bit heavy on that aspect for me. \n\nCute premise, and not bad overall.", "timestamp_created": 1619656619, "timestamp_updated": 1619656619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491739809513092041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91078475": {"recommendationid": "91078475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202509830", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2184, "last_played": 1694982647}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addicting game.

The game is very engaging, great time killer.\n4. customisable playstyle, no run is ever the same and multiple classes(Leaders) to choose from.\n5. Cute rats that like cheese!\n\nCons:\n1. There is no story line to the game just pure gameplay.\n2. Ratropolis gets hard quick, so you will need to learn the optimal ways to build each leader or lose the run.\n3. A lot of the cards can be quite useless compared to others, some balancing issues and tweaks needed.\n4.

The thing that stopped me from playing it, was that most leaders had an optimal way to build in the end which would make the cards you pick for that leader the same in most runs or be at risk of getting a defeat screen.\n\nI give this game a Does it Worth? of 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1618657164, "timestamp_updated": 1620154263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662019133567810059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90448286": {"recommendationid": "90448286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022685634", "num_games_owned": 805, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1621029362}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego de estrategia que me recuerda al Kingdom Two Crowns en cuanto al scroll lateral, el 2d y el planteamiento de las defensas, pero con un sistema de cartas, y lideres que cambia el como afrontas cada partida.

If you are expecting to build a maze like in a tower defense game or feed the needs of a population, you will be disappointed. Ratropolis is its own game, and that is good!\n\nThe deck-building in Ratropolis is the strongest part of the game. There are lots of opportunities to add and remove cards and you can build buildings to get even more opportunities to add and remove cards. Luck plays a small role, thank goodness. If you want to build your deck a certain way, you can definitely achieve that. Also, you run through your deck many, many, many times. This is great because you will notice the effects of small changes to your deck and again luck is minimized.\n\nThe UI and gameplay explanations are extremely well done. One feature in particular  that is awesome is the game automatically goes to slow-mo when you start to place a card. This removes the need for a pause and makes the game flow smoothly instead of some games in which you pause, then fast forward then pause.\n\nRatropolis is a winner for strategy and management gamers.

It manages to combine some cool deck building stuff with some cool tower defense stuff/RTS. Sadly it doesn't do either very well. The deckbuilding is fairly linear, and most of the cards are obviously chaff, where success is *heavily* dependent on getting the right cards. The tower defense has incredibly poor scaling, going from \"These enemies seem reasonable\" to \"Was  that a bug?\" levels of tankiness/overwhelming spawn numbers. The only strategies that seem to work are ones that adhere pretty strictly to the \"tanky thing in front\" and \"dps in back\" setup. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not opposed to hard games, its just that Ratropolis goes from 0-100 so quickly, it fails to actually teach anything to the player.

Unique and interesting gameplay - it's a tower defence city builder with roguelike deckbuilding\n - Very fun for the first 20 hours or so, depending on how good you are at TD games\n - varied and interesting class mechanics and cards\n\nCons\n - Game gets quite RNG-reliant at higher difficulties as there's a fair number of bad cards (bit of poor balance) and there's not many ways to pad against bad luck. If you don't get the cards you need your run just sort of withers and dies.\n - Monsters are also RNG (which is not bad in itself) but you can roll some really annoying stuff, especially on the beach tileset. Like you'd be having a great run and then one bad wave screws it all over.\n - Couple of UI issues: no numeric stats on deployed units; the time gauges for \"Service\" cards are way too small for me poor eyes\n\nOther\n - You get access to more cards as you play, This is kind of good because a lot of the cards gained from levels are interesting and strong, so it promotes playing more even if you suck / fail a lot of runs initially. Yet it's also kind of bad because it dilutes the card pool, so the more you play the more subject to RNG you become.\n - graphics are sort of cartoony and, err, kind of 90's-looking?

Recommend it, especially if you like the RTS & deck builder mashup this game will provide.\n\nCheck out my Youtube VOD of my playthrough\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk2nFU5oDM8", "timestamp_created": 1614120978, "timestamp_updated": 1614120978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87318184": {"recommendationid": "87318184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074388839", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 7318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1898, "last_played": 1699413800}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive", "timestamp_created": 1614120886, "timestamp_updated": 1614120886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87278600": {"recommendationid": "87278600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095102738", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1651132799}, "language": "english", "review": "k", "timestamp_created": 1614072012, "timestamp_updated": 1614072012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428571403026580811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87202963": {"recommendationid": "87202963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159403203", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 756, "last_played": 1613966521}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried it, took a break from it, tried to get back into it again and the game feels like a repetitive waste of time. \nMaybe the game just isn't for me, but i can hardly fathom what's fun in a game you know by wave 8 - 10 you can't win, especially since there's 20 harder waves after it.\n\nThe early stuff isn't much of a challenge, but the game usually bends you over without a warning whereas you just Cannot do enough damage to survive. \nAnd the thing is, a lot of my losses were basically because the rng didnt grace me with enough Unit cards with decent damage and sends a Boss my way that either a)Has Crazy high regen or B)Supporting units that actually heal both boss and extra units. \nSo all it leads to is wipe after wipe, after wipe. \nI barely have a 25 % win ratio so far and MAYBE it gets better down the line after grinding levels but the grinding feels more like a chore than anything especially since the rewards for leveling up dont seem to be that efficient. \n\nI will give it to the game, it has an amazing aesthetic and the theme is what caught my attention ( redwall anyone ? :P )", "timestamp_created": 1613964016, "timestamp_updated": 1613964016, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442365378141403198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87181417": {"recommendationid": "87181417", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977991227", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1665452905}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and addicting, having to make quick decisions makes this a lot of extra fun for a deck builder.

Time between rounds is valuable for obvious reasons and would make the game more manageable, also would boost the usefulness of the hasten round for gold thing, as you'd have preping time on 'after round' enough to want to skip the preping time 'before round'\n*Making so you can save your progress at least in between waves, just nullify savescuming if that's your concern. This is really basic and idk how anyone would find current state acceptable.\n*Make all the active usables from buildings appear on a side menu (something like bloon's td 6 sidemenu for powerups), scrolling around town for buildings is dumb. This should also include shop, chests and events.\n*Better visual indicator of which troop is under which wall's influence\nMore complicated but also vital:\n*Mobs are too quick or units are too slow or buildings are too squishy, game doesn't feel like it can be recovered from after you slip once. This is due to problems already cited, like game not letting you play cards quick enough, having to scroll for buildings, being clunky at splitting, having to scroll around to send troops. It's really frustrating to lose to the first slip and get snowballed with no comeback potential, some of it is due to card design. Everybody loves an underdog, it's thrilling to fight from behind, but only if you have any semblance of hope for victory.\n*Don't know if the game isn't supposed to be played past wave 30 or not, but the way the gameplay scales is that the further you get into the game the less time you have to make decisions, this is due to the way gold generation goes up, allowing for more cards to be played and discouraging smart play. Maybe fix that somehow.\n*Card and level design has lots of room for improvement, don't get me wrong I like the mechanics and ideas, but they feel unrefined. The shop is too unreliable (announcing when it's coming or having a set per wave and some decisions are just not balanced at all things don't really feel like tradeoffs.\nMiscellaneous grievances:\n*It's annoying you cant send units to defend your main building after the last wall on one side died, which makes for being unable to mount a last defense, but then again at the current state of the game you'd lose either way.\n*It's annoying how you cant exactly check next waves as a normal wave defense would be and prepare accordingly", "timestamp_created": 1613568175, "timestamp_updated": 1613568175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86831928": {"recommendationid": "86831928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206466465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 20743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14640, "last_played": 1671955392}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a nice mixture - I would describe it as a deck building, tower defense rogue-like which is challenging at the start but very revarding at mid and end game.\n\nThere is a lot of content, 6 characters with a total different playstyle,\nThe beginning is quite challenging for newcomers - can't say if it has changed since I know the mechanics too good now to say so.\nI hope for more content, since after getting all achievements there is nothing more to do for me. - maybe to get some daily runs.\n\nEDIT:\nOne of the biggest cons, saving a game, is not added to the game - perfect, thank you!", "timestamp_created": 1613510228, "timestamp_updated": 1616351408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86787824": {"recommendationid": "86787824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891103138", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 212, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1638618185}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fast and unforgiving, I love it! \nEvery round you play feels so different and one little mistake can make your whole town burn down.\nYou have a couple of characters you can pick of, which have different cards to use.

The cards are interesting, the 6 different leaders have such radically different playstyles that the game never becomes repetitive, the ability to witness your improvements to the city and your units changing looks as you upgrade them make the game very satisfying and creates this fulfilling sense of accomplishment.\n(cons)\nI think the wave system is a bit uninspired. There are 30 waves and for every 10 waves a new foe appears. That is fine but it leaves a lot to be desired. Speaking of uninspired so is the difficulty. The first 20 waves have enemies being beyond easy, with you not even having to pay attention at the front lines half the time, however in the last 10 waves the difficulty scales so much that you could be steamrolled immediately. This extreme difficulty spike is really bothersome and I wish there was a way to bridge the gap. For both of the issues I mentioned I feel like more new enemies and more waves before the official end game would be enough to solve them, but that is just my opinion. Also as a final note. Playing infinite mode (something you can access after you complete the first 30 initial waves) is very much meaningless. There are no rewards, XP or otherwise. The only reason I would ever try to reach the \"coveted\" 120th wave would be purely for the steam achievements.

Unlike many rogue-likes a single play through can seemingly go on forever (wave 30 is the normal 'end', it at least goes to wave 120- to the point where the game was struggling to keep up with the units on screen). The flavour and the theme of the game are interesting enough, the events and waves (of enemies) have enough variability where you are kept interested, but theres not too many that it seems impossible to account for/remember. Since its single player balance isnt as big of an issue, though you will find certain classes are far harder to win with than others, you will find some very strong mechanics (to name a few: minus armor stacking, stalling waves with baths and using cards like breed) but it is fun to build towards combinations that are very strong, and you will need to have done this to beat waves past 30- especially 100+- and high pollution runs. The difficulty scales well with pollution (equivalent to ascension(STS)/covenant (Monstertrain). There is enough content to keep you busy for a long while with 6 classes, with 3 different areas, and too many cards to count, however it does need to capture your attention first and foremost.  The difficulty on high pollution teeters with \"too difficult\" as it requires luck to consistently beat- earthqaukes, plague rats aren't the run killers, its not getting key cards (notably cards that increase your population like, breed, warren (for scaling), even cards like houses and apartments for early game defense) that will make you lose. Of course its a choice to play on high difficulty and with more balance I suspect it will become challenging and skill based enough to win without having everything out of your control go right.

As other's have said, there seems to be a huge difficulty spike right around wave 25. Enemies go from not being able to touch your walls, to mowing everything down in their path. There's also the issue with card balance. At the beginning of every game you get a few Cheese cards. Cheese cards give you 30 gold, plus an additional 30 for each Cheese you have in your hand. The issue is that they cost 40 gold. This means that you have to draw two Cheese cards to get any benefit from them, and this becomes harder and harder to do as you start adding cards to your deck. The risk/reward here is off. Cheese cards go from mildly useful at wave one, to be obnoxious unplayable garbage within just a wave or two. Just why? There's already a timer/cost to drawing cards; there just doesn't need to be this extra risk/cost. A lot of cards are this way, just entirely too situational to have in your deck.\n\nAnd this unbalance continues to other aspects of the game. Ranged units can, and do, miss. Frontline units will often run out to engage the enemy, which will sometimes be outside the range of the ranged units fire. Units gain EXP and level, but are hard to keep alive. Once you start losing units, you're basically done for as any new unit you plop down will be weaker than the veteran unit that just died. Moving units is incredibly difficult- you either move everyone as a mob or click individual ones and hope that the command to move them pops up. Either way, micro-managing is next to impossible.\n\nIf the game were $5, I would say, sure, give it a go.

The game is very much dependent on rng, Ive had runs where its wave 9 and i have yet to see the option to build a house and increase my population, this is just frustrating and unless you've gotten lucky elsewhere, it can be a round ender. I have no problems with the concept of moving my army around, but dear god does it need to be easier, clicking individual units and not having command groups is terrible, tab cycling just Isnt useful enough. A lot of the hero ability and unique card mechanics need better explanations; the shamans soul mechanic is still confusing even after I've cleared the game. Id really like to see more things to do with my gold, most rounds result in pooling massive amounts of gold and having little to no need for economic cards.

At least if we look past the epics of Slay the spire & Monster Trains and the alike. There are some themes being used in all decks to begin with, such as the \"not so cheese,\" cheese card. But other then that, the further you get into a run, the more unique will each deck and run feel.\n\n*I could see myself play this for 100's of hours, with the amount of content and small achivments\n to hunt for. But again, I want to emphasis, that the importance is, that I don't feel like any of the current runs, ever turned out the same, which is key to getting me to play those amounts of hours, and coming back for more.\n\n*So far do the game feel pretty balanced. Not to easy, not to hard for me, the average Joe. \n\nTHE NEGATIVE:\n\n*The runs can easily take 2 hours, if you hold over the cards for long, and get buildings or cards that slow down the wave speed of enemies. Tho, this is also seen as a plus, is this game pretty exhausting for oldies with slow reaction time, and with the need to rethink everything.

So as that compounds, without any particular effort, within the first 1/3rd of the run you have essentially infinite gold (it caps at 99999) - and a good chunk of the cards/structures/mechanics of the game are irrelevant.  Why is the first character you get a gimmick character like this that breaks the game and makes tons of stuff pointless?\n\nThe game is ostensibly a deck builder, and seems to think it's a deckbuilder, but again that lasts for about the first third of your first run.  Trashing cards is super cheap/available and there's no (or very little) reason to keep more cards in your deck. \n This means you very quickly get your deck size down to your hand size, and just draw the same hand every round.  At that point, you're not playing a deckbuilder - you really just have 5 abilities you spam on a shared cooldown.\n\nThe game does a terrible job communicating the state of the game.  You can't get a quick visual idea of how many units you have, how strong they are, or how much service life they have left (a concept that becomes ephemeral once you get a \"double these units' service life\" card.  Similarly, the enemies are just sort of a mass of opaque nonsense, and you just kind of hope your pile of turd is bigger than theirs.\n\nSo yeah, it took a couple tries but I won my first game and didn't really feel like I was interacting with anything.

The game is cleverly designed in this regard exploring a large number of card mechanic variants--one use cards, cards which power up over time, cards which power down, card combos, cards playable a limited number of times, etc. etc.  Most of these mechanics have interplay with other mechanics on the leader or cards in their sets, allowing for the discovery of interesting combos.  Similarly buildings available (one use cards) offer different advantages, some are common to all leaders, many are specific to supporting particular strategies focused around one of the unique mechanics for that leader type.

Although it has rather a bit of RNG, when I lose (and I lose fairly often), I can nearly always find the mistakes I made in hindsight.\n\nThe core gameplay is a mashup of deckbuilding, tower defense, and even Starcraft (the devs appear to be Korean), and shows a very very deep understanding of game design - everything you do in this game has an opportunity cost and may come back to bite you in the back later. Hire a low-powered unit just to survive? You may have trouble getting rid of it later for better units. Build a building to help economy early on? Better hope you get a Demolition card in the future or it's a permanent space hog in your city which may force you to expand. \n\nSince you can't predict the future in the game, in the early game, it's common to bounce from tactic to tactic before you can develop a coherent long-term strategy. The core of the game is speed management and the ability to make good snap decisions, somewhat similar to speed chess but with far more emphasis on coping with random situations. I'm not joking when I say this game probably will help you develop and hone your analytical skills. The results of mismanagement are just like real life - they only rear their ugly heads fifteen or so minutes in the future and then you realise that failure is nigh-inevitable as it gets exponentially expensive (cycling your deck) just to survive. The early waves might seem dull and uneventful, but they actually do lay the groundwork for your long-term success.\n\nThe developers also understand that everything is a resource - they aren't just limited to gold and your little fuzzy Ratizens. Space is a resource. Time is very much a resource. Gold is a resource. Enemies are resources. In true Korean fashion, even APM is a resource - some actions clog up your mouse and attention and may deprive you of developing and paying attention to trends which need to be addressed before you realise you made a grave mistake 10 enemy waves later.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive. The art is cute, from the cartoony rat citizens to the helium-induced rat babbling. The difficulty is just spot-on. Every Rat Leader has significantly different playstyles, and perhaps a telling feature is that nearly 50% of the people who own this game have played more than 10 games. Best of all, the game is very reasonably priced. \n\nIt's not often I find a game where I honestly have trouble coming up with valid criticism which isn't overly petty.

Though fun, it's very active for newer players.\nThe game works as follows:\nYou start your game with 1 of 6 leaders that decide your active and passive abilities and those, in turn, decide the way you SHOULD play. You then pick a zone that decides which enemies show up and which boons are common to show up for winning battles. From there you're dropped into a sideview of your, soon to be, kingdom and are tasked with building up your settlement by hiring units, building structures and exacting actions; all picked from your deck. That deck can be added upon by buying cards from shopkeepers that show up and substracted upon by various ingame mechanics (like events, buildings that have that ability or boons). At certain time indices you will be raided by the enemy in a wave-like style. A total of 30 waves need to be beaten before you \"win\" after which you can choose to continue or end your run.\nAll the while you need to juggle available population, money and structure abilities\nIf you win (or get rekted) you then accumulate experience which opens up new cards and/or advisors (this game's version of relics).\n\nSounds easy enough if not that time won't wait on you to make the choices; the next wave WILL come, treasure chests you didn't pick up WILL despawn and the merchant WILL leave and that's not even mentioning the idea that the game has a measure of RNG like any good roguelike has. You might not get the cards you need at that time in hand, or in the shop or maybe not in the combinations you want. This CAN put people off in extreme fashion....you might be fine from wave 1 to 10 only to suffer from bad rng and die by attrition....you might get horribly murdered in under 10 waves even.\n\nDoes this mean the game isn't any fun? Funnily enough; quite the opposite if you're anything like me. The progression from every loss is still progression and when you do win that first time it does feel like a true win, hard earnt and bloodsoaked.\nHowever, as my very top line said, it's not a game for people who're looking for a chill game to play whilst also doing something else; Ratropolis demands your full attention.\n\nAs for the rest:\nThe music per zone is chill and relaxing to listen to but nothing truly exceptional....not that you would have time to notice anyways.\nThe graphics are cute; you're playing a nation of rats after all and seeing those rodents dressed up in various armor and wielding a variety of weapons does give each unit type their own feel....a paltry cityguard truly looks like a poor man's shieldbearer and seeing an exile swipe at enemies using their katana definitely gives each unit type its own style.\nGameplay wise it's a bit janky at times.Units don't occupy space and it can become hard (if not impossible) to target any individual unit (be they friend or foe) which often made me question why single target abilities even exist in the first place. Sure, big enemies are easily singled out and often do the most damage but if you're trying to target the healer in a throng of lizardmen... well.... good luck is all I have to say. In turn this leads to a line of thinking that AoE is vastly favoured over single target abilities but ALSO to situations where you get hopelessly steamrolled because that shaman who's keeping the enemy group up in health is the last to fall (ofc). Buildings you build are permanent unless you can get your hands on a very specific \"spell\" and buildingspace is limited at all times so you better be sure if you need that second copy of a building you already have because, once placed, it's usually there to stay until the end of the run.\nThe difficulty curve is another thing worth mentioning. Every 5 waves you get a champion, every 10 a miniboss and finally on wave 30 the actual boss. More often than not you can truly notice the spike in those segments and either you keep up.... or lose; simple as that. This also means that if you're stuggling with wave 6 then you prolly won't last untill wave 10 unless you TRULY shape up and make drastic decisions. It's something that disappointed me a bit; there's no clutch ....once your walls start falling it's usually over...buildings are paperthin and often don't allow you time enough to mount any sort of resurgence. Even your palace will fall to (what seems like) maybe 1 or 2 hits of even the weakest monster, let alone that group of 10 who just tore down that final wall.\nIn addition to that the game has some tricky mechanics and synergies that are not apparent like in Slay the Spire or Monster Train. A good example is how you starts with the Cheese-card which nets you 30 gold for each Cheese card in hand... but it COSTS 40 gold to cast one so it's only a net gain if you have at least 1 OTHER in hand or you might spiral into a deficit. Labor cards not ONLY cost gold and a ceratin amount of time to complete ALSO cost available population; which you then can't use to hire units....or vice versa; you might overdraft and realize you don't have enough free population to do any labour. There's no active pause in this game....time moves on and that usually means you don't have the time to carefully read the effects of new cards or think about what casting them entails; you HAVE to know. All of this makes the game quite difficult for a new player and as a result you'll often lose because of one of these unforseen side-effects.\n\nAll in all Ratropolis is a great game for new people who seek a challenge in the \"coolness under fire\" department and for experienced players due to the RNG but if you're looking for something to play whilst also watching a movie then I would stay far FAR away.\n\n7/10\n\nNow....I got promised some primo Edammer; gimme the Cheeze", "timestamp_created": 1610627834, "timestamp_updated": 1610628268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480291068553924561", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84642602": {"recommendationid": "84642602", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994261970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 628, "last_played": 1611845598}, "language": "english", "review": "something like this isn't usually on my radar, but one of the creators i watch featured it and it looked interesting.\nthe card concept is new to me but i found it easy to pick up and enjoy,  this game is lots of fun.\n\nbest 15$ i have spent, thank you devs.", "timestamp_created": 1610583191, "timestamp_updated": 1610583191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545338749885559082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84641812": {"recommendationid": "84641812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024301834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1610578699}, "language": "english", "review": "No HD resolutions.

It feels like the entire run is mostly a cakewalk until you get to rounds 25ish/30, and then suddenly there is a massive spike in enemy damage/tankiness that will wipe your entire city in one wave of enemies. It can be very difficult to judge whether or not you can survive these rounds, because there is a lack of the following QoL features:\n a) enemy stat numbers, which you can only sort of see, but important things like health are frustratingly obscured or overly vague i.e. just a generic healthbar without actual numbers to reference (at least that I could find while playing)\n\nb) an easy way to check the stats of your units once they are out on the field. you can see how much they are buffing their stats, but not their actual stat numbers, making this a guessing game as well because there are so many variables that contribute to their overall attack/health/armor even before they are played\n\nc) an easier and more precise method of moving and assigning units to different locations. the current system is brutally inefficient, forcing you to either individually separate units from the pack or move entire hordes of units between wall locations. the only feature that helps with this at all is the ability to separate commands by unit type but that rarely helps either. \n\nd) the ability to slow down / stop time to issue more precise commands. this one is more debatable, because currently the biggest \"challenge\" of the game is time management for the most part, making use of every second as efficiently as you can. But given some of the other controls-related frustrations i had, I wouldn't mind seeing this added as an option later on.\n\nOutside of these issues, the game can be a lot of fun.

I will try to keep it kind of short. Very much a fun game. But, can be quite difficult on new players! \n\nPros: \n+ The cutest deck-builder on Steam. Easily! I'm not really a fan of rats/mice. But, the card art is so cute in this game that it just makes you happier seeing it. The voice acting is also so extra super well done and cute. \n+ Neat \"lore\" in a deck-builder. This isn't really a lore heavy/building game. But, what it does have is at least worth reading in my opinion. The very cute exterior hides a much darker interior. The random events are sometimes very brutal in the story they tell. Even the opening cinematic is pretty dark. \n+ Very quick gameplay. This can be seen as a con at times, though. While the early-game is a bit slow by design (not really in a bad way), the late game will be quite hectic. This is the only deck builder I've played where using the hotkeys is greatly recommended else you could fall behind. \n+ Fun mechanics. You have Skill cards that let you activate its effect when used. Building cards that you play once to place a build within your walls for a lasting effect. Advisers that can offer many different benefits. Various different mechanics on the military unit cards. It's not an exceptionally deep game. But, you can still create fun synergies and alter the way you play with them. \n+ Diverse Leaders. There are six rats that lead and each one plays differently from the others. They're not slight differences, either. The Merchant Leader can turn your economy into your best offensive option while the Shaman leader is wittling down the enemy with Curses. This becomes even more true as you unlock cards. \n+ Build Variety. While you don't generally \"specialize\" in certain themes like say a poison-based Silent in Slay the Spire, you can build thematically and create wombo combos with smart planning. Such as getting the Gladiator card from the Military Leader that increases the gladiator's max HP each time he is healed. Then, you get several methods of healing (buildings, advisors, skills) and you can rapidly make a tanky rat. Or, getting a lot of Curse cards as the Shaman to quickly stack up high amounts of Curse to deal strong damage over time. \n\nCons:\n- The most notable issue that you'll see on the Discussions forums and subreddit are the difficulty spikes. They've made attempts at smoothing it out throughout development and have certainly made it better with time. But, there is still a very noticeable increase in difficulty in the early 20s in waves (games are won at wave 30). You can be completely fine and even thriving one wave and then literally the next wave just lost. As you become better at the game, this gets much easier to combat. It is a hill you have to climb and can be a bit brutal on new players. Worth the climb! \n- RNG heavy! Like any other deck builders. It does sometimes feel like the odds are stacked against you. While it isn't bad enough for me (is for some others) to put me off, there have been times when you just get constantly bombarded with negative events and poor choices. Combine that with the noted difficult spikes, and it can lead to a very rough time. I consider this kind of a Pro as well. \n- There are a couple of relatively minor issues that I have problems with.

And that is a lot to say at once but thats truly what this game is. It manages to combine all these genres into one game that not only feels unique but also a ton of fun to play.\n\nThe game has so many cool little features and mechanics it would take forever to explain them all so I just want to highlight a couple awesome parts about the game. \n\nFirst of all I was really confused on how a roguelite deckbuilder could also be real time but it does something very clever. After a certain amount of time passes you can discard your hand and draw a new one. However if you don\u2019t want to wait you can spend gold to immediately draw a new hand. So there is a good balance of sometimes waiting because you need the gold for other things and sometimes you can afford to keep going through your cards.\n\nAnother thing I really like about the game is how unique all the different characters in the game are. They all have not only their own starting decks and abilities but they also have their own unique cards you will find in game. So when you play as the alchemist a lot of the cards that you get as rewards and in the shop will be themed around your character which is really awesome.\n\nAlso all of the characters have their own progression where you unlock new advisors, new cards you can find in the game and more.\n\nThis makes the game feel completely different depending on who you are playing as and since there are 6 characters to play as you have 6 completely different ways to play the game.\n\nAnd so the overall goal of the game is to survive 30 waves but let me just tell you the game is really hard. It\u2019s one of those games that is going to take you several tries before you even beat it a first time and the runs last like 40ish minutes. Also it appears to have the ascension level thing most roguelites have nowadays to increase the difficulty once you beat the game so I could really see some people putting hundreds of hours into this game if it is a roguelite that speaks to you.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is how the micro management is handled. And big disclaimer I am terrible at micro in games. I hate most RTS games but this seemed like it wouldn\u2019t be too bad to handle and its not for the most part though the game makes it really hard sometimes. Like as far as I know you can\u2019t just mouse over all the ones you want and move them to a different wall. You can move each rat individually or have all the rats at one wall move to another wall.\n\nAnd I am sure this is something I am just doing wrong especially since I am terrible at RTS games but it just seemed very clunky in my opinion.\n\nSo overall Ratropolis is an example of one of my absolute favorite things in gaming. A roguelite that incorporates other genres and this game combines so many genres yet it\u2019s not clunky and weird it is very streamlined, not confusing at all, and just a ton of fun. \n\nIf this game looks like the type of game you might enjoy I would highly recommend picking it up especially since there appears to be a crazy amount of replayability in the game from the different characters, to the unlocks, to the ascension levels, to also just learning how to not suck at the game haha.", "timestamp_created": 1610227559, "timestamp_updated": 1610227559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616336643695831299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84384259": {"recommendationid": "84384259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037457084", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 814, "last_played": 1677539708}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to begin with this lovely little masterpiece, tucked away, behind the big name companies, and games that are currently out there.\n\nI will say I have a bit of a biased when it comes rodents as a whole, I love them a lot, so to be able to play a game centralized around them is sort of a dream come true. And in the line of it being rodents, you fight a lot of enemies that naturally hunt rodents. I won't spoil the enemies, but I will say that you will be fighting things bigger than your soldiers 99% of the time, and it's disconcerning.\n\nThe gameplay is perfect. A lot of games have tried to blend things in that just simply were jarring, strange, or not very fitting for the way the game is suppose to be played. This game dares to be different, and added a rouge-like death mechanic, cards that add units, buildings, money, and skills, tower defense, and finally, city building, city management mechanics that work in unison with the rest of the game. If you die, you lose everything, if you don't manage your \"Ratizens\", you won't have enough soldiers, and if you don't manage your units on the field, you'll be overwhelmed. It's easy to learn, but very hard to master, because it's also luck based.\n\nWhich furthers us to the next points: RNG and the Enemy. The RNG in this game isn't just which cards your draw next, it's which cards the Merchant shows up with, or which one you pick from the Chest menu, or which boss you're going to face. At first it doesn't seem like it's that bad, but if you're preparing for a boss who, say, is going to attack your buildings instead of your units, and you get one that attacks your units... Game over.\n\nWhich brings me to the Enemy. Like any tower defense, the first waves are typically simple, allowing you to build up, farm up, and so on. The next set of enemies is strong, but if you have a good military, you'll handle it just fine. The last set of enemies, I will warn you, is where the real game begins. A lot of HP, typically able to one-hit your units, and run faster than the previous sets. This game is mostly perfect, but it's one blaring flaw is these last enemies, where the scaling is downright unfair. You might win on your second attempt, because of the first leader you unlock, like I did, but then the more you play, the more you realize just how lucky you were that one time. \n\nWhich would be fine, if there weren't other regions that made these final enemies stupidly broken. The desert makes every enemy stronger, and when you have these things that have a lot of HP already, it just feels like they get a buff to smoke you. If there was something I'd ask the developer to change, it'd be these guys. The game is fun to play until they show up, and ruin your setup. It becomes dumbed down to unit spamming and praying you can redraw enough to beat them out. Seriously, there is no strategy to them. You have to have a unit with a lot of damage and not melee, or a lot of HP to handle them, or you lose. This isn't a fun way to play.\n\nThe flaw is blaring, as I said, but the game is still worth picking up at any price. It's cute, it's fun, it has a lot of things to do, it's a very interesting, enjoyable concept, and it has a lot of love put into it. If these end-game enemies were fixed, and maybe add an additional leader skill to choose from at the start, (perhaps unlockable?)

It is challenging, but achievable (Took me several cities to fall before I won with Military, will be trying Shaman and Merchant)\n\nGameplay is nice and simple. You have two walls, enemies come from the sides. Use units to stop them from reaching the middle. The complexity comes in all the cards and decks you can have. Each leader has their own style, perks and decks which makes gameplay varied over each playthrough. Three biomes gives you a decent mixup, and they also come with their own small gameplay changes that really racks up the value of this game.\n\nThe rats are super cute, the advisers actually do something, random events, plenty of cards, and each area and rat does have it's progression. Leaders unlock more cards and advisers, the levels track which leader defeated it, which is nice for those who like checkmarks.\n\nIf you like these games, like Slay The Spire, and their \"card deck\" idea, then by all means this is a fantastic game. This is a really decent mid-tier TD game (upper being Gemcraft and lower being BloonsTD).\n\nMinuses is that there is no ACTIVE pausing. The game will \"bullet/slow time\" when you are playing cards, which is helpful but I'd prefer to actually fully pause the game and make decisions. There is pausing however so don't worry, you just can't do anything. There is no \"save\" feature, but at the same time a single full game to level 30 shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. Especially when you know what you are doing. Clearly made for \"play a few games\" rather than \"play a super long extended game over hours\".\n\nAll in all, I had fun and enjoyed this.

Quite a bit. I've been very sad ever since they came out, to learn that there is nothing else really like them. I think the format has a lot of potential for a variety of different genres and the 'build wide, defend the edges' gameplay is inherently suitable for games.\n\nI've played almost all the games that are out there and are vaguely Kingdom-ish. This is the first game that I think really does the style of gameplay justice.\n\nThe roguelike deckbuilder works really well. Kingdom, while fun, is honestly not the most well designed game. The first game is too easy but is very poorly optimized. The second game, farms are pointless. The third game... we don't talk about the third game (it's not bad, but too different from the previous 2).\n\nHowever this game, Ratropolis, pulls off the game format very well. It almost feels like \"well duh, of course this works\" when you start figuring out how the game works and how to win, and you see it all come together so well.\n\nI enjoy Slay the Spire and Monster Train, but find I don't have the motivation to grind for completion. This game is proving to be different. The combination of Kingdom-esque gameplay, roguelike deckbuilding (always a fun time), and action means that your attention is captured and then kept.\n\nOf particular note for this game, is the fact that the leaders are complicated enough that it takes a few playthroughs to really see what they're trying to do and how the cards come together. I've found so far (maxed out Military, halfway done with Economic and Builder), is that you get an extremely different gampelay experience based on the leaders. I find most roguelikes are pretty same-y, but in this game the Leaders are different enough that you are genuinely making different and deliberate decisions about how to play. They're very different from each other and it's been quite fun so far.\n\nIf you like Slay The Spire, Monster Train, and other roguelike deckbuilders, and/or like the Kingdom games: definitely give this game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1609962252, "timestamp_updated": 1609962252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52702707052230835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84172151": {"recommendationid": "84172151", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988659441", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1609955876}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game for a few hours :)", "timestamp_created": 1609962167, "timestamp_updated": 1609962167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84166936": {"recommendationid": "84166936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084382637", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1609957472}, "language": "english", "review": "This game severely needs active pause.", "timestamp_created": 1609957292, "timestamp_updated": 1609957292, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512175798416137695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84164235": {"recommendationid": "84164235", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967076538", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1609862411}, "language": "english", "review": "It's OK I guess but the core gameplay loop gets tiring real quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1609954863, "timestamp_updated": 1609954863, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453224867582321167", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84158988": {"recommendationid": "84158988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208716648", "num_games_owned": 1194, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 457, "last_played": 1620479956}, "language": "english", "review": "A very nice and original tower defense, unique gameplay style, infinite mode, nice features.", "timestamp_created": 1609949903, "timestamp_updated": 1609949903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667588651180267334", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84148812": {"recommendationid": "84148812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440774381", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1695403899}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el juego es muy bueno pero necesita si o si poder guardar la partida, es horrible que me tenga que ir y no pueda guardar la partida :(", "timestamp_created": 1609940376, "timestamp_updated": 1609940376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637826979160308838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84127530": {"recommendationid": "84127530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120357626", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2231, "last_played": 1649378515}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey if you are here because you like slay the spire, monster train, griftlands, whatever, you know what im talking about, then get this.

These kinds of issues are all going to be addressed by the developer with patches, but offer a bad feeling learning curve.) Also some things are supposed to be dark and ominous, but some cards and events simply aren't clear how they function. Drug store for instance seems like a translation error.\n\n- The game feels very snowbally, where the primary difficulty is in the first 10-20 waves then the final 10 are more coasting than playing. As of now I am at pollution 15 and I would say 75% of my losses are before wave 10. It just feels like I have a lot of thought and engagement in the early game and then kinda feel \"waiting for the run to finish\" for the last bit. Shaman and Scientist feel a bit different but the other 4 leaders usually snowball to the high end\n-No animation skipping. I think it would offer a ton of advanced play if we didn't have to wait for the \"Draw a new hand animation\" and while the game has a pause button so it would be abuse-able, it seems punishing for a live action feeling when attempting to speed up.\n\nAgain game is great, I would sleep on it.

Most modern games are so shallow and easy it almost hurts to spend time playing them.\nMe for my part enjoy the game a lot. I haven\u2019t bought into the \"infinity\" cycle part as of yet, rather playing slow and structured without a \"click fest\". I managed to beat wave 64 with this approach and can see room to expand upon my three approaches so far that do not force me to spam money or refresh etc. Here are three examples that work well in a slower way of playing:\n1.\tCloaking Builder: Go into cloaking the front wall on each side and its combat buildings. Fortify the second wall up to max. Not expensive and not too hard to manage (need two upgraded cloaking stations, 6-8 Watchtowers, Flametowers, Balista,\u2026 you name it and feel free to experiment on the exact build up). Beats Wave 60 no sweat. Upgrade \u2013 Advisers supporting cloaking, traps, trappers (not sure what they are called, units underground poking out spears). This will most likely carry me far beyond wave 60 if done right.\n2.\tBounty Fighter: Go into Bounty Tower and other cards that live from extra bounty. Build up bounty via cards, events and buildings. Tried this only to wave 30 on pollution 7, but works fine until then. I can already see its potential for later waves since tower damage scales all the way up to 75% of 999, should do the trick, maybe even incorporate this into the cloaking build up.\n3.\t(borrowed out of some other post here) \u2013 Speed Fighter: Build up Lancers with shoemaker and stuff. Sounds really good, haven\u2019t done much with this yet, but I can see it going far too.\nThose first two builds don\u2019t need any fast clicking or money drains. It\u2019s a slow approach that seem satisfying to me.

For some reason the devs thought it was a good idea to give that same keyword to cards that give temporary boosts. So the military leader's ability is \"Give ephemeral upgrade +1/+3\" which was confusing for me personally. They should've kept ephemeral as its own keyword and used temporary instead.

There are certain waves in the game where the power level of the enemies spikes --- think mini-boss type stuff. It's a good game mechanic, but I wish there was some indicator (maybe the round timers being purple rather than red?) that emphasized when such a wave was coming, so it would be easier to know when to stockpile and when to ramp up your defense. As of now, I suppose knowing that is just another layer of game knowledge. At times, you can see that the game is a bit unpolished.

Eh, if it's on a good sale, sure. You could even justify the full price if this is the kind of game that you really, really like.\n\nDo I recommend this game at its full price? Not really. While the mechanics have a solid foundation, and there's a lot of \"content\", it feels like this game that really likes trying to pad its run-time. I like the game, I do, and it is really fun for the first few hours with its unique mechanics. But there are some serious issues with it that hold me back from loving it to its full potential.\n\nThe reason why I feel this way is going to require a bit of math so, bear with me here, potential buyer.\n\nThere are 6 heroes you can play as. Each of them has 10+ levels of experience which. To gain levels, you have to play as that hero. In my experience, a full game will get you about a level. So, you're looking at about 60 games. A new level will get you something new to play with, though very minor - think of it like completing a run in The Binding of Isaac, and then unlocking a single item you might find during the run.\n\nAnd then, there's pollution levels. If you beat a level, you unlock the ability to play that level again, on a harder difficulty. You have to beat the previous difficulty, before advancing to the next. There's 20 of these per level, and three levels in the game. You don't have to just play the same level 20 times, but play and WIN the same level 20 times, to 100% the level. Each new level gives an interesting change to the difficulty in fun ways, but... well, look, there's a problem to this system.\n\nThese rounds aren't fast. A WINNING round will set you back at least an hour. Playing with largely the same set of cards and only one or two new ones, plus a single new change to something about the enemies that make them slightly harder [spoiler](for example: on Pollution 1 in one of the levels, the enemies are no longer affected by status affects)[/spoiler], for an entire hour, isn't enjoyable. It feels grindy at best.\n\nDo I think this game is good? Sure. But I also think that it's very flawed. It is amazing those first few hours, but its primary flaw becomes fast-apparent: it drip-feeds you new content way too slowly, making the game feel rather stale rather quickly. If you want to 100% this game, you'll have to sink bare minimum 80 hours into it, and I worry that the game would feel almost identical to when you started by the time you finish it.\n\n\n\nOh, also, as someone who really loves rats, it upsets me maybe more than it should that they put the word \"Rat\" all over this, but clearly everything in this game is a mouse.

More are unlocked as you play, but are just as gimmicky and useless, cluttering the card pool. The cards that do work nearly trivialize the game, as the main threats are just massively produced stat-bloated enemies which lead to boring endgames.\n\nUI is a mess, as military troops are a hassle to manage and there are notifications and alerts all over the screen, vying for player attention in too many directions and causing a stressful experience ([i]especially[/i] when there are enemies attacking).\n\nEarly-game turns into a rush to build economy by quickly buying extra cheap turns. But basic early-game cards can actively hurt a beginner player to use carelessly. In addition, you can upgrade cards as well, but this also makes them even more expensive to use while providing only meager benefits. All these factors make the game rather unintuitive and newbie-unfriendly.\n\nAs for Hardcore players, they have a leaderboard ...and that's it. Most of the game is just digging through the markets to get the right card combos/setup and steamrolling once you get them. There's an optional endless mode, but it merely drags the game out by randomly destroying your buildings and/or military until you lose or give up.\n\nThere's also this awkward period where enemies stomp through your city if they get past your last wall, leaving you unable to do anything but watch.\n\nI can't recommend this at all.

[/url] [/td] [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nRatropolis is a roguelite deckbuilder and tower-defense game.\n\nThere are six different classes. Every class has different cards. You start with basic cards and have to survive waves of enemies attacking your city. With cards, you can build different buildings which will give you bonuses, etc., units and buffs or debuffs. Enemies attack from two sides so it's important to defend both sides equally. You can move your units around but it takes time for them to move from one side to the other. \n\nThrough your run, you can upgrade cards, remove them from your deck, or get new ones. You constantly change your deck to make the best out of it. Destroying enemies gives you cheese as well as some cards do or some buildings produce it. You need cheese to play cards, buy cards, etc. \nEach character has a special ability. It can be upgraded in a run and is on a cooldown once you use it.\n\nEvery class changes the strategy of a run. Different maps force you to change your strategy. Special happenings are different on each map and can make your run easier or harder. \n\nIn this roguelite, you unlock new cards and classes with every run which makes future runs a bit easier. \n\nThe game is well balanced, free of bugs, and addictive with lots of content. \nIt's a must-have for every fan of roguelite deckbuilder. The tower-defense elements go well with it. It's one of the best early access games out there. It can be stressful in the later waves of enemies, but you'll constantly learn new strategies to make future runs less stressful. \n\nI highly recommend the game. It's well worth the asking price of around 13\u20ac/USD right now. This is your last chance to buy it before it leaves early access in December and gets more expensive.

I can't get enough of them.  When Slay the Spire came out and combined roguelites and deck-builders I was hooked for 100+ hours and even back in my pre-COVID table-top gathering days, deckbuilders (Dominion/Thunderstone) were my favorite.  The combination of control and RNG is so delicious and it's exciting to see all of the ways developers are using this in either quality design or just experimenting with a gimmick.  \n\nRatropolis is certainly a deck-builder + tower defense, not quite as sure about the roguelite or city-building elements.  You are the leader of a newly found city for your Ratizens.  These mice are your workers that you will assign defensive roles, stations or have them do other resource or support jobs.  Your workers assignments are a major part of the game but there are also autonomous defensive buildings and 'skill' cards to keep things interesting.  For an Early Access game, it is improving at an excellent rate with solid balancing updates coming (and more needed, but I have faith).  I love the variation between the Leaders, their special cards and abilities and how they all help you form a better overall play.  The game is unforgiving - very difficult (as good tower defenses should be) and it will take multiple plays for you to even get a decent grasp of what simple strategies are.  I was thrown off at first at the degree in which I was staring at the timer to tick down so that I could draw more... the 'time as a resource' is understandable in tower-defense but it wasn't until I played for awhile that I really appreciated it in a deck-builder (which I had always regulated to being only turn-based in my head).  Now I really like the tension that aspect brings. I completely get how a lot of gamers who are less interested in experimental Early Access/Indie games can get annoyed, but this has really captured by imagination currently.\n\nIf you love tower defense and/or deck-builders and don't mind some growing-pains in this experimental mash-up, then this may be a great game to try out (I was dubious, but patient and I fell pretty hard for this).  I look at Early Access Indie games with a lot of grace and care much more about gameplay and execution of a new idea more than nit-pickier things that can easily be fixed pre-release.  If your sensitive about the finishings, you may want to wait.  \n\nI just reviewed this for my podcast RYSK: Roguelikes You Should Know which should drop at the end of November 2020.", "timestamp_created": 1605883362, "timestamp_updated": 1605883362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621205925941467285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79525197": {"recommendationid": "79525197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881334109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3782, "last_played": 1689559084}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played alot of games in my time but none make me think as hard as this game. true you can make a plan but you will need luck to get the right cards. fun to play in bursts or while wasting time while waiting. \n\nits been fun playing this game and following the production of it.", "timestamp_created": 1605819498, "timestamp_updated": 1605819498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79475644": {"recommendationid": "79475644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015300404", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1853, "last_played": 1640460493}, "language": "english", "review": "cool", "timestamp_created": 1605728350, "timestamp_updated": 1605728350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79468380": {"recommendationid": "79468380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409736288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10304, "last_played": 1682920419}, "language": "english", "review": "Ratropolis is a dynamic real time strategy / deck building game that offers both casual and more complex gameplay.

With the exception of the shaman leader, the leaders all felt unique, and they had interesting mechanics to help you win. Likewise, the cards seemed to be reasonably balanced, albeit there was less niche cards. Now, the developers seem to want to have a ton of very situational cards, which are only useful in very specific circumstances. What this means is if the \"stars align\" the new cards are good, if the stars sorta align its passabe, and in most situations the new cards are terrible. A simple example of this design philosophy change is the navigator leader ability. In the earlier versions, when you used his/her ability you were give four quests to choose from. Each quest had a objective (collect X gold etc.) and a reward (give you gold, buffs etc.). As a player you had to choose which if any of the quests to take. Now, the Navigator leader ability gives cards in hand stock. Stock is a resource that is consumed on playing that card. Sounds more fun doesn't it?

Not something you want to invest a lot of time in and 100% complete. The best gameplay and combos are available from the start and everything that follows is jank cards/combos and hyperspecific playstyle cards.\n\nGames a mixed bag. In the beginning, it's a lot of fun. Sooner or later you figure out the basic mechanics with each of the leaders and the game starts to become a bore.\n\nUnfortunately all the card unlocks that take awhile to grind out are hyper specific. Instead of providing these hyper-specific cards at the beginning to teach players how it \"wants\" you to beat the waves, it gives you some of the best cards right off the bat. There's really not much point to grinding out all the leaders because the card drops are always worse/very specific and you don't feel like you're gaining anything.\n\nIf they would re-balance the cards and the distribution, this would be a slam dunk. \n\nThe normal game loop for these types of games is given different leaders with very specific playstyles, and working out how to beat the challenges with the options provided. Even if you don't win, you're still gaining xp to unlock new cards which expands and improves upon the gameplay each leader offers. It would be really cool to grind different leaders up to unlock a larger pool of cards. \n\nYour first games will be the best and easiest, because none of the cards unlocked in the future are really good compared to what you already have. Military/builder/factory are so easy with just the base cards. There are so many heavy hitting cards, then you unlock random \"cloak cards\" or other dirt cards that don't even compare to the cards you start with. Ultimately you're weakening your total card pool filling it with dirt. \n\nWhy would the players grind to unlock jank, when you have such bomb combinations to start with? All the critical pieces to have a successful run should be unlocked through different trees.

If you don't get a good orange military card by lv10, it's gg again. If you don't get an orange eco card allowing you to infinite your gold by lv15, gg again. Even you got all these, if you don't get the events that allow you to scale out your population, gg again. And there's nothing you can do about it. Devs should really reduce the dependency on RNG in hard mode.\n(2) Normal mode is too easy but hard mode is too hard, there should be an intermediate difficulty mode.\n(3) The start game is designed very poorly. You are supposed to spam the refresh button and spam every eco card you get before wave 1/2 to get as much gold as possible. I totally can't see the point of this design. Why don't just give the player that much gold and directly move on to wave 1, instead of forcing the player to do the same repetitive labor work every game? \n(3) The localization is terrible.

A pretty elegant combination of Slay The Spire-esque card game and base builder RTS. With a bit more pizzazz, a (much needed) permanent progression system, some QOL fixes and balancing and a big handful of calm-down pills, this could be a true rat-serpiece.\n\nFull <Early Access> ratview and feedback below:\n\n= Intro =\n\nHad this on my list since forever. Wanted something different, so gave it a shot.\n\n= Gameplay 61/00 = \n\nWhew. Where to even start on this one? And suddenly, I can't think of many good rat puns.\n\nAt it's core it's Slay the Spire, except that rather than using abilities, you build units and structures, expand your base and population limit and accelerate your economy.\n\nSo how does it feel? Honestly, it's like They Are Billions and Spire had a baby. And that baby was a rat. In 2D. \n\nAt first, this seems quite twee and forgiving. However, within the chest of this rodent beats the heart of the villain from Saw. Beating 30 waves sounds fine, but boy - does this take a bit of doing. Even on the easiest difficulty, it feels like I'm only starting to get a handle on the game quite a few hours in.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. The 'seams' that most other rogue-lite deckbuilders run on feel mostly absent here - the cards are quite straightforward and with the exception of the *very* rare opportunities to get advisers (essentially the artifacts of the game) lack any real interaction. \n\nOn top of this, the game relies a lot on RNG, even more-so than similar titles. It's entirely possible to lose a game in the 20s simply because you didn't get the right draws on infrastructure or units. And similarly, the 'golden runs' - where you get some crazy synergy going feel few and far between. \n\nThis may be because a lot of things that seem powerful (quest cards, some buildings) - the actual bonuses they offer are really small for the work/space they take. Static defenses are a good example of this, as they hog much needed real-estate and cannot be moved or even demolished without a specific, rather rare card.\n\nMy final issue gameplay wise is how frantic the game is. Especially later in the game, it feels like I'm running with infinite gold and population, but being held back at times simply because I don't have the APM to play the cards I want where I want (some are very fiddly), fire my static defenses (many are manual) handle structures that need clicks, cast spells and keep an eye on combat. Does a deckbuilder need to be this...panicky? \n\nSimply allowing orders to be given and buildings to be used during Pause would help this a lot.\n\nA lot of rogue-lites counter the difficulty and RNG with some sort of permanent progression system, allowing repeated runs to grant permanent bonuses to a hero or player. I really, really like this sort of mechanic as it creates a constant feeling of small gains even if a run ends in catastrophe. However, aside from cursory card unlocks, the game has nothing like this and feels like it badly needs something like it, to alleviate the frustration.\n\nNone of this is to say that this is a bad game. It's not. Next to the really awesome Monster Train, this is likely my second favourite deckbuilder at present. So much potential\n\n= Graphics and Audio: 55/100 = \n\nThe graphics are actually quite nice. Strong, 2D visuals. The fact that the max resolution is only 1080p is a bit annoying, but will likely get sorted before release.\n\nHowever the music will get on your nerves fast, as will the sounds of the rats. The next time I hear a 'GAGOOO' or a 'BLARG BLAAA!' I'm going to try to eat my own keyboard. I'd love to disable SFX, but unfortunately a lot of important cues are handled in audio. Rrgh.\n\n= Style: 80/100 =\n\nIt's such an original concept and the bones of the thing are excellent. I really don't have much to complain about here, except for the stuff I've already said - it needs more 'seams' and some permanent progression.\n\n= Value: 79/100 =\n\nWhile a lot of the game feels slightly rough at this point, there is quite a lot to do at present. With 6 commanders, each offering a unique ability and some cool cards, 3 maps to conquer (and a random thing I've yet to try) and higher difficulties waiting to...well, test your luck against, there is a lot here for the price and it isn't even the finished product yet.\n\n= Overall =\n\n+ Excellent concept\n+ Attractive visuals\n+ Lots of cards\n+ Challenging\n+ Plenty of content for the price\n+ Very active developers\n\n- Crying out for some sort of permanent, incremental xp system/progression outside of a few card unlocks\n- Audio can be annoying, but needs to be on\n- Too fast paced for it's own good, especially later - needs to take a breath and let us do stuff while paused\n- Many cards feel weak\n- Lack of synergy between cards\n- RNG can be frustrating, even for a deckbuilder\n- Moving units around the base can be a chore\n- Most defenses feel too pricey space wise to be worth it for their power, compared to raw pop/unit spam - and they all need to be automated.\n\nOverall, I really like this game.

There's a lot of neat concepts here, a real-time deck-builder provides for an interesting stress experience.  The sort of tower-defense play is neat as well.  But I think there's a balance that hasn't quite been struck and a few problematic mechanics.\n\nOne problem is the micromanagement of where units are.  It's just extremely tedious.  You can only place units on specific walls, to move them between walls requires multiple clicks (and moving just a few units is extremely complicated).  And so it becomes this game of maybe trying to just steadily recruit on the outer walls on each side and hope each side is well balanced?  If a strong wave comes from one side, don't even waste time trying to move the units to that side.  They'll be needed, but the experience of moving them over will be slow and frustrating.\n\nNot to mention, never ever ever can you let enemies get further than your last wall.  Then you cannot build units on that side and cannot move units to that side (because there's no wall to move them to).  Which creates this odd 10s where you've essentially lost the second you lose an inner wall, despite the fact that you have gold to spare and units in your hand, and maybe even a dozen units on the opposite side just standing around pointlessly.\n\nI think this game also has just a few too many mechanics trying to compete for attention at once.  The complexities of economy, buildings, units, unit position, and skills, and leader abilities, are all enough to make for a pretty solid deck builder.  When you add in a real-time element, it's a bit overwhelming.  And I say that as someone who 100%ed One Step From Eden, which is the most frantically stressful deckbuilder I had played until here.  But here it feels like a chore sometimes waiting for things to line up correctly.\n\nI think this game has a future.  I would be happy to re-review later.

If you have a big direct damage attack you want to use against a boss-type enemy or a buff to one of your troops, and they are in the middle of a group of units (and there's no other way for them to be), it is virtually impossible to selectively target them.  Beyond that, the redraw timing is clunky and leads to mistakes that wouldn't otherwise be made.\n\nThe difficulty scaling is pretty ridiculous and makes the game very frustrating.  \n\nRNG rules this game, and the RNG can be brutal.  I just played a game where I didn't get a single useful building until wave 17.  On top of this, there are really only a couple of feasible builds to be able to win.

Every so often, waves of enemies will spawn to try and take down your city hall. In order to defend your settlement, you need to balance the various aspects of management with the help of a vast assortment of cards. You will need to make money, you will need to grow your population, you will need to expand, and you will need to recruit troops to defend your Ratropolis. \n\nThere are six different leaders you can choose from, each of them focusing on a general aspect of the game. For example, the first leader you start with focuses on your economy, with cards tailored to making money faster. These different leaders provide different playstyles, although each can make use of cards of the others, provided they come across them.\n\nThere are also three different maps, with each map offering one unique faction of enemies (Enemies will be basic up until wave 10, then have the map-unique faction between 10 and 20) to further diversify runs.\n\nAnd you might be thinking at this point \"This sounds like a game I could sink a good number of hours in\", and you'd be right.\n\nYou'd also be underestimating this game, because there's a button with a very modestly worded tooltip in character select: 'Leader Plus'.\n\n\"There may be differences from a normal game\" is quite the understatement, because Leader Plus mode essentially overhauls a lot of the game, reworking some cards already present and fleshing out the decks of the three leaders that have Plus mode available right now. These new decks are more complex and make for a great challenge after you've gotten to grips with the other, base mode leaders.\n\nOverall, Ratropolis is a uniquely inventive take on the roguelike deckbuilder genre, and manages to pull it off with style, while simultaneously heaping a boatload of content on you!

I'm also writing this review having put about 4 hours into the game.\n\nI read some of the reviews that mentioned RNG early combos and difficulty spikes but thought this game would still be worth it. Turns out the game pacing is extremely fast. I've played on normal and hard and the longest any game lasted was 20 mins but that was one time I was really lucky. \nWhile working on unlocking certain leader cards (each leader has 3 sets of cards to unlock) and playing on hard. [u]Most of the time each game lasted 4 to 6 mins.[/u]\nThe roguelite aspect comes in with these card unlockables, similar to Slay the Spire. You receive XP at the end of each game. Playing on hard, I was getting about 100 xp per game and the first set of unlockables takes 300 xp (there are 6 leaders currently available).\n\nOn mechanics:\n-The main mechanic/resource of the game is managing gold income you collect every 10-15 seconds. Building houses increases the income collected by 1 or 2. There are a 3-5 instant cards to collect gold early on (+10 gold per card in your hand, a cheese card: cost 40 to play and collect 30 gold for every cheese card in your hand, and farming: send two rat citizens to work on a farm... in 90 seconds collect X gold) and a couple of buildings that provide similar benefits. \n-The next most important resource is citizens, as you need available citizens to play troop cards. \n-The other major mechanic is deck building. A merchant will arrive occasionally selling 9 cards and every chest at wave end usually allows you to choose 1 of 3 cards.\n\nIn terms of genres does mixing resource management, base building and deck building in this case work? It's just a little fast for my taste and as other reviews mentioned RNG plays a huge role. Especially in getting access to crucial troop cards early on for surviving waves 5 and onward.\n\nOn game pacing there is hardly any time to catch your breath. After you defeat a wave a chest drops that will de-spawn after 15 secs that contains your reward for surviving. Certain buildings have abilities that trigger every 120 seconds that require you to click on an icon above the building to trigger. Add into this the fast pace card combo playing and you start to get the idea. The game is fun but there is no exploration involved / moving units outside of the fort walls. You expand your base simply to have more room to place more buildings. In terms of pacing / number of things to click on screen think mobile game. There is no safe daytime followed by nighttime attack cycle like on Kingdom Two Crowns and each game is designed to be very short.\n\nSo far there is one tower and one type of wall. All of your main defensive options come from unit cards that you unlock. I think I saw one building that will double the damage of your towers and a quest card that will give your walls extra hp. But the quest cards are usually pretty hard to fulfill. One gripe with quest cards are they take up room in your inventory and you draw them into your hand. I understand that once unlocked you can play them like regular cards but they don't feel worth it. Like the space they consume in my deck plus the low probability of fulfilling them each game just isn't worth it. \n\nA couple of other gripes. After either of the last walls closest to your fort collapse, it becomes impossible to place any more units on that side / send military units towards that side. Your main building despite looking like a castle has a barely any hp. Seriously if the enemy breathes on it, it's game over. So what happened a couple of times was I had units on one side I would have liked to send to fight. But I was unable to send them in a few games and a couple of other times I did send them but they were too slow so it was game over. This doesn't seem like a problem until you have 1 or 2 very weak enemies survive/sneak by and it's just game over. There are some buildings and cards that increase unit speed but overall are a very poor investment compared to economic ones.\n\nTL;DR If you're expecting a relaxing TD feel/base builder like Kingdom Two Crowns you might want to pass on this.

I'm switching the review to recommend, but only barely. \n\nThe overall design of the game is fun, addictive, and challenging. There's tons of cards and abilities, and plenty of ways to achieve victory. Enemies, especially the end-bosses are varied and difficulties range from effortless (the turtle) to extreme (the bird). \n\nThere's still a lot of imbalance and frustration in the game, however. And it's all tied to there being WAY too many cards for WAY too little card selection opportunities. \n\nFor classes that have leader abilities that increase card variety (Builder and Merchant), you'll find most games moderately challenging with some unlucky games being frustrating due to poor draws.  For the other 4 classes, well, I wouldn't even bother playing them. Unless you luck out and get a Market card or two in your first few merchants, the odds of getting viable core cards (ratizens, money, and defense) goes down dramatically. \n\nMy biggest beef with those classes is that you have no idea your run is poisoned by RNG until you invest 5, 10, even 15 minutes. Getting 15 minutes into the game only to find you've never been offered a decent defense card, or the population to field them, is infuriating.

I love seeing a deck come together after waves of looking for cards, upgrading cards and thinning the excess.\n- Fun and Interesting events to add a bit of interesting flair to the world. It adds a bit when you see some of the way the rats are responding to your rule and decisions. \n- I enjoy unlocking different leaders and cards as i'm progressing throughout the game. The leaders definitely add something to your play style and they help shape what you do in your run and i think that it's a great way to provide some more replay value.\n\nThings that annoy me, but probably don't ruin the game for most people.\n- After the last wall on either side of the palace is broken, you cannot send troops to stop any enemy units. which means unless you have a bomb card or the legendary adviser that destroys enemies when your base is hit, the game is essentially over at that point. however the game does not end at this point. it can take time for the enemy to break any buildings that you have in that section, and if it's the infected that got in this can be particularly slow. which means you have to sit and wait, knowing you have lost until it becomes official. \n- The draw animation is slow. out of context it probably doesn't appear that slow. but later in the game waves move fast. I've played several runs where i could infinitely play a few cards and redraw them without cost. example: mining for 200+ gold, 2 copies of steal, +1 other card of choice. with no cards in bag you can cycle through these cards for as much money as you want. using your limitless cash use the other card of choice as many times as you'd like. this sounds like it should basically win you the game. infinite money, infinite uses of whatever cards you want. the problem was that the animation for drawing the cards took so long that i couldn't play cards quickly. Even when not attempting infinite loops, i still felt that i was being held back at times by how slow the drawing was. \n\nThings that i do think are somewhat problematic.\n- How successful your run will be feels heavily dependent on what cards you get. There are a lot of cards that i would probably never put in any deck regardless of what strategy i'm going for.  it's also fairly frequent that i open up the market, hit the refresh and still not want a single card. i've had games where i bought 3 market buildings because i knew if i wanted to beat wave 30 there are certain cards you basically need. \n- Depending on which leader you go with, there aren't a lot of different strategies you can go with that feel like they can actually help get you a win.\n\nReasons i say potentially 5/5\n- There is a beta mode in the game called leader mode plus or something like that. It has many more unique cards added. the cards themselves feel more interesting and special. I felt while playing that there was more variety in the decisions i had to make. Basically if they take what's in this beta version and keep working with it, this game would be a 5/5 without any hesitation.", "timestamp_created": 1591644285, "timestamp_updated": 1591644285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70493877": {"recommendationid": "70493877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893841981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 774, "last_played": 1612639403}, "language": "english", "review": "I just love that game and play it very often!\nI also beat it, but since some time it becomes impossible to beat anymore, which makes me sad :(\nEven on easy mode its impossible to beat the very last wave.

Why is it not either an ATB or turn-based game?\n\nI despise the real-time aspect of this game. It is utter lunacy, trying to figure out where to put down buildings, keep track of my troops, play cards from my hand, keep an eye on ALL the fucking timers, look for the merchant, look for active buildings that need to be clicked, and so on!\n\nThis game is chaos incarnate. I do not find it at all fun to play. There are so many aspects of its user interface I loathe, too. Where is the 'view my entire current deck' button? Why must I look at my draw pile, and then my hand, and then my discard pile to get an idea of my deck's size? Why can't I view or click any of these things when adding cards to my deck? Why can't I view them while I'm deciding which chest reward to pick or when a random event pops up (always at the most inopportune time)?\n\nLet me give you an example of the timers you have to keep an eye on while playing.\n\n1. Timers for your unit labor. Maybe you'll get some gold or a card draw every X seconds.\n2. Timers on your buildings that produce things. Almost no buildings are automatic, so if you don't click them, they just sit there, wasted, forever. Why can't you at least manually set these to automatically pop up or activate?\n3. Timers on the next enemy wave(s).\n4. Timers on when you can discard your hand without paying gold.\n5. A timer for how long the merchant will stick around.\n6. Timers for chests before they disappear.\n7. An invisible timer for your rat tax, which gives you money every X seconds.\n\nI'm probably not even getting all of them! Each timer you miss has a huge correlation with your early demise!\n\nWhy don't purchasable buildings tell you how big they are somewhere on the card's description, and why don't they tell you how many slots you currently have available? If you only have two slots available, buying a three slots building means you just added a useless card into your deck cycle! Genius!\n\nWhy can't I purchase the random card from the merchant and have the chance to immediately discard it? It's bad enough the merchant's wares usually suck, but my only shot at getting something decent is almost always a total crapshoot.\n\nWhy can't I pause the game and play units or cards? Don't tell me something like that isn't doable. If 'They Are Billions' can add such great QOL features like that, so can this game.\n\nIf this game wasn't a manic, unfun, hyperspeed game, or if it had a pause feature where I could just... LOOK at the battlefield, my cards, my hand, and make decent tactical decisions, or if it was turn-based... I would actually rate this game up!\n\nBut it isn't. It is all of the bad things I listed, and I don't see that ever changing.

I've had a lot of fun with it so far but it has two very big flaws I'd love to see improved in the future.\n\n1. The game has a big balance issue. The Knight leader seems much stronger than the others but I do believe the can all win on normal, I've already done it with 3 of them. The biggest issue is with the cards themselves. A few select combinations can beat the last few rounds but so many cards are not useful in any viable strategy. The biggest offenders are buildings. The basic house building is the main way to augment your army size. Anything that takes building space and doesn't give army size must give a very big perk to be worth using and many of them don't do this.\n\n2. The unit management is way worse than basic. First of all, most beginners don't event know that you can switch your army from one side or the other because it's not the same button you'd usually use to quickly move between walls. Also the AI of the units will sometimes work in weird ways. With some army compositions, the frontline can push the mobs so far ahead that the ranged units can't reach them anymore. And worst of all, there is no way to split a goup of the same wall. If you accidentally put more units on the side of the city, all the group stay there or none do. It's very likely to cost you the game since you have to wait for them to die to respawn some on the other side. If that's gonna happen, it'll probably snowball into a city destruction. It's also weird that not unit can directly defend the middle of the city. If your last wall is destroyed, you just weirdly wait for the mobs to get through the last buildings since there is no way for your units to come from the other side because they HAVE to move to a wall.\nI'm not asking for full RTS micromanagement but this at least needs to get more intuitive and your units need to be able to directly defend the city center. I would also love to have a way to split units on a wall.\n\nAnyway, even with these issues, I'm having quite a fun time with the game.

The concept is fun. The execution isn't, at least for now. Graphics and sounds are good.\n\nBesides the EA basics (balancing, missing content), which I do believe will get done, in my opinion this game has are fundamental gameplay issues.\n\n1) Unit stacking. As you may have noticed from the presentation video, units have no \"body\", they can stack on top of each other as if they were nothing. Your units and the enemy. That means that they can form a blob, which instagibs everything, somewhat at random. Enemy units tend to come one by one, so that's what your units do. To counteract this, the devs have implemented AOE damage, which... decimates those blobs. On both sides. There should be a limitation to the number of units on a position, to reduce the power of AOE and insta-gib blobs.\n2) Infinite stacking. There are card which add bonus to your unit cards in game. Permanently. This a huge no-go for me for game based on CCG mechanics, as it always ended in failure. Other cards add permanent bonuses to gold generation.\n\nOthers things I think are missing, but I doubt they'll be in game:\n\n3) Maybe I missed it, but I failed to see a way to separate your armies at a tower.\n4) Power level feedback. Basically, the game let you position units at a tower, and enemy waves come from the left, right, or both at each wave. The warning gives you the number of enemies like this : 1x unknown, 5x unknown, 3x unknown. Over your units, the only things you have are small icons, and a number telling you how many each of them are. However, units go from 5 to 400 HP, from 2-3 attack to more than 50. Also, the units you placed may have different stats depending on how, when, where you put them. So, none of that gives you an accurate information of whether you'll win or not.\n5) Complete rework of repair mechanics. Repairing consist in clicking on a building and waiting for 5 seconds that it repairs. You have to remain still for those 5 seconds. Later in the game, enemy bombards your buildings and can break a half a dozen of those in a single wave, and waves come about every 30 seconds. There are building that made repairing faster, but that's a band-aid on a bad game flow.\n6) building rebuilding. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't demolish my own buildings to make place for new ones.\n7) a way to make housings and towers to expand more reliable. You can get a run completely lost just because you don't enough of those. Housings are what limit the number of soldiers you can have. I blocked, at first, at maximum level 26 (with a lot of losses lower). I started buying those everytime they appeared and made 2 runs at 29 and 30.\n\nSo I don't recommend it. I finished it for the challenge, but I didn't have fun. Maybe it'll get better.\n", "timestamp_created": 1588453066, "timestamp_updated": 1588453066, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544072985649108887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68437208": {"recommendationid": "68437208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376082731", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 291, "last_played": 1622813116}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun but it would be more fun if there was a pause button.\nor turn based game from the beginning.", "timestamp_created": 1588433740, "timestamp_updated": 1588433740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68425406": {"recommendationid": "68425406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002656504", "num_games_owned": 622, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 5738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1612583963}, "language": "english", "review": "Update : Once again, this game has simultaneously improved and also gotten worse.

Because it's a rogue-like deckbuilder, you only have a slim chance of ever seeing any of those cards. Everything else is barely necessary. Your soldiers will go down too quickly to defend late game if you can't buff them, you can't buff them if you don't get the right cards, and you can't get the right cards when your deck is cluttered and/or you don't get good drops after each wave.\n\nIn other Deckbuilders, like Slay the Spire, each card complements a new tactic or playstyle. In Ratropolis, each card is necessary in some way, leaving you struggling to make space for new buildings, earn money, and manage your population, while ensuring you have a good hand to play during the next wave. If you get a hand full of weak soldiers during a tough boss fight, or buildings you can't place because you have no space to do so, you're forced to discard them. It's made worse still if you need either a military or building card, but you have a hand of useless cards (such as skills that should only be played during combat), and you have no means of using them.\n\nYour downtime is often spent rushing for cards and trying to juggle where some buildings should go. their placement is semi-permanent, meaning that if you accidentally slip and put it in the wrong place, you've just screwed yourself if you have a building card that requires a large space (like a horn or a ballista). Your best bet is getting a demolition card, but good luck getting that before the next wave and not burning through your money on early redraws.\n\nI've finished it twice, and while I did enjoy those playthroughs (and will continue to play it on and off - a negative review where the player can't stop, shocking, I know), the game feels much too cluttered with its mechanics and must be played in a specific way; with a heavy reliance on military.

I do have to give them credits about a lot of good improvements such as some interface are more friendly now, you can control single units. Then of course the downside of you cannot save and load the game still exist, still very RNG heavy, aka if you dont hit all aspect of cards(building, econ, ratcitizen, military) then you are basically fked. the updated game require you to unlock all the cards again. Bonus rant: The fact that in the updated version, most military units are services cards pisses me off so much, because that means now you also need to find good spell card to win. Thanks dev, adding more rng to winning condition,\n\nIn conclusion: I think this has potential, or had potential(as a player who completed the 120 wave nightmare challenge, i did enjoy this game).

You can be  doing extremely well and upgrading your armies and defenses and winning strongly, then a group just runs over them and there are very few countermeasures once the fight has started.

In ratropolis you need to survive 30 waves of enemy attacks on your town to win. You play mostly by playing your hand of cards to have various effects... in real time. So throughout the game you build up better cards to do things. Some cards are one time cards that create buildings in your town that have ongoing effects but your town can only has so much space for building though you can expand the walls. some cards create warrior rats to defend the walls. Others get you money which you need to play the cards.\n\nThere is quite a bit of random chance in the game with different cards you can get and different events so sometimes you can lose and it doesn't feel fair, Other times you get a good combination of cards early and the game feels easy. Usually though I find that I can scrape by with what is given to me although often if I'm going to win by the end I feel pretty secure. There are cards you don't get until you unlock them by playing and a lot of the unlockable cards are pretty strong so the game might be really hard until you get a few unlocks.\n\nOverall I liked this game a lot and I haven't played anything quite like it before so I recommend people try it.", "timestamp_created": 1586103372, "timestamp_updated": 1639448525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580419540405273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66525372": {"recommendationid": "66525372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068322746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 292, "last_played": 1662215909}, "language": "english", "review": "help protect the ratizens", "timestamp_created": 1585941557, "timestamp_updated": 1585941557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66469080": {"recommendationid": "66469080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425204299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3481, "last_played": 1665251748}, "language": "english", "review": "Combines deck building and tower defense really well.

It has low system requirements for older systems, the design and theme are amazing, and the game concept is wickedly interesting. I enjoy how the game combines deck building with a tower defense strategy game. As an early access game, there is a lot of polish here - point in case, I've only had one small 'bug' where my cursor occasionally goes a little bonkers and can be reset by just hitting escape twice.\n\nThat said, there's still a lot of room for growth here. The game really only has one real win strategy - build up a ton of gold and only hire a couple of specific troops to smash your way through the end boss. There's also no real difference in difficulty levels. When you also account for the fact that the level 30 'end boss' is insanely difficult compared with other mobs, it's easy to see the tuning that needs to take place.\n\nMy other big ding is that the game really lacks replayability. Due to the lack of win conditions, once you've played once, it feels like that's the entirety of the game. Even the micro rewards of new cards with the xp system feel pointless because they only get in the way of the cards that are most useful. If the developers added in some new victory paths, a set of challenges maps, and maybe introduced a couple co-op modes such as versus or a split invasion defense this game would be truly amazing.\n\nMore than anything though, with the progression system I want to be able to build custom decks. The current game mode relies heavily on random card drops. It could be way more fun to have limited decks based on the different heroes that I could cultivate as I powered through the game with rare unlocks for completing each storyline. This would really let me feel a sense of progression and involvement.\n\nSo, bottom-line-up-front, buy the game if you don't mind early releases. The devs did a great job and I think they will continue to do some great things with this one.

I find myself with money or lots of low tier units that don't matter once the third wave of monsters start appearing and they get one shot with nothing i can do. \n-rework defensive buildings. catapults/archewr towers are a trap and don't do anything especially when you have to expand for more bulding space and they don't matter. \n-have a gold cost to upgrade cards at increasing cost intravels and time: economy doesn't seem to matter very much later in the game and buildings seem way underpowered where it is better just to stay in your small boarders and not expand and just use all the bulding space to build only houses. \n-quest cards feel clunky and the reward is never worth the value of completing them especially since completing them takes longer than you can last in the game \n-it would be nice to add an auto pause feature for players who wish to use it with settings like \n-merchant appears\n-way is coming\n-wave is defeated\n-wave starts\n-ect\n-i would really like a gold option to upgrade buildings that have been placed it would give you more options to play with. i understand the whole concept of this game is to play off your deck but card rng is so terrible you are locked out of the majority of the game no matter what you do (example my best run is one where i got a pike man unit on my first merchant buy. no other runs have come close to that. pike men are OP until tier 3 monsters which just kills everything no matter what you do. \n\nFinally tutorial issues\n\n-what do advisors do this doesn't seem to be ever really explained\n-is there a way to upgrade cards\n-when increasing leader level there should be a tooltip over that option that will tell you what that does exactly, or what changes you get at the next level\n", "timestamp_created": 1582752767, "timestamp_updated": 1582752767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64144803": {"recommendationid": "64144803", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972277589", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1220, "last_played": 1671919477}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, easy to get into, plenty of replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1582720119, "timestamp_updated": 1582720119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64069836": {"recommendationid": "64069836", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981521401", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 7281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1848, "last_played": 1680156992}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1582586154, "timestamp_updated": 1582586154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64067874": {"recommendationid": "64067874", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964358547", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9015, "last_played": 1695315463}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sigo esperando idioma espa\u00f1ol, un juego realmente adictivo.

But it happened to be a real-time tower defense with hordes of monsters, agitated clicking and resource collection, all of which I'm not a big fan of.\n\nThe game is easily beaten with the following set of cards, which unlike Slay the Spire, you can get in every run:\n- Mining (skill, common, gives N gold, and +3 gold every time you play it, breaks the game). If you get one or two early in the game, money becomes unlimited, hence you can draw cards as often as you want.\n- You only need two units: the bird rider with a lance and the healer (sorry, don't remember the names). It's is better to get the bird rider as soon as possible, so it becomes an auto-choice in stores and chests.\n- Buildings: barracks and warehouses and the ones that copy a card and upgrade a card. Copy upgraded barracks, they give +3/+13 to a chosen unit every 120 sec. 4 or 5 barracks will be turning your bird rider into a tank, I stopped training mine when they were about 300/1300 in stats.\n*there is no need in any buildings that give you money thanks to the Mining card.\n- Skills. You'll only need one that reads \"Labor: +1 ratizen in 60 seconds\" (+2 ratizens when upgraded). This one card gets you to 200 ratizens, which is max.\n*other useful but not necessary skills: the one that gives your units +100% movement speed for 15 sec (which doubles the power of bird riders); and the one which speeds up the production of your buildings for 15 sec (so your barracks can train birds more often).\n\nBest class, hands down - builder.\n\nIn the end: bullet-train-bird-riders with unlimited stats, unlimited money, max ratizens. \n\nThe set of cards is easily obtainable in every run by wave 20 and it is much stronger than anything else that I've seen, making it the only strategy, but it's super boring: click on barracks, get new hand - auto play mining and other cards, click on barracks, get new hand -- auto play your cards, click on barracks... If you decide to grind through all 140 waves in Nightmare mode (or how many there are in it) it'll be about 4 hours of this rinse-repeat routine with no variety (I quit at wave 70, it became too tedious)\n\nAll monsters look the same as well, just moving pixels with stats, player uses the same strategy against all of the monsters. A mob of 20+ monsters is just one big blob of pixels. Same is your blob of birds but with higher numbers. Just throw your blob into the enemy blob and that's all the strategy you need in this game.

Ratropolis pleasantly surprised me yet again and is now the newest of the genre to soak up my free time when I had initially gone into it not entirely sure of what to expect. After only the first couple of games, I realized that it\u2019s another title to earn a spot among my favorites for its unique blend of real-time and deck-building elements, a combination that is so well done that I\u2019ve played at least two games of it every day since I first got my hands on it.\n\n\n[b] Enter the Rat Race [/b]\nRatropolis is played in games that last anywhere from a couple of minutes to half an hour depending on how well you hold off the enemies of ratkind (other rats, weasels, and even reptiles) that seek to raze your city. Waves of increasing strength arrived every minute and you must fight them off with the resources that you have at your disposal. Fortunately, each wave provides a treasure chest upon being defeated that rewards you with a choice of useful boons, such as adding or removing cards from your deck, increasing the efficiency of your leader, or even building a new house to boost the population of your rats and the taxes that make up your income. The occasional boss wave offers an even more impressive selection of rewards, though you certainly earn them as they are a significant threat to your settlement.\n\nDue to the real-time nature of the game, drawing a new hand of cards is restricted not by turns, but by a timer. You can pay a hefty sum of coins to skip the timer and instantly draw, but even the richest of cities will struggle financially if this is used too often. There are plenty of times where it\u2019s worth it though, an immediate hand or two in an emergency can be the difference between surviving a wave and being overwhelmed by it.\n\n\n[b] Hoarding For Survival [/b]\nWhen you first begin, you some open land with your capital building centered on it, and a wall on either side of it. The direction that the settlement goes from here is determined by the cards that you use, and they come in for primary categories: economy, building, military, and skill. Other than in rare instances, cards always cost gold, and sometimes other resources such as your population. Economy cards tend to focus on making money in one way or another. Building cards are single-use cards that construct permanent structures on your open land or expand it further with new walls at predetermined locations. These tend to offer powerful activated abilities and useful passives, though they\u2019re a fairly uncommon find and the most impressive of them are also expensive. Military cards create units at a wall of your choice, each consumes one of your population (or more if they\u2019re particularly powerful) as well as their cost in coins. Unit types are varied and plentiful, but you\u2019ll often struggle with your available population due to the increasingly stronger defenses that you need; housing is more than worth its weight in gold. Finally, skill cards are used for an instant effect, such as a battle cry that buffs military units for a short time, or another that sets an area on fire dealing damage to all units that pass through it until it burns out. I was pleased with the assortment in every category, and gaining new cards never stops being exciting.\n\n\n[b] King of the Rats [/b]\nEach game of Ratropolis starts with you selecting a leader, though you\u2019ll only be able to use the merchant in your first game as you\u2019ll unlock the rest by hitting milestones later. The roster currently includes the merchant, the general, the building, the scientist, and the shaman, though there is at least one more coming by the final release. Each of these comes with an activated ability and a passive benefit. The merchant can discard cards to generate additional gold for your treasury based on the amount of gold currently in it, while they also reduce the purchase price of new cards from merchants and the market. The general can strengthen any military cards in their hand, and every such card in their deck increases the population of your settlement. The builder can discard their hand to acquire building cards that must be built before drawing the new hand, and building cards, in general, can be played on buildings of the same type to upgrade them. The scientist can generate skill cards that must be used immediately, though the use of any such card will reduce the timer on their ability making it available frequently if you have a good number of them in your deck. The last of those currently available, the shaman, specializes in the soul resource and can use it as a currency to acquire a number of useful benefits. With leaders that suit a wide variety of playstyles, I\u2019ve found that I can play several games in quick succession without losing interest and I\u2019m looking forward to whatever others may be added to the game in the future.\n\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nRatropolis is easy to learn, but a challenge to master, and every game feels different from the last. Although some have offered solid competition for Slay the Spire\u2019s crown at the top of the genre, none have come as close to Ratropolis for me, and that\u2019s saying something as it\u2019s still in Early Access. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the concept, particularly if you\u2019re into card-based mechanics, as I\u2019d already classify it as an indie gem even in its current state. The only warning that I would give is that its real-time aspect keeps you on your toes and rushing about, sometimes even making you feel overwhelmed depending on the situation at hand. If you don\u2019t need that kind of stress in your life and would prefer games that are slower-paced, this one may not be what you\u2019re looking to pick up as your next purchase.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1580514309, "timestamp_updated": 1580514309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592080473899841309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62728625": {"recommendationid": "62728625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093271871", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 912, "last_played": 1645282184}, "language": "english", "review": "interesting game.

In terms of my play-time, I've completed most content (including wave 120), so I feel I've enough experience with the game to give a moderately informed review. \n\nIn a nutshell, this game is a very polished game that reminds me of my days playing free games in the heyday of flash.  Take a Newgrounds defense game and add a massive layer of professionalism and that's this game.  You play a defense game where your units, economy, and development are linked to a deck built throughout a session.  It is hard.  You will lose a lot.  But there will be an \"ah-hah!\" moment where you understand what the game wants from you and suddenly it will be rare to lose.\n\nStrengths:\n-- Presentation: Adorable mice set against a backdrop of a grimly brutal world, what's not to love?  UI is simple and could have a few QoL additions but does the job just fine.  Soundwise the voice \"acting\" is amusing and cute, but otherwise unremarkable.\n\n-- Gameplay Loop: For the first 20-30 hours, there's enough variety to satisfy even veterans of games like Slay the Spire.  Like Slay, you can work your way towards some absurd \"combos\".  It's quite satisfying to see a wave melt after a single twang of your crossbow rats or having a single \"Greatest Rat\" wipe the floor with a boss.  Beyond that, however, and the lack of depth is clearly shown and going for the harder achievements really lays bare the weaknesses of the game.  Continual updates should stave that off (though the most recent one, the Shaman, does not).\n\n-- Usability: The game runs really, really smoothly.  The polish in the game (barring the somewhat poor yet charming English translation) shines through.  Cards come and go naturally and the game, in general, works without any issues.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-- Difficulty: The difficulty curve in this game, right now, is jarring.  A unit composition may smash one wave and be overrun the next.  A lot of this is down to the RNG present in the game.  Waves can spawn on 1 side only, meaning all of the enemies on that side get doubled up and can really mug you if you're already falling behind the curve.  It's very feast or famine but has improved since it's initial steam release.  Won't touch much on nightmare mode, as I truly believe it's meant for masochists.  My run took me ~6hrs, mostly just clicking between barracks to slowly upgrade units. \n\n-- Odd Choices: A catch-all, but largely it refers to your ability to control your units in game.  It's not uncommon to see half your melee units fighting the mobs whilst the rest of your forces stand there picking their noses.  You have no direct control over them.  This makes certain units almost entirely useless simply due to the AI controlling their actions, Medics are especially poor due to this.  Similarily, moving units is incredibly painful as you can't set them to go to a specific wall, just up or down one wall.  These are largely minor issues, but have wiped a couple of runs for me.\n\nOverall, it's a niche game.  If you like hard games and you like defense games then this is right up your alley.  You will have to forgive some minor issues but you should get solid enjoyment for the price.

The blending of deckbuilding and RTS is a fun mechanic and pulling off neat combos of cards feels great. Though as many other folks have said there are some cards that simply feel too weak to feel happy playing. In other deckbuilding games the main RNG factors are whether or not you get the right cards or items, in Ratropolis you also have to deal with the RNG of which side the enemies attack from. In the early stages this isn\u2019t much of an issue as you can move your troops from one side to the other but once you build up your empire this isn\u2019t a feasible strategy. Having a balance of forces on either side is also a viable strategy but when the mid to late game bosses spawn you basically have to pray they spawned on the side with the most troops.\n\nBalance wise each of the leaders do offer slightly different playstyles but some of the powers do feel lacking. The Merchants R ability ranges from \u2018meh\u2019 to \u2018okay\u2019 depending on how much money you have. The Shamans ability would be great but it feels like half the soul-siphon cards are pretty weak unless you stockpile absurd amounts of Souls onto them. \nThe advisors offer nice bonuses that range from passive \u2018good\u2019 effects to bonuses that shape your run entirely. That being said I think it would be nice to have some way to buy an advisor, relying on the events and legendary chests yet again makes it feel like youre at the mercy of the games RNG system.\n\nThat being said when you get the nut combos the game really feels fun some of my favourite combos have been: \n-\tAs the General Leader, Train + Arm + Rally. The combo of your hero power plus the skill cards allows you to get some truly beefy troops.\n-\tAs the Builder Leader, Tavern/s + Totem lvl 2. Using the Tavern ability to duplicate cards you get to the point where you are reducing the attacks of enemies to the point where they do next to no damage. Other leaders can pull this off, but the Builder has an easier time hitting the combo.\n-\tAs the Scientist Leader, Ignite + Shock + Agit. An obvious combo but stunning enemies and watching them burn Is a nice combo and it gives your soldiers a nice day off. Using support cards like Tracking allow you to hit the combo more reliable. \nAt the time of this review I still haven\u2019t completed all of the achievements and I am still having fun trying to complete them all. Hopefully the developers stay passionate about this project and continue development into 2020. \n\nSolid foundation, with some rough edges that need smoothing but still a fun experience.", "timestamp_created": 1577944000, "timestamp_updated": 1577944050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61023909": {"recommendationid": "61023909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059060785", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1683591325}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a wonderful and fast paced little deck builder.

At this point, it's excellent.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nThe Good: the game is easy to pick up, quick to play, very cute (I'm not biased SHUT UP)\n\nThe Bad: as other people have mentioned, there's still pretty serious balance issues with the various cards and heroes. That's a common problem with games like this, but due to the difficulty and speed this game plays those balance issues cause massive swings in gameplay - even a couple hours in, it's clear that you either luck out and get the OP cards you need to win or you quickly hit something your deck just plain can't deal with and that's the run; I even had one particularly unlucky run where the only way I could have made it to wave 10 was with perfect play, as I just wasn't given enough economy and military cards to handle the enemies being thrown at me. Unlike similar games, you're effectively dead the instant anything breaches the barricade - so there's no chance to recover from a failed strategy or a short run of bad luck, and often I didn't even run across repair cards so it was a very quick battle of attrition. Several enemies can automatically breach or jump over barricades, as well - so if you didn't have the right combination of units to handle the size of the group being sent at you in place already, that's it.\n\nHopefully this will get better over time, but right now it's still pretty rough.", "timestamp_created": 1577674772, "timestamp_updated": 1581996544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566302061080932617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60855827": {"recommendationid": "60855827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047124201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1819, "last_played": 1622337743}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game. though it can be hard even a bit unfair sometimes but when you get your deck working it's beautiful.\n\nsome bugs at the time of writing this and small QoL improvments needed but not to much that ruins the experence I'd give it 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1577645401, "timestamp_updated": 1577645401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508885324001312256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60845735": {"recommendationid": "60845735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987181093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1613692204}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay loop in Ratropolis is to play economy cards for gold, and to spend this gold on military units to defend against waves of enemies. There's a little extra going on with ratizens and needing to upgrade soldiers, but for the most part this is your gameplay loop. The problem is that each of these things are extremely samey.\n\nThe first problem is that all economy cards essentially function as if the text said, \"Play this card for gold.\" Sometimes you might get gold just for playing a card. Maybe you'll get gold for playing the same card many times, or you'll get gold if you click an ore mine for so many seconds. Most of the economy cards are not as good as others, so you'll be playing this 'solitaire' minigame with the same subset of cards for the majority of your time.\n\nThe second problem is that your military units are almost all functionally the same. They're stat sticks with maybe an effect that heals the other rats, or slows down enemies, or roots an enemy in place. None of these things are very fun or interesting in practice because of the point I'm going to bring up.\n\nEnemies come in deathballs, and while sure it says they have an ability, all it really comes down to when they crash into your wall is if you have a certain amount of stats split on your military units defending. If you do, you'll crush the wave in about 10 seconds. If you don't, the wave which is probably about 20 units doing the same attack animation right on top of each other, is barreling down to your center and you've lost. There is no way to really interact with your enemies other than through your stat sticks, and there's no reason to learn what each enemy does because it absolutely does not matter. In fact, you shouldn't really be paying attention at all to the fights, as it's more efficient to simply be playing the solitaire economy minigame at all times.\n\nYou can play as different leaders, but they don't really change any of the problems I have. The trader can make more gold. The general can buff military units. The shaman can remind you that you would be having more fun playing Transformice than Ratropolis.

You can spam literally 50+ of these and they will do nothing in the end game as they die in 1-2 hits, enemies in late game have aoe, and a drastic ranged/dmg/hp pool advantage.\n\nThe mid game is well balanced but, early game you can lose to no fault of your own and without a chance to survive based on whether or not the game decides to spawn acid spitters (these go over your defences and 1 shot your ranged units). Or hopping rats that jump over your walls and just decimate your back line.\n\nMany of the leader units active abilities are very lacklustre, the shaman has the best mechanic of the bunch but relies way too heavily on shaman specific cards that you see very rarely due to large card pools.\n\nLastly the final wave is ridiculous as you can have TONS of units and they just walk right through them killing everything, effectively destroying your walls in under 2 seconds and just strolling to your base and ending it.\n\nIf these balance issues can be sorted out to be a bit more fair, (RNG in a card game is expected but, it shouldn't determine everything) I would gladly change this to a recommended review as the core concept of the game is interesting and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1577567209, "timestamp_updated": 1577567209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533181071281433105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60701763": {"recommendationid": "60701763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209146004", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2144, "last_played": 1680550077}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm addicted ! this game is so much fun, I can't wait to see how the devs are gonna polish this gem.", "timestamp_created": 1577481650, "timestamp_updated": 1577604583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60689214": {"recommendationid": "60689214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003545011", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 150, "last_played": 1577468147}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun and has an amazing premise. However, I feel like I have to dissuade people from buying it for now until it gets more time and attention. \n\nThe Good\n- The concept is rock solid. Real time rogue-lite card battler mechanics is something that I haven't seen done before. They have a really good foundation here for something great.\n- The frantic chaos on later waves is really fun. Using that surplus money to redraw multiple times to pump out cards and effects  is a great feeling that I enjoy.\n\nThe Bad\n- Balancing. Your basic military units are simply not enough to get past wave 10. While this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, there is a lot of RNG to be able to find the cards that you need to simply survive. There are only one or two strategies that seem to get me to wave 30, and even then, getting past that wave is like hitting a brick wall, no matter what.\n- Unlocking new cards just dilutes the pool of available cards, making it harder to achieve victories because all cards aren't properly balanced to bring a good win.\n- UI Clunkiness. There are some things that could be addressed that would improve the UX a lot.\n    - Can't deploy troops on main building if inner wall has collapsed on one side. \n    - Can't send troops to a broken down wall to beat back the enemies.\n    - Can't look at your entire deck of cards without looking at discard + draw pile. \n    - Can't look at your cards when choosing a new card.\n- Supports a very small number of resolutions despite being built in Unity. Only goes up to 1080p and not 1440p. Definitely would like to see support for ultrawide resolutions (3440x1440)\n\nThe Verdict\nUsually with games like this, I would refund it solely on the fact that it doesn't support 1440p and needs a lot of UI / UX polish. However, I think the goods outweighs the bads here, and that since most of my issues come from things that can be changed without reworking the core of the game, I think it has a bright future ahead of itself.\n\nI will gladly update my review as the game gets updates to see if these things are addressed.", "timestamp_created": 1577470097, "timestamp_updated": 1577470148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54877394437789917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60689080": {"recommendationid": "60689080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141730175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1745, "last_played": 1632246106}, "language": "english", "review": "I adore this game.

If you want to win, there's really only one or two viable strategies you can run, each relying heavily on RNG to give you the cards you need. And your reward for lasting longer once those cards are given to you? Naturally, it's unlocking more cards and making the select few good ones even harder to find.\nA variety of small problems, which on their own are harmless, but when added together just amount to a devastating feeling of dissatisfaction after every loss (and often wins too) is the lack of an ability to move individual units should a wall need reinforcements which can have crippling effects, and being unable to send any units to destroyed walls. This effectively means as soon as any one inner-wall is breached, its game over regardless of your troop count or hand because you can't get move them to the fight or spawn troops at the main building.What's the point of making the enemies spend time attacking buildings within those walls if delaying them has literally no positive effect except elongating the feeling of helplessness with each loss?   \nAnd should you try to use building abilities during any point of this chaos, you'll find yourself scrolling back and forth over the playing field to find what your looking for. Honestly, with this mechanic, it seems the game tried to instill a necessity for skillful multitasking but its delivery is nothing short of an annoying tedium because the multitasking is exactly that: a task. A simple bar somewhere on the screen with all active abilities listed that could be clicked would be a simple solution, but seeing as it would undermine the chaotic focus of the game, I doubt it'd be implemented.\nOf course, you can try to organize the buildings to make it easier to find what you're looking for, but don't expect to get very far. You often aren't in control of what buildings cards you get and when you can play them, and if you delay placement for some hope of order, you'll often find that such a simple plan ends the game for you. \nAdding to the calamity is how easily certain enemies can wipe out your units. Don't have enough militia early game but have a lot of guards? Well, watch as with a single jump over your wall that entire reserve of ranged units is wiped out by a monster. And if you do have enough melee troops? Sit back and enjoy the later game monsters pulverize them all with their AoE.\n\nThe game's concept started strong when I first started playing. Having to divert focus a million different ways nonstop was at first pleasant test of one's capabilities, but after playing for a while you'll find yourself feeling as though you did everything right and still came up short. And when you do finally figure out the magic combination of cards needed to last, you'll find that its the ONLY combination of cards that really works. Overall, this when combined with the many small nuisances found in some of the game mechanics makes the game frustrating to lose and boring to win.

get 3 times unlucky with the rng and loose at wave 20 and you feel like you wasted 2 h for nothing you didnt learn anything new you didnt archive anything new in these 2 hours just becouse of some bad

game is hard, after about 10 hours i started beating the normal mode of the game every other game(wave 30), however, 40 hours in and i havent beat round 60 which is the first achievement of hard mode, the thing is, even tho the game has a lot of replayability the power level of cards is a bit off (not as wild as other reviews describe it)\nthe strong cards are rather consistent on power-level/cost/rarety ratio however because of the wide variety of the cards and effects, there are a lot of neat strategies that currently i dont think can see much play.\n\n(WARNING***: if you havent played the game and want to explore it yourself dont read the strategies and the power levels i mention below)\n\n\n\n\n(note: this strategies are based on all cards being unlocked)\n\nweak strategies: super buff 1 unit (too inconsistent, hard to get, and slow combo,also hard to repopulate your gates in case of hard enemies), eco based on bounty (too weak imo, lacks cards), defensive buildings (too weak imo, inconsistent, not worth valuable land) , skill damage cards (i havent tested this option enough but it seems weak), labor card eco (needs specific advisors and falls off late game,also requires many ratizens early on)\n\nstrong strategies: 'spam rorolls for eco when game start while it cost 20 (very basic and important strat)' ,'tax based eco (very consistent in late game, however weak early)', 'military spam deck/take almost all military cards (consistent, easy to repopulate walls,easy to play, bad side of strat: hard to repopulate walls late game, falls off late game, hard to get enough eco early game)', 'military based on strong military cards: medic, bannerrat,shieldrat,crossbow , and defender, + some range units (strong late, game consistent in late game, however takes time to build and inconsistent early-midgame)', 'utility building use + the visit skill card: having the delete a card, upgrade a card, duplicate a card and market to control your deck perfectly (damn this is strong, however hard to build)' ,there are also a few valid card based ecos but they have wide variety of ways to play.\n\ntop cards: house, raise tax, medic, bannerrat (overpowered), market, collect tax, walls (obviously), castle (overpowered), tax building, factory, library, smithy and steal (also some other skills cards i forgot).\n(p.s. also power levels of heroes are a bit of an issue, military and builder guys are far stronger than the other two)\n***\n\n\nthe game replayability is extremely good due to the wide spectrum of cards, advisers, starts, enemies ,the 4 classes, and events. the game itself is thrilling every time you start again because of the well balanced rng system of the game (power level of events, good rarity/power ratio of cards) and the great phasing of it as well (perfect timing of merchants, waves, and events), each game is a new story even if you go for the same build.\n\nthe artwork is amazing, cute, and very appealing. its a refreshing style that can fit any age of the audience. the sound effects and music are nice and well fit to the theme of the game.\n\nif i had any suggestions for additional content for the game it would be to add deeper lore and daily quests.\n\nafter purchasing the game i found it simply fun to learn and explore the game, to get used to its phasing , i would play a few runs in a row because i was excited to unlock new cards, after  a while the game fun factor starts to come from the challenge, and from achieving op combos ,however ,playing a few games in a row is now less fun because the runs are longer (finally im giting gud) and starting from 0 can be exhausting after a good run.\n\ni would recommend this game to almost every type of gamer who is into strategy based game (the game can also require high apm at times) \n\n\n\nTL;DR: \nYeah boiiiiiiiiiiiiii", "timestamp_created": 1575074736, "timestamp_updated": 1575512293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8,

While the economy cards work well and give you some build variety, the military buildings and skill cards aare almost all not worth getting. while the units are almost all dependant on the barracks, it doesnt really matter what kind of setup you use. it feels like you really need barracks to get anywhere with your military, and when you have barracks, it doesnt matter which unit you use.\nin short, i think there should be more wincondition cards, more synergies, and less bad cards, that really dont do anything or at least not enough.\n\nthe game overall is still great, but these issues are prevelant and take replay value away from the game.", "timestamp_created": 1575050540, "timestamp_updated": 1575050540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58601750": {"recommendationid": "58601750", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962249233", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1572790575}, "language": "english", "review": "not for me", "timestamp_created": 1575048844, "timestamp_updated": 1575048844, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58567558": {"recommendationid": "58567558", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987356063", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2499, "last_played": 1631384381}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game!\nCannot wait for new leaders and endless mode!", "timestamp_created": 1575034729, "timestamp_updated": 1575034729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58528441": {"recommendationid": "58528441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326162832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1662341824}, "language": "english", "review": "God fucking amazin", "timestamp_created": 1575009856, "timestamp_updated": 1575009856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58499252": {"recommendationid": "58499252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044002249", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1559, "last_played": 1698170487}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will get you feel hate, rage, frustration, despair and utter defeat at beginning.

It's a real-time strategy card defense game by Cassel Games. This indie development team called Caseel Games is consist of the college students. Although it is not known when full-scale development began. But through the online crowdfunding, the goal seems to have already been achieved. If you are interested in this game, you can try the demo version on itch.\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nThis game combines a defense game and a TCG. When compared to other games available on Steam, Ratropolis is a blended genre game of Slay the Spire and Overdungeon. At first glance, its game experince is so good that it's hard to believe that college students really made it. They look like developers who have already made enough games.\n\nThe game concept itself is interesting. The rat heroes against the predators. The artworks are nice, and the SD characters and card designs are neat. The soundtrack is particularly magnificent, but the voice effects are very comical. In addition, the game content is well organized, including rat heroes, unlockable cards, collectable artifacts, and global leaderboard.\n\n[h1][b][3] Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b][/h1]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Cute Voice\n[*][+] High Potential\n[*][+] Leaderboard System\n[*][+] Addictive & Strategic\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Somewhat Difficult\n[*][-] Tricky Mouse Controls\n[*][-] Display Resolution Issue\n[*][-] Overlapping Card Effects\n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b][4] Verdict : [/b][/h1]\nRatropolis. This is a hidden gem game. Its gameplay reminds us of familiar genres, but the real game experience is fresh. Of course, since it is still early access, the level design and balance may be somewhat lacking. Nevertheless, the potential is quite high. We hope that this development team will be able to accept the feedback from our users and make their roadmap truly real.

There is a bit of RNG to the game which can make it a bit annoying, sometimes you lose pretty early just because you didnt get the cards you needed.\n\nI find the leaders fairly interesting and different but frankly some of them just seem reallllllly weak, like the builder since buildings can only be upgraded to level 2 his ability needs a lot of work for very little reward. Plus most of the abilities they have are very RNG reliant and you can use it and discard/replace cards and get hot garbage as your reward.\n\nThe military leader seems to have the strongest ability by far, both passive and his on use ability, it seems to be the least RNG reliant and just overall better than the others.

I am a huge fan of slay the spire and many other deck building games, and Kingdoms was okay for me, though I thought it may have been a little slow. This game really does a great job of combining the better aspects of both games. However, as much as I do love this game it does have some issues and some things it can improve upon. For starters this game's biggest issue is its balancing and scaling. This game brings a unique opportunity to bring your cards to life but the enemies just scale up way too quickly, and abruptly. I can name 4 distinct spots where the game has a major spike in difficulty, that being waves 13, 15, 26, and 30. These waves will, 9 out of 10 times, be your downfall. One this Wanderbots repeats in his lets-play of this series is that this should be an endless wave game that gradually scales, and I completely agree with this. That is the only major issue I have with this game, but I do hope that it adds more leaders, cards, and maybe even mod compatibility in the future. \n\nPlease don't let my major criticism deter you from at least giving this game a try. This game is lovely and you can progress through it even if you aren't able to beat all 30 waves, which isn't impossible I have done it. This is an issue which can be fixed later in development, so much so that it may even be a non-issue by the time this game is fully released. It is, to my knowledge and experience, a unique game that builds on its best aspects very well and I do recommend giving it a try, especially since its only $15. There is a lot of potential for this game and many core aspects that it does well that it can build off of. Do however take the initial gameplay with a grain of salt as it is an early access game.

Good rogue likes are difficult but possible to beat 60-80% of the time if you understand how the game works. This game requires you to get lucky and find certain cards that allow you to make it past even the middle 10 waves. The game scales wildly every 10 stages ramping up the difficulty several times over. Some of the best cards in the game require you to unlock them by playing every character through several runs. Unlockables in roguelikes should open up new play styles, not just straight up give you more power.\n\nOther than having all the right cards drop for you or appear in the shop the only other bit of skill comes in the form of an APM check and your ability to guess what's happening on one side of your settlement while looking elsewhere. You can zoom all the way out and see everything but the icons don't get any bigger on buildings with active abilities so they're near impossible to click on. Could do with some extra keybinds for active abilities like the aid station and some QoL changes to make doing what you want easier. I know what I need to do, it's just a pain in the ass to do it which makes it less fun.\n\nCard upgrades making the cards more expensive is needlessly confusing on the part of economy cards. If the price goes up 10 and the gold gain goes up 20, why not just keep the price the same and only make the gold gain go up by 10? It makes it just that much more difficult to comeback if you fall behind even a little bit. If you lose one wall ever you are fucked and might as well give up the run so long as you're past wave 10 already. You'll know if you're going to go far in the run or not after the first 5 or 6 waves. If you aren't though you can't just abandon the run because there's an event that requires you to make it past wave 10 on the previous run. If you didn't the event does nothing which means you're missing out on the possible benefits from a different event.\n\nThe game draws you in with a visual style similar to Kingdom and the Roguelike Deckbuilding genere of Slay the Spire but it doesn't deliver any of the feelings those games do.\n\nI'd be willing to check it out again in the future to see if things have improved at all but for now I'm just not enjoying the game.", "timestamp_created": 1573617483, "timestamp_updated": 1573617483, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57075128": {"recommendationid": "57075128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072766255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1576460082}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is engaging and fun!

If you truly love Slay the Spire, a mechanic that requires you to rapidly mash buttons is probably going to be anathema. And the deckbuilding itself is only ok --for example, I felt you always had to make this binary choice as to whether you are going to use cheese as your economic engine, or strip it out of your deck and try to make money with killing or mining or being a slum lord. And leaving that last cheese for the discard every time feels kind of clunky.\n\n I also hate games where you have to scroll to the other side of the battlefield to see that all your defenses are getting destroyed.

I've read the other reviews and think the well thought out ones speak to the pros and cons of this game, so I don't feel the need to repeat what others have said. What I would like to add however is that the game is currently not very fun because of how useless almost every card is. I am almost considering resetting my game before the unlocks so that I don't have to deal with all the absolutely terrible cards clogging up the merchant. There is no way to build synergies unless you get incredibly lucky, so 'winning' just requires playing over and over and over and over until you get everything to line up just right. Until something is done to improve the game, I cannot recommend it.\n\n[h1]Constructive thoughts[/h1]\nI believe a few things need to be done to help the game:\n\n[b]1) Completely change how military is handled.[/b]\nRight now you place military cards down on little outposts and allow them to defend you until they die. You can keep placing cards until you're out of rat population, so you're limited on card draw, owning units, and rat population. All of that is fine. What isn't fine is that your military is never strong enough to handle anything in the later stages unless you're lucky enough to have gotten the building that constantly improves a unit or a large amount of the few useful skill cards (and both cases are fairly rare).  \n\n[b]Proposed Change:[/b]\nMake military respawn after death and make every wall use an independent housing cap. This makes it so you have a reason to populate the inner walls with military, and it also makes it so you don't just instantly lose to the end stages and can potentially come back if your strong outer wall is breached. It gives the game more strategic value.\n\nSecondly, a way to buff currently placed military is needed. I really enjoy the idea of continuously buffing a few cards on the super rare chance that I have gotten the building to do so, but by the time you are able to play even a couple of them, there are too few of them to make a difference against the insanely strong enemies. If already placed units could gain permanent buffs with cards, you can have real scaling that attempts to keep pace with the enemy scaling.\n\n[b]2) Remove, change, or buff all the cards that are useless.[/b]\nMost of the skill cards are terrible. The damaging cards are amazing mid game, but (like pretty much everything), they are absolutely worthless late game. They badly need some sort of scaling to keep up with the late game. Don't get me wrong on this section however, as some of the best cards in the game are actually skill cards (like research, forge, and I'm forgetting what other one). But the skill cards also have some of the worst in the game.\n\nEconomy cards are mostly pretty solid. There are a few different econ routes you can take, and I like that part being totally random. Some games a cheese route is good just because you were offered cheeses and methods of slimming your cards down or drawing a lot. Other games it's better to have a huge rat population and use delayed money cards. Still others you tax your population into submission. \n\nThe building cards are also fairly solid, but some changes should be made here as well. Buildings are the only thing that \"scale\" into the end game by the fact that you can just keep building more of them, and most of their abilities are useful to have more of. The only issue is that the amount of cards in the game and the few times you're offered cards means you don't usually get many buildings unless you're the builder. I don't think you should be reaching builder levels of building offers, but something needs to be done to make this be the main stable aspect of the set.\n\n[b]3) Card offers need to be increased.[/b]\nRight now there are too many cards, and most of them don't help you. I believe the chests should offer the same thing they do now, but they should also always give you 3 cards to choose from. Yes, this means you can choose the 3 cards option and get two sets of 3 cards to choose from. As of now, it is not possible to build synergies unless you're lucky, which strips away the little strategy this game could have.\n\n[b]End Thoughts.[/b]\nI write all of this not in disappointment at the game. That would be a waste of time. I believe this game has great potential. It just needs a lot of polishing to reach that potential. I also don't think my suggestions are the end all be all fixes (or even necessarily the root problems of the game). There are many options that could make the game shine. I just hope something is done that gives the player more strategic options rather than making very few actual choices and relying on luck.", "timestamp_created": 1573019975, "timestamp_updated": 1573019975, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696748793125152588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56604990": {"recommendationid": "56604990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007511644", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 2411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1672771864}, "language": "english", "review": "1/14/21 UPDATE\n\nI love this DAMNED GAME!

I'd want you guys to know that you've developed a promising blueprint and your game is worth further contributing, yet I've noticed some flaws in your design and would appreciate it if you can improve them.\n\n[h1] Information Delivering [/h1]\n1. [b] UI improving [/b]\nWhen players have the mouse on the icons of active buildings, highlight them (whether to [i] switch to a bigger icon [/i] or [i] add a glowing contour [/i] or something) to give in-time feedback. This also applies to the chests / quests / traders or something like that.\n2. [b] Advisers showing [/b]\nWhen a specific Adviser (V, for example) appears as the outcome of the event, show the effect of that Adviser (as you've already done with cards).\n3. [b] Time presenting [/b]\nFor now, players have to scroll the trader out of their screens to know how long he will stay. You may consider presenting that with a constant time gauge. This also applies to chests or some.\n\n[h1] Initiative Guaranteeing [/h1]\nIn Slay the Spire, when players want to improve their decks, they can (based on their gold & state) CHOOSE a way (elite or trader or campfire or event) that MOST LIKELY helps achieve their goals.\nWhile in Ratropolis, getting / upgrading / deleting some cards all RELY ON RNG (whether from a chest or, most of the cases, from the trader). That is, for example, if a player wants to upgrade some useful card, he/she can only pray that the trader offers a smith or the gold chest offers one upgrading; and if things don't go well, he/she will NEVER get enough chance to upgrade cards.\nSo my point is, you may consider offering a more stable way to improve the deck (and the trader system is of great significance).\nFor example, the player can pay the trader some money and choose several cards as the goal of trading, and the next time the trader comes, there's a bigger chance that he appears with those chosen cards for sale.\nI'd really appreciate your improving on this.\n\n[h1] Balancing [/h1]\n1. [b] Among Leaders [/b]\nIt might have already been pointed out that the Merchant and the Scientist appear useless compared to the Builder and the General. You might need to redesign some of their perks and skills (and consider associating perks with Leader's level).\nHere is my suggestion, just for your reference:\nthe Merchant (designed to be friendly to new players)\npassive: discount on buying cards (and setting goals of trading, if you adopt my suggestion above)\nactive: summon a trader instantly\n2. [b] Among Cards [/b]\nI appreciating your separating cards for early / middle / later stage, but most of them are useless most of the time. For example, Attack may help players through early-middle stages, while stacking military cards can do the same, but you may want to delete Attack ASAP when you moved to the later stage.\nSame story with the military cards. Personally I want a Guardian that stands still with rangers instead of fighting on the outside of the Defense Wall.\n\n[h1] Further Developing [/h1] (when you've achieved enough sales)\n1. [b] Enriching [/b]\nMore Enemies\nMore Cards (featuring different play styles and more paths to win the game)\nMore Modes (Endless Mode / Daily Challenge etc.)\nMy little suggestion:\nThe dying of single-use units can be really frustrating. Have you guys ever considered adding Hero Cards into this game? The card will be removed (temporarily) from the deck once used, but will appear again (possibly at some cost) when the unit dies.\n2. [b] Polishing [/b]\nImproving the animation of units and enemies.\nImproving the text.

Lets get to an actual review though, shall we?\n\nGameplay:\n Exactly what it says in the description, think Kingdom New Age but with cards, a lot easier to manage in my opinion while still being fast paced once the game gets going, deciding whether to add cards, remove them, what cards to take, etc. Managing economy and your military all while watching that ever dwindling supply of gold and ratizens (peasants/workers) slowly dip down if you aren't careful. I've beaten the game a few times now, first win was with builder, my second favorite leader, with my favorite being the Merchant. You can brute force if you get the right military units, but it isn't as effective later, if you don't build with a plan.\n\nContent: \nCurrently there's 5 Leaders each with their own passives and actives. Later to be 6, according to borders in game. Merchant, General, Builder, and Scientist, and Shaman each showing their own take on balancing the previously mentioned resources, and each with 3 'packs' of cards to unlock as you play. Adding the cards to the deck of all of the leaders.\n\nWrapping up: \nIt's early access, yes, but so far.. if you like card based games, games like kingdom, or like managing a base you're building up, I'd heavily recommend this to be honest, or try the demo if you're on the fence. It's a game about experimenting and finding ways around the rng of what cards you get, even with 'bad cards' if you think things out you can usually make something of it. Anyway, I hope this is a decent enough view of what I see, thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy the game.\n\nShaman addition edit: \nThey just added Shaman, which.. needs some work, but that goes into how they've been working quite quickly to balance things as quickly as possible. From the leader's abilities, to other cards. They've been doing it quickly, so I'm sure this'll be balanced soon too. All in all, I'm still very much in favor of this.", "timestamp_created": 1572603830, "timestamp_updated": 1576999168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804753661155700684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56120020": {"recommendationid": "56120020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288124829", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 91, "last_played": 1619054250}, "language": "english", "review": "RATROPOLIS, MAKING STEAM GREAT AGAIN!", "timestamp_created": 1572601530, "timestamp_updated": 1572601530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459556102752685547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56118509": {"recommendationid": "56118509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988878041", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1611114036}, "language": "english", "review": "This game f u c k s.", "timestamp_created": 1572600514, "timestamp_updated": 1572600603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.338960140943527222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56116065": {"recommendationid": "56116065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275116141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1613359752}, "language": "english", "review": "At the time of this review I'm ranked 17 in the world.

Devs? \n  perhaps rename to Mousetropolis?\n\n- If you like deck building card/board games then you will most likely enjoy this game\n- difficulty ramps up hard but not too ridiculously (again, you need to lose to get stronger and \n   survive longer)\n\n- I'm ranked in the top 20 in the world.
