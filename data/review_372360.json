I didn't experience any game-breaking performance issues aside from having to manually set the game up to work with a controller during initial setup personally. That aside, people keep forgetting this game was originally made for consoles. While capping the FPS at 30 has clearly pissed off a lot of people, it was easy for me to see why. With consoles, things are fixed. It's a lot more varied with all the different kinds of PCs and video cards there are out there. The 30 FPS cap was likely for stability reasons but performance wise, I've seen no difference from the Gamecube version which I've owned since 2007.\n\nMoving on. If you never played a \"Tales of\" game before, this is a good intro to the series. It was the first 3D \"Tales of\" game and though it lacks a lot of the polish Tales of Vesperia has in terms of features and mechanics, its deep and engrossing story is why it's one of the top 5 games in the series overall (It's in my top 3 personally). Back in the day, Tales of Symphonia is why many JRPG fans owned a Gamecube. Its storytelling, world building and character development go a long way in making up for the game's biggest flaw which is also why each playthrough has minimum 45 to 60 hours: The Dungeon areas. \n\nSymphonia's biggest issue is how the development team decided to extend the game's playtime: Putting time-consuming elaborate puzzles for you to figure out in order to proceed as possible. The Balacruf Mausoleum (Sylvarant),  Meltokio Sewers (Tethe'alla), the Palmacosta Human Ranch (Sylvarant), the Asgard Human Ranch (Sylvarant), the Temple of Ice (Tethe'alla), both Renegade Bases, the Temple of Lightning (Tethe'alla), Derris Kharlan (both visits), The Toize Valley Mine (Tethe'alla), Latheon Gorge (Tethe'alla), The Temple of Darkness (Tethe'alla) and Ymir Forest (Tethe'alla) all take a few hours to get through due to the mechanics. Thankfully, after you pass through Ymir Forest for the first time you can skip going through it again when traveling to/from Heimdall.\n\nThe three biggest offenders of those listed are Ymir Forest, the Meltokio Sewers and the Tethe'alla Rengade Base. The Temple of Darkness and the Temple of Lightning get (dis)honorable mentions though. They make every New Game+ painful. Why would you play through the game multiple times? Well there 8 possible endings, each involving one of the 8 possible party members. \n\nOne party member will permanently leave your party depending on if you see a certain ally's scene in Flanoir. Anyone who's played a console version before knows which two party members I'm referring to. If you meet that certain ally in Flanoir, the next boss battle you have will be against the ex-party member. In exchange, the ally permanently joins your party for the rest of the game. \n\nI mentioned this earlier but there is a New Game+ which has become a series staple for almost 20 years now. You can use the Grade Shop when loading Clear Data to carry over certain things from your previous playthrough from items to money to Artes (called Techs in Symphonia) to XP Boosts among other things. Grade is earned at the end of battle though a multiplier is applied on higher difficulties. Grade spent before each NG+ is refunded back to you for the next so after a few playthroughs, eventually you will be able to get everything you want. A few Grade Shop items are exclusive to each other such as XP Boosts and Half EXP for example. \n\nWould be nice if they added a Dungeon Puzzle Skip Perk to the Grade Shop. Honestly I'm annoyed Namco Bandai never thought to add this to ANY of the re-releases. More so given you can skip certain puzzles in most of the games released after Symphonia after you fail a few times. Oh, well.\n\nAll that said and in closing. Would I recommend this game? Hell yes absolutely. Would I recommend this on Steam? If you don't have a console version already, definitely.

game as well as gameplay. \n\nTechnical: First of all, I do not recommend this game on PC. However, despite it's many reported issues on PC, many of which I've experienced myself, this game runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck. For me, the game was practically unplayable on PC. It would crash to a black screen upon opening the game and trying to play the intro video. Maybe 1 in 10 times I could get to the main menu, but would experience crashes any time I tried to change settings. \n\nOn Steam Deck this was an entirely different experience. Right out the gate it worked flawlessly. Smooth 30fps (locked, even on PC), resolution can be changed without crashing, and videos have no issue playing and don't crash the game. I had been looking for a reason to use my Steam Deck more often. A game that runs so poorly on even the strongest PC's was actually perfect for what I wanted. So I play this exclusivel on the Deck. \n\nGameplay: Although I'm not new to the Tales series, this was a title that I missed growing up. So I'm glad to get to experience it with fresh visuals, but I can't speak to the differences between this port and the original release.\n\nHands down, the game is fun. I can see where this laid the foundation for following 3d Tales games in the series. Combat is responsive, although it can be a bit repetitive. This is however alleviated by a fairly robust roster of enemy types. \n\nExploration is the most tedious part, and isn't much rewarding beyond unlocking the ability to ride your mount in specific areas of the map, each of which must be unlocked individually. Early in the game, exploring the map to reach your next destination could turn off some players to the game. \n\nSlogging through the tedious exploration is rewarded with great story segments, character to character dialogues and monologues, and unique, often element specific instances to explore. The story is similar in ways to Tales of Arise, and that's a compliment. It's well story-driven.\n\nTL;DR: Get this game if you intend to play it SOLELY on the Steam Deck.

However, after being reintroduced to JRPGs via Pokemon and Paper Mario I started seeking out more JRPGs to play. To my utter disappointment I came to find out there was basically nothing on the N64 and Gamecube and I didn't own any Sony systems. So as any enterprising young adult on the internet is want to do, I turned to emulation. I started diving head first into the SNES library and came across this fan translated game that looked \"So cool!' - Tales of Phantasia. \n\nI remember playing Phantasia from dawn till dusk for days on end until I beat it. I started looking up things about it and realized it was part of a series of games. I was unfortunately disappointed as i realized I was without many options. Most of them were on the PS1 and my computer couldnt' handle emulating that at the time. Then I found out a game had just recently come on the Gamecube called Tales of Symphonia and it was a prequel to Phantasia that I loved?! The starts aligned just for me. \n\nI begged my dad to take me to the local Best Buy so I could pick up the game - and I did. I immediately fell in love. Tales of Symphonia was to the Tales franchise that Final Fantasy VII was to it's respective series - it put the series on the map outside of Japan. While Symphonia has aged poorly in some places there is no denying that it is by far the most important Tales game in the franchise - again, just like FFVII. \n\nAlso, for those on the fence about this version, you are far less likely to run into any issues playing this port than you are to run into any. Don't be fooled by the volume of people complaining about this game. The amount of people having issues are a vast minority compared to those who have no issues. It's hard to see that taking a quick glance at the reviews or the community forum because it is far more likely for people to review/discuss their complaints than there are for those to discuss having no issues withe the game. \n\nDo yourself a favor and give this game a try. There are better Tales games out there nowadays, but by no means is Symphonia worse for their existence. It is a vital part of the franchise, a game that had it not been the critical success that it was, may have doomed the franchise into complete obscurity or perhaps even it's existence.", "timestamp_created": 1689672602, "timestamp_updated": 1689672602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565474271774291992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142301776": {"recommendationid": "142301776", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005789890", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 372, "last_played": 1690483540}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es entretenido y la historia vale la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1689642370, "timestamp_updated": 1689642370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142276667": {"recommendationid": "142276667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283688765", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4067, "last_played": 1689611166}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cine", "timestamp_created": 1689611755, "timestamp_updated": 1689611755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142112083": {"recommendationid": "142112083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158516892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2449, "last_played": 1689400072}, "language": "english", "review": "Please, please, PLEASE make sure you download the TSFix located in the guides section if you buy this game. My recommendation would likely slip into a \"maybe\" category without it. Shout out to the awesome mod developer who worked hard to fix Bamco's lazy port of this game. With that said:\n\nAh, Tales of Symphonia. In my opinion it's one of the \"Golden Era\" Tales games. Nostalgia certainly played a role in deciding to replay this game in more than 10 years, but there is more to this game than that. That being said, age certainly is this game's greatest enemy and is a good place to start in helping others decide if they want to invest the 40+ hours to complete:\n\nCons:\n\n-Port is awful. Don't need to spend too much time on this one. Get the TSFix and this becomes irrelevant. \n\n-Character animations are super rigid. I'd find myself laughing at dramatic moments when I knew I shouldn't be because most character animations just look so unnatural. \n\n-Sound design is very inconsistent. A crackling fire might sound more like a wagon with a misshaped wheel, or walking through grass more like a crumpling bag. Even a lot of voiced lines (reference English Dub) feel like they could've used a few more takes.\n\n-Battle system doesn't feel anywhere near as robust as modern Tales games. It's much more guard intensive with a slower pace and shorter combos with a longer time frame to get genuinely interesting. \n\n-TOO MUCH BACKTRACKING. Whether it's in the overworld, in dungeons, or even in towns on sidequests, you're going to backtracking a bunch with only a few opportunities to quick jump (no fast travel). This is literally the biggest replay killer for this game in my opinion and I see why it took 10+ years for me to replay this game. Some dungeons get flat-out tedious. \n\n\nSo why might you want to play this game even today?\n\nPros:\n\n-Strong cast of characters. This definitely comes down to preference but I've always liked Symphonia's cast. You have the typical hero from the early 2000's that, of course, dual wields, the tragic--yet air-headed--heroine, the MAGIC elf boy, big sis teacher (yes!), tsundere ninja (oh yes), pervert knight, handsome edgelord that's ALL business, and an adorable lil' lumberjack that looks 12 but is 28 in an attempt to piss off virtue-signaling Reddit users years before Reddit existed (yes...?). This game also has a fun feature where you can decide your \"partner\" (someone you get unique scenes with) depending on choices you make. The game ships Lloyd/Colette hard, but I went Lloyd/Sheena this time and I love it. Villains and side characters are a bit of a mixed bag, but there are plenty of good ones (including the main villain). \n\n-The story is solid. It might not win any awards, but it's like coming back to a Saturday-morning cartoon you used to enjoy. It's genuinely interesting, it's fun, and it doesn't go off the rails like some modern games (something that seems consistent with the \"golden era\" Tales games). The pacing isn't always on point, but I'd rather take a hiccup in pacing than feeling like the game gets tired of its own themes.\n\n-The battle system is fun. As mentioned above, it's not as good as modern Tales games, but it's still fun to set up your characters, choose your party, and play around with technique/combo setups. \n\n-Soundtrack is great. Though other elements of sound design have their issues regarding consistency, the soundtrack does not. \n\n-Aside from a strange sequence of about 6 dungeons that are very tedious (about 2/3 through the game) the  overall dungeon design is very good; maybe the best in the series (Abyss might be better: Less tedious, but slightly less creative). Most have great themes, puzzles, and boss fights. You really can't go wrong and I hope they bring this level of dungeon variety back to the series in the future. \n\n-Cel-shaded graphics have aged well. Symphonia has always stood out amongst Tales games due to this and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. Not everyone is a fan of the chubby lil' chibi character models, but the colors and shading help the world pop in ways that Zestiria, Beseria, and Arise failed to in my mind. Even Abyss (my personal favorite in the series) doesn't stand out quite like Symphonia. It's...really kind of special in that way...maybe the nostalgia is getting to me...haha. \n\nThis game sat in my Steam library for AGES and figured I'd never play it. When I finally installed it on a whim I almost gave up playing due the shoddy port and initial issues with the TSFix (if you tab out, or use another monitor you need to make sure to click back on the screen with Symphonia on it until the cursor disappears otherwise you might get awful lag like me). I'm glad I didn't give up. I genuinely enjoyed returning to this game, even with its flaws.

Now I am not by any means discounting how good of a game it could have been when it came out back in the early 2000s... but unless you are playing it for nostalgia value, I don't think someone can genuinely enjoy the mechanics and graphics of the game in 2023. If I had given this review in the early 2000s, I think it would look dramatically different.\n\nAdditionally, like earlier games, there is little to no directional guidance, which led me to unlock the seals backwards (in terms of difficulty). Now I am okay with this, but it is frustrating dying all the time to a higher level region, only to realize I was doing it backwards and cake-walking the earlier region. Call me spoiled by modern games, but I no longer have the patience to retry the same thing over and over when it is just about grinding a few more levels. Moving around across the map was quite annoying, and sometimes random mob combat is just unavoidable.\n\nThe one redeeming factor was that the story remained interesting with multiple twists. However, since I got really bored after 10+ hours or so, I did not beat the game. I did however Google up on the story, so I am familiar with how it goes. Although I do question some parts of the story, I can see why people liked the story.\n\nOverall, if you have any nostalgia attachment to the game, it will continue to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling playing it. But otherwise if you are like me, a random gamer playing this in 2023 who did not play it back in the days...

As a fan of RPGs, I can confidently say that Tales of Symphonia is a true masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the genre.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Tales of Symphonia is its deep and engaging storyline. Set in a world where two factions, Sylvarant and Tethe'alla, vie for control, the game delves into complex political struggles, religious conflicts, and the fate of the world itself. The narrative is richly woven, filled with plot twists, and supported by well-developed characters who undergo personal growth and transformation throughout the game. The emotional depth and thought-provoking themes explored in the story make it an unforgettable journey from start to finish.\n\nThe real-time combat system is where Tales of Symphonia truly shines. Combining fast-paced action with a strategic element, battles are fluid and exciting. The ability to control a single character in combat while the AI controls the others allows for dynamic teamwork and coordination. The \"Artes\" system, which enables characters to unleash powerful special attacks, adds a layer of strategy and customization. Furthermore, the multiplayer option allows friends to join in and experience the adventure together, enhancing the game's replay value.\n\nThe world of Tales of Symphonia is beautifully realized, with lush environments, diverse landscapes, and intricate dungeon designs. The hand-drawn art style has a timeless charm, and the character designs are both distinctive and memorable. The music, composed by Motoi Sakuraba, is a masterpiece in itself, perfectly capturing the emotions of each moment and immersing players in the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe game's length and depth are worth mentioning, as Tales of Symphonia offers countless hours of gameplay. Side quests, hidden areas, and optional content provide additional challenges and rewards, making it a game that encourages exploration and thorough exploration of its rich world.\n\nIt's important to note that the Steam version of Tales of Symphonia does suffer from a few technical issues, such as occasional frame rate drops and controller support hiccups. However, the overall experience remains largely unaffected, and with the help of community patches and mods, most of these issues can be addressed.\n\nTales of Symphonia is a timeless classic that has set the bar high for RPGs.

I have so many great memories playing this game on the GameCube and still load up my old save from time to time to see my progress. After buying other Tales games and playing through Vesperia and Arise (i'm not finished yet with Vesperia) I wanted to write a review after seeing some odd reviews from steam and some of the community. \n\nFirst off i'm not fluent or very knowledgeable on PC lingo or anything so you know. But this is a game made in 2003..its had remasters and hd remakes in the past as well so I understand if some fans have favorites ports. I also realize you can just steal it online which is fine if you don't wanna spend money on an old ass game. One thing i had seen the most is the contempt hate for how it looks \"Oh its so clunky\" or \"its gross to look at on my 7000 40 monitor\" or whatever. ITS FROM 2003 FOLKS please shut the fuck up. if you hate shitty graphics don't play it that's all. If graphics in a video game mean so dearly to you than the nostalgia or a good story with well written characters DO NOT PLAY IT. Second thing is the FPS. I will say it again because honesty these people need a good shower and need to touch grass but 30fps is playable when it comes to an older title. Please enlighten me on why 30fps is bad because I can't tell how it is honesty and I think you are just a bunch of piss babies that need to touch grass. as long as my frames don't die on me to the point where I can't see its playable. \n\nNow that that's out of the way let me tell you about this masterpiece of a game. Symphonia starts you out with 3 characters, 4 if you really want to jump the gun but let's start with the main 3. Genis Sage, genius kid with a smart mouth. Colette Brunel, timid girl with a huge heart but is also very clumsy. And then Lloyd Irving, cunning, brave, dumb as hell, but always ready to show everyone what he's got. These 3 are wonderful and full of life when you play the game and get to know them, and I can say that about the rest of the cast. Not one has a weak story line you can go through and watch to see how they grow and change  from being around Lloyd's intrepid heart. A classic story that was told back then remastered into a wonderful nostalgic trip to your childhood. I would definitely recommend this game if you want to sit down after work, school or just a long day to relax and play for a couple hours and enjoy the combat and story. I have 4 playthrough's including new game +. Is it clunky and kinda hard to get the hang of if it's your first game? yes, is the story long and repetitive? yes, and the combat as well? yes. But that's what makes it good. a classic 3d-ish style of an RPG that you can have fun with. watch a video about combos or some dungeon run to see if it is for you. And remember its an old title so these uptight gremlins with their high standards can stuff it. The game is not bad whatsoever. I have had 1 crash and that was because I tabbed in and out multiple times so it froze. No lag problems and a nice smooth controller scheme. But play on controller, it will feel so much better if you do that. If you want to comment feel free because i would love to talk about this game with others and if you want to criticize me feel free.", "timestamp_created": 1682602814, "timestamp_updated": 1682602814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493670880794525146", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137313884": {"recommendationid": "137313884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056701839", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2405, "last_played": 1682712247}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Quer\u00eda probarlo debido a las buenas cr\u00edticas que ha tenido siempre este juego.

I had so much energy in part 1 and the initial part of part 2 but by the time you hit the ending it's like... \"oh man ANOTHER dungeon?\" The combat is also really repetitive and a little clunky feeling compared to more streamlined games later on. You can play as characters besides Lloyd but then it begs the question \"Why would you\" when I gave it a try to see if I could earn some titles and unlock stuff. Unskippable cutscenes mean I don't think I would get anything out of new game+ and considering how much I loved the game as a kid, it saddens me a little to give it the thumbs down, but I just have different wants and needs from a game now than I did when I was 8. \n\nPros: \nNostalgic, decent story, enjoyable memorable characters, bright and colorful \n\nCons: \nrepetitive battle strategies, story drags near the end of the game, more convoluted than I remember it being, game drags itself on too long on some plot threads that are just not very exciting or fun tbh. \n\nI get why I liked

Why i can\u2019t recommend this game us because of the mechanics.There is barely a mapping system and it should not be so hard to navigate where to go to carry the storyline along.  Also, most games you get beaten by the boss and you can go level up enough to go back. Not this fane. I still haven\u2019t figured out how to string attacks\u2026very frustrating to play. When you run on the map, you can\u2019t see where you are going because the camera level us too high.  If theres a way to turn off auto-camera, i haven\u2019t found it.

This is my first play, while I'm catching up on RPG history I missed.\n\nGraphically, the character models, towns, and dungeons look good.  There are fixed camera angles, which are mostly used very well.  The stylized artwork makes the lower resolution of them still look good and timeless.  Overworld graphics are a different matter altogether, terrain looks really dated, and you have a very short draw distance, and finally poor camera angles in many places in the world.  I only had one graphical glitch, which only happened in a single room of a late game dungeon.  The terrain textures did not load or render correctly, mixing in a bunch of black lines over the terrain.  I don't know if this was a game bug, or if it was due to the Proton compatibility layer allowing it to run on Linux.\n\nThe sound and music are great and memorable.  Voice acting in English isn't used outside of a few major cutscenes and certain full motion videos.  Skits are not voiced, but stilled tied to the timing of the Japanese audio so you cannot speed them up or wait to read them/progress the dialogue at your own pace.\n\nControls on the overworld are clunky and not too great, you turn slow, you move slow, and the camera issues make it even harder.  Controls in town, dungeons, and combat are perfectly fine and work really well.  You occasionally get caught up on objects in dungeons, especially narrow passages at angles, but there were only a few places I ever got completely stuck.  Combat controls are excellent, feeling far better than some Tales games released a decade later!  Movement is a little slow (but can be sped up with Ex skills), but attacks, blocking, and all are very responsive with the risks you'd expect in an action RPG.\n\nThe characters are also quite memorable, there are no characters that I'd consider truly bad.  That said some aspects of a few characters, namely Zelos and Raine, are a bit uncomfortable to experience today.  [spoiler]Stop hitting your 12 year old littler brother Raine![/spoiler].  Each character has a good role to fill in the story and can be a workable party member for you.  Nobody aside from Raine seems to completely overshadow anyone else in a combat role.  As always with Tales games, the skits do a lot of character development and filling in what the main story glosses over.  They're really effective at making you like your companions.  There are also a number of special interactions that can be triggered on the overworld, these can be very valuable in controlling the hidden stat \"affection\", which determines the outcome of several events late game.\n\nThe story is solid, with the themes of discrimination, religious zealotry and scapegoating, conforming and rejecting the roles placed onto you by society covered heavy-handed but still well.  There are a lot of twists and turns, and changed expectations throughout the story which kept it interesting.\n\nThe main negative aspect is the dungeon design.  While it's nice to have puzzle dungeons in RPG's at times, there are a massive number of them (most of the dungeons), and it got very tiring toward the middle of the game.  In addition, encounters during puzzles are really annoying!  A few dungeons also have very confusing paths with many branches all looking the same.  A few times it was easy to miss what was intractable or that there was an exit in a place as it blended too much into the background.  I also had one game crash [spoiler]when starting Sheena's duel boss fight in one of her sidequests[/spoiler], but going through it again didn't crash so it may have just been a one time thing.  Since this is a 2003 game and still lives off classic game rules, there aren't autosaves so you'll need to manually save as much as possible.\n\nOverall, Tales of Symphonia lives up to its status as a classic, and even with the few negatives (dungeon design, poor overworld look and movement, some aspects of characters), it's well worth a play today and still feels good to play today.

Sadly, as well-known as this game is (sometimes, the only one people know from this franchise), it hasn't aged that well.

No ultra-complicated equipment or leveling systems, a basic synthesis system for weapons and equipment, a non-convoluted storyline, simple yet addictive combat, tons of hours of side-content (bosses, sidequests, costumes, bonus dungeons, New Game+), and you can also grab a friend or two to fight alongside you.\n\nNot a perfect game by any means, but a solid choice for any avid JRPG/Anime RPG fan that hasn't tried it out yet. \n\n*Fair warning though*: if you're the kind of completionist that wants EVERYTHING, be warned: this is the kind of game that requires not only extreme patience but also multiple playthroughs to be 100%. This is mostly because of story-related titles that are a once-per-playthrough choice between characters, and the easiest to miss content I've seen in video games (in one sidequest, the cutoff point is within the same screen it's triggered).

"playtime_at_review": 2436, "last_played": 1533132192}, "language": "english", "review": "A tale for the ages. \n\nStory:\n\nThe story follows on Lloyd. Your friend Colette has been chosen to set out on a journey to replenish the world of Sylvarant of it's mana and so you decide to help her out on the trip across the land, but you quickly find things are much more complicated as not only your world is danger, but another world too. \n\nThe story of Tales of Symphonia is basically the typical JRPG romp. You're a young noble adventurer/warrior who sets out to save the world and then things turn really complex with plenty of twists and turns and grand scale. That's not to say that's bad, cause the story here is genuinely captivating and I got really hooked to see it through to the very end, but as far as it stands, there's really not much to stand out here.  \n\nGraphics:\n\nWhile I really like the vibrant and colorful design of the characters and the world itself, the game has some issues with the visuals. So I'll begin with the positives, which of course I have to give it to the character designs, while they are incredibly anime, I genuinely loved each of the characters designs and they all really stood out from one another. The world too has plenty of interesting locales you visit, from your starting village in the middle of the forest and some crazy sci-fi bases later down the line.\n\nHowever the PC port looks rather muddled. I've played the vanilla as I wanted to experience the game in it's original form and I have to say that for those who really want the experience to look the best it can, you need to mods. Textures look really blurry, a lot of character models look rough around the edges, especially the NPC characters, there's definitely some notable aging in these areas. \n\nAudio:\n\nOne thing I cannot fault here is the voice acting which is absolutely phenomenal. Every single person on this cast is pretty notable voice actor and they all knock it out of the park, although I always hear Robin whenever Lloyd speaks, but even then I can't really fault it. so two thumbs up. The other sound design is also really good, especially the music. \n\nThe music is a great collection of simple music for exploration and action packed music when you're in combat. I generally really liked the combat music and especially the tracks that are used in boss fights as they really nail add to the epic atmosphere. Sound effects do sound a bit rougher, like they aren't properly remastered as they sound a bit muffled, like your weapon swings, but it's not that big of a problem. \n\nGameplay: \n\nI have to admit that as far as JRPG's go, my knowledge does not go beyond Persona. So when I first played Tales of Symphonia I was surprised by it. Now the basic gist is all here, exploring the world, getting into combat encounters, levelling up and getting better gear for you and your party, but the combat is what makes this special. \n\nOnce you land yourself into combat, you and your assembled team get into a brawl and the best way I can really describe it is that it's like a fighting game, but a lot slower where you really think about the combos and moves and of course magic spells. It's very simple on paper, but I have to admit that I had my ass handed to me quite a bit until I really got a hang of the combat and then I found the game to be a fair enough challenge. \n\nThe world exploration is pretty fun and I found the enemy encounters don't detract from the overall pacing as you're usually not getting into fights every second unlike some other RPG's where you can't move two steps without getting into a fight, which really makes the pacing of the game flow much better. Of course you will need to slow down and level up, but the combat is fun enough that I kind of wanted to get into combat, but when I felt like I was properly levelled I could just run away. \n\nEach so called \"dungeon\" of the game also has some light puzzles you have to solve to progress and there's of course other activities and side quests to take up if you really want to take a break from the main quest and break up the tedium of combat + story all the time. However the side quests are really uninteresting and just mostly unfun and I found myself ignoring most of them and the puzzles themselves are rather easy, but tedious due to the movement. \n\nThe biggest negative of the game I can only come up with is the difficulty spikes which are random. For the most part I think the game is pretty fairly challenged, it was neither a breeze, but I never found myself barely scraping by, but there are particular fights that come in once in a while that will really be really difficult, be it because of the really difficult moves of bosses etc. \n\nVerdict:\n\nTales of Symphonia is a great RPG and I can see why so many people love it and regard it so well. It's definitely aged a bit, but it's still standing tall even after all of this time, however the PC port doesn't do it many favors. For fans of the genre, this is definitely a must. \n\nFinal Rating:\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\n+ Story is grand in scale and is pretty engaging \n+ Combat is pretty fun \n+ Great voice acting\n+ The soundtrack is great, especially during the final section \n\nCons:\n- Side activities aren't interesting and mostly boring\n- PC port isn't the greatest \n- Graphics have started to show their age \n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews\n", "timestamp_created": 1675353464, "timestamp_updated": 1675353464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581977605819702148", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132041307": {"recommendationid": "132041307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887353972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6125, "last_played": 1676363754}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es lo mejor que me pas\u00f3 en la vida", "timestamp_created": 1675310270, "timestamp_updated": 1675310270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131890368": {"recommendationid": "131890368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014026893", "num_games_owned": 685, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1695335926}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was my childhood.

If you just want a good JRPG, honestly don't bother with this one.\n\nIt's not a BAD game. The UI, the voice acting, the story and the graphics are all 'OK'. One of the main characters is voiced by Matthew Mercer (he's in pretty much everything, of Critical Role fame). The plot, characters and story, while perfectly fine, are nothing special, pretty much what you'd expect from a JRPG. Some people would say clich\u00e9, though.\n\nThe one thing that put me off this game was the GOD AWFUL COMBAT. It's just absolutely terrible. There's barely any strategy to it, it's a button masher, you can only move backwards or forwards. Friendly AI is dumb: they'll run into enemies and stand there even if you set their behavior to ranged. \n\nThe main thing to do is run, get a few hits in, then back away. This is because basic enemies hit like trucks and will kill you or your party members with a few hits while they themselves are damage sponges and they don't have real patterns to their attacks. Sometimes they get staggered, but only god knows how or why. So you run in and hope you can do a combo before the enemy just does an attack and halves your HP.\n\nBut then doing combos is janky. Controls are not the most responsive and any hit by any enemy will interrupt you. Sometimes knock you away or stun you. Blocking only lowers damage taken. Enemies will sometimes block and immediately attack, sometimes they won't.  And this game LOVES to take away party members from you for one reason or another. So the best strategy is to just avoid enemies.\n\nHealing/sustaining is a chore. You can heal with items in or out of combat, or pay money at an inn. Items are not cheap, though. So you'll want to spend a lot on healing items, but the game doesn't give you a lot of gold. So get grinding.\n\nSave points are few and far between, they won't heal you either. So get ready to repeat a lot of dialogue and cinematics, because you'll die in a dumb, non-optional fight where you are outnumbered and the AI is stupid and there's not a lot you can do. You want better equipment? Well, get grinding, because it's not cheap either and most of your money should go into resting and healing items.\n\nOne example of this horrid system:\nThere's a low level enemy very early in the game. It's apparently almost immune to physical attacks (there's no way of knowing unless you Google it). So having any character go into melee with it is not gonna work. According to fans, the trick is to just control your mlee guy and have him do nothing but block the enemy attacks while the others are set on AUTO doing magical ranged attacks. If you try to melee this enemy in the meantime, you're just gonna die because like I said, enemies can just attack without interruption but they WILL interrupt you. So then the enemy will just casually walk up to the other NPCs and kill them one by one. Oh, and your NPCs will just run out of mana for their spells before killing this guy anyway, walk up to melee it and die. \"Oh, just avoid that enemy!\" What a FUN and smart battle system. \n\nYou can always just set everyone in your party to AUTO and hope they can finish the fight without dying or taking too much damage.\n\nHonestly everything in this game is ok, but the incredibly bad and boring combat mechanic just craps on it. There is no strategy involved, it's not engaging in any way, it's not fair or well-balanced. Sustaining your party is frustrating, getting gear/items/money is a chore and the controls are wonky.", "timestamp_created": 1672279347, "timestamp_updated": 1672336355, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412989228963851929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129522500": {"recommendationid": "129522500", "author": {"steamid": "76561199147729907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6072, "last_played": 1688342415}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es la primera vez que juego un tales y me gust\u00f3 mucho.\n\n - La historia muy linda, puede llegar a ser un poco aburrida al principio, pero va mejorando mucho mientras avanza el juego, los personajes son muy simp\u00e1ticos y te encari\u00f1as con ellos.

There is a ton of charm, great characters, and a LOT of thematic exploration between:\n- Bigotry and discrimination\n- Loss\n- Moral dilemmas\n- Trust and betrayal\n- Selfishness and selflessness\n- Family and friendship\n- History and mythology\n\nI can't say for sure Toby Fox experienced this game, since I just outright don't know, but I feel some story topics feel very similar to ones seen in Undertale. They're obviously not _unique_ plot points, but as a fan of both, I did notice them. \n\nMy favorite character is Genis. He feels kind of like this game's Tails, only a lot more snarky and sometimes mean-spirited. The focal characters of this game all have some level of growth and development over the game in a refreshing manner, the growth feels earned and the dialog skits really help to progress the interpersonal feelings. \n\nThis game feels as big as I imagine it was back in the day of its release. It has a lot of content to explore for a person seeking various monsters, characters, scenes, challenges and story.\n\nSo, for the few downsides I DO have:\n\nThe smaller sticking point because a single playthrough isn't going to be affected, but is meaningful to someone interested in the experience: I believe a full 100% completion takes 8 or even 9 playthroughs at minimum, which, even if you bulldoze through all the plot, seems like it could take an exceptionally long time.\n\nLikewise not a mandatory experience, but the red light green light is everyone's least favorite thing in the history of ever. Like, it's so bad it is basically a deciding point on if you're going to 100%, and if you don't know what you're doing you have to do it twice.\n\nFor the amount of farming you do need to do to 100%, some of the areas can get really boring.\n\nThe dialog in a couple places kind of beats you on the head or repeats itself a bit, but not cripplingly.\n\nThere are a couple typos even though the game has been out for something like 20 years, even though this definitely has modernizing touches to it.\n\nSometimes the cost to do moves other than your basic ones can be annoying enough that you don't feel like doing anything but hacking through multiple battles in the same area. \n\nOnly a couple characters are really playable as a main due to how things like casting and attack speed control.\n\nA couple of plot points seem hinted at, but never really... come to anything? \n\nOther than that, though, it's really a very fun and compelling game, and worth the price tag.

I played all the way through and didn't give two craps that it was a supposedly \"inferior version\", and I didn't notice a single thing that ruined the experience. Trust me, you won't notice the locked 30fps unless your precious eyes can't handle any fps under 60. A SMOOTH fps rate is far more important than a HIGH fps, and this game's got that. There are a few hiccups in the voice acting direction despite a knockout performance from the full cast for the most part, but that's not new. The only failings of this port are the failings of the original Symphonia; it is a product of its time and sometimes the gameplay can swing between overly simplistic (seriously, there's STILL no free run button?) and obtusely weird (why they didn't make mystic artes easier to use and access in the updated PS2 version, or hell, this one, is a mystery to me).\n\nBUT. If you liked the original, you'll like this release. The story and characters are still some of the best in the series, even if some reveals feel like they're broadcasted on full blast to a well read adult. The gameplay is simplistic but with enough depth that you can get one or two full playthroughs in and still be entertained and find out new tricks. IMO, the only Tales game that outshines this one as of this date is Vesperia.", "timestamp_created": 1666424973, "timestamp_updated": 1666424973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490421533584594727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124199959": {"recommendationid": "124199959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136090482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1679191398}, "language": "english", "review": "The game reminds me a lot of the Final Fantasy series.

I played through the whole game at least ten times (since I had more time on my hands, compared to now) and still had fun figuring out active skills (\"Techs\", which are divided in two groups, and each character can only learn one group or set of \"Techs\" at a time) and passive skills (\"EX Skills\", which are based on equipable gems that can be swapped), as well as through all the endgame bonus content and dungeons.\n\nWhen the Remaster (or rather, slight graphical overhaul) got announced for PS3, I played it again - and to be honest, I was a little scared that a gaming gem of my past would turn out as a mediocre, overhyped piece of garbage when compared to newer, more modern games, or that my taste just changed during all these years. \n\nBut on the contrary: I understood much more from the nuances in the stories, was able to appreciate characters and their motivation even more and also figured out many new and improved character builds and team compilations - in a game that I played a ton already, mind you.\nSure, the gameplay might get somewhat repetitive, but since there are a couple of characters to choose from (which all play differently) and you also can play with friends, it is more than enough to keep you entertained for a whole playthrough, or maybe two. \n\nSpeaking of that: the main storyline takes roughly 50-70 hours to beat, and the game features an NG+ mode as well. \n\nIn terms of presentation... well, Tales of Symphonia had its roots on Gamecube (and later PS2, which is also the version on Steam/PS3 is based on) and it shows. Thankfully, the style aged comparatively well and the music/voice acting is and was very good, but there could have been done more. They also included the bonus content from the (Japan exclusive) PS2 release. \n\nThere are also some oldschool design choices that were pretty much part of classic JRPGs, like being able to miss major sidequests or hidden treasures, strong weapons and the like, which could be unwelcome during this day and age, but I think it makes the world feel more \"alive\" and authentic (compared to everything in it waiting and sitting there for the player to make sure he/she sees or stumbles over everything) and it also makes exploration and returning to former locations much more rewarding, as well as giving a good reason to start a new playthrough via New Game+.\n\nIn summery:\n- great and engaging story and characters that can be enjoyed by all ages, with twists and turns\n- a world that feels alive and changing\n- somewhat spammy and repetitive gameplay that gets broken up by character and build choices\n- acceptable graphics... at best\n- good music and voice acting\n- bonus content you might not have experienced, if you played the version on GC\n- high replay value (for me at least)\n\n\nI can recommend it wholeheartedly if you are into JRPGs and/or action based combat.", "timestamp_created": 1666186777, "timestamp_updated": 1666187363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124055261": {"recommendationid": "124055261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099074376", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1666150127}, "language": "english", "review": "got an hour in,had a box in a bad position, grabbed it, could only move left and right, couldnt let go, so i was softlocked\n", "timestamp_created": 1666150454, "timestamp_updated": 1666150454, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124053975": {"recommendationid": "124053975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012849849", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 488, "last_played": 1666222954}, "language": "english", "review": "Having always wanting to play Symphonia I finally picked it up while it was on sale and I don't have any regrets.

You can use Special K's ToSfix  (easy method) or Cheat Engine (will take more effort) to apply a  speed hack to increase the speed by 1.3x and it'll give you a nice brisk bump without making everything weird like a 2x speed and such would.  I think the content changes from the GC version are worth it and make the GC version obsolete, but if you really must, the GC version is out there.\n\nAll in all, a solid RPG with lovely characters, nice storytelling, side content, and decent gameplay for its time and alright now.

Graphically the game is alright for its age and while I don't think it matters, some people are upset the port is locked at 30 FPS. A lot of reviews rave about the combat, but the 2D movement on an open plane feels awful to me. Most of the combat is incredibly easy but the first shrine boss devolves into spamming items just to stay alive even with two healers.

play the first tales of game represented in smash (by a mii costume)\n\n+I am pleasantly surprised to say the combat was really fun. The tech combos you can pull off with some EX-skills you can get + the macros so you can use your teammates effectively. I did really only use Lloyd and Zelos for the most part but all the characters are fun.\n\n+On that note, it is nice to see another Tales of game where there is no powercreep. You can use any character you so desire as long as you properly build and invest them. That being said it is highly encouraged to use everyone to build techs anyway. Exp is not a problem at all as everyone even those not in your party get it so I actually didn't need to grind at all in this game.\n\n+The story of this game was excellent. I am honestly surprised I can say this story might even rival Vesperia's story for me. The way they tackled racism and sacrifice was well-executed. A fair amount of twists and turns in the story yet not linear and not predictable for the most part. Of course a lot of moral dilemmas in classic Tales fashion will be found. Definitely not your average hero saves the world story.\n\n+I really just want to say the way they tackle stuff like discrimination, human experimentation, following dictators due to fear, etc. They felt very realistic and thus makes the events of the world more understandable even if we can't necessarily relate them to our daily lives.\n\n+The characters are truly what makes the game for me. From the main duo of Lloyd and Colette to the funny antics of Sheena and Zelos to the discrimination Genis and Raine had to endure and the excellent backstories of Kratos, Presea and Regal. All of the cast were great and I am happy to say none of them were annoying and all were appreciated. Their relationship clearly grew as the game progressed and it was nice to see their dynamic throughout the game.\n\n+Bonus that Lloyd Japanese VA is the same as Kamina from Gurren Lagann. Very inspiring.\n\n+On top of the main cast, the antagonists and NPCs were well fleshed out and you can truly understand their motives. It is hard to talk about antagonists without spoiling the game but I can say just cause they are antagonists doesn't necessarily mean they had harmful intentions. This game really made it feel like every choice had its consequences.\n\n+The dungeons were very creative. None of the dungeons were linear and they really required you to think to solve them. Some may be frustrating but I really appreciate the amount of effort put into these. The dungeons really didn't feel like you just find the way while beating all the enemies along the way. Definitely a big upgrade from the dungeons of the last Tales of game I played (Zestiria).\n\n+The world was well-made. The many locations all felt unique and it truly felt like I was exploring the world when the many places I visited were different.\n\n+This is the first Tales of game I played that does NOT have weapon skills. I personally disliked the weapon skill mechanic but just assumed it was part of the series. I am much much much happier with the EX skills given in this game as they are not only nongrindy but also don't rely on RNG. The EX skill system also lets you really customize your characters and play them the way you want. Some characters need some EX skills however (Raine with Concentrate) but for the most part you are free to build your characters however.\n\n-Visually this game is not very good. I found the character models ugly and the anime scenes to be subpar. On this note of peripherals, the sound design was just annoying. I hated it when my characters had to walk on sand. The SFX of choice was just not good.\n\n-I can't believe I have a game I like yet I didn't really like the music. The OST of this game was not standout and left much to be desired. I normally take notice to the OST of games but this one is just mid.\n\n-No character swap-ins meaning theres only 4 characters when you go in a fight. No free-run so you can only move towards or away an opponent. Swapping controlled characters has no hotkey and you have to open the menu everytime to do it. There's a lot of dated mechanics with the combat despite being really fun.\n\n-Clunky controls on the boat when you get it. Noishe didn't really add to much. Dodging enemies in the overworld and dungeons was extremely hard so you had to take almost every fight. Traversing didn't feel really nice also. It didn't help that the overworld felt a bit too big.\n\n-I did mention how the dungeons felt very creative but and none were the same but some puzzles (the temple of darkness for one) were very frustrating and required a lot of backtracking. At least it did requires some brain power but the frustration was evident with a few of the dungeons.\n\n-The tutorial system sucks. Just lots of textboxes and no showing so it is easy to forget some mechanics in the game.\n\nOverall, great game and I definitely can see why some people say it's their favorite Tales of game.

For me, it takes first place over all the other JRPG favorites everybody talks about (like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Persona, etc). I'm so happy there's a PC version and I've been able to start replaying it, and it's everything amazing I remembered it as (and better)! \n\nThe cel shaded graphics are beautiful, nostalgic, and adorable at the same time. Honestly the whole game looks like a watercolor painting to me, with all the soft pastel colors and anime-like, yet realistic design. It's amazing how over time the graphics aged so gracefully. Also, the music is A+++! Dreamy and memorable for every town, and catchy and exciting for the battle themes.\n\nStory wise, you can't beat Symphonia! Each character in your party has an incredible design and backstory, and it's both hilarious and intriguing seeing how they develop and interact. And despite the cuteness of the game, the story tackles deep social issues like religion, race, class, and politics in a way that really makes you think like no other games do. Without spoiling too much, it's great for both kids and adults and you can learn a lot from it. I also love the fantasy setting and Norse lore mixed in. \n\nGameplay wise, Tales games are always exciting and unique! Live action fighting while your party members help you out. Your friends or the whole family can each control a party member too, which makes it a really fun bonding experience! Still not a lot of RPGs like this where the whole family can enjoy together, which I think is an incredibly special aspect of the game.\n\nOverall! if you're an rpg fan and hesitating, don't hesitate anymore!

Nada mal. Sin embargo, uno de los motivos por el cual he tardado tantos a\u00f1os en acabarlo, es porque los personajes, no son precisamente, agradables, no en el sentido que son antip\u00e1ticos, sino que tienen rasgos que los hace dif\u00edcil sobrellevar. \nPor decirlo plena y clara, Lloyd (el personaje principal) es un pedante y se queja por todo, Collete (protagonista femenina principal), es una tonta que va dispuesta a ser el sacrificio, Genis es un sabiondo y la profesora, pues tiene fetiche por cualquier cosa que tenga m\u00e1s de 50 a\u00f1os y el \u00fanico medio-normal es el mercenario (excepto que es el t\u00edpico mercenario callado, misterioso y tajante). \n\nCon esto,  que sea una historia tipo peregrinaci\u00f3n y el hecho de encontrar a semi-elfos nazis con toda la lista incluida de villanos de turno, pues si, no es algo que sintiese ganas de seguir jugando, sin olvidar lo lioso que es el combate en el inicio. \n\nBien, eso puede parecer que el juego, es malo, pero de hecho, tras forzarme a jugar un poco m\u00e1s (en parte, gracias al finalizar Phantasia), he descubierto que el juego no era tan malo como pensaba, de hecho, incluso me ha gustado y me parece un buen JRPG que no puede faltar en la biblioteca. De hecho, al final, me hab\u00eda incluso olvidado de los semi-elfos nazis (que si bien, son importantes, en realidad son usados por unos cuantos, y tienen su finalidad), ya que la trama de Lloyd y cierto personaje cercano importante (que no dir\u00e9, porque son spoilers de mid para  lategame) y como interact\u00faan ambos, est\u00e1 bien hecho, y despu\u00e9s, est\u00e1 el hecho de que sabe mezclar perfectamente la frase de \"para que uno viva, otro tiene que sufrir\". Aparte, los personajes, mejoran (excepto la profesora.... que no se ve un cambio, ni positivo ni negativo) y la trama tipo peregrinaci\u00f3n, deja incluso de tener importancia, por lo que cambia a uno en el cual, hay que salvar a Collette (unas cuantas veces, de hecho, y no solo f\u00edsicamente) para luego, intentar descifrar lo que sucede y finalmente aprender las motivaciones del villano principal. Eso no quita que haya algunos momentos que flojea un poco, como cuando se sacrifica un personaje con tal de salvar el grupo y Lloyd sobreactua a pesar de que cuando lo conocimos, al principio, acabamos pele\u00e1ndonos contra \u00e9l, yo me qued\u00e9 en plan \"\u00bfesa muerte tengo que tomarlo como algo importante ?\" o cuando en un momento dado, hay como una fiebre (metaf\u00f3ricamente hablando) que hace que todos los personajes principales  deseen sacrificarse, uno detr\u00e1s de otro en cuesti\u00f3n de minutos y \"mueran\" para que aparezcan a salvar el prota en el momento m\u00e1s oportuno. Pero de todas formas, sus pros, los considero mayores que sus contras.\n\nSi al adquirir este juego, sientes que no es lo tuyo, animo que intentes pasar de los 10/20 horas, porque es un juego, algo duro de llevar, sobre todo, al inicio, y si a pesar de todo, sigue resisti\u00e9ndose, prueba la versi\u00f3n de Tales of Phantasia (que es lo que yo hice antes de jugar a este), que aunque es m\u00e1s antiguo, lleva mejor la historia, sus personajes e incluso, su antagonista principal cosa que Symphonia, aunque no malo, de hecho, me ha gustado, si que flojea un poco en esos 3 aspectos.\n\nMuy buen juego en conclusi\u00f3n. De una cosa mal que hace, 3 los hace bien. \n", "timestamp_created": 1652615419, "timestamp_updated": 1652615419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115424687": {"recommendationid": "115424687", "author": {"steamid": "76561199190533429", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3587, "last_played": 1696303016}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un rpg magnifico clasico que deberias probar si inicias la saga tales of", "timestamp_created": 1652508809, "timestamp_updated": 1652508809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115159529": {"recommendationid": "115159529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018567646", "num_games_owned": 5156, "num_reviews": 543, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 273, "last_played": 1620575766}, "language": "english", "review": "fix the Dark Souls servers Bandai Namco!

It's so smooth that I would rub my face with it. Lack of polish will stare at your face pretty much each time you boot the game. Why does the main menu music stops playing when getting in the load save file menu? That didn't happen before. Also, why does the voice acting is so quiet for every new ability added since the PS2 version? And that's only the most obvious example. It's a real shame.\n\nHonestly, even though I bought this game at 5$, I still feel a bit ripped off seeing how much Namco doesn't care about this game, just like most Japanese publisher do about their old catalog (it's that right Square?). I still think it is worth the purchase thanks to steam save cloud and what not, but I can't fault anyone who decide to emulate the GameCube original instead.\n\nEdit: Better this version then the 'remastered' one.

Only other tales games I beat besides this one are phantasia and destiny. Phantasia was the first tales game I played way back on SNES. An old friend recommended it to me, and even tho he beat it, I never could beat that game till recently. Its a great game and on SNES its comparable in graphics to chrono trigger, final fantasy 6, and breath of fire 2. Which is really good, TOP actually amazed me back in the day, how good the graphics and magic were. But it wasn't an easy game, long and super grindy. But it got me into the series, so I decided to start with this one on steam. It sometimes goes for 5$ on sell. For the price its one of the better jrpg deals you can get on pc. So if you wanna test the series out but don't want to buy a snes/psx/ps2 then this is the best option on pc for a good price. If you enjoy it then you'll probably enjoy the higher priced ones like zesteria/vesperia. Vesperia seems closest in tradition to symphonia imo, cept with much better cell shading. Symphonia was a game I saw way back on Gamecube and wanted it but never got a chance to. I had  zelda the windwaker back then and was really sold on cell shading. Also loved jet grind radio. Having it now, I really didn't expect it to be so good. At the time I was just interested in any good rpg on gamecube because GC didn't exactly have a lot of jrpgs. This game is heavy, heavier than most Final fantasies even. If you buy this game, be ready for a long playthrough just to beat the game might take you 40-80 hours depending on how you play. With extras, unlocks, alternate costumes, and achievements, damn I've heard anywhere from 300-1000 hours not joking. That's how frickin huge this game is...\nSo yea worth 5$ on sell imo. I would look at this as kinda like an elder scrolls game don't buy it with a complete it mindset. Get it for the fun and gameplay. I beat it once and going through it again for some of the other stuff like optional bosses and items. Its really a good game, and has a great postgame as well with tons of little things to do. You can get to around lvl 250 also I've heard. I've yet to scratch the surface in what all you can do but I have beat the main game 1 time and its nice, great ending, great characters, good music too. Just that expect more light and quirky than epic over the top godmonster like final fantasy. That's whats kind of the appeal here its more like a fun anime cartoon with a lot of silly humor than serious. Altho there is some serious stuff its never to the point of other rpgs, or even other tales games (lot of the earlier tales were way more serious).  \n\nThe dungeons can also be a bit complicating and there's always some complex puzzle to do so just letting you know you might get stuck a bit at times. I kept pushing on cause I really liked the characters and storyline. The summon volt in particular was a very rough dungeon. But its an extremely rewarding game and when you finish it there's a lot to do with the new plus features. There's all kinds of other little things like cooking recipes and stuff, but really this is an epic jrpg and not light in anyway so don't buy this thinking it'll just be an easy grind game its not its very complicating and challenging. \n\nEven more so than the older tales games, like phantasia. Not to say phantasia is light either but compared to this it is... But if you wanna test out the tales games for a good price, love cell shading, like child hood friendship story lines and coming of age romance, and a good battle system, can't go wrong here I really enjoy it.

symphonia and it was....good and bad. I would say 6/10 \n\nIt takes the classic formula of a jrpg and adds a nice, real time battle system to it . The gameplay is fun and simple enough to get the hang of yet takes time to master. The progression throughout the game means not much grinding is required. the levelling system/ tech system is alright. nothing innovative. \"use x move 50 times to unlock y\". the whole T/S made not much sense and I ignored it pretty much and still made it to the end with no real difficulty. This game will not challenge you (maybe the end game content...but even then is grinding a challenge? Not for me thanks)\n\nNow, many on here who are fans of the story i feel are looking at this through nostalgic glasses. The story starts of like your classic jrpg trope boy from village on path tp save the world. But from this it goes down a series of extremely convoluted paths and obvious tropes . Add a few twists in you could see coming a mile away. Add that to the last 20% of the game where I had NO idea what was going on by the end and it gets the story wrapped up by even more bs that I honestly had to google for an explanation. (which even though was honestly unsatisfactory)\n\nSome of the writing is cringe inducing honestly. it is a dated game though and it is forgiven and on the whole the writing was decent enough. A very nice moral story that they sometimes take a stick and beat you with. But I liked the message at least \n\nYou can play it again on a sort of new game +...but why would you . it does have endgame content but beyond a couple of bosses and an arena, there is nothing else really to do. \n\nStill I would recommend it on sale I suppose. It fixed an itch and for the first 80% of the game I was having fun. The ending though...sheesh....just run through it. its not like you won't absolutely smash every boss with zero effort anyway. \n\nI'd say 6/10 maybe? I do want to try another tales game though, I think this installment has laid some serious groundwork done and I can see why the future installments are spoken highly of.

This review is entirely based on how good the port is. It took around two hours of forum diving/googling/experimentation and setup, which might be a somewhat high barrier to entry for this port of the game.\n\nIt's mandatory to use TSfix, which means SpecialK injector is necessary, which means that dll errors and a lot of install jank is mandatory. When you figure it out though, it's great and you can even get 60fps with it in most areas (old game, speed is based on frame rate, GC version was heavily coded differently to compensate for 60fps, etc etc, everyone who has emulated old games knows this).\n\nIf it wasn't for TSfix, this would be inferior to the dolphin; but having a multiplayer-compatible camera and being able to just download the latest versions of TSfix's \"dlc\" (texture pack and model fixes, mostly) is really handy. Being able to run the game in the background and edit it directly on your computer is nice too.\n\nAs far as whether or not you should play Tales of Symphonia itself, obviously yes. If you haven't ever played this, it's a classic and the PC port isn't shaky anymore thanks to patches and fixes years ago. This game is on the same level as something like Chrono Trigger or Earthbound because it defined it's own niche in the RPG genre and many games are compared to it for a very good reason. Certainly it's not as popular as those games, but for 2003/2004, it was around as ambitious and successful with that ambition. The story and characters are charming and compelling, the combat is approachable and simple but very satisfying and easy to experiment with, the replayability is extremely high (thanks grade system), and there isn't any real BS.

El sistema de combate es original a su manera pero se vuelve muy tosco a la hora de querer que tus compa\u00f1eros no se metan encima de las habilidades del enemigo (si, ya se que se les puede ordenar ir atr\u00e1s o estar a la defensiva pero a\u00fan as\u00ed les quita participaci\u00f3n en el combate, hace que el \u00fanico personaje que valga la pena controlar es Lloyd por sus combos y no me gusta eso).\n\n- La interfaz del juego es muy fea al igual que los items, reciclan varios iconos y les cambian el nombre y ya es un item distinto pero la verdad lo unico que me gust\u00f3 realmente fue la intro anime con su soundtrack.\n\n- La animaci\u00f3n en el mapa mundi de Lloyd montando a Noishe es lo m\u00e1s rob\u00f3tico que vi y contrasta mucho en el juego, ya que para tantas animaciones y movimientos en combate no me podes poner a Lloyd mas duro que tornillo de submarino flotando en Noishe, no se como se les pas\u00f3 por alto darle una animaci\u00f3n al montar a la mascota que hace que termine pareciendo que Lloyd montara una motocicleta estando acostado sobre ella.\n\n- El juego lo dej\u00e9 luego de que Kratos traiciona al grupo, la verdad ya hab\u00eda tantos acontecimientos predecibles pero este se ven\u00eda oliendo y dije \"como Kratos me traicione y Sheera deje el team, desinstalo\" y pas\u00f3 osea xD\n\n- \u00a1Ups! Iba caminando por un cruce y me choco con una persona que ni ella ni yo nos vimos venir y se rompe una poci\u00f3n (que es valiosa y por ende deber\u00eda estar bien cuidada) que pertenece a unos tipos que tienen est\u00e9tica de maleante, que te hablan con ataques pasivo/agresivos, te amenazan y tras  yo haber matado y luchado por menos con muchos enemigos \u00bfque crees que haces para resolverlo? \u00bfPelear? Nah, te amenazan e insultan a Colette y no te dejan salir del pueblo y te ves obligado a devolverle la poci\u00f3n. Acto seguido ves a los protagonistas haciendo berrinches de que no tienen ganas de devolver la poci\u00f3n valiosa pero aun as\u00ed el juego te obliga a hacerlo, totalmente innecesaria toda esta situaci\u00f3n dando vueltas por el pueblo para devolverles una jodida poci\u00f3n la cual ellos tambi\u00e9n tienen la culpa de chocarnos, un juego que no teme a decir \"tenemos que matar para avanzar en la historia y nuestra misi\u00f3n\" termina buscando la excusa mas mediocre de mostrarnos al grupo de maleantes, mal encarada su presentaci\u00f3n.\n\n- La banda sonora es lo mas aburrido que tiene el juego, muy lineal y se repite a cada rato en las masmorras, monta\u00f1as o pueblos. La reciclaron hasta mas no poder.\n\nY eso es todo lo que puedo decir, como dije no es mal juego pero a mi no me lleg\u00f3 a gustar, me llegaba a dar sue\u00f1o, no me atrap\u00f3, y tras aburrirme con la historia mi mente se puso a buscarle errores hasta que no pude mas y tuve que desinstalarlo.

You go around collecting loads of summons for every element under the sun. The formula for each one is pretty much the same. Go to some tower/dungeon. Solve the puzzle there. Battle a dungeon boss. Rinse and repeat about 15 times. \n\n[h3]Graphics[/h3]\nThe graphics are cell-shaded 3D. It gives it a bit of a timeless look, but some of the textures are way too low for modern screen resolutions. I would have preferred more life-like proportioned characters. The game forces you to play at 720p. There is an unofficial patch to allow you to play fullscreen borderless window mode but it has bugs occassionally where the screen goes blank or the animation graphics don't play.\n\n[h3]Sound[/h3]\nThe background music is OK. I didn't have to mute it but I wasn't looking forward to listening to any of the tunes either. I was disappointed to find out that there were no English dubs for \"skits\". That gives me the impression they \"cheaped\" out on it.\n\n[h3]Battle System[/h3]\nThe best selling point of this game is the action-oriented battle system. It looks like you can have multiple players for the fights and I can imagine this game being quite fun between a couple of friend or siblings around 12 years old. It's a shame most people would probably not experience this playing alone on the PC.\n\nOne tip from me for XBOX gamepad users. Do yourself a favour and swap the default bindings for \"Defend\" and \"Techs\". This lets you rest your right-thumb joint over the 'B' button to block.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game.

The gameplay progression in Symphonia is also one of the most balanced I have seen. You are always just strong enough to beat the bosses in or two tries, and just weak enough that it is still a challenge. While regular battles are fun too, boss battles are the highlight of this game. While dealing as much damage as possible and blocking attacks, you are conserving TP and items trying to heal you and your teammates. It is an interesting blend of real time skill and resource management and strategy that works the best during these boss battles.

They each have their own fully fledged stories and backstories, either explicit or implied, that are explored, either as a main-through, or told in cut up parts throughout the game. There are deeper themes involved than \"go there and slice 'em up.\" The themes vary from self-sacrifice to save others, refusing to give in to hopelessness and cynicism just to become an indifferent self-serving individual like those around you, and the difficult choice of deciding to trust someone again, even if they crushed your hope into a million pieces. These themes arise from the game's focus on \"emotional resonance,\" which gives the game an emotional depth and wide breadth of emotional experiences that, sadly, few games ever focus on, and instead choose to divert the entirety of their energy into profitability, not richness of experience.\nOf course, the size of the world and the maps are not boring, the number of unique enemies, and types of strategies are enough to keep you interested in playing for a while, and the slashing and spellcasting are quite satisfying for a game of its time.

Released originally on the Gamecube/PS2 and then having rereleased on PS3/Steam. \n\nOur main character Lloyd (Same VA as Robin from Teen Titans) acts as a body guard for Colette who goes on a journey of world salvation. Seeking out the seals and Colette slowly becoming an angel. As the adventure progresses, NPCs mention about how half-elves are evil and conduct world destruction. While many of the villains are half-elves, this also puts a problem for certain characters who are also half-elves and aren't evil. Lloyd and crew also seek a way to end segregation - while continuing their journey of salvation.  \n\nCombat is real time action where using basic hits and skills to chain combos with CPU party members is needed to succeed in the game. I will say this though, Symphonia has a tough beginning game and gets easier as the game progresses. Equipment system is very basic and easy to keep on track. The only drawback the game has is questionable puzzle design choices in dungeons.\n\nIn conclusion, Tales of Symphonia is a great game and great as a starter entry to the series.

At its heart it's a 2.5D hack-n-slash dungeon-crawler inside an anime RPG.\n\nGood graphics (stylized but not photorealistic). Good music (one of my favorite OSTs). Combat system is simple to learn and excel at for basegame but surprisingly difficult to get good enough at for the optional side content (yes even on normal difficulty; this is Namco there is no easy mode lmao). VERY VERY LONG if you want to do and see everything, but even if you wanna just coast through it and do the bare minimum to roll the credits taking the time to relax and enjoy the story... it's still pretty long all things considered and it's a very engaging story [about fun things like grief & loss, racism & caste discrimination, religious oligarchy, literal fascists running concentration death camps, and... FRIENDSHIP! :D ...yes i am being 100% serious].\n\nThere are no less than 9 systems in place for strategy and mechanics (beyond \"mash the x/A button until the bad guy dies\"), and only one of them has anything to do with your characters' stats directly, so skill and strategy are wholly responsible for your advancement- there are no \"character builds\", it's more a mandatory job system. Fighters do physical damage, white mage heals, black mage does magic damage, jack of all trades do everything decently. You can adapt things to your playstyle, focus more attention on different characters if you like them more, revert most changes, or just stick it out and try again in new game plus with either buffs or nerfs to various things (with points you earn based on how well you do and how much you're willing to grind).\n\n...I can't do this. Screw being analytical and using facts and logic, time to get emotional and anecdotal.\n\nThis is my favorite RPG. Fallout, Persona, Mass Effect, Dark Souls, System Shock, Final Fantasy, they are also fantastic RPG series I love, but I genuinely love this game more than all of them. In fact, scaling for cohesion length content etc, this is my favorite video game, of all time. Resident Evil 4, Dead Space, Metro Redux, Half-Life, Jak & Daxter, Metroid Prime, yeah yeah they're all great. I still love this game more. When I was 6 I got a brand new Gamecube for my birthday, my first exposure to video games that wasn't Atari or an arcade cabinet, I got Soul Calibur 2, Metroid Prime, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, and my cousin let me play his copies of Ghost Recon, Falsebound Kingdom, and Tales of Symphonia. I played those games for hundreds if not thousands of hours growing up and they all left their mark on me, but none did as much as Symphonia did and it will always hold a special place in my heart. But I never stopped replaying it. For 20 years I've played and loved this game. I read the manga twice. I listen to the OST on my regular playlist. I've read transcripts of the drama CDs' audio. I'm rewatching the anime for the fourth time with my boyfriend. I have the Gamecube and the controller that came with it with a dozen saves on the memory card that came with it, all at the foot of my bed ready and waiting to be plugged into my CRTTV, and yet I bought this again on Steam, and if it wasn't hundreds of dollars and I could read Japanese I would buy it on PS2 as well. When I was in middle school I found and read a 136,000 word fanfiction that crossed it over with Invader Zim and Harry Potter in an afternoon. My love for this game is absolutely absurd and borderline obsession, and has been for 70-80% of my life. So why am I telling you all of this?\n\nIf you only like this game 10% as much as I do, you'll still have a damn good time.", "timestamp_created": 1637490514, "timestamp_updated": 1637490514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "103179421": {"recommendationid": "103179421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993276341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 2451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2451, "last_played": 1637379538}, "language": "english", "review": "A total classic JRPG with great real-time action combat.

The plot twists and turns it's way through 40-60 hours of content, which some side stuff available for those who explore around.  Sometimes the plot makes sense...sometimes it doesn't.\n\nAs with many RPGs from the era, the dungeons are varied but a bit painful.  Be prepared to backtrack around, have to re-fight the same enemies over and over while you figure things out, and become sick of pushing and pulling boxes around.  Fortunately, the ability to set the characters to auto-combat helps out tremendously in alleviating the fights.  The monsters are on the map and can sometimes be avoided, but often you'll be running down narrow paths and cannot avoid them.\n\nI did have a tendency to get stuck on path edges sometimes.  Again, a relic of the era...but it was frustrating trying to dodge around an enemy and then start running in place because I had found the invisible edge of the path.  \n\nI had to restart once because I managed to get myself cornered in a room by an NPC that paced around.  Since I was in the spot the NPC was trying to path to, he couldn't get out of my way and I couldn't get out of his.  Save often, just in case.\n\nI would've loved a \"quick-save\" feature so that I could stop playing and shut down the game at any time without finding a save point, but dungeons aren't terribly long.  Not the end of the world...I'm guessing they wanted to keep as much of the original mechanics as possible.\n\nThe game is vibrant and the soundtrack suits the mood.  The characters can be a bit edgy at times, but that is typical from this era.  In my opinion, the game overstayed it's welcome just a bit and could've been about 10 hours shorter.  Ignore my listed playtime...I have a newborn in the house and had to walk away from the game from time-to-time.\n\nTypically when deciding if a game is worth it, I measure how much time I enjoyed the game and compare it to the game's cost.  If it comes out to worthwhile entertainment for under a dollar an hour then I got a great deal.  I feel like even if I had paid full price, I would've gotten that from this game...so if anyone is interested in a good example of RPGs from this era, you should give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1636298011, "timestamp_updated": 1636298011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102359810": {"recommendationid": "102359810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346980676", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1663027908}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is literally unplayable.

It's just a shame the Chronicles version was limited by the PS2 version. Sure it had more content, but also had worse performance. It's sadly felt a bit here, but it's still fun at least in my opinion.\n\nThere's a lot of content to go through, and in Tales fashion a lot to keep track of if you want to be able to actually do everything. I don't think this has quite as many hard to hit/follow triggers like Vesperia, but I guess an older game being simpler makes sense (at least before modern games became worse). \n\nThe music is great, the characters are all enjoyable. I was surprised just how much was vividly burned into my brain given I hadn't played it in so long and had only played it once. The story is not that much to write home about, but it does the job. Playing right after Vesperia there's a lot of similar concepts and themes in the overall story. \n\nThe combat isn't as slow to start, it's fun if a bit simple at times. It's also more simple depending on where you upgrade your EX Skills. Being able to link stuff makes it a lot more engaging than it otherwise would be. Thankfully unlike Vesperia you don't need to do anything for backsteps, recovering from knock up/backs, etc. IT's all there by default.\n\nThe AI I couldn't stop from randomly running toward enemies. Even having them not attack they'd still run up toward enemies for some reason. *shrug* Might just be me and not the game though I know it took me awhile to figure out Vesperia, but that was more complex with AI than this one.\n\nThe main issue I have with the game is that you can easily get stuck on stuff while moving around. The camera will stutter while it happens in some cases too which is annoying. It's just a bit wonky. I don't remember having this issue on Gamecube but that also had the weird hexagon thing around it's analog and you can still 'feel' that type of movement despite not using that controller. So maybe that's why?\n\nIt's a great JRPG. The only other criticism is the Japanese audio, a lot of things aren't translated for some reason. Like bosses dying dialog, or some of Presea's original victory dialog before a certain story shift in her character. I think literally just one enemy actually had her loss dialog show up translated. It's kind of a bummer. And in battle dialog for bosses is also not translated. So you'll miss out on some stuff if you don't speak Japanese and choose that as your language option.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1636157024, "timestamp_updated": 1636157024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102285786": {"recommendationid": "102285786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070224536", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3828, "last_played": 1485278725}, "language": "english", "review": "only issue you need to be able to skip scenes  some are like 20min slogs", "timestamp_created": 1636150455, "timestamp_updated": 1636150455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102074348": {"recommendationid": "102074348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451952358", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1642684610}, "language": "english", "review": "I would probably give this game a glowing review, if i could actually play it.

And I love Every. Single. One of Them. This game is still engaging and fun, even if its a story you've heard a thousand times in other games by this point. The heroes are really likable, Lloyd Irving is young and naively idealistic without feeling whiny or incapable of character growth. Colette Brunel is soft-spoken and vulnerable, but isn't without the will or power to step up and fight or do things for herself. I found the side story of Genis and Raine the most compelling in the game: dealing with injustice, racism, fear of your friends' rejection, and the best way to deal with others' prejudice.

que no lo compres, lo acabo de desinstalar y lo jugu\u00e9 por 81.3 horas y puedo hablar con fundamento de que es un juego que no merece tu dinero, hay mejores, y no lo he terminado es que no soporto jugarlo un segundo mas\n1- uno de mis mayores quejas con este juego es el mapa, in\u00fatil a mas no poder, o sea solo son monta\u00f1itas y como 4 caminitos y ya eso es todo, no lo puedes ver en pantalla completa, no puedes marcar nada, no puedes ver los nombres de las ciudades, no puedes hacer zoom, NADA NADA NADA, esta ah\u00ed como un complemento nada mas, tienes que ponerle atenci\u00f3n a las escenas por que es ah\u00ed donde ellos dicen adonde van a ir y luego colocar la br\u00fajula hacia la direcci\u00f3n que dicen, noreste, sudeste etc. y cruza los dedos para que la encuentres r\u00e1pido\n2- no me gusto para nada que luego de 81.3 HORAS DE ESTARLO JUGANDO todav\u00eda segu\u00edan apareciendo enemigos que apenas me dan entre 200 a 400 puntos de experiencia vaya a donde vaya, es un fastidio a medida que subes mas de nivel porque entre mas alto tu nivel mas puntos te piden, entonces para el pr\u00f3ximo nivel tienes que hacer mas batallas para subir y as\u00ed sucesivamente\n3- todos los personajes a excepci\u00f3n de Lloyd se sienten tiesos cuando los usas, el mejor es Lloyd los otros es mejor ponerlos en autom\u00e1tico se mueven mas r\u00e1pido as\u00ed, si no me crees juega con Colette y veras lo que digo\n4- no tiene checkpoints, as\u00ed que graba cada vez que te aparezca el punto para grabar y hazlo hazme caso, me paso varias veces que mor\u00ed y por falta del maldito checkpoint perd\u00ed un mont\u00f3n de progreso\n5- en algunos tramos parece un juego para adivinos, si no ves v\u00eddeos en Youtube no vas a saber como sacar algunos items, con decirte que llegue a las 80 horas y no sabia como robar\ny te digo una cosa, este no es un juego malo, el problema con este juego es que fue hecho con poco tiempo, que lastima por que a mi si me gustaron los personajes, si tienen carisma pero de verdad ya estaba irritado y este juego a medida que avanzas  se pone peor, primero le iba a dar un 8 de puntuaci\u00f3n luego un 6 y al desinstalarlo ya baje mas el puntaje\neste juego es el ejemplo perfecto de que las prisas no dejan nada bueno, les falto tiempo para pulirlo, ser mas autocr\u00edticos a los desarrolladores, lo lamento por ti si conf\u00edas en los fanboys que  recomiendan este  juego,  cr\u00e9eme no vale la pena, toma mi critica como la  ultima advertencia seria, si bajas a los comentarios hay un fanboy que se manda con la rajada de que este es uno de los mejores rpg's de la historia, otro que dice UN JUEGO EXCELENTE Y MEMORABLE, y as\u00ed vas a ver bastantes comentarios variopintos\nCalificaci\u00f3n : 4 / 10",

It did get me emotional at one point and it was worth it for the outcome. From the gameplay aspect...it's horrible. The global world is garbage. I do not know if it's only for me but the camera was not working properly most of the time. God bless the moment when you can fly over the map. Random encounters will get annoying as hell. You will do a few steps and battle. Few steps and another battle. The combat system is a meh 50/50. For 2003 it's average. The funny part is that this version of the game is a PS3 port but when you connect a PS controller (DualShock 4 In my case) it will show you controls of Xbox.

When you think it finally feels like the story ends, it turns out you're only half way through and once you're done with the other half it turns out you're only 2/3 through the story. The ham-fisted messages about racism, tradition and friendship just isn't enough to justify the length either.\n\nThe anime cutscenes are beautiful, but sadly there are way too few of them. I would definitely watch a show or movie in that quality. The overall artstyle and design of the game are really great as well, but that is due to the limitations of the time it was made.\n\nThe combat itself is simple but really good... for like 10 hours and from there it's just too much of the same. There's also the terrible AI. You can set strategies for them, but they barely act on what you set before and you will find warriors doing nothing on the backside of the battlefield, while the mages cast spells right next to the enemies.

I wish I could figure out how to use the other characters more properly but oh well.\n\nThe story for this game is pretty good, though basically what you'll expect from a JRPG, although I thought the game would end like 3 times before it actually did, like the characters even say this will be the final battle like 3 times before it actually was, and each time it totally could have been the end of the game but something happened to keep the story going, but by the end I really enjoyed all that the characters went through. \n\nThere is a pretty big cast of characters and I gotta say that by the end of it I really liked everyone in the party, they all just felt like friends going on an adventure by the end. The \"Skits\" in the game, which are basically just the party talking in games like Dragon Quest really expanded the character's personalities and made me like them even more than just the actual cut scenes. I also liked the antagonists of the game, though I wish some of them got more screen time. \n\nAlso the game has a lot of good conversations about life questions such as discrimination and stuff like that, which are still prevalent today. And overall I highly recommend this game despite some of the minor problems that are in the game.", "timestamp_created": 1628633967, "timestamp_updated": 1628633967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97180479": {"recommendationid": "97180479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044486199", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2128, "last_played": 1680479195}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game as a kid and its help up the test of time.", "timestamp_created": 1628438493, "timestamp_updated": 1628438493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97163575": {"recommendationid": "97163575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305037295", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2296, "last_played": 1628403869}, "language": "english", "review": "A game i played back in 2010 when i was a teen. bring back memories. already finished on my xbox,now finished it again on steam. 10/10 best opening song. love Lloyd and Collete", "timestamp_created": 1628417575, "timestamp_updated": 1628417575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "97088281": {"recommendationid": "97088281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098413321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 7732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7732, "last_played": 1628314398}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahhh memories, memories, memories.

This is a classic \"Tales of\" title, released in 2003 in JP and 2004 in EU and NA. One of the greatest games created by Bandai Namco in my opinion. It has character development, creative story and interesting battles throughout the game, as well as fun mini-games, collectibles and a huge world to explore. THIS was the game that has stuck with me the longest, right next to games such as Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Skyrim. \n\nThis game is not only nostalgic, but holds up pretty well, especially with some fixes. But not all aged well with this game, and I recommend a few fixes to optimize your experience.\n\nThis game is in my top 5 favorite games of all time. PLEASE, read the issues with a grain of salt and DEFINITELY give it a try. If it's your first time, I HIGHLY recommend playing with Japanese voices, setting the control to \"manual\" and explore AS MUCH as the game allows when you can.\n\nFirst, before I go into detail here, please keep in mind this game is LONG, and because of this, it has some unfortunate aspects that really show an uglier side of it's age.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\nNote: This section is in no particular order.\n[list]\n[*] Animations for certain actions during impactful cut-scenes can be quite cheesy or borderline hilarious. Mind you, the game is trying to be serious, but these actions can be quite amusing to look at. I will say this though: I was able to look past this, still feel the emotion the game was conveying and enjoy the story. But this may be somewhat off-putting to some people so I thought I'd add it.\n\n[*] English voice acting is quite bad. Unfortunately, nostalgia disallows me to play it in Japanese (at least on my first play-through) but I'll definitely be going back through in Japanese the next time around. More content is covered in Japanese, and the voice acting is [b]much[/b] better.\n\n[*] I [b]cannot stress enough[/b] how bad the camera is in this game. It's okay in most situations, but while walking around the overworld, the camera will drive you crazy. The game explains that this is somewhat intentional, but honestly, it's infuriating not being able to see where you're going. There is a long-range mode that improves this (you'll find out) but you have to walk around blind to find the monument to allow you to be able to use long-range mode. In addition to the above issue, if playing with a friend, you will not be able to see one or the other if the players choose both a long range and a close range character. Basically meaning, you both must choose close or long range, otherwise someone will not be able to see what is happening.\n\n[*] Ship control. The ship turns extremely slowly and is quite bothersome to travel with. It takes about 5 seconds to turn from straight to left or right. Yes, it is this bad.\n\n[/list]\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\nNow it seems like everything I listed is bad, but there is [b]so much[/b] good in this game (literally everything else) that while these things do weigh it down, it's still an amazing game to play through. I will list some main points, but I obviously love the game so I'll keep it short.\n\n[list]\n[*] The story is amazing. It makes several twists throughout the journey, and leaves you guessing at what will happen next. It's got everything you'd want from a story and more. Not to mention the character development, morals the game discusses, sacrifices the characters make and how their choices impact the world.\n\n[*] Battles are fun. They are challenging (especially on hard), without forcing you to grind the entire way. There's tons of enemies you'll encounter, and really cool boss battles and optional ones too. \"Tales of\" games have always had great battle systems, and this game is no exception.\n\n[*] Skits, Collectibles, Mini-Games, titles etc. will be found throughout the game as you travel, complete the story and do random things such as complete 256 battles on hard mode. There's so much to do, so many extra little things that you'd never expect (like making Colette talk to all the dogs in the game) that really make this game shine. You're probably used to fetch quests in RPG games, well instead of fetch quests you get tons of extra character development, mini-games and collectibles to find!\n\n\n[h1]Workarounds[/h1]\n[*] Download cheat engine. No you're not using it to cheat. Attach it to ToS.exe while it's running, set \"Enable Speedhack\" to on, type in manually 1.1x speed, then click apply. What this will do is help fix the movement issues and make battle feel a bit smoother by increasing the game speed. At 1.2 or higher, it will be your choice to battle with it on or off, I do not recommend it for difficult battles.\n\n[*] Install this program from this community page and install your desired gamepad buttons, HD texture packs, fixes, etc. This is something I stumbled across whilst trying to find a way to run the game at 60 FPS. Not the fix I was looking for (there wasn't one) but a fix I was thankful to find. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=618359790", "timestamp_created": 1627356131, "timestamp_updated": 1627356374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "96434307": {"recommendationid": "96434307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190758028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1586, "last_played": 1631328432}, "language": "english", "review": "It is actually quite good.

I just have an issue with mainly gameplay and the OST sometimes. Some bosses hit like trucks and can kill the party in 1 AoE. So being able to stun lock them to do a meaty combo or heal would be a nice way to balance it but these bosses can eat hits as tho its being dealt by kids and they're John Super Cena. So making my hits not feel like they are doing something is something I am bothered by deeply. The OST cause sometimes something rather traumatising or sad is going on them the music cuts back to being very happy. The narrative dissonance there bothered me. \n\n9/10 for story but 7/10 for gameplay and 6/10 for music.\n\nEdit: So my prior review was salty cause [spoiler]  when you enter the tower of mana for the 1st time and fight Kratos, unless its new game plus or you overlevelled a fuck ton, there is no way for you to beat him [/spoiler]\n\nStory:\nSo I came very close to finishing the game [spoiler] I had to fight Yggdrasill  and Pronyma [/spoiler] and I can say objectively this game is very juvenile. It tries to address complex themes like systemic racism, religion and differences in ideals leading to conflict and war, very poorly. Had the game simplified its themes further and stress why Lyold is important early on, story would be very good. But at best, the story is childish and was made for children in mind, so if you are 24+ with responsibilities like myself, you wont enjoy the game unless you turn off your brain.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game will filter you. The 2nd half of the game is filled with too many puzzles, most of which frankly shit. So there will be puzzles where not enough information is conveyed to the player in terms of how much progress is required  to progress, as you may need to exit the puzzle room to progress but doing so resets your progress unless you did X amount of work such as in Temple of Darkness. Most puzzles eat time, like with Ymir Forrest.  Then there are puzzles where too much useless information is given such as with Temple of Ice. So obvious padding in the 2nd half of the game, time wise. Achieving Mystic Arts for the characters is  a feat unexplained by the game mechanics. Only Sheena achieved hers and those are story related, no other character towards the end of the game achieved theirs and I had 769 random encounter battles and 50hrs of gameplay, having done most side content. Also playing this game with a guide is recommended as progression can be confusing, mostly due to puzzles but also cause of side-content that is not optional needed to progress the main story like the unicorn-side mission.\n\nCharacters :\nWith the exception of Sheena, all the characters introduced in the 2nd half of the game that join your party suck. They suck [spoiler] Zelos is ok cause you get free shit when you talk to random women and his character journey is ok, ok as the man lacks a sense of urgency and purpose in his life [/spoiler].\n\nSoundtrack:\nASSSSSSS. This OST is shit dude. Muted the game and watched youtube or whatever while playing and random vids had better music, some of which better fitting for certain scenes and parts of the game than the actual shit in the game.\n\nFinal Point:\nThis game is a time eater. I invested 50hrs into this shit game cause Im stubborn and I payed for it and it didnt really deliver. I liked the cast introduced in the 1st half of the game. The 1st half of the game was solid, the 2nd half had far too many PUZZLES and half assed written troupes for characters introduced that joined your party. Music again is ass. Gameplay leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nHad the main story been 30hrs and sidequests another 20 (which can be done by not forcing players to do certain quests and rewarding them for it and reducing the amount of puzzles in the 2nd game) this game would be a classic [spoiler] I would remove the handcuff dude from joining your party and just make Presea the mute short girl that joins your party rather than Le Sad girl, also Kratos being Lyolds father was forced, so would change that too. Also the part of the game where it baits killing your party members  1 by 1 pissed me off cause I FUCKIN KNEW it was bait to force a emotional moment. This is where and why I dropped this shit game.[/spoiler]\n\n6/10 game, would not recommend you play cause there is no payoff and its target audience are pre-teens.\n", "timestamp_created": 1626658014, "timestamp_updated": 1628510593, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95977504": {"recommendationid": "95977504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361931553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1644458223}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game!

It's not my favorite of the Tales series, but if you're a fan then perhaps it's worth your time. The storyline is great, the characters are good, and the combat is alright.\nThere are only two problems: \n1) If your controller has vibration on, your game lags/stutters every time it vibrates. I didn't figure this out until the end of the game basically, which was super annoying (but also amazing to see what the combat is really supposed to be like at full speed instead of 1/4 - 1/2 speed). \n2) There is no free run. Sometimes, you fight multiple enemies that come at you from several directions, but you're just a 2D fighter with your target. Avoiding enemy attacks can be extremely difficult, especially in the beginning of the game. There's a bit of a learning curve...\n\nAnyway, if you want to get into the Tales series, don't start here.

[/h1]\nWell it\u2019ll have to be since the only way to catch all these achievements, whoever plays this game will have to beat this game approximately 5 times to do so.  Not only having to play the game that many times, but also have do tons of preparations, placing many restrictions very early on the game to get titles for certain characters which leads to achievements, tons of grinding with not only with levels, but with cooking levels, money, grade (I\u2019ll explain that later), getting almost all items, collectables, monster list, figurine in one playthrough, etc.  In other words, the very first play-through of this game is going to be the busiest, grind heavy, restrictive (the first half of the game), and demanding playthrough.  However, the great new is that after that hump and second and other playthroughs are less demanding and more opened.  As long as the players choose Kratos as their final party member on their first playthrough and gotten all of the titles for that playthrough, he\u2019ll get his last one on the second and then the player will receive the achievement to getting all the titles for him just by starting new game plus.  So, if anyone wants to gain all achievements for this game, they have to play this game like it\u2019s a mission and to finish this section of this insanity is with the five people you must speak with in a certain snowy town to guarantee the completion of titles and collection book and they are: Kratos (pretty easy), Zelos (hardest character), Colette (easiest character), Genis (easy character) and Regal (surprisingly easy if player find all of the outside skits for him (find those prism rings and GameFaQ will help)).\nNow I can finally talk about this freaking game and for those who love the Tales series will love this one since it\u2019s the first one to do 3D.  The game suffers for what I call the \u201cFinal Fantasy VII Syndrome\u201d which is it\u2019s \u201ceveryone\u2019s first (final fantasy/Tales) and these people get extremely emotionally attached to these two games.  Spoiler alert: those are my first introductions to those series \u2013 Final Fantasy 1 was my first RPG and Tales of Destiny was my first tales game whereas this game was my fourth one.  Both VII and Symphonia got a lot of similarities, strengths and weakness that sett hem apart, but overall good games; however, not my top 3.  What makes Symphonia stand out so much to many Tales Fans are the characters, the story, the interactions between the good and bad guys, but most importantly, the game is easily accessible, anyone can literally pick it up and play it without any hassle - with the character class restrictions, the players can strategizes which character can be effective in battle vs slapping on the right materia to characters which will take a while if people aren\u2019t familiar with the mechanics.  Unlike Final Fantasy VII\u2019s main antagonist Sephiroth, I prefer Yggdrasill because I find him more terrifying due everything he has done in this game and the vast majority of stuff he did was all his idea unlike Sephiroth who had a ready-made plan already handed to him and all he needed to do is sit on his ass, occasionally trolls the main character and has his \u201cmother\u201d do all the fighting for him and most notably, he waited 7 years to finally use his \u201cmother\u2019s\u201d body like a gundam (for more context, then play Final Fantasy VII and the explanation for that will take about 30+ hours to get to that point), but hey at least he looks walking through fire I guess.  I would say the game\u2019s greatest strength is that it doesn\u2019t drag on and on like VII does sometimes whereas in Symphonia, I don\u2019t feel that at all, but unlike FFVII, Symphonia does have some dick moves where if the players do fight a certain optional boss, talk to a certain person at a limited time bracket, then they\u2019ll never have access to some of the best equipment in the game.\nRemember where I briefly mentioned Grade early on, this is where Symphonia has over FFVIII in terms of replay-ability.  Grade serves two purposes: its use to buy material use for customizations aa well as EX Gems that will gain each character unique skills, but importantly, its use to buy bonuses for new game+ which is required to get everything in this game as well as making the game easier for players on harder difficulty.  They\u2019re obtained through battles along with money, EXP and drop items \u2013 think of Grade like a score for combat performance where in order to get the highest, the fights need to finish quickly, no damage, doing tons of combos, using technical skills and the like.  Those how played old school Tales games knows this, but at least in this game we can actually use these points as currency.  If anyone wants the best of the best stuff that new game+ plus got to offer, then prepare to grind for hours; however, there is a bonus that can be bought with grade to double the amount of it on can obtain, but it also doubles the loss if the battle performance is subpar, so high risk, high award scenario.  Unlike FFVII and other games Tales games, by beating the game, the sound test is unlocked which is awesome since the music in the game is very good, but there are older Tales games like Tales of Destiny that have that feature already available the moment the title screen appears.  Nevertheless, anyone can make the game easier or harder through the Grade store, but only if the game is beaten.\nBefore I recommend this game, the negative comments on this game in the steam community are legit since I have encountered some of these issues they addressed, but luckily not all of them.  For example, when I got over 135 hit combo in the game, for some reason it felt like I gave the game a heart attack because it looked as if it was going to crash when it froze for a little bit and all of the sudden it got better.  The worst crime in this game is the movements of the NPC where they can walk right up on me and get me stuck into a corner of a building that wasn\u2019t properly smoothed out in coding and I\u2019m imprison in that corner for all eternity until I reset he game or load up the file and hope that I saved before the incident.  That happen to me at least 3 times and nope, the NPC can\u2019t be shoved away.  Another annoying thing to bring up is when you uninstall and reinstall this game; it automatically set it to full screen regardless of the setting where I have to switch it back and forth to get back to windows mode and the FPS I believe is locked to 30 which is a no no for PC gamers because they hate it when FPS is locked.  That being said, the game is the PS2/PS3 version which contains more content, more techniques for each characters, titles and more optional boss fights.  The gameplay is going to be a little rough for those who play the more current Tales game, but that hump with dissipate very quickly by playing the game more.  Get this game on sale, can be played with friends and family and the opportunity to play the very game that paves the way for more 3D Tales game for years to come.  As for this game\u2019s sequels, one of the happens to be the very first Tales game which is Tales of Phantasia, a great game, and the other one is a direct sequel called Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World which is a game that should never existed and be completely skipped for Phantasia \u2013 trust me, I\u2019m doing everyone here a favor by stating that fact since I really don\u2019t understand the point of that game other than milking money out of people because I saw the words \u201cBandai Namco\u201d which gave me the prove that it\u2019s was just for the money.  It\u2019s on sale now, so get cheap before time runs out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1625478685, "timestamp_updated": 1625478685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958065986633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95077909": {"recommendationid": "95077909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078660123", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 4808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4808, "last_played": 1625443881}, "language": "english", "review": " Very unique JRPG, completely different from all other games i have played from the genre. will definitely play the other tales of games", "timestamp_created": 1625453837, "timestamp_updated": 1625453837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94881178": {"recommendationid": "94881178", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178539362", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1680402201}, "language": "english", "review": "was beyond hyped to find this gem on steam. love this game", "timestamp_created": 1625229492, "timestamp_updated": 1625229492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94818531": {"recommendationid": "94818531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141370504", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7483, "last_played": 1692818156}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is still pretty fun to play even after all these years from playing it on gamecube and the remaster chronicles on the ps3.

There's plenty more where that came from as well.\n\nThere are many different ways to play it to make your playthrough your own. Paths split and can be done in what order you want, tons of secrets to discover and extra non-essential things to see and do. The story is nothing groundbreaking, but for a comfy adventure that makes sense and doesn't try too much - it's great and gripping enough while being easy to follow. It has romance, it has sad moments, it has funny moments and it has some really brutal ones. But what makes this story stand out are the characters. All of them are unique, all of them have their motivations and interactions between them are fantastic, if the presentation might be a bit lacking sometimes. The characters SELL this game.\n\nCombat is really simple too, and although you can customize it and play around a lot to find what you're comfortable with, you can also change around to whatever character you want to control whenever you get bored of one. Lloyd is still my favorite to play, and Zelos is probably the most interesting and funny character to watch.\n\nThe voice acting is not perfect, the voice quality included, but it does its' job. The music is pretty good though, and sets the mood of any scene well. It has a tendency to get abruptly cut because of changes of the emotion of a cutscene, but considering this game is quite old, that shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAnyway, without getting into too much - it's recommended, pick it up during a sale, and if you want a nice comfy story to play around on summer evenings - can't go wrong with Tales of Symphonia.", "timestamp_created": 1625132334, "timestamp_updated": 1625132334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94704618": {"recommendationid": "94704618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198942979271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3537, "last_played": 1625022620}, "language": "english", "review": "I just beat this game and let me tell you, it's pretty good. This is my third Tales of game (Berseria was first, Zestiria was second) and I was not disappointed in this one. For a 2004 game, it actually holds up. This game has a pretty enjoyable cast of characters. Lloyd, Colette, Genis, Kratos, Raine, Sheena, Presea, Zelos, and Regal are all enjoyable characters. The dungeons in this game are incredible. As a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I think these dungeons are some of the best I've played in a video game, and definitely better than those in Berseria and Zestiria. Those two games have good dungeons, but compared to Symphonia, they just aren't as good.

It's not perfect though, it's really starting to show its age, and some aspects I just don't think were designed well to begin with.  Let me start with the positives first since there's far more good than bad here.\n\nThe writing, and the characters.  Oh my GOD this is an incredible cast. With the sole exception of Zelos, the cast is filled with lovable, memorable characters that will stick with you LONG after you finish the game. The main character Lloyd, Genis, Regal, and Kratos are my personal favorites. This game will MAKE you remember them, because not only do they each have their own character arcs, and play roles in the main story, but Symphonia does something that I don't think I've ever seen in a game before, skits.  From what I understand, this is a system that most Tales games have.  But basically, if you aren't aware, at random points in the game, whether you're on the overworld, in a dungeon, a town, or wherever else, you'll get a prompt for an optional skit.  Skits are essentially optional pieces of dialogue centered around the main cast, and there's hundreds of them. They'll comment on recent story beats/discoveries.  They'll comment on the town they're in, or recent characters they've met.  Or they could just be casual conversations between some of the characters, or them just having some fun.  This is an incredible way to develop these characters, and add extra context or information to the story in a way that doesn't seem overwhelming or annoying, because they're entirely OPTIONAL!  You can completely ignore them if you want to, and that's really cool.\n\nGameplay is really great.  It's an action RPG taking place in a 3D space, but you're fighting on a 2D plain, like a fighting game.  You can move left, right, and jump.  You also have basic attacks on the ground and the air, as well as skills that can be combo'd.  Most things happen in real time, though you can pause the action at any time to use an item or issue a command to your teammates.  Over time, as you fight, you'll learn more skills, not by leveling up and spending skill points, but by using the skills you already have, and changing your affinity, you'll gain new abilities mid-battle that are either brand new, combinations of previous skills, or previous skills that morphed in some way. For example, one of the earliest skills you get is Demon Fang.  It's a long range wave of energy essencially.  If you're T-Type, it'll morph into Double Demon Fang, shooting two waves instead of one.  If you're S-Type, it'll turn into Fierce Demon Fang, which removes the range, but makes it a multi-hit close range hit.  The way your abilities morph and can be combo'd with each other keeps things constantly fresh throughout the whole game.  You have a new ability to try out all the time, and its really fun to see how it performs, and how it fits into your combos.  \nOh yeah, and there's up to 8 characters in your party, and you can play as all of them and they all have this.  Extremely robust battle system here. \nMusic is incredible.  Very memorable soundtrack.  Not sure what else I can say on that, it's just really good.\n\nVoice acting is pretty good for the most part, though it's a bit disappointing that only important cutscenes are voiced.  I hear future games have full voice acting, even for skits.  It's a shame that such an incredible cast didn't get more time in the spotlight.\n\nStory is pretty good, lots of twists and turns, and very impactful events.  The game gets pretty dark at times.  Unfortunately, this is where a few of my gripes with the game start.\n\nAs I said, the story is good, and there's some seriously messed up things that happen in this story.  But it feels like the characters aren't allowed to take things seriously for too long.  I won't spoil anything, so I'll use a vague example to illustrate my point.  Imagine a very important character dies.  The cast is devastated. As you leave the place where it happened, the music is gone, the characters are silent, everyone is mourning the loss of their friend. 5 minutes later you get a prompt for a skit.  Now, this could be the one where they comment on their fallen comrade and talk about what they meant to them, or it could be a silly skit with the characters making jokes and laughing.\nSee the problem here?  That happens a lot if you always do the skits.\n\nThe overworld is awful.  It's huge and you move at a snails pace. You don't get a means of fast travel until around 30 hours in. The story will have you make constant trips back and forth across the region and through places you've already been just to get to the next story segment.  The game is very non-linear at times, which for the most part is alright, but there's a few times in the story where it doesn't tell you where to go next.  Usually, you have the synopsis menu to tell you exactly what happened up until this point and usually tells you where to go next, but at random points it's like *BOOM* check literally every town/area you've been to!  One of them has a new scene, but we won't tell you what one!  Have fun!\nI wasted a good few hours early on trying to figure out where to go in this game.  The problem is almost completely resolved after you get the flying vehicles since you can travel the regions in seconds, but early on especially, I'd recommend keeping a guide near you so you always know where to go next.  \n\nThe dungeon design isn't great.  I see people say that they are good but I don't know what they're smoking.  The ones that have you solve a genuine puzzle are pretty good, the one where you had to figure out the order to get the windmils spinning was one of the best.  Had me actually write notes, was a really cool time to play through that blind.  The rest of them? It's all block puzzles, pushing switches, or breaking stuff.  And oh my GOD there are so many multi-room puzzles that require you to go on one side of the dungeon for one step, go on the other side for another step, and back and forth multiple times.  Tedium is the perfect way to describe these dungeons. The one where you're in a forest and you have to do things in a VERY SPECIFIC ORDER across the entire multi-screen area to get a piece a fruit??  That mini dungeon is the absolute worst.  If you mess up even once across the dozen or more steps, it's back to square one and you have to do it all over again.  I hate crap like that, and symphonia's dungeons are FILLED with things that make you start over. Around 30 hours into the game I just said screw it and kept an eye on a guide.  Any time I found myself in a new dungeon, I just followed it.  They are so exhausting to play through and there's so many of them, that I just wanted it to end.  You will NOT get engaging dungeon design from this game.  Have a guide up and play with it to save yourself the time and the headaches.\n\nOverall, would I recommend this game?  Yeah I say I would.  As I said, this was my first tales game, and even though it was rough around the edges, it got me interested enough to give the later games a go though.  I may have wrote an entire novel of my thoughts of the negative aspects of the game, but don't get me wrong, I liked this game more than I disliked it.  I think for the most part it still holds up today.  I don't even really like JRPGs that much so the fact I could play this all the way through without dropping speaks to its quality, I feel.  Give it a shot if you're in the mood for a good action rpg.

It might not be the kind of masterpiece I thought it would be after what I heard from my friend who told me to play it, but it's fun to play and really entertaining. And the story is really good, even if it goes the path of the typical JRPG. There might be some things that are annoying at times, like slowly moving platforms or a menu that isn't exactly beginnerfriendly, but that are things you can close an eye on.\n\nBut the question is, if I would recommend this game and that is a no. Well, it is a yes, but not for this version. If you have the chance, play another version of the game instead of this.\nThis is not the worst port of a game that exists and it's not unplayable either, but it's poorly made at some points. There are annoying bugs and one of them almost made me quit in the middle of the game. You can get stuck between NPCs and if you aren't lucky to get out somehow, you'll have to reload from your last savepoint, no matter how long you have played since then. There is also a point where you might softlock yourself if you can't equip a certain quality of life ability anymore. Also, for those who want to enjoy the story, at some times text just gets to places where it shouldn't be and takes away the text that should be there (and you might never know what text should've been there).\nThe worst thing though is about an item you'll need for many things that suddenly has so much delay that it becomes almost unuseable and so makes a lot of stuff way harder than it is intended to be. So you have the choice of learn to control the delay or only use it if it's absolutely required.\n\nSo, to conclude: Really nice game, so I'm sad for the negative review, but this port sadly didn't really leave me a choice there.

That aside, let's talk Tales.\n    There are A LOT of games in this series.  Out of all of the games, this one is MY favorite.  In the Tales series, I think it's all about which game resonates with you more.  This one happens to be the one for me.\n    The story is typical anime and fantasy fare, but it's done well with plenty of plot twists and character development (for a 50-70 hour game).  It's told with a combination of text, voice, anime cgi, and engine- rendered cut scenes.  It looks great for it's time.\n    The battle system is hack and slash with RPG elements infused.  You'll run into monsters and start combat.  At that point, you push the A to attack and then the directional buttons plus B to carry out special movies linked to specific buttons which you assign.   Special moves can chain if you have the right skills. A lv1 skill links to lv 2 which can link to lv 3.  You also have a limit-type gauge which when filled will allow you to carry out party combos.  If you use the right skills in the right order, you can execute powerful party attacks.  It's fun to figure them all out.\n    Compared to the newer Tales, the combat is fairly primitive and slow, but it's still fun to play with.  There are titles to learn which increase your leveling stats and EX gems (three slots per character) which can allow a little bit more customization.  The party controls themselves and you can set tactics for them; however, the options are limited compared to newer games in the series.\n    The dungeon design in this game is great.  They are just the right length and I love the puzzle elements.  I think the dungeon design is better than Vesperia, Xellia, Zesteria, Abyss, and Beseria.  Graces compares to it very well, but IMO, it's the only other one with such well designed dungeons.\n    Though old, it's a good entry in the series.  If you like JRPGs, this one is worthy of your time.  It packs 50-70 hours of gameplay, and it has solid story, systems and pacing.", "timestamp_created": 1624496185, "timestamp_updated": 1624496185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94189548": {"recommendationid": "94189548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244313794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17278, "last_played": 1624651401}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1624400986, "timestamp_updated": 1624400986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94147283": {"recommendationid": "94147283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880551720", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1644812521}, "language": "english", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1624335806, "timestamp_updated": 1624335806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460854470729827881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94144223": {"recommendationid": "94144223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120744042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1693060036}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game.

So to shakes things up, lets start with the bad. \n\nGRAPHICS, STORY and BLOCKS. To go into detail, there are moments when the facial shading just doesn't match the surrounding lighting. Story is pretty solid, but it falls for the same trap in most JRPGs and anime. It wasn't so bad at the start, but near the end, the whole world would be falling apart but EVERYONE in the game will have time to say their piece of mind. Lastly, block puzzles. They're interesting when they decide to work. But when they don't, MY GOD I WANT TO .... \n\nBut if you can ignore these problems, the game works fine. Combat was pure bliss. You can be hands on or just auto-pilot like I did. Music worked well with the story, and just generally good. It's no square enix level epic but the BGM does have it's moments. That takes us to the next point; by far the strongest reason that kept me hooked. Very strong character development occurs throughout the game. With a cast of lovable (and hate-able) characters, there's sure one for everyone to latch onto. Sadly not all villains get their own backstory or revelations, but somehow, i didn't mind. This leads me to the second strongest point for Symphonia and any RPG tbh, character influence. How each character and the story develop along with each other and the rest of the world. A good example is the city of Luin. Without spoiling too much, your characters will remark on how they (implying you as the player) helped the town through the good and bad times. \n\nOn a last note, probably a more neutral point, are the mini games. They vary in terms of fun, with some just weird random. It's not that they seem lazy, but I think they're going for the Yakuza games style of kooky. \n\nIn summary, I personally enjoyed almost every minute of playing this game.

If you do not have nostalgia for it, I don't think there's any reason to go back to this one.\n\nStory:\nPeople talk about the story and characters in this game, but after about 20 hours I just could not make myself care about either. The story feels incredibly generic. The world is bland and uninteresting. The villains are boring and not particularly threatening. You're escorting \"the chosen one\" on her quest to unlock various magical seals and regenerate the world. She accepts her role as sacrificial savior of humanity with a smile.  There are some bad people (or elves?) who enslave humans for.... reasons. The story feels like FFX if you excised everything from FFX that gave it any character or sense of place. Maybe this is one of those games that \"only gets good after 40 hours\" but who has the time for that? If a game can't get you to feel the slightest invested in the first 20 hours, it is not worth your time.\n\nCharacters:\nIt's hard not to compare this game to FFX. Even though FFX' characters were also mostly tropey archetypes and kinda annoying, Symphonia's characters all somehow manage to feel like even worse knockoffs. The main character, Lloyd's, defining trait is that he's dumb. Colette is the Yuna analogue. Her character is \"good.\" That does not mean she is a good character. Rather her entire personality can be summed up in one word. \"Good.\" (and maybe \"innocent/naive\"?). There's an Auron analogue who's the story's stoic warrior type but... more boring. Other characters... exist. Again, maybe I need to put in another 15-20 hours before any of these characters start to even hint at any sort of an arc, but there are other games to be played.\n\nMechanics:\nI don't particularly care for the combat system in this game. Battles are very repetitive, and even the early boss battles feel pretty dull. You control one character and have some limited ability to set the three other characters' strategy. The control of your character is a bit wonky and the battles just don't feel satisfying or fun. You just spam the same basic attacks, while your allies may or may not help you, until the enemy dies.\n\nThe game does an absolutely TERRIBLE job of making you feel any sense of progression. It's never clear what your character gains from a level up. You do not find interesting equipment or upgrades in the world. There's no joy in exploring the world. There's an entirely pointless equipment upgrade \"system\" that serves no apparent purpose other than forcing you to interact with two NPCs in each town instead of one. As far as I can tell, the ONLY control you have over your characters' growth is what title you choose to give them, with different titles being unlocked by completing certain tasks.\nFighting generic enemies after 20 hours feels the same as the first generic encounters. Fighting bosses feels the same as fighting generic enemies except the battle lasts longer.\n\nStyle:\nThis game has not aged well. The art style is bad and really contributes in a negative way to everything said above. It's hard to take the characters seriously when they look so ...childish. This is especially true of villains who all just look like goofy bobble-head dolls. \nIt's hard to take the story seriously when every dramatic moment is totally undercut by the lack of art direction. The game renders cutscenes in engine, but the game engine is totally inadequate for recreating any scene meant to have either action or emotion. \nAlthough the game sort of flirts with a cartoon style, it fails to hit the timeless look that games like Windwaker acheived. Instead, Symphonia's visuals are just the worst of early 2000s 3d. Dull blocky environments.

TSFix improves things but if low frame rates bother you then this may be very unappealing.\nPerhaps that's a limitation of being an old GameCube game.\n-Drawn out gimmick dungeons help diversify your treks, but get tiresome after a while\n-Romance options have no tangible effect on the ending\n-In terms of storytelling it's great to have an anti-discrimination theme, but the writers seemed to lack a deeper understanding of how discrimination works and how it affects people in a society. This makes it lack the amount of depth that could've really helped bring more weight to the overall plot being told.\n-Character designs are cool, but everyone in-game suffers a bit from Bobblehead syndrome\n-Synopsis pointers to the next goal aren't always quite intuitive\n-In the initial stretch on a first playthrough, it's entirely possible to spend hours not knowing where you're supposed to go\n-Some of the character writing can be a bit naff, especially with characters like Regal.\n-In combat sometimes your movement input can seem a bit too heavy and delayed, such as pressing the block button but it not reacting soon enough. Combining that with getting stunlocked can lead to awkward situations.\n\nOverall I'd say the initial hours were the longest for me, to the point it took me years to actually start getting somewhere.\nAnd I think that's a shame, because it can be a real turnoff that causes most people to quit and move on to other games, as even I did.\nIn the end, though, as I progressed further into the story and got to know the characters, it really opened up more.\n\nThis game could have been much, much stronger than its hyped reputation would suggest.\nIt's not...BAD, but a lot could've been done to improve the pace of the initial sections of the game and make everything flow together more nicely as a whole experience.\n\nThis just makes me wonder why games like Tales of Eternia or Tales of Phantasia never made their way to Steam as remasters instead, because this is just not up to that level of engagement.", "timestamp_created": 1622366840, "timestamp_updated": 1622495308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544904947280883789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92808628": {"recommendationid": "92808628", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124645942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 227, "last_played": 1623365672}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't stop the gain train in this one, 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1622305690, "timestamp_updated": 1622305690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92747021": {"recommendationid": "92747021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987180063", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2094, "last_played": 1622231779}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game on the Gamecube back in the day.

The enemies move and attack on a 3D plane. This is dumb as hell and makes it really easy to get hit-stun combo'd for large portions of your HP.  Doesn't help that your attacks are slow and clunky, really compounds the previous issue to make the combat just completely unenjoyable. I've discovered you can turn combat to full auto, which is kinda nice in that you avoid interacting with the clunky combat. But fights are on the long side for an RPG, so enabling this just means you aren't even playing half the game. Which is kind of silly and boring if you ask me.\n\nThat clunkiness just kind of extends to everything else in the game. Characters seem like clunky one-note caricatures, though admittedly I didn't see much of them in 3 hours. Combat, as mentioned, is horribly clunky. Walking around feels clunky. Exploring dungeons and solving puzzles is nearly as clunky as the combat. Everything just feels bad to play.\n\nGraphically the game isn't much to look at. I understand this is an old game, but it can't have been very impressive when it came out either. The modelling quality is what you'd find on an early PS2 game, but animated like a PS1 game. I generally don't put much emphasis on visuals, but this comes from that dark time when 3D sucked but nobody made 2D games because they were \"outdated\" even though they looked better.", "timestamp_created": 1621824151, "timestamp_updated": 1622174148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92476826": {"recommendationid": "92476826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305311414", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1657946172}, "language": "english", "review": "very good story as i am only 3 hours in game", "timestamp_created": 1621787150, "timestamp_updated": 1621787150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92428144": {"recommendationid": "92428144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069979154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11076, "last_played": 1661260843}, "language": "english", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u597d\u73a9\u7684 \u4ef7\u683c\u662f\u504f\u8d35\u7684 \u7d22\u5c3c\u662f\u53f8\u9a6c\u7684\n\u8bf7\u5956\u52b1\u8fd9\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u5dee2000\u70b9\u53bb\u4e70\u90a3\u4e9b\u9a9a\u903c\u5934\u50cf\u548c\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7ed9\u6211\u70b9\u8d5e\u725b\u5b50\u7cbe\u7075\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u589e\u957f1cm\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u6211\u7684\u4eba\u725b\u5b50\u589e\u957f10cm\uff0c\u8c01\u4f1a\u4e0d\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u6839\u957f\u94a2\u7b4b\u5462\uff1f\nPlease reward this comment.

[/h1]\n\nI'll start off by saying, I have owned multiple copies of this game on Game Cube, once on the PS3, and now on Steam. It's been one of my all time favorites since I first played it on Game Cube. I was very used to playing with a controller, but switching over to the PC wasn't bad at all! Some of the controls are a bit wonky, but that's just because of muscle memory and having to adjust to using a mouse and keyboard. \n\nIf you enjoy heavily story based games, you will definitely want to try this one out. The story is very well done, and all of the characters have their own unique personalities and quirks. The graphics are pretty great for the year this originally came out, and the sound is all great too. \n\nThe game also allows you to customize your menu settings. You can change the color and the opacity of menu boxes, speech boxes, and enemy speech boxes. This I feel comes in handy if you want to color code things, or have a nice clean and sleek look to your game. You can adjust the speed at which the written text on their speech boxes appear as well.\n\nIt's a long game (originally two discs), but is easily replayable over and over again. There is an alternative ending, which is based on a specific choice you get to make later in the game. If you're looking to speed-run the game and avoid most side-missions, you're looking at around 15-22 hours. If you want to take your time with it, you can easily sink 72+ hours into the game. \n\nAll in all, I have replayed this game from start to finish dozens, if not hundreds of times, and have yet to be bored of it!\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you enjoy long, story-based games with a fantasy aspect, you'll definite enjoy this one!\n", "timestamp_created": 1620109866, "timestamp_updated": 1620109866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562021434307098389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91388896": {"recommendationid": "91388896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024023015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4134, "last_played": 1620141859}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.", "timestamp_created": 1620093579, "timestamp_updated": 1620093579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91382567": {"recommendationid": "91382567", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994424255", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5041, "last_played": 1620542250}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1620083105, "timestamp_updated": 1620083105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550468921661376953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91362064": {"recommendationid": "91362064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210459383", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1630266549}, "language": "english", "review": "As a kid I traded my copy to a friend for Super Monkey Ball.

I used to play it a TON on the GameCube. That said, I don't want to make it seem that I think this game is perfect. It isn't. While the plot starts off right away, it is slow going in the beginning as you learn the mechanics and what-have-you. Although it doesn't feel like it is dragging, the plot is very cliche and was at the time of it's release. \n\nIn my opinion, some of the characters aren't all that great either and and as you go through the plot, some things just don't make sense in the large scheme of things. There's a LOT of pushing to justify some the plot and characters. I don't want to make it seem like I hate the characters. The ones in your group are great and they have great story lines. It's just a lot of the \"extended\" relationships that have a lot of pushing and I find I don't care too much for the characters that are there for a single plot point. They're very forgettable. Plus some of the things done to make some of the characters seem mysterious just make them look incompetent.\n\nI do want to mention that I have a great time playing the fights in this game. There is a lot of button mashing, but it is still fun. Also I like the dungeons in this game too. There are several puzzles to solve, which is something that is really lacking in the newer Tales games. \n\nThere's also a bunch of fun stuff to do on the side. So the game does not have a linear feel to it. There is a lot of exploring to do and items/places to unlock. You can get some good optional gear this way as you take part in some of the side quests. \n\nReplay value for this game is extremely high. While you do get the same ending every time, your relationship value with your party members can slightly change the path to that ending. It can affect who remains on your party and which part of their story you will uncover. This gives the opportunity for new titles and total completion. You will not have 100% completion your first play though.\n\nAll said, I think it is a great game to pass the time with.", "timestamp_created": 1619304553, "timestamp_updated": 1619304839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504999995231628418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90851525": {"recommendationid": "90851525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803798650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1617426511}, "language": "english", "review": "Short version: Boring and grindy.\n\nStory worked alright, but it wasn't very compelling; the characters felt one-dimensional and I frankly just didn't care about them; the battle system felt really clunky, awkward, and unresponsive.

Either way, it's bad and it keeps me completely detached from the story.\n- unvoiced skits\n- unskippable cutscenes (which is quite bad since watching that horrible dialogue play again after failing a boss is atrocious)\n- locked 30 FPS\n- clunky controls on large map\n\nAfter finishing Vesperia (4 times and my personal favourite), Zestiria and Berseria and after playing more than half of Graces f and Xillia, I think that this one is praised because of nostalgia.

Over the years I have beaten the original GameCube title at least 10 times. It's an endearing, and enduring classic.\n\nEven when playing the game when it was new, I did roll my eyes a lot at the dialogue and story, with all its cliches and melodrama. Whilst a certain overly-dramatic script is a feature of many JRPGs, so that perhaps to others [i]Symphonia[/i] doesn't seem particularly noteworthy in that regard, I was still a relative novice to the genre in 2005, and coming off the more down-to-earth style of [i]Skies of Arcadia Legends[/i], I couldn't help but be frustrated by a lot of the dialogue and characters. On the other hand, not liking certain characters doesn't mean they're badly written, and in fact they're all well-rounded, it's just that the somewhat angsty and juvenile tone can be a bit irritating. Its heart is in the right place, however.\n\nThat aside, none of this really stops the game from being consistently fun. I think the biggest factor in my constantly coming back to it is the real-time battle system, which makes fighting even basic enemies an engaging experience rather than the chore it tends to be in turn-based games. The care shown by the development team for this system is perhaps best shown by the fact that every enemy in the game has a host of unique animations, including for when they're stunned: zombies clutch at their heads, for example, while sewer rats perform cute pirouettes. There are hundreds of moves, or techs, to learn, and every party member is able to be player controlled, though the protagonist Lloyd is by far the easiest to handle. I always look forward especially to the boss fights, particularly those against the more humanoid foes, like the Desian Grand Cardinals.\n\nThe Steam version of this game is based off the Playstation 3 version, which adds a lot from the original GameCube that I grew up with. I appreciated the extra costumes, the faster pace of skits, and of course the chance of playing the game in widescreen, which allowed me to notice details I had never picked up on before. I did miss the original artwork for items and weapons and such, and they have added a largely unnecessary bit of padding to the plot, but on the whole I think the changes and updates were positive. \n\nThis is a huge game and it's impossible to cover even a small part of all its depth and complexity. Suffice to say it's one of the best JRPGs of the last twenty years and certainly value for money for what you get. To see everything in the game would technically take 8 playthroughs (getting all achievements requires 5)! I love the music and playing it again always brings back fond memories.

El juego LO RECOMIEDO, lo que no recomiendo es esta versi\u00f3n ni los de PS 2 o 3 por lo que he visto, lo mejor es jugar en su consola original o en la Wii a d\u00eda de hoy en una pantalla CRT (estando en el 2021, manda narices...).", "timestamp_created": 1613575639, "timestamp_updated": 1613575639, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86761676": {"recommendationid": "86761676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198835058741", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1697339835}, "language": "spanish", "review": "GRAN JUEGO RPG", "timestamp_created": 1613442112, "timestamp_updated": 1613442112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86712142": {"recommendationid": "86712142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018080877", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1485713557}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is bad.

This is to this day, in my opinion, the BEST of the \"Tales of\" games and I can tell you why I think that is.\nStory: So Tales of has always had some influence from Norse mythology but this game has THE Norse mythology story. This is like an anime video game love letter to it. The creator of Symphonia brought together all he had researched and put it into this game with his own twist. So of course the story is GREAT. His own ideas elevate the game to the next level. The story is unforgettable. The game goes on way longer than you'd initially think and this is one of the longer games in the series. The first time took me 44 hours and there is more content past that I did later playthroughs.\nGameplay: A lot of the other Tales of games have the same sort of formula for gameplay but this one is a step above them I think. The first time I played through this game I skimmed through a lot of the mechanics without knowing that they went deeper. I died A LOT on my first playthrough but I could still manage to barely get through bosses using all my life bottles and gels and it was a lot of fun. Then I played through it again when I was older and realized just how deep the mechanics went, this time I destroyed bosses and optimized my ex-skills and it was fun in a whole new way. This way of letting people figure the game out at their own pace and learn to play it better the next time is something the other Tales of games don't do as much, their mechanics are easy to grasp and built into how you progress way more so than in this one. The fights in this game are also a lot of fun with the ability to use every character who joins your party and chain together creative combos like you would in a fighting game or hack n slash.\n\nReplaying this game is a joy and playing with another person is even more fun. (Should really get the GC version for the best experience. If this was 60 FPS it would be better but 30 FPS is still good.)\n\nI love this game.

I say this because I found myself various times feeling like the story was being dragged, and there is so much backtracking\n- If you find yourself during a hard time progressing in the game, you'll have to do a lot of grinding\n\nI think this is a game that aged well except for the flaws that I mentioned.", "timestamp_created": 1612013243, "timestamp_updated": 1612026268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85462216": {"recommendationid": "85462216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243201782", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5108, "last_played": 1608342940}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games of all time!

On Discrimination of people just for being born different whether it be race, sexuality, gender, religion or national origin. This game's focal point is to accept those who are different irregardless of what they might believe or be like. Even if it's something you don't like. So tolerance.\n\n 4.7/5: Narrative \n\nI find some of the characters to be 1D, and a little flat sometime. I think Lloyd for example is kinda boring, not a bad character but he feels weird sometimes. He's likely my least favourite out of the playable characters and my favourite being Collete or Presea \n\n 3.4/5 Protagonists\n\nGame play it feels dated but i do kinda like the system even if feels kinda janky sometimes. Some of the characters are really hard to play as if not done right. but if you can master combos it's pretty fun \n\n3/5 game play \n\nThe villians can be rather interesting the main villian is just more tragic than anything else. and the more supporting antagonists are just your standard supervillains. Powerful but stupid, smart but cold, cunning and spiteful, ruthless and lacking in empathy, and total psychopathic. \n3.5/5\n\n\nGraphics are very dated if they were the graphics from the cut scenes it would be even better. but i kinda like the anime/cartoony style \ngraphics 2.5/5\n\n\n\n\nEdited Jul. 22. 2023", "timestamp_created": 1611256953, "timestamp_updated": 1690083079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85067447": {"recommendationid": "85067447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258905098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 22486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7031, "last_played": 1630777277}, "language": "english", "review": "This is straight up one of the best JRPGs I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1611200640, "timestamp_updated": 1611200640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85017352": {"recommendationid": "85017352", "author": {"steamid": "76561199064322516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 19887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19201, "last_played": 1697423509}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buenardo", "timestamp_created": 1611125147, "timestamp_updated": 1680773079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85016200": {"recommendationid": "85016200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391242761", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 12488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2341, "last_played": 1685324322}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Aun no has jugado tales of symphonia? a que esperas!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1611122820, "timestamp_updated": 1611122820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84953033": {"recommendationid": "84953033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179043094", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 722, "playtime_at_review": 1610, "last_played": 1700192027}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game nonstop as a kid.

The graphics are a bit too cartoony, even for anime standards. The gameplay is really unique for an RPG. Like most RPGs such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, there is an overworld where you can go around and there are battles you can encounter. Unlike Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, the battles are action-oriented instead of turn-based. Keep in mind that this is the first game in the Tales series that is fully three-dimensional, even though the battles are played in a two-dimensional environment.

Upon beginning my playthrough I found that many of the important information about the game is never or only sparingly provided, so I strongly urge using a guide to ensure you are doing everything you need to. I made the mistake of entering Balacruf Mausoleum too early and am now forced to grind up 8 levels to be on par with the area's boss. If you are interested in playing this game, I would recommend trying the remastered PS3 version or trying another game in the series.

Most of it good, but when I actually went to play the game it didn't live up to expectations. It has a good battle system and an interesting story (though the length of the story is a bit loo long) but other than that it has too many problems for me to recommend.\n\nFirstly I should say the game is LONG. As in a single playthrough took me 70+ hours!!! Now it's fine if games take that long to complete, but the main story should not take that long. For the record I actually do like story, but after awhile it just drags and you start to wonder when is it gonna end. I didn't even go after that many optional things. (at least I don't think I did as I played it blind) But yeah the game takes a long time to finish. RPG's are known for having long play times but that's usually  when you take into account optional stuff and side quests. The main story should not take that long to finish. As a working adult, who has limited time to game, I want to play a game, finish it, and move onto other ones. If I like it maybe i'll come back and replay it (especially if it has either multiple endings or different classes to play as) I don't want to spend 70 hours on one game just to finish. If I spend 70+ hours on a game it should be because I had FUN playing it and want to keep playing it. \n\nSecondly the Tech and Upgrade system is a bit flawed. The game tells you there's a difference between T and S Skills and that different gems have different skills you can learn, but you'll probably need a guide to figure out how to get some of the better skills. I kept leveling up and using the techniques and I swear I wasn't able to get some of the better ones. I really wanted to Zelos to learn some new skills, but I must have been doing something wrong because he never seemed to learn any better magic skills. I eventually tried looking up a guide to help me but even that didn't really answer all my questions. So yeah I don't like the tech system for learning new techs, felt like there could have been some work there. \n\nFinally there's the upgrade (or sythesis) system. It uses a similar one to FFIX where you need to use old weapons and armor and fuse them to make new one. I'm not very fond of that system as sometimes you need to buy more than one weapon or armor to make it work, but also there is an instance in the game where a certain town is destroyed and you needed armor from that town in order to fuse a better armor later......Oopps guess I should have known that town was going to be destroyed and i wasn't going to be able to go back and get the armor  I need for a better fusion later, boy am I an idiot.... So yeah needless to say I don't much like the upgrade system in this game either\n\nAll in all I think you would be better served playing a different RPG. I'd recommend FFX, Mass Effect, or Chorno Trigger (all of which are available on STEAM) before I recommend this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1606252938, "timestamp_updated": 1606252938, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396840155124664307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79762489": {"recommendationid": "79762489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821619279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 4954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4954, "last_played": 1606236396}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game with very good story. \n\nMy only gripe is there is not a clear info where to find all side quests or all optional bosses.

I'm not going to go over pros and cons and explain why I think it's a good game, I'm obviously biased in that regard, but I do want to talk about the quality of this port. I have played every version of this game multiple times on all of the consoles it was released on minus the PS2 version because I don't have a Japanese PS2 nor do I read Japanese. That being said, the PC port is by far the version of the game that I prefer the most since it is the most accessible if you game primarily on Steam, as well as having all of the added content that wasn't in the original GameCube release. While it obviously isn't perfect by any means, I wanted to put my opinion out in the open since I consistently see people complaining about this port in their reviews. Since it was released, I have never once had any sort of issue with this port even after all of the time that I've put into it. The only odd thing that I've noticed with it is that during an important cutscene for two of the party members, some of the audio files and lines of text don't match up with how they're supposed to but that is the only time it happens in the entire game. While it's a bit confusing at first, it's certainly not game breaking in the slightest. The 30 FPS cap also doesn't have much of an impact on gameplay either since battles still feel really smooth even with the cap in place.

This makes it easy to do precise combos and work special cancels and other high level techniques into your repertoire.

So conflicted feelings on this game. Part of me liked this one the best of all the Tales games I have finished so far. But I feel something's missing here. Let's open this up a bit.\n\nFirst of all, this game is old so I'm not gonna go to details about the graphics. You can tweak the resolution up but the game is way too blurry and mushy to look at in the end. A full on remaster would do the trick and just sharpen up the textures and models. Oh well, can't have it all. The game itself if bright and colorful and has nice animation. Nothing bad to say about that.\n\nThe sound. Hm. Best music of all the Tales games in my opinion. Very nice melodies overall. But the damn sound effects ruin this department. I had to put the volume from 100% to around 10%. But some of the sound effects were still at 100% volume so in some areas wind/sound of water/some misc sounds here and there just damaged my eardrums and you couldn't do anything about that. Kinda annoying. Did they test this  game before they launched it? ..I doubt it.\n\nControls are good and responsive. And the tech system is fun to use and is solid overall. Nothing bad to say about it. \n\n*SPOILERY THINGS AHEAD ABOUT THE STORY*\n\nThe story.. well. Here I gotta say that this game lacks a bit in this department. Some of the characters were fleshed out more than the others. The game had some heart wrenching moments with Colette losing parts of herself but POOF, she got better way too fast. Raine and Genis didn't really have a good character arc after the being a half-elf and it making some other half-elves miserable. They didn't really have a reason to be so cross about it because they didn't really grow up in that environment after a while. Sheenas arc was good one. But I really wanted some more tension between her and the SO GODDAMN AWFUL protagonist who was so dense about everything. I think they made the best pairing from the bunch. It just lacked something. Preseas arc was another sad and emotional one. I really liked that but it could have been tied more to the Colettes arc better. I thought they were too similar in the end. Zelos was kinda ...boring. actually. He didn't really have and arc if you didn't pay attention to the Kratos/Zelos affection choice. Yeah there was a awful affection point system going during the game that chooses your \"soulmate\" or something. I chose Sheena on my playthrough and I really wanted to see how their relationship could go. But HOLY BALLS the ending was awful on that department. It closely related to Mass Effect 3 ending where the choice didn't really matter besides one character was shown in the very end with the protagonist. \nAbout the protagonist. I think he was one the most boring characters ever made. I think he is the worst main character in the Tales series. He's dense and doesn't really bring anything to the table. He's the everyman, a swordwielder, magic sword blah blah. He's so dense to boot so there was no chemistry at all with any of the other characters. Well. I suppose he's made to represent a blank slate to the player. I liked Tales of Vesperia protagonist more with some more witty dialogue and such. \n\nOverall, the length of the game was around 70 our on my first (and only I suppose) playthrough. The game drags itself quite a bit at times but it doesn't get monotonic enough to be annoying. The puzzles were fun at times and dungeons didn't drag themselves too much. I think the game is just a lengthy sort of game. Lots of dialogue and skits to watch, things to do and side quests to explore. \n\nFor a Tales game, there are better ones, for a RPG itself it's fun enough to play, as a story it's confusing at times and the characters lack a bit of Flash and Pizazz but they serve their purpose at times.

I am not at all disappointed, while many aspects of the game remind me of early Final Fantasy games in the items and way the story is done, the combat system is a refreshing and unique system that I've never seen in any RPG that I've played. The game doesn't do very well at informing you of some of the things, or I missed it when they mentioned it, because I was like level 20 or so before I realized that I could switch my character's titles for bonus stat growth at level up.\n\nWhile the entertaining and challanging battle system makes the game really fun to play, the level of customization, though limited to a degree, allows you to set your character up the way you want them. I haven't made it very far in the game, but playing on Hard battle rank lives up to the term. I have found myself having to do heavy leveling just to manage some of the enemy groups in the game. The difficulty is intense in the beginning due to the level of learning required to get familiar with the battle system, but makes for a fun and epic battle compared to the turn based battle systems I was used to in the older Final Fantasy series.\n\nAfter having beat the game three times now, I have to say that this game is really a welcomed find. The quality of the port seems lazy and partially broken, but more than fine to still enjoy the game. I have to say the sound levels are one of the biggest issues; moreover, anytime you are near something constant like a waterfall, the sound level is so loud. You can adjust the sound level of special effects, but in doing so, make other things so quiet that there is really no fix to these high volume levels. One other complaint is for achivement hunters, one of the all title-based achivements is broken. Fortunatly there is a mod here on steam that you can use to allow it to unlock. I didn't continue to use the mod afterwards, but at least there is that option to get the achivement you earned. My last complaint is that for all achievements, you are required to play through the game four or five times. While I love the option for new game +, this causes the game to become very tiresome.\n\nAll in all the game is a very enjoyable experience, this port is not the difinitive version of the game based on what I've read; however, while it feels to be a lazy port, the game is still very playable and fun. I wish developers would stop tying achivements to multiple playthroughs and instead just include a new game + feature for those that want to make multiple runs through the game. I have to say the new game + grade shop options compensate to some degree for the additional runs by taking some of the extra work out of the next run.

The past brave saved the world but hasn't saved the negative desires from human hearts until now. And now, the world is facing another huge crisis. How do Lloyd and his companions face to understand both huge problems and find their way to solve them? This is the main highlight of the story. Following the fantastic story, you'll deeply dig out the sad past of each character, understand their values, and have your own reflection about the theme that the game is aimed to express. I believe that you will enjoy the story of the game if you are a fan of JRPG.\nThe music directed by Mr. Motoi Sakuraba is really satisfying perfect work. The beautiful tones show the broad and relaxing scenes of both Sylvarant and Tethe'ella, the tense rhythms for battle mention the difficulty of the battles not only for monsters but also for the Bosses. The BGMs in the four temples of Spirits and Derris Kharlan are very holy and serious, in order to show the greatness of the ancient power and the contributions of ancient heroes. Play the game will not only make you enjoy the story but also let you fall in love with the music produced by Mr. Sakuraba.\nAt last, as a Chinese player, I strongly recommend my compatriot fans of JRPG to buy this game.

Unfortunately, the game never quite lives up to the high stakes it sets up, and the middle sags quite a bit. The plot twists and sprains its way to form an epic (though at times unfocussed and underexplained) tale of friendship, sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal, starring a cast of lovable, memorable and well-realized anime people (and Regal and Presea...), all with some of the best designs you'll ever see.\n\nThe gameplay is also still a lot of fun. It's less smooth and action-heavy than later games in the series, and the main protagonist is basically the only one who's actually genuinely fun to play without learning how, but the combat is still enjoyable and addictive. If you've never played a JRPG before and you're turned off by turn-based combat, this may win you over... Or I'm just old and this game actually handles like arse to anyone under 25...\nThe game is often quite non-linear with a ton of interesting (and easily-missable) side content, which was great back in the day, but is actually a huge pain nowadays. If you're any sort of completionist, or if you only want to play it once, you may suffer. It's full of all sorts of random extra stuff to find.\n\nyeah, it's kinda old and the voice acting has a strong \"budget DVD by ADV films\" energy to it, but it's still great.

I don't even remember why did I get it but it was in my library for years. Tried to play it a few times but the combat system instantly turned me off. Just didn't really click for me. But this week I finally started the game with a mindset that I finish it no matter what... and it was a good decision! It's a really really good game. I admit I still didn't really like the battle system but this time I did something differently. I've played the whole game through with auto-battles! And yes it works, and it was fun. There is a bit difficulty jump around the first real story boss but after that the game is much easier (as long as you still fighting random mobs so you level up + \u00a0you keep up with getting gear upgrades). In the end before the final boss I was level 65-67 with all my party members https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1656720389304029449/4A5D371510196D0156010897477CCCA6EC203FF3/ (not sure that's high or low but didn't have a problem)\n\nI really liked the story, the characters, and the world. Had really strong Final Fantasy vibes when playing the game. Can't really say anything without the spoilers but the story is actually engaging and good, maybe a bit too long for its own good but that's not a big problem. It just takes time before it picks up and starting making sense more or less. Maybe that would be my biggest criticism that sometimes the story is all over the place. Not story complicated per se just complicated because it takes itself complicated. Hard to describe that but with a different pacing the story telling could have been good. But that's still a little thing compared to the whole of the game. So yeah it was a blast and now I'll play the other 3 Tales games too that are available here on Steam.\n\nI can highly recommend the game if you want to play a good JRPG. I'm pretty sure the battle system makes or breaks the game for a lot people but as I said above try the auto-battle mode, it's still not easy you just play on a different mode (imagine kinda like how Final Fantasy XIII worked, which I really liked). One problem I encountered: if controller vibration is enabled (and you play with a controller) there are heavy FPS drops, into the single digit territory, in some scenes. Just disable vibration and everything is fixed.\n\nIf you need a good spoiler free 100% guide then arguably this is the best choice https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/gamecube/561316-tales-of-symphonia/faqs/42708\n\nAnd this is the Ex skills guide I've looked up sometimes https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps3/765388-tales-of-symphonia/faqs/61238", "timestamp_created": 1602178517, "timestamp_updated": 1602178604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77229151": {"recommendationid": "77229151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008966025", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3420, "last_played": 1533870016}, "language": "english", "review": "The battle system is amusing, but man is the writing juvenile and cringy", "timestamp_created": 1602162944, "timestamp_updated": 1602162944, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77221986": {"recommendationid": "77221986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066792143", "num_games_owned": 1367, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1593063757}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an old game, originally released in 2003.

lugares del mismo. Sin embargo, las guerras y las disputas acabaron por agotar el man\u00e1 del mundo, hasta el punto en que casi lo destruyen. El gran h\u00e9roe de guerra Mithos se sacrific\u00f3 para dar al mundo una oportunidad m\u00e1s, y esa leyenda ha pasado de generaci\u00f3n en generaci\u00f3n hasta hoy. Tales of Symphonia es un JRPG  en el que te embarcar\u00e1s en la aventura de Lloyd, un chico un tanto terco pero siendo un trozo de pan, donde acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 a su amiga de la infancia Colette en la misi\u00f3n de restaurar el man\u00e1 del mundo. En su viaje se encontrar\u00e1n con m\u00e1s personajes que les ayudar\u00e1n y, a su vez, te dejar\u00e1 entrever que no todo es tan bonito como los gr\u00e1ficos lo indican en un principio. \n\nEste juego te muestra facetas muy crudas de la vida, c\u00f3mo el racismo puede afectar hasta niveles insospechados a los personajes; te mostrar\u00e1 escenas bastante crueles y algunas incluso te dar\u00e1n repel\u00fas por lo que conllevan. Esto no hace m\u00e1s que a\u00f1adir a la aventura el toque de querer seguir jugando y de ver c\u00f3mo se desarrollan los acontecimientos. Yo destacar\u00eda este punto como una de las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s fuertes del juego, ya que ayudan a que creas en la historia y en lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo en el mundo.\n\nMezcla de fantas\u00eda, aventura, comedia, tragedia y momentos de suspense, este juego apuesta por una historia bastante larga pero bien contada. A trav\u00e9s de las conversaciones que saldr\u00e1n entre los componentes del grupo, Tales of Symphonia te aporta una aventura rica en detalles.\n\nEn cuanto a los gr\u00e1ficos, nos encontramos ante un juego que se estren\u00f3 en la GameCube, y muchos sprites siempre repetir\u00e1n una acci\u00f3n establecida y eso ser\u00e1 lo que veas, pero los gr\u00e1ficos no es algo que yo tenga mucho en cuenta a la hora de hacer una rese\u00f1a porque lo que importa es c\u00f3mo te lo cuentan todo. Este juego no se restringe por eso, y los combates est\u00e1n llenos de movimiento, magia, detalles y al principio me encontraba un poco perdido en mitad de tanto caos. Sin embargo, uno se acostumbra a verlo todo en pantalla.\n\nEn cuanto al apartado musical, yo dir\u00eda que est\u00e1 bien. Tiene algunos temas musicales bastante destacables y otros menos. \n\nTenemos un juego bastante entretenido: tienes mil cosas que hacer, con algunas rutas que cambiar\u00e1n dependiendo de qu\u00e9 decidas o de c\u00f3mo hagas las cosas, los personajes tienen su sistema de afinidad (el cual debo decir que apenas entend\u00ed porque supuestamente los trat\u00e9 de la peor manera posible cuando yo ve\u00eda que se llevaban bien con el protagonista) pero tengo entendido que se nota poco esto \u00faltimo. Tienes muchas submisiones ocultas, y esto puede llevar a confusiones porque, si llegas a determinado punto de la historia, tal vez esa submisi\u00f3n se pierda si no la has hecho antes. Ergo, o conoces lo que hay en cada zona y cu\u00e1ndo ir, o posiblemente te saltes alguna cosa (como me pas\u00f3 a m\u00ed). Aparte de eso, tendr\u00e1s enemigos poderosos, un sistema de mejora de armas y armaduras, la posibilidad de cocinar para el grupo tras cada combate...hay mucho por hacer en este juego.\n\nEn resumen, estando lo barato que est\u00e1 (a m\u00ed me cost\u00f3 3 euros), me pas\u00e9 mi primera partida en 51 horas, sin realmente pararme en mucha cosa, y explorando lo que me apetec\u00eda. Es un juego bastante largo; muy rejugable, ya que al acabar una partida puedes canjear una cosa llamada rango (lo vas obteniendo tras cada combate) para transferirte x cualidades, equipo, etc, a tu \"New Game+\" y para poder hacer cosas que quiz\u00e1s te saltaste en tu anterior partida o tirar por otra ruta. Recomiendo este juego para aquellos que quieran estar entretenidos muucho tiempo en un JRPG con una historia interesante, buena y que a veces, te deje pensando en los eventos del mundo de Sylvarant.", "timestamp_created": 1600002345, "timestamp_updated": 1600002345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535483837127685547", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75888850": {"recommendationid": "75888850", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073867196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1262, "last_played": 1603001859}, "language": "english", "review": "its good", "timestamp_created": 1599973866, "timestamp_updated": 1599973866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75789131": {"recommendationid": "75789131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069193240", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "playtime_at_review": 3419, "last_played": 1700549200}, "language": "english", "review": "Tales of Symphonia is my favourite game of all time.

Deeeeeeeeeeeep breaaaaaath. \n\nWow man, this game has divided me so much that I really don't know what to say. Actually I know what to say but it may take long and I want to cut short as much as possible. Also small note: This is my first \"Tales of\" game. I deliberately started from this game because it is the oldest \"Tales Of\" in Steam. And the other reason is that when you go from old to new games you can see lots of improvements and kinda enjoy it. If you do it reverse, you cannot stand old games and your brain kinda rejects them. It is a tactic I always try to apply.\n\nFirst thing first: I gave thumbs up because I couldn't give thumbs down to this game, my heart couldn't allow that. But believe me that [b] if Steam had allowed \"Neutral Thumb\" when reviewing (which I reaaaaly like them to add this goddamn feature), I'd most definitely used that one.[/b] Definitely no other way, no sirreee!\n\nThis game is good at some mechanics. But really bad at some other mechanics. \n\nGood things are; most of the voice actings (played English VA), really good main story, fighting mechanics (to a degree).\n\nBad things are; Outdated quest log, REAAAALY BAD story presentation, unnecessarily long game lenght bad quest mechanics etc. etc.\n\nI know that this game has come out for Gamecube but believe me I've seen so much better presentation from PS1 games. I can call myself that I do not discriminate games for their release dates but this game is so bad at presentation aspect that occasionally you find yourself saying \"What? What the hell??!\"\n\nAnd that is a really game breaker (at least for me). You cannot immerse yourself into the game because of this. Also you do not have any quest marker as well. I know that at \"synopsis\" you can see the general information but most of the time those informations are not enough as well for you to figure out what to do. Was it really hard to add at least general marker for where to go next? Apparently it was.\n\nLastly the game is unnecessarly long. I've played lots of long J-RPGS (100+ hours games) but when playing this game you really feel wrongness at some point. You feel the stall tactics clearly and I believe most of them are reaaaaly unnecessary.\n\nAt least the main story is good but because of the presentation you cannot feel enough emotions. Maybe it's me but I  couldn't immerse myself into this game. Even so, I like the companions and they all have different characters. Their voice actings are really good most of the time.\n\nI can write lots of other things but I don't want to do that. I just want to say this: \n\n[b]This game is really outdated and you need a strong patience to finish it.

Sin embargo es mejor que muchos juegos de la saga, incluyendo algunos posteriores como el abyss, el vesperia o el zestiria y posiblemente a la par que el berseria.\n\nEsto lo consigue gracias a su dise\u00f1o equilibrado, sin mec\u00e1nicas absurdas que conviertan la lucha en unilateral y con control sobre la cantidad de golpes que puede recibir el enemigo, mediante una mec\u00e1nica que tumba el enemigo y lo vuelve inmune al retroceso durante un tiempo. Esta mec\u00e1nica se perdi\u00f3 en los siguientes juegos de la saga y no fue hasta el xillia 1 que no se recuper\u00f3 (aunque el graces tiene un suced\u00e1neo de esto mediante un stat concreto, si no estas absurdamente leveado es muy dif\u00edcil hacer combo infinito a nada). El resultado es que el juego se siente bastante justo sin dejar de ser desafiante, con algunos combates realmente dif\u00edciles por su duraci\u00f3n no porque te maten a cada golpe (esto es un problema muy notable en la dificultad del vesperia, cuando tienes un sistema de combate que permite hacer combos infinitos, la \u00fanica forma de subir la dificultad es la muerte instant\u00e1nea, y en el vesperia hay mucho de eso).", "timestamp_created": 1599293926, "timestamp_updated": 1599293926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597189843654632568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75460410": {"recommendationid": "75460410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135131874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1688802846}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game on gamecube and now pc..it's a fun game...way to much talking but a fun game never the less.

The characters (maybe not Colette), the story, and the gameplay are incredibly charming and just a joy to experience, even now as an adult. With loads of sidequests, secrets, and end game content, you can easily rack up 40-80 hours on your first playthrough depending on your playstyle. \n\nIt's your standard JRPG with standard JRPG tropes in terms of plot, but the character development is so well done and there are twists and turns in the plot being thrown at you constantly. They might not be surprising twists, but there's enough of them that you'll want to keep playing to see where the road takes you next.\n\nThe battle system is riveting and, at certain difficulties, have you on the edge of your seat. Straying from turn-based battle (which I also love) and using the real time action system really makes this a unique experience to the franchise. Doing the a 10% exp. run after some vanilla ones really made the game engaging again even after a couple playthroughs, as you have to rely less on how you battle with your character as you did before, and rather rely more on organizing what the whole team is doing at all times. Speaking of characters and your team, the ability to battle as any of the 9 main party characters, even switching between them in the midst of battle, adds so much variety to how you can go about any playthrough.\n\nI do have some bias because this is an old favorite I played for the first time about 14 years ago, but I believe regardless that there is much to fall in love with in this game. I would hands down consider this a 10/10 JRPG experience and probably the best game I have ever played so far in my life.\n\nAnyway, I'm giving it a break for now, but I'm going to get those last few achievements eventually or so help me god....", "timestamp_created": 1598338556, "timestamp_updated": 1598338556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74822946": {"recommendationid": "74822946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832530739", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 262, "last_played": 1598845321}, "language": "english", "review": "if you enjoyed tales of vesperia this game is a simplified version but there is an issue if you have issues with a black than white screen and music press spacebar then enter to make a new game then press alt and enter", "timestamp_created": 1598254540, "timestamp_updated": 1598254540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74822114": {"recommendationid": "74822114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120129468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 6757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3932, "last_played": 1599968144}, "language": "english", "review": "Gameplay-wise, its OK. there's no free running mode, and mystic artes deals bad damage with annoying condition to do. combat difficulty is pretty easy as long as you don't lag too much on your level. its possible to skip grinding on Normal difficulty, but you might need some grind on Hard, or at least not skip all encounter with Sorcerer's Ring.\n\nStory wise, its awful.

It was requiring 2 CD on the gamecube back then!

All party member gets soul and love put into them.\n- Good Replay value with bonuses for fun and completionist!\n\nCons :\n- The game being kinda old, the combat system limitation didn't aged well.\n- Even though the combat system is easy to understand, it can be a bit cluncky at times.\n- The AI can be a bit terrible at times.\n\nI really can't give more cons to this game even though I've been searching for 15 minutes.\n\nWould I recommend this game to someone : YES!\nIs it worth the full price of 21.99 CAD$? : YES!

Now here are the breakdown of the game:\n\n[h1] The Pros [/h1]\n(+) [b] A Really Interesting Story [/b]\nThe game had a really slow start before the story gets good and by that, I mean a [b] REALLY [/b] slow start. The theme of the story revolves around racism and sacrifice which is the bread and butter of most JRPGs with interesting twist here and there to keep you entertained with the story. \n\n(+) [b] Tons Side-Quests [/b]\nAs per usual, tales of game have tons and I mean tons of side quest to do. Some of them are tedious to do and some actually have a pretty good story with great character development on the side. \n\nThe down side of this for me is that there are no quests indicator so either you to talk to every NPCs to find it or you read a guide for it.\n\n(+) [b] Combat Are Easy to Jump Into [/b]\nCombat are really simple and easy to understand, you either block or attack or perhaps heal from time to time. However, the part that irks me is the fact that Mystic Artes are really complicated to execute and the camera need time to get used to.\n\n(+) [b] Lovable cast of characters [/b]\n(+) [b] Very Nice Anime Cutscenes [/b]\n(+) [b] Great Soundtrack [/b]\n\n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\n(-) [b] No Skip Button [/b]\nThis is kinda sad, the closest thing you get is a text speed configuration. \n\n(-) [b] Translation Issue [/b]\nSome line of the dialog just doesn\u2019t make sense or doesn\u2019t fit with the situation. But not to the point it ruins the game experience.\n\n(-) [b] No Retry Option [/b]\nYeap you heard it right, its game over if you lose a fight. Make sure you come prepared before every boss fight.\n\n(-) [b] Random Crashes [/b]\nYea this part is the most annoying part of the whole experience, since you don\u2019t know when the game will crash and ruin your progress. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a fix for this, but make sure you save everytime you get the chance.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\nAll in all, for me this game was a really enjoyable jrpg with a great twist on the story. Now I do hear some troubling aspect of the game that some other people experienced, but thankfully I don\u2019t experience those or perhaps it was so minor that I didn\u2019t notice (I meant other from the crash issues).

It's...slow and a bit tedious. And by the start, I mean the first 20-30 hours or so.\n2) Walking on the map sucks.\n3) I ended up using a keyboard and no mouse because for some reason my controller didn't work. Awkward.\n4) About 2 or 3 times I was left wondering where I had to go next with no clear hint in my quest journal. Thank god for the very helpful Steam forums or I would have given up.\n4) The final 4 or 5 dungeon puzzles are HARD. Maybe I'm just stupid or impatient or old (or all of the above), but if I hadn't been able to watch YouTube playthroughs for the last 20 hours of the game, I fear it would have become 40.\n5) Too many ending fake-outs. I was ready for the game to end several times, but there was always a twist to keep the story going (usually involving poor Colette being kidnapped).\n6) The combat system was convoluted (though you can set things to auto and button mash through).\n7) An affinity system that's never explained, pointless trophies and hidden systems you'd need a guidebook to take advantage of fully.\n\nThe Good:\n1) A charming, goofy old school aesthetic.\n2) Characters you grow to love.\n3) A long (it took me 70 hours) story with unexpectedly dark twists and serious meditations on sacrifice and racism.\n4) Even though I didn't really know what I was doing, the combat grew on me.\n5) At the end, I was entirely satisfied with the conclusion of all the character arcs, and felt a little bit sad that it was all over as the credits rolled.\n\nVerdict: This was my first Tales game (yes, I'm very late to the party), and now I'm eager to try more.

Naturally, there is nowhere near enough mana, so the world suffers from constant food shortages (of which we never actually see the effects, funnily enough) and the evil Desians (read: magitek half-elf Nazis) run rampant.\n\nIn the village of Iselia, there lives a young girl named Colette, who is said to be the \"Chosen\" who will restore peace and plenty to the world. But this isn't about Colette, this is about Colette's classmate Lloyd. When Lloyd and his snarky half-pint best friend Genis (yeah...) witness Colette receiving a magical \"Cruxis Crystal\" from the angel Remiel, they become deeply fascinated by the \"Journey of World Regeneration\", a sacred pilgrimage undertaken by the Chosen to awaken the \"Summon Spirits\" and the goddess Martel, which will hopefully replenish the world's mana and defeat the Desians.\nUnfortunately, a series of shenanigans involving an elderly prisoner of the local \"human ranch\" (read: concentration camp) leads to Lloyd and Genis being banished from the village, leaving them with no choice but to join Colette on her journey, against the wishes of the village elders.\nAfter more shenanigans, they meet up with Colette and her group and journeny through the desert to the Seal of Fire, resting place of the spirit Efreet. After defeating the monstrous Ktugach, guardian of the Seal, Remiel appears before the party and grants Colette angelic powers of her own. And with that, our heroes, along with Genis's older sister Raine and the mysterious mercenary Kratos (no relation), continue on their journey to save the world.\n\nBut Colette is hiding something, and it seems that virtually everyone our heroes meet knows more than they're letting on. And a mysterious young woman seems determined to stop Colette at all costs. Could there be more to this journey than \"stop the bad guys, save the world\"?\n\nOh, you have no idea.\n\n\n[h1]But how does it actually play?[/h1]\n\nI'd describe it as a cross between Chrono Trigger and Super Smash Bros., strange as that may sound. Ok, Maybe that's not the best description, but it's late and frankly I'm not very good at describing things like gameplay. So we'll skip straight ot the pros and cons, shall we?\n\n\n[h1]Don't mince words, Mr. C., tell us what you really think![/h1]\n\nIt was a mistake for you to accept promotion.\n\nGratuitous Star Trek reference complete. Time to do the actual review.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n [*]Incredible art style with some of the best use of cel shading I have ever seen.\n [*]A unique and charming cast of characters ranging from a young self-taught swordsman to a very busty ninja to a martial artist who seems to like his handcuffs a little too much (it makes sense in context).\n [*]Thrilling real-time combat\n [*]Many waifus\n [*]Many husbandos\n [*]Some frankly spectacular magic spells\n [*]A damn fine soundtrack (which as we all know can make or break a game)\n [*]Wicked sicknasty interdimensional jet-scooter-plane-things with an awwesome theme song\n [*]Enough sidequests and bonus content to, by my estimate, nearly double the length of the game.\n [*]Truly incredible voice acting, with spectacular performances by Scott Menville, Cam Clarke, Tara Strong, Robin Atkin Downes, and many other famous names.\n [*]Provides a deep and surprisingly nuanced examination of human nature.\n [*]An impressive amount of replay value if you have the patience to sit through the first part of the game multiple times.\n [*]Both heroes and villains are hella fucking badass!\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n [*]Chocolat\n [*]The tech system can be quite awkward; learning spells/special attacks requires each character to have performed lower-level spells/attacks a certain number of times, usually 50. This isn't so bad for most characters, but for some, such as Kratos and Zelos, you'll have to carefully manage their skill usage if you want them to learn any really cool moves.\n [*]Chocolat\n [*]A lot of stock anime humour, mostly involving Zelos. This wasn't [i]as[/i] tired and overdone when this game was made, but still!\n [*]Chocolat\n [*]You WILL need a guide to fully enjoy this game. Seriously. Especially if you like sidequests. Many of them require counterintuitive steps just to [i]initiate[/i], to say nothing about actually completing them. Case in point: [spoiler]to unlock many late-game sidequests, you have to enter [i]the last room before the final boss[/i], view the cutscene, and then [i][b]turn around and walk away![/b][/i][/spoiler] It's ridiculous!\n [*]Did I mention Chocolat?\n [*]While some of the game's puzzles are fun, they can get [i]very[/i] grating, especially in those areas where you're constantly being hounded by enemies in a confined space.\n [*]The game's replay value can actually work against it; you need to beat the game [i]at least[/i] three times to complete the Collector's book and the Monster List, as [spoiler]three minor accessories are associated with specific endings, and a particularly spoilerific boss is exclusive to the bad ending.[/spoiler] Combine that with the fact that the system that determines [spoiler]which of the game's eight (count 'em, eight!) endings you can get[/spoiler] is very opaque in and of itself, and I honestly cannot, in good faith recommend trying to 100% this game unless you have a frankly obscene amount of spare time and are willing to devote at least a month of your life to completing this absolute beast of a JRPG, but if you do somehow manage to pull it off, then I salute your devotion to completionism.\n [*]Minor nitpick, but due to a quirk in the art style, characters can sometimes look as though they have tiny bandito moustaches, even though they actually don't. [spoiler]Yuan[/spoiler] is probably the worst offender, but Colette gets it quite badly as well.\n [*]The writing is usually excellent, but some scenes leave a lot to be desired (case in point: Chocolat).\n [*]I will never understand what the deal was with that scene where Lloyd and Genis run into Raine as they're leaving the Martel temple... And that music... What were they thinking?!\n [*]You now cannot unsee the moustaches!\n[/list]\n\nOverall?\n\nI fucking love this game! Don't get me wrong, it has its flaws. A lot of flaws. But it more than makes up for them with its lovable characters, thrilling real-time combat, and deep, compelling plot that twists and turns like a twisty-turny-thing while still managing to remain coherent. As long as you can look past the apparently-cliche-at-first plot and occasional moments of cringe (*ahem*Chocolat*ahem*), you [b]will[/b] enjoy this game.\n\n                                                                                                               Yours Sincerely,\n                                                                                                                  -Mr. C.\n\n[h1]So do we get a TLDR, or...?[/h1]\n\nYes, yes you do.\n\ntl;dr: it has its ups and downs, but I still recommend it to any serious JRPG fan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what I want to know is, was the coffee really hot or cold?", "timestamp_created": 1592710184, "timestamp_updated": 1599870048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610831081867218018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71105488": {"recommendationid": "71105488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198889346772", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1679117536}, "language": "english", "review": "most of my review for this game comes from my childhood days on the gamecube.

Maybe just some extra cringing at the voice acting. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4pUgVwjslE2-agkqzzt2xA", "timestamp_created": 1589772327, "timestamp_updated": 1589772327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69274363": {"recommendationid": "69274363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090601795", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2874, "last_played": 1617935634}, "language": "english", "review": "my dad left me too", "timestamp_created": 1589674826, "timestamp_updated": 1589674826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249274730682373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69273718": {"recommendationid": "69273718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198864077755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2627, "last_played": 1631845872}, "language": "spanish", "review": "simplemende me gusto", "timestamp_created": 1589673960, "timestamp_updated": 1589673960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69259324": {"recommendationid": "69259324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235546988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 293, "playtime_forever": 3762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3721, "last_played": 1590163067}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una historia (muy) cl\u00e1sica de Elegidos y h\u00e9roes improbables que una vez superados sus t\u00f3picos presenta un mundo interesante por conocer y recorrer.

It is a solid JRPG, if what you're looking for is something to sink a lot of time into.  The story is decent, but like many things about this game... it's just good enough.\n\nMore:\n\n     This game started off slow.  The middle portion was exciting, and endearing.  Towards the end it dragged out and slowed down again.  My favorite portion of this game was the middle portion; when the world initially opens up to you.  There are dozens of cities to explore and multiple interesting characters to meet during this part of the game.  When the game nears the ending, it begins to grind to a halt, and the padding shows up.\n\n     There is so much needless padding in this game.  It is ridiculous how many times I thought that this game would end, only to send me off to complete another objective.  I stopped caring about the story after approximately the third time that this occurred.  The story arc for this game looks like the reading on an oscilloscope monitor.  It just keeps going up and down... up and down.  Characters are introduced so often, and the story tries to pull so many twists that I eventually had no idea what was going on.  All of the different groups and their motivations began to blend together, and the goal of the player's group became muddied behind it all. \n\n   Then there are the puzzles.  The puzzles are horrible.  Dungeons more often than not have some type of puzzle that you're supposed to complete.  Some are not clearly described, or they are simply trial and error exercises.  Some are just ridiculous.  It made finishing this game a chore.\n\n     One point that I constantly hear when people discuss this game is the battle system.  That is just OK as well.  It is often noted that there are no random battles in this game.  Encounters with enemies are initiated when the player's character model contacts an enemy in the world while moving around.  This is a good idea... yet it is implemented in a horrible way.  Battles in this game often times are unavoidable because you spend a lot of time walking down narrow corridors, and you can't simply run past the enemies.  When you move to another 'screen', and then go back, the enemies respawn.  You end up in battles more often in this game than in any other game I've seen with random encounters.  It happens so often that you will quickly become tired of battling enemies all-together, and just constantly use the escape option (well... I did at least).  I would rather have random encounters than to run into enemies every 10 seconds.  The worst part of the battle system is the constant player chatter.  Players and sometimes enemies talk 'CONSTANTLY' during the battles.  Every few moments someone will call out their current move.  Sometimes there's a cacophony of voices screaming out different magic and special attacks, and talking over top of each other.  I muted the game more times than I can remember because of this.  My ears literally began hurting during one battle because of the repetitive and mind-numbing chatter.\n\n     This game is OK.  It's fine.  If you like RPG's and especially JRPG's, then I can recommend it.  Just make sure that you have a lot of free time on your hands to complete this one.", "timestamp_created": 1589350627, "timestamp_updated": 1589350627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69016267": {"recommendationid": "69016267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116061324", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 2180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1589740979}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1589297479, "timestamp_updated": 1589297479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68987613": {"recommendationid": "68987613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198512058051", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1590485726}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story. gets a bit cheese near the end :P", "timestamp_created": 1589251063, "timestamp_updated": 1589251063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68947748": {"recommendationid": "68947748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203036148", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2580, "last_played": 1668592184}, "language": "english", "review": "best. game. ever", "timestamp_created": 1589190665, "timestamp_updated": 1589190665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "68931092": {"recommendationid": "68931092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247782594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1596394850}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game on all platforms and honestly this version is a downgrade. Now even though I say that, it doesn't mean its a bad thing. With this game on steam more people without a console and those who have a decent laptop can enjoy this game much more easily now. \nOn to the game. The presentation itself resembles its PS3 counterpart. However if you have a stronger PC you can easily modify it to look as beautiful as you want. Combat is just as fun as when I first played it with there being so many combos and combinations of attacks that you can pull. Characters are just as memorable as I remember, though I still hate Rodyle and his condescending voice (spoilers). \nWith the added addition of full japanese audio support, like the PS3, you can listen to both english and japanese voices whenever you want by changing them from the settings. Though I prefer the english voices for the characters since I played this game from the gamecube days. I found myself liking the japanese voice actors a lot when I was done with this playthrough. \nIf you still read this far into the review I would reccomend you to watch the animated version of Tales of Symphonia after you beat the game.

Along the way, he finds out things aren't quite what he expected, so he runs off on an idealistic journey not just to save the world as he knows it, but to make it into something better for everyone.\nThe good:\nThe characters are generally likable and enjoyable. Despite the nature of the story, the game tries not to take itself too seriously, which is good, considering that you're basically playing a cartoon.\nThe bad:\nThe story is a bit formulaic, a bit cliched, and sometimes a little cheesy. There were moments that the dialogue was so corny, especially toward the end of the game, that I prayed like crazy no one was watching me out of fear that I would die of embarrassment. There are a few too many \"well that was convenient\" moments in the game for my taste.\nThe ugly:\nThere comes a moment when you have to admit to yourself that this game is kind of cheesy, but you keep on going so that you can beat the tar out of more evil plants or watch one of the main characters make a buffoon out of himself.\n\nGameplay:\nIt's a real-time battle system that feels sort of like a traditional fighting game with lots of combos and special moves. You're limited to a 2d plane of movement, but the camera and that plane will rotate as your enemies move around the map.\nThe good:\nGenerally speaking, the gameplay is fun. The battle system takes a little bit of practice and a little bit of strategy, so it's not a complete hack 'n' slash.\nThe bad:\nYour teammates' AI is, well, dumb. Technically speaking, you can choose to control any of the characters in your party, but you're pretty much forced to play Lloyd or another tank; if you try to play any of the support characters, you quickly find that the AI is too dumb to protect you long enough to cast any spells.\nThe ugly:\nSome of the gameplay mechanics have not aged well at all. The battle controls are a little finicky and lack the polish and fluidity that you would find in a game like this today. Particularly obnoxious is the sort of arbitrariness surrounding the battle camera and the restricted plane of movement that shifts as you attack different enemies. Some of the puzzles are more tedious than I remember, and wasting ten minutes to push a couple blocks across the room is... unpleasant.\n\nPort Quality:\nThe good:\nIt's a 100% faithful port of the PS3 port of the original GameCube version. All the features are there, including the originals animated cut scenes. They updated the UI and fonts so that they don't look blurry on modern screens, too.\nThe bad:\nThis is not a terribly well-optimized port, which makes me think it's just playing inside a custom-built emulator. Certain options, like antialiasing, had to be disabled because they completely trashed my framerate and made the game nearly unplayable. I played it on a mid-range laptop that can handle games like the Witcher 3 just fine, so any lag at all in a port from a GameCube game in 2004 is unacceptable.\nThe ugly:\nThis isn't an ugly game, and the art style still holds up at 1920x1080, but high resolution screens exaggerate all the flaws in the original game, like low resolution textures or Colette's hair clipping through her clothes.\n\nOverall, this isn't a bad game. It's not going to go down on any \"best of\" lists or anything, but I enjoyed it a lot more than some \"classics\" like FF X. You can get a good forty hours out of a single playthrough, especially if it's your first time.

"review": "*Got this version for preordering Zesteria. Finished this game twice on the Gamecube, and that version visually better. The only reason I would suggest buying this version would be if you're interested in some extra content not available on the GCN release. Without the TSfix mod, the game looks and runs terribly in comparison.*\n\nAside from that, this game is fantastic. The voice acting is incredible featuring the voices of Scott Menville, Tara Strong, Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect), and Cam Clarke, etc. The characters are unique and are developed beautifully. \n\nThe story is captivating with enough plot twists to make M Night's head spin. And the game is long, with an average completion time of 40-60 hours.\n\nThe artstyle of this game has to be my favorite of all the tales games. While animation is a little dated at times, the chibi character models and cel shading make the graphics age a little nicer. Newer tales games in the series (Zesteria and Berseria specifically) look too textbook anime/over the top to me. And Anime mixed with motion capture never sits well with me.\n\nThe battle system is addicting, with 8 different playable character styles, each with two different skill trees to work with. It's fast, technical, and fun. It feels like a beat em up with each random encounter, with special moves tied to the B button similar to Smash Bros.\n\nThe gameplay outside of battle is a little hit or miss. There are a ton of missable sidequests and unlockables for your characters. And in this version, it will require a minimum of 5 playthroughs to unlock every costume. The dungeons start out simple and kind of enjoyable, but later on they get really cryptic and tedious, with one in particular is tied to terrible AI.\n\nFor the main game, the difficulty level stays pretty flat in my opinion. You won't have to do much grinding. Some boss battles will knock you on your ass if you're not prepared with proper move sets.  I like to play on Hard on my first playthrough which kicks my ass for the first 30% of the game and then it seems to level out as I learn better skills.\n\nThe post game will have some things you will have to beef up for however.

The gameplay is the usual tales of combo system where you link basic attacks into different levels of special attacks, from 1 to 3. So 1-2-3 basic attacks, then a level 1 special, level 2, then level 3. Its a lot of fun to create combos from all the different moves you have available, with the 8-9 characters you can play with through the game. Its the kind of combat system you can get lost in, or just happily button mash your way through. \n\nThe only real problems are that the AI is dumb as bricks and requires some management in boss battles to stop spell casters running into melee range. The very early sections of the game (first five hours) are weirdly difficult due to the lack of healing available. This is also back in the days where tales of games had a crazy amount of secret content, which means players should be prepared to consult a guide at any time or miss out.\n\nOther than that things are good. Encounters are visible on the field, save points usually appear just before a boss, soundtrack is memorable, and the story is well paced for the most part. Its a good game and its really not as dated as I thought it would be. \n\nA final note on the game length. The game took me about 56 hours to finish (don't know why steam says 59), but I did most of the side content.

Did it deliver?\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Gameplay \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nGameplay consists mainly of a \"2.5D\" fighting system, exploring the overworld map and towns, dungeons, and reading dialogue. I got most of my enjoyment from exploring towns. Unfortunately for me, I just couldn't get into the combat system. It felt slow, and I didn't like the enemy targeting system. There are quite some items and equips in this game, but I never really needed it, and played the rest of the game on Auto after a certain point. That is, except for some bosses with INSANE difficulty spikes in the beginning of the game. I had to level for hours to even get a chance beating them. I like that the dungeons have some puzzle elements to it, but most of them were extremely easy, and just very tedious to do. All in all, it felt like a really low-quality game to me, even for its age. Keep in mind this game also is LONG, which I guess can be both bad or good. (50-70h)\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Visual style & Graphics \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nI really liked the colorful and toony visual style. Most town designs are pretty cute. Although a lot of textures are super blurry, everything looks good enough to play on your big TV in 1080p. Except for the overworld, which looks empty and very low-effort. The anime portrait art while viewing conversations was good. Character animations are pretty basic, but do the job I guess.\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Music, SFX and Voice \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nNot impressed by the OST. Again, I know it's an old game, I don't mind the crappy midi-instruments ( in fact, I love those!), but the compositions of most songs just didn't cut it. No really memorable tracks here for me. Most SFX are decent, but some have VERY obvious loop-points. Come on, devs. However, voice acting is great, and there is quite some of it!\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Story \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nAnd here, maybe the most important section. I often hear story is extremely important for Tales games.\nI really liked that there was a lot of character interaction; a lot of silly conversations which still give some depth to each character. At fist I didn't really care for them, but they grew on me.\n\nThe main plot itself was a big letdown, though...\nAfter the first few story events, the pace drops to pretty low and this will continue for about half of the game. The second half of the game got a bit more interesting... but man. The cutscenes are some of the worst I've ever seen.\nPacing is all over the place, and animations are sh*t. They just all have zero impact the way they are made. I never cared about what was happening in the game at all, and most of the time it felt more like a chore to follow everything.\n\nSome sections and interactions made me think of the Trails in the Sky trilogy, but then I realized how infinitely much better executed the story in Trails was, even though those games also are pretty dated.\nIf you're looking for an extremely well-written story with very good character building, go get those games instead. (Music is also excellent!)\n\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Technical & Bugs \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\nKinda bummed this didn't run on 60fps, but I never really encountered problems.\n\nWell, what can I say... Sorry to all Symphonia fans out there. I think nostalgia might have been playing a big role in this game getting the status it has. But considering other JRPG's that are available now, new and old, I think this game isn't worth it if you have no connection to the Tales series already.\n\nI might still try one of the newer games, but I don't think this series is for me.", "timestamp_created": 1584987027, "timestamp_updated": 1584987314, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565883457660675049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65638473": {"recommendationid": "65638473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114281474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1854, "last_played": 1587506451}, "language": "english", "review": "tons of content, epic story, awesome gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1584980119, "timestamp_updated": 1584980119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65619091": {"recommendationid": "65619091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319557946", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 949, "last_played": 1584948651}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a port of the Gamecube version of the game that came out in 2003 and the fifth main title in the Tales series of action RPGs, and unfortunately the gameplay hasn't aged well at all especially compared to the more recent Tales games. I do not recommend this game but if you insist on playing it at your wallet's risk, be sure to install Kaldaien's Tales of Symphonia Fix mod (visit the Steam guides page for more information) to solve all known technical issues and ensure a smooth gameplay experience. You can then go to Settings ingame and select 1920 x 1080 resolution. While you're at it, visit NexusMods and install the Braless Sheena mod. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) This game is completely devoid of fanservice so even the smallest hint of cleavage ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) is certainly welcome. A controller is also highly recommended.\n\nI have played and platinum'ed all the latest Tales games on the PS3 and PS4 (Graces f, Xillia, Xillia 2, Zestiria, Berseria) so it is quite disappointing to experience how primitive the Tales series used to be during its early days. The story follows the standard Tales formula and tropes: a group of characters go on a journey for some inane reason (in this case, Lloyd accompanies his childhood friend, Colette, on a pilgrimage to release all the seals that will allow her to transform into an angel and regenerate the world), discover an alternate world (two worlds is a trope that exists in pretty much every Tales game) and their quest is escalated to world-saving stakes. The cast of characters are quite bland, to be honest. The female characters are extremely covered up to the point that it gives off the impression that the character design was intended to cater to mentally challenged SJWs (though this most likely isn't the case given that the original game came out in 2003, way before any of this woke garbage infiltrated gaming). If you installed the Braless Sheena mod ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0), you do get to see Sheena's nice set of plump breasts that hang pretty realistically against her chest to show appealing cleavage though it doesn't come anywhere close to count as lewd or arousing.\n\nThe battle system is atrocious and extremely cumbersome compared to recent Tales games. Movement is restricted to a 2D plane (only forward/backward movement) as there is no free roam, and you can't sidestep to avoid enemy attacks which forces you to either backstep or defend and this makes combat extremely sluggish. Unlike recent Tales games, there is absolutely no way of gaining 100% stagger immunity so your attack animations can still be interrupted by enemies no matter how far you are into the game. Getting staggered and interrupted is the most annoying part of Tales combat and the fact that this is unavoidable in this game is extremely frustrating and makes battles an absolute chore. You'll spend more time in battles getting interrupted than actually doing damage, and most of the time battles are won by your AI party members casting long range AoE spells while you get chain staggered by enemies. Party AI isn't as great or customizable as recent Tales games, but they get the job done moderately well at default settings i.e. they heal when needed and don't waste TP by spamming skills unnecessarily. The element and species weakness system found in recent Tales games is noticeably absent in this game, so you'll be doing pathetic amounts of damage regardless so there's no incentive to tailor your skill setup for different enemies.\n\nThe difficulty at the beginning of the game is ridiculously overtuned and among the worst balanced I have ever experienced in gaming. It does eventually become more manageable once you get enough characters to fill your party but I highly recommend using a trainer for the first 2 hours of gameplay at least if you want to have any chance of progressing.\n\nUnlike the latest Tales games, this game still uses a world map for exploration like old-school RPGs. However, traversing the world map is extremely tedious and slow. Monsters show up on the world map and battles only occur if you run into them but it's pretty much pointless to evade them as they can move faster than you so you end up fighting a ton of unnecessary, repetitive battles just to go to your next objective. Signposting is terrible in this game and areas that can be entered aren't well-defined, so you're left to wander aimlessly on the world map until you eventually find a location you can enter. The synopsis occasionally hints at the direction of your next objective, but overall the game is pretty vague as to where you need to go. You'll be forced to backtrack plenty of times during the course of the game, and since there is no fast travel whatsoever \uff08\u256f \u0361 \u0360\u00b0 \u035f\u0644\u035c \u0361\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b it's gonna be extremely frustrating if you don't know where to go and have to revisit old areas one at a time. The camera angle while your on the world map is very restricted and it's really difficult to see where you're going, much less avoid enemies.\n\nDungeons start off pretty easy and relatively manageable compared to recent Tales games, but by midgame they quickly become annoyingly long and filled with tedious, frustrating mechanics that we've come to expect from Tales games. However, recent Tales games have the benefit of nice graphics and a fun battle system, of which this game has neither. The combination of the terribly primitive battle system, unclear directions and frustrating gimmicks make dungeons in this game an absolutely horrendous experience.\n\nPost-victory battle quotes in this game are extremely lacking in variety and comedic value compared to of those in Tales of Graces f, Xillia and Xillia 2; I saw the same 4-5 unfunny post-victory battle quotes recycled throughout the entire game regardless of my active party. Skits in this game are not voiced if you play with English voices, and they are terribly boring. The sad attempts at humor are pretty cringe; they are nowhere near the level of comedy gold of skits in Tales of Graces f, Xillia and Xillia 2. Even Tales of Zestiria has funnier skits, and that's really saying something.\n\nTales of Symphonia could have passed for a decent RPG 17 years ago, but the quality unfortunately doesn't hold up to modern RPG standards. I do not recommend this game at all due to the terrible graphics, extremely and lacklustre dated battle system, bad gameplay mechanics and absence of fanservice. If you're looking for a GOOD Tales game, I highly recommend Tales of Graces f (my personal favorite Tales game) which has the best combat and party AI in the entire franchise, and tons of entertaining and memorable skits and post-battle victory quotes. Tales of Xillia and Xillia 2 are also must-plays for the skits with tons of sexual innuendo (\"bazongas\" ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) and awesome, sexy female character design.

We have the impulsive but very kindhearted, the dorky chosen one, the genius, the mysterious mercenary and many more. The chemistry between those characters is truly great, which gets enhanced due to skits between the characters. They really make this game and is the main selling point.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, the voice acting in this game is top notch with some known voice actors. Also the soundtrack is really great with some pumping battle tracks.\n\nGraphically, its a Gamecube game from 2003, so its not state of the art, but the cell-shading-look is passable still to this day. The overworld and the non animinated cutscenes look dated unfortunately. Speaking of, this version is sadly only 30 fps locked, unlike the Gamecube Version, which plays fluently 60 fps.\n\nThe 2.5 D battle system is really fun. Chaining combos as Lloyd feels really good. If you played newer titles of the series, like Tales of Vesperia, the gameplay feels a bit rough with the lack of free running, but this is by no means gamebreaking.

I would recommend it though only to people who would enjoy a JRPG mostly for the sake of it just being a JRPG.\n\nSome of the factors that lowered my enjoyment of the game include:\n\nAt least one unbearable character that joins your party which of course you can not dismiss.  I have rarely felt this way about characters in any RPG that join your party.  In some cases you might have someone annoying or just not cool that you can effectively bench resulting in no longer having to heard their dialog during cut scenes and such.  This is not the case with this game, you are stuck with who joins and any time 'story' happens you will have to hear them.\n\nThe world is deceptively open.  There are events in the game that open up more 'enhanced' modes of travel just like in most JRPGs, like boat and air travel.  However I was greatly let down when I spent a lot of time exploring only to be shut down by the game saying stuff like 'this place is not open yet' thus forcing you into a rather liner mode of playing.  \n\nThe combat system was a bit new for me as I have mostly stuck to Turn Based systems.  The real time action combat or whatever the term is called was refreshing at first, planning out what attacks to use to link together and such.  This eventually became extremely boring.  The one saving grace that stretched out interest in this system was the ability to directly control any of the party members and they all felt rather different for the most part.  \n\nThe story was not all that captivating.  In fact at a certain point I just wanted to get the game over with, this resulted in one of the rare occasions I did not feel a desire to go pursue all of end game side quest content 'like gathering Ultimate Weapon activities and fighting Bosses that are harder than the End Game Story Bosses'  in a RPG.  \n\nI do not have a ton of positive things to say about the game.  The overall impression for me was that the game had average content and a lot of it.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you are someone who is looking for a huge game to sink some time into.  Also I did not have any technical issues during my entire play through (no crashing or anything).", "timestamp_created": 1581513023, "timestamp_updated": 1581513056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423229902982711792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63368970": {"recommendationid": "63368970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842848657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3055, "last_played": 1679115387}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen JRPG pero nada m\u00e1s, al principio su historia y mundo se sienten muy poco cre\u00edbles (y hasta rid\u00edculo seg\u00fan como se mire), tanto que abandon\u00e9 el juego 2 veces antes de terminar el primer arco, es un hecho de que al juego de verdad le cuesta ponerse interesante al principio, su primer arco es bastante predecible, hasta que llegas a cierta torre, donde la historia por fin comienza a ponerse cada vez m\u00e1s interesante.

Buena evoluci\u00f3n de historia y personajes. Gameplay divertido, sencillo y m\u00e1s profundo de lo que aparenta. \n\n1. Gameplay: 1.1- Combate: Ataques b\u00e1sicos y habilidades que pueden resultar en largos combos. Se pueden bindear hasta cinco habilidades en total al control o teclado. Dos de estas pueden ser para ordenar a nuestros compa\u00f1eros que hagan ellos sus habilidades como sanar, buffear, dispels o cualquiera que queramos. Las otras tres serian para el personajes principal que estemos usando, el cual podemos cambiar en cualquier momento. \u00bfDesea poder usar a Genis que es un caster? Pues puede ser su main. O si ud quiere ser el soporte, pues tambi\u00e9n puede serlo. En total (y por lo que veo en todos los juegos de tales, porque este es el primero que juego) en nuestro equipo podemos tener cuatro personajes en un solo combate para nuestra ayuda. \n Recalco que podemos tener cinco habilidades si queremos para nosotros, o solo tres pero poder ordenar de forma m\u00e1s sencilla a nuestro compa\u00f1eros presionando alg\u00fan bot\u00f3n. Por supuesto esto no quiere decir que solo estemos limitados a dos ordenes para nuestros compa\u00f1eros. Desde el men\u00fa de combate podemos usar items, ordenar a nuestros compa\u00f1eros que usen ellos los objetos o habilidades. Tambi\u00e9n desde ah\u00ed podemos escapar del combate. Y tambi\u00e9n cambiar la estrategia del combate, si queremos que nuestros compa\u00f1eros sean m\u00e1s agresivos, ataquen de largo, no usen tanta man\u00e1 etc etc etc.\nLuego tenemos una habilidad especial que nos permitir\u00e1 hacer un ataque en conjunto.\nEn ocasiones nuestro personaje principal se queda atorado entre los enemigos y no podemos moverlo, esto no pasa mucho, pero es molesto.\n\nLas animaciones, por cierto, son geniales. Algo que no me esperaba. Las habilidades empiezan siendo un poco las t\u00edpicas como bolas de fuego. Ataque r\u00e1pido con espadas etc etc. Pero a medida que avancemos iremos consiguiendo m\u00e1s, y m\u00e1s peculiares, en especial la de los casters.\n\n1.2- Items, armaduras, Ex gemas: Pociones, armas y armaduras son las normales. Lo m\u00e1s curioso de estas ser\u00edan como unos tipo de abalorios que pueden llegar a ser de lo m\u00e1s \u00fatiles en el juego, porque nos dan celeridad en hechizos, resistencias, fuerza etc etc etc.\n\nLas Ex Gemas son unos items que nos ayudar\u00e1n a mejorar nuestras estad\u00edsticas, y depende de que escojamos nuestras habiliades pueden fusionarse para elaborar. Claro, las gemas no solo afectan esto, pero ya me estoy cansando de escribir.\n\n1.3 - Exploraci\u00f3n: Ser\u00e9 cortico. El mapa es m\u00e1s de lo que parece. Como es normal podemos encontrar cofres con items. O hallar ciertos circulos que nos regalan unos peque\u00f1os di\u00e1logos donde elegiremos nosotros la respuesta. Tambi\u00e9n la forma en la que exploramos el mapa va evolucionando a medida de que avanzamos en la historia. Yo tengo 56 horas de juego, y eso lo obtuve mayormente haciendo la historia principal del juego. Por todo el mapa, si buscamos bien, nos encontraremos con monstruos, jefes nuevos, NPC\u00b4s que nos dan misiones etc etc etc. \nA veces la c\u00e1mara se mete en lugares extra\u00f1os y es un poco tosca de mover.\n\n\n1.4 - Puzzles: No esperaba encontrarme con estos. Algunos sencillos, otros no tanto. Lo normal. Mis problemas son con uno de los \u00faltimos. Este tiene cierta \"mec\u00e1nica\" que ni siquiera es eso. Lo llam\u00f3 as\u00ed para no decir lo que es. Nunca se hab\u00eda presentado en ninguno de los anteriores. Pero cuando llegamos a este tampoco se nos da una pista, porque adem\u00e1s esta es la \u00fanica vez que esta \"mec\u00e1nica\" esta dentro del todo el juego y b\u00e1sicamente se encuentra teniendo suerte.\nTambi\u00e9n los primeros puzzles tienen su justificaci\u00f3n, pero a medida de que se avanza pierden su \"porqu\u00e9\" y solo est\u00e1n ah\u00ed para retrasarnos. Al menos yo al final ya estaba un poquito harto, pero solo un poquitico :)\n\n\n2. Historia: Empieza siendo extremadamente t\u00edpica. (No olviden que es un juego del 2004, aunque igual no es excusa) Pero esto creo yo es al propio. Nos mantienen al tanto del hilo principal con tanto di\u00e1logo con ellos, como si quisieran que no olvidemos de que trata el juego. Y a medida de que avanzamos, sabemos que estamos por terminar lo que se nos propuso al inicio, pero lo estamos por hacer muy r\u00e1pido. As\u00ed que es esperable que haya un plot twist. La historia evoluciona y cambia mucho. Nuestro objetivo final incluso puede llegar a no estar claro. Pero eso es lo genial. La historia evoluciona  y cambia tanto a medida de que nos vamos enterando de todo, que lo hace genial, con uno que otro y otro giro de gui\u00f3n. \n\n2.1 - Personajes: Grandes personajes con personalidades un poco ya vistas, pero bien marcadas y usadas. Todos aqu\u00ed tienen un porqu\u00e9. Todos tienen sus conflictos que los hacen interesantes.. La mayor\u00eda consigue un buen desarrollo y desenlaces. No dir\u00e9 nada m\u00e1s.\n\n3. Datos extra: La dificultad est\u00e1 bien casi siempre. Algunas peleas son un tanto dif\u00edciles pero nada imposible.\nDe vez en cuando nos salen un di\u00e1logos extra con algo de animaci\u00f3n para profundizar en la historia o personajes o para hacernos re\u00edr.. Nosotros podemos elegir si queremos escucharlas, pero tambi\u00e9n hay algunas se nos aparecer\u00e1n y tendremos que verlas obligados. Estas no son tan comunes como en el Tales of Berseria (ah\u00ed llevo casi 30 horas, y esas me tienen harto) El problema viene en que si uds son como yo y no se quieren perder nada, las van a querer ver todas, pero a veces son un poco molestas (como en el Berseria, no me dejan ni jugar) Pero aqu\u00ed no pasa tanto.\n\n3.1 - Por cierto. Gran banda sonora, en especial al final. Muy buena. Aunque repite un poquito. \n3.2 - De vez en cuando se nos van a mostrar animaciones completas cuando pasen cosas importantes. \nEstoy seguro que no he mencionado todo, pero es que ya no quiero seguir. En fin. Buen juego para empezar con la saga. De todas formas hasta la fecha que escribo esto solo hay cuatro disponibles en steam. Los voy a jugar y rese\u00f1ar todos. \n\nPD: Recomiendo jugarlo con texto en ingl\u00e9s y audio en japon\u00e9s. No sean como Waffer (espero que no lea esto.

It's a great game, but not without problems. I couldn't use all of the supposed control keys on the keyboard. No, it's not my keyboard. Just that, it just doesn't work. I could use the controls properly using a controller though. Thankfully, that made the game playable. It took me a while to figure out how to play other characters in combat. Guess they didn't explain it that well. I didn't experience any crashes whatsoever.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good for an old game. The combat is not the classic turn based system. It's hack, slash, block. Combos are quite difficult to do, especially combos reaching up to 50-100 . There's other combat features like the Overlimits, Unison Attack and the EX Skills system. I don't think I'd ever figure those out without a guide. The story, the world building, the lore are expansive and well written. I really like the voiceover which is available in Japanese and English. Personally, I prefer the Japanese dub as it's the original version. The dungeons are quite challenging. There's a lot of them in this game, so be prepared. If all else fails, look at the guide!! (So that you don't miss anything). \n\nAnyway, I enjoyed this game very much. I'll give an 8/10.

Os recomiendo probarlo ya que aunque el juego ya le pesan sus a\u00f1os se mantiene bastante bien y puede ser un buen comienzo en la saga Tales Of.\n\nEmpecemos destacando el apartado jugable, un apartado en el que siempre ha destacado esta franquicia y pese a que sus hermanos peque\u00f1os pueden dejarlo en pa\u00f1ales, Tales Of Symphonia tiene un sencillo y eficaz sistema de juego que engancha. Para quien no lo conozca y sigue leyendo pese a mi aviso de spoilers, decir que el sistema se basa en los combates de acci\u00f3n activa donde podremos encadenar golpes b\u00e1sicos y t\u00e9cnicas especiales para hacer grandes cantidades de da\u00f1o a los enemigos mientras nos desplazamos por el escenario 3D aunque tan solo en 2 dimensiones.\n\nAlgo que remarcar en su contra es que para desplazarte en alguna direcci\u00f3n que no sea derecha o izquierda debes depender de un segundo enemigo que este en una posici\u00f3n distinta a tu objetivo actual, ya que te mueves para adelante o atr\u00e1s usando al objetivo que tienes marcado como punto de referencia para el movimiento en un supuesto eje X de una gr\u00e1fica tridimensional, eso fue modificado a posteriori en otros juegos de la saga pero en este no llego a existir ning\u00fan bot\u00f3n de movimiento libre en ninguna de sus versiones.\n\nEl juego te permite controlar en combate o fuera de el a cualquier personaje que este dentro de tu grupo de combate lo que te permite una gran variedad a la hora de luchar casi con la imposibilidad de aburrirse ya que cada personaje tiene sus pros y sus contras con los que deber\u00e1s lidiar mientras los manejas.\n\nEn combate deberemos aprender como enlazar los golpes b\u00e1sicos con las artes que aqu\u00ed fueron mal traducidas o simplemente adaptadas, como gust\u00e9is, como ataques especiales, existen artes de nivel 1, 2 y 3 que en principio se pueden enlazar en ese mismo orden haciendo un combo medianamente largo, un sistema sencillo que se puede enrevesar mas si tiramos de otra funcionalidad del juego, las gemas EX lo que nos permite alterar las caracter\u00edsticas de como combaten los personajes entre otras cosas.\n\nLa banda sonora que ostenta este juego es simplemente maravillosa, cada uno de los temas de los personajes esta grabado a fuego en mi cerebro. La solemnidad y respeto que me despierta el tema de Kratos, los bonitos sentimientos que vivo cuando escucho el tema de Sheena, la alegria al escuchar el tema de Colette. Esa experiencia callejera que me despierta el tema de Regal, la dulzura del tema de Presea, la tranquilidad del tema de Raine, hacen que ya solo por los temas de los personajes me enamore de esta OST.\n\nPero es que eso no es todo, la ost que ambienta el resto del juego es de la misma envergadura, haciendo que disfrutes desde el opening hasta un paseo por Palmacosta o Welgaia sitios con unas m\u00fasicas muy distintas.\n\nA nivel visual tenemos un juego que pese a no ser un portento gr\u00e1fico ni ahora, ni en su d\u00eda el cellshading, el uso de los colores vivos y tambi\u00e9n ese dise\u00f1o a medio camino al cartoon le permiten envejecer a una velocidad endiabladamente lenta haciendo que a d\u00eda de hoy se siga viendo bastante bien en cualquiera de sus versiones. Ademas contamos con unas cuantas escenas de animaci\u00f3n que amenizaran grandes escenas. Dependiendo de que versi\u00f3n juguemos veremos mas escenas que en otras, siendo la de gamecube la que menos tiene ya que la de PS3 y PC se basan en la de PS2 que inclu\u00eda mejoras respecto al original.\n\nTodas sus versiones se mueven bien siendo quiz\u00e1s la mas solida , de forma natural, la de PS3. Si ya tiramos por mods la de PC te permitir\u00e1 hacer verdaderas virguerias como llegar a los 4K y 60FPS como una roca.\n\nOtro de los puntos positivos del juego es que en varios puntos de la historia nos permite la elecci\u00f3n de varias respuesta, alterando sensiblemente la escena pero poco mas en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, podr\u00eda quedarse ah\u00ed pero no, estas decisiones pueden ser lo mas insignificante del juego o lo mas importante segun como puedas llegar a verlo. En una primera ronda puede que no te des cuentas, yo al menos no lo hice, pero este juego cuenta con un a la vez semioculto a la vez semidescubierto sistema de afinidad de los personajes principales con Lloyd que permite alterar ciertas escenas durante todo el juego. Este sistema de afinidad dota a Lloyd de un peque\u00f1o efecto avatar que ya incluso al principio del juego y si nos damos cuenta insin\u00faa que merece la pena la nueva partida + d\u00e1ndole rejugabilidad a la historia. La afinidad tambi\u00e9n aumentar\u00e1 con otras acciones como que Lloyd cocine tras la batalla con el ingrediente favorito del personaje o las skit repartidas por el mapa del mundo.\n\nPor ultimo y no por ello menos importante me gustar\u00eda hablar de las Skit un recurso muy valioso que no solo nos permiten disfrutar de escenas relativamente irrelevantes, algunas son de gran importancia y otras nos permiten conocer mejor a los personajes de forma cotidiana y son un recurso valioso que llevan usando mucho tiempo en la franquicia.", "timestamp_created": 1575054410, "timestamp_updated": 1575055509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58350784": {"recommendationid": "58350784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044446426", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 3162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2112, "last_played": 1682703887}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, hands down, my favorite game. I've loved it since it was a two-disc special on the gamecube, and I would play it tirelessly to try to get the completion bonuses and entice friends into playing the multiplayer so that I could talk story with them. Lets talk about the good and the bad.\n\nThe good:\n- ToS has an amazing storyline. I mean it can get predictable at times, but it's really immersive and you get to know the characters really well and it gives you an opportunity to form your own opinions on them. I mean you're not like.. sitting there definitely loving everyone. A few of them can be hard sells.\n- Good characters. Ties in with the first one really, but the characters are (for the most part) really interesting and have a good bit of versatility on what they each do so that you don't HAVE to play the main character for fighting and whatnot.\n- Story-driven outcomes. I love a game with different outcomes! A lot of things can change in your second playthrough depending on how you go about the game. It keeps it a little fresher, so that when you replay, you have some things to discover.\n- Replay value. There's things you'll miss, there's things that the second time through you'll be like \"ah this thing I figured out later makes SENSE NOW\" which is neat and fun, there's bonuses for beating the game and starting over so that you  aren't starting fresh.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Tbh while the visual update is good I guess I was hoping for a little more. \n- Still some bugs, though they're nothing huge and nothing that breaks the game (as far as I've seen).\n- Keyboard feels like the worst possible idea ever for this game so make sure you have a controller handy.\n- Collette's voice still makes me want to punch a wall.\n\nI'll never not love this game tbh.

Elemental seals comparable to Ocarina of Time temples (but smaller)\n\n-Gameplay - 7/10\nGiven the time, as an ARPG the combat feels a bit dated, testing the waters for the series with mechanics that have been since-refined, but Symphonia still effectively implements the features it includes.\nThere exists a feature called \u201cEX Skills\u201d which are a fun way to use passive skills to differentiate characters, in addition to two branched skill paths for each character, effectively altering the abilities they learn throughout the game from start to finish.\nUnison Artes (think dual-techs from Chrono Trigger, but only occasional) are satisfying to unleash against bosses, and it\u2019s fun to watch the characters use these abilities together and discover new ones. \n\n-Graphics - 7/10\nSymphonia uses a very unique and cute cell-shaded art style which provides an interesting complement to the sometimes-darker undertones of the story.\nEvery character has a uniquely identifiable design that helps make them memorable from the first moment you meet each of them.\nAll the colors help to make every part of the world stand out, as well.\n\n-Soundtrack - 7/10\nWith Symphonia being a 2003 game, expect lots of midis, but this isn\u2019t really a bad thing. Given the composer is Motoi Sakuraba in the early 2000s, if you\u2019re into Golden Sun\u2019s soundtrack, you\u2019ll LOVE this one.\nAll the frequently-played songs such as battle themes, the world-map, and some dungeon themes are memorable and don\u2019t really get annoying like they sometimes can in a handful of RPGs. \nThe music selections ALWAYS augment the dramatic scenes.\nThe different boss themes complement the accompanying boss very well, ESPECIALLY for the major fights that are given unique dedicated themes.\nSongs made for less-important segments of the game (like the ones that cut in for like a minute during hectic moments or something) aren\u2019t as memorable, but those are of little consequence.\n\n-The Remaster Itself- 7/10\nFirstly, the widescreen support, enhanced resolution, much sharper UI & ditching of the original game\u2019s tendency to blur make it MUCH prettier to look at.\n30fps lock is confusing, given that the Gamecube didn\u2019t even lock it like that.\nThis version includes additions like new regular artes, mystic artes, and even enhanced elemental variations of artes. Also new costumes, dialogue & some extra enemies too.\nAlso removed various bugs while also removing obnoxious (albeit kinda fun) exploits from the 2003 version of the game.\nApparently this used to be a terrible port at launch, but it has since been significantly fixed up. No worries now :)\n\n----OVERALL: 8/10----", "timestamp_created": 1574375670, "timestamp_updated": 1574375670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603071808815002441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57600980": {"recommendationid": "57600980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993855291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 353, "playtime_forever": 2610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2610, "last_played": 1513873151}, "language": "english", "review": "I 1st played Tales of Symphonia on Gamecube, and as soon as I saw it was actually available on Steam, I bought it.\nThe Tales of saga is incredible, the scenarios are always fantastic, but I think this one is above and beyond the other, incredible story with so much mysteries and fantasies. \nThe graphics is typical of the Tales of, quite manga-like, but this one being older is more like a friendly rounded manga design. \nThe music is just a dream for the ears...it always perfectly fits!\nI wish all of the Tales of would be available on Steam!!!", "timestamp_created": 1574369811, "timestamp_updated": 1574369811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57510064": {"recommendationid": "57510064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191299734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2693, "last_played": 1638419647}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es muy bueno te vicia para un buen rato 100 recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1574221102, "timestamp_updated": 1574221102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57505075": {"recommendationid": "57505075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198858432900", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1575942975}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the game that got me to love the series. even after all these years its still a blast to play", "timestamp_created": 1574211968, "timestamp_updated": 1574211968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57495836": {"recommendationid": "57495836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171793693", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1692410300}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game. only played like 5 hours and I fall in love with this game.\nEdit: ok so I finished this game, masterpeace, 10/10 really recommend :) maybe old game but it is a very good game especilly when u like anime.", "timestamp_created": 1574195828, "timestamp_updated": 1586337275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477520942687988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57483587": {"recommendationid": "57483587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141712533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1583854983}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the tales series and this is the first one I ever played.

These are just my first impressions, and I will update the review after finishing the game. Now, without further ado, let's dive into why I love this game so far.\n\nThe story is nicely paced, and told in an interesting manner. You take control of Lloyd Irving, and you set out to look for the Chosen, Colette, after being exiled for the Desians attack in the nearby village of Iselia, because you and your friend Genis decided it would be a good idea to visit the off-limits area of one of the Desian's human ranches. So far, good stuff.\n\nThe gameplay is what I like the most so far. It's really fucking good. It's so simple, yet so effective at doing what it needs to that feels really smooth once you get the hang of it. Using different techs and learning when to block can be tedious at first, but when you get the hang of it, it feels really good. Overall a really solid combat system so far, and I know it will just keep expanding as I keep playing, and I can't wait to see what gets added later on in the game.\n\nThe graphics are really good, considering this is a port of a 13 year old game. Yes, this gorgeous game came out in 2003, I can't believe it either. But if you only care about graphics, and don't really care about a solid story or solid gameplay, skip this title, you won't get anything out of it, since it really isn't the main focus. Textures look kinda low-res when compared to more recent games, but for 2003, it looks mind-blowing.\n\nThe voice acting and dialogue are charming and intriguing so far. I like it, good stuff.\n\nThe only real problem I have with the game so far is the 30 FPS lock, which doesn't really matter to me all that much since it looks smooth, and you don't need pixel perfect inputs to control it, but it would be really cool to see this in 60 FPS, like on the original Gamecube version. While this may be a problem for some, it doesn't bother me too much.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying this game so far, and I'm excited to see where the story goes next. It's entertaining to play, with a really nice combat system, and the writing is pretty good. Overall, if you like JRPGs with a more action oriented focus like Chrono Trigger, Secret Of Mana, and other games like them, I'm sure you would like this one. If you're more of a graphics kinda guy, and don't care about story and gameplay, don't play this game.\n\nRating so far: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1573937078, "timestamp_updated": 1573937078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57280328": {"recommendationid": "57280328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268167582", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1574449948}, "language": "spanish", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1573904871, "timestamp_updated": 1573904871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57207019": {"recommendationid": "57207019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803482764", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1582523650}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood game for me, just bought it while on sale to replay it, loved it before the port to PS3 I played it on the Gamecube, I used to just play this for hours on end, and i can't wait to watch my hours on steam go up with the game, Been streaming it as well, and its been a decent hit for everyone watching. :)", "timestamp_created": 1573816434, "timestamp_updated": 1573816434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57183453": {"recommendationid": "57183453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036278392", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1697464526}, "language": "english", "review": "check requirements of your system before buy ", "timestamp_created": 1573771583, "timestamp_updated": 1697816758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47450980544090271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "57133638": {"recommendationid": "57133638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999256559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1573798673}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my favorite games of all time.

This version is perfectly fine for me to be honest. \nIt works well enough and I had no crash or issues. If you can get past the first few hours of the game, you will probably end up loving it.\n\n* HUGE GAME, over 180 hours of content for sure.\n* You will think it has ended and then BAM nah. This game came with TWO discs back in the day.\n* CHOICES MATTER!! \n* Costumes!! Side quests can get your characters costumes! But only a few of them can wear the costume for good after the event, so pick your favourites!\n* Near the later end of the game, you will get a flying machine, and it's so fun to fly around your world map!\n* I totally recommend button mashing any moves you get as many times as possible with each character, their moves can branch off with how much they learn, theres so many moves I never learned because I didn't press them enough. For example, the character Raine has 'First Aid' at first which does some basic healing, but if you continue using it, she will eventually learn REALLY powerful healing moves, as well as all the other characters, they all branch from this sort of thing. \n\n*And yes you can fight in multiplayer mode! The camera is wonky, but you get used to it.\n\n* Your ending will be the same in every game, story wise, but you can end it with any of the characters in your party and it will be different, and it's great. I ended my game with a high relationship with the professor, Raine, so at the end of the game, we met up and had a special conversation with extra stuff.\n\n* As you go through the game, if you talk to people, you will find out REALLY interesting stuff, from ex-boyfriends turning into creatures, murder, meeting parents, aaand you can miss it if you don't chat with them! Do some side quests!!\n\nAs a child, that was my first game that actually changed based on what I did, on purpose and on accident.\nThis game taught me empathy, feelings I could relate to, and just funny things.\nThis game is my soul.

Four people can play in combat at once, enjoy.\n\nA lot of people have technical gripes about this game, which is hilarious since it was developed for the gamecube almost twenty years ago, so grow up pussies. It doesn't look pretty but at least they managed to beat Microsoft at making things run at a better frame rate in HD resolutions.\nWhile Japan proves that they continue to not know how to implement controller support for any video game actually solid on PC, I don't recall ever the game being available on Xbox. The game thinks there's one there now (Steam Controller master race) and buttons aren't missing, so that's aces in my book. Great controller support in this game, surprisingly.\n\nThere's a lot of things I like about this game, such as the relationships between characters, hours of fucking content everywhere, anime trope shit galore, and an interesting story that continued to be dynamic enough to keep my attention.\n\nThis is pretty impressive for a three hour review, I'll get to that later, drink your milk.\n\nThere's a lot of things you won't like about the game, for example an FPS lock, which at least works, so can we grow up? It's not giving you the illusion of unlimited FPS, so at least the game looks and perform well, I welcome the lock after playing Halo: Reach on Steam. The real issues in this game lie in some of the less revealed aspects that they kind of expected you to somehow figure out or buy a guide for. Controls aren't really explained well in the tutorial, there's some things that you want to skip or speed up that you can't, and while I love having Robin from Teen Titans as the main character I hate a lot of character's voices in this game.\nIt's an older RPG, so it's at this awkward stage of being less forgiving and reliant on a saving system I wish we let die in the 90's while not being too difficult, just frustrating more than anything coupled with annoying. There's a perk for keeping Lloyd with the wooden swords basically until Disc 2...so good luck figuring out when that is on PC, but it's worth the grind and tears. There will be tears.\n\nIf you can get over this, it's a great RPG for the price of $20. This is the Tales game that effectively reinvigorated the franchise, and if you're not going to go back and play the best Tales game (Tales of Destiny) then this is a good starting point. If Xillia is ever on PC I recommend that next, and I'm looking forward to playing Berseria eventually.\n\nNow, about the three hours. Ah yes, I remember my first ex-wife.\nSo the whole reason I bought this game was to have my girlfriend play it while I played second hand banana as whoever I wanted with a second controller. Turns out my girlfriend would rather play shitty games like Apex and Overwatch instead, so fuck her, going to start boosting those rookie numbers by myself soon. If you have a girlfriend who plays RPG's and sucks at not dying in them this series is made for you.\n\n4/5 Decent JRPG that you can play with guests/play once with people who say they love you.", "timestamp_created": 1569965514, "timestamp_updated": 1577155430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536398470401763916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55260246": {"recommendationid": "55260246", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991673744", "num_games_owned": 1208, "num_reviews": 209, "playtime_forever": 3929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3929, "last_played": 1569335159}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty okay.

The objective of the game is to prevent a parallel world from eating your world by helping a holy maiden, Collete, create World Regeneration.\n\nStorytelling is pretty cliche with names like Lord Yggdrasil, Ymir, Heimdall, Mines of Moria and Remiel the Angel. The characters are just mirrored in Sylvarant and Tethe'alla. Kratos = Zelos, Presea Combatir = Colette, Dirk the dwarf = Altessa the dwarf. The story is really long and spans the 2 worlds covering Exspheres, Summon Spirits, Human Ranches, Cruxis and Yggdrasil. There aren't any details but a rough touch-and-go.\nYes, I missed Izold, the fishing village. I took the long route up to Asgard and had to walk all the way back. I think their ad for 80 hours of story is true. It's not very good story but it is a long one.\n\nNo map. It was so hard to navigate on the World map and in the dungeons. Weldgaia was a super pain in the ass since they intentionally made roadblocks without telling you where they were.\n\nSwitching between characters. Technically, it is possible. However, the obtuse way of setting keys and changing from Manual/Semi/Auto is so tedious that I stuck with Lloyd Irving instead. The system is meant for up to 4 players to fight.\n\nUnison Attack. Very good except for 1 single flaw. You can't set healing abilities like Nurse. So, you can't combo a heal and attack at the same time.\n\nThe amount of content is very good. There are many levels and stages to play. The main issue lies in the quality of the content. While there are plenty of stages to cover and many interesting puzzles to play, it feels \"not wow\". Like a huge sackload of potatoes but little quality steak. \n\nNew Game Plus is sucky as it forces you to start from the beginning. Yes, a 50 hour linear game repeats with some GRADE modifiers. This is not the Witcher where your choice determines different outcomes.\n\nConclusion, you can play Tales of Symphonia. However, it's very old and all the nitty gritty tiny things that you take for granted in newer games are not there, like free camera rotation. It's not a smooth experience. Play TOS for nostalgia. \n\nNote: TOS' total worldwide sales across its original platforms have reached 1.6 million as of 2008, making it the best-selling Tales title to date. The game designer is Kosuke Fujishima.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Interesting Mechanics\nLike the dragon rider and dragon. Flying dragon was eh. Trap Faker was nice. \n\n2. Makes you Appreciate 20 years of Gaming Tech Improvement\nSuch crappy controls and graphics. See how we have improved over the decades.\n\n3. Puzzles\nI love the level design. Not for the irritating bits but for the trickiness. It makes you think one way and then ta da, it's another. E.g. Sewers, the Energy Lines, the Temple of Darkness.\n\n4. Funny Designs\nI like the weird designs like the Iris Boxer (Irish Boxer). It's so punny. The Gravekeeper is nice too. I like how the hand just grabs you and pulls you into the casket.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Roaming Creatures Give Random Monsters\nIf you see a bird, you get a phoenix and scorpions. If you see a grub, you get scorpions. If you see a blob, you can get a thief. The roaming creature model does not match what you fight. You get a flower, you get 2 ogres. WTF\n\n2. Can't Move Around the Battlefield\nYes, you are stuck on a linear path with 1 enemy. You can't maneuver around to its back.\n\n3. Reaction Times Are Slowed\nModel turn speed is set really low.\n\n4. The City Size Does Not Match Its Model\nBig zone but tiny city model.\n\n5. Can't Control Camera Rotate\nCan't control the camera. It just rotates on its own.\n\n6. Surprisingly Confusing Skill Tech Build\nYou can't just plug and play Tech. It feels like a Street Fighter Game rather than a RPG.\n\n7. Repeating Models\n2 giant caterpillars, 1 green 1 yellow. 2 ladybugs, 1 red 1 orange. I know it's hard to do multiple models but just having 1 repeat simply due to a colour change is off-putting.\n\n8. Mini Games Are Weirdly Placed\nOn the bridge in Teathella, you have a lone Kat playing Red Light Green Light. Why?\n\n9. Wasted Quartz\n90% of the bosses don't have a weakness to an element. What's the point of using Quartz?\n\n10. Cooking is Lacklustre\nBattle over? Press J, Cook, heal and level up cooking. No difference from drinking potion. \n\n11. No Quick Jump\nYes, who would have thought that this is so important?\n\n12. No Main Quest Markers\nYes, having to guess certain parts of the story is really tedious.\n\n[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]\n1. 4 Rheairds\nNo need for 4. 1 is good enough.", "timestamp_created": 1568245785, "timestamp_updated": 1643528441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417015343904495239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55010619": {"recommendationid": "55010619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050666569", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2979, "last_played": 1567903203}, "language": "english", "review": "Exactly as I remembered.", "timestamp_created": 1567903560, "timestamp_updated": 1567903560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464512407779693604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54994643": {"recommendationid": "54994643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074165567", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "playtime_at_review": 483, "last_played": 1700277124}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores Tales Of que he jugado", "timestamp_created": 1567816538, "timestamp_updated": 1567816538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54981559": {"recommendationid": "54981559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110830942", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1547278727}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing it as a kid.

I still haven't played another Tales game. But this is a game that I will certainly return to over and over again. It's far from perfect, so let me list the downsides first. The overworld mechanics are a bit jank, leveling is too easy in the main game for veteran JRPG players, and the quests all start to feel a bit samey by last quarter of the game. The port from controller to keyboard is playable, but not great. And lastly, while many of the English voice actors kill their parts, others fall short to the point of some dialogue being a bit cringey.\n\nBut I don't want to downplay the immense strengths that this game has. Some parts have aged poorly, but the polished parts of this game may shine even brighter than they did in the last generations of gaming. This game still has much to offer as we reach the 2020's. \n\nFirstly, the combat system is very smooth and somewhat depthy. At first glance and even for an entire first playthrough, the combat may seem repetitive and button-mashy. A first time player can definitely complete the main game without too much haggling with or practice of the combat system. But the rewards of learning the proper mechanics are big. The game rewards players with clean combat mechanics GRADE points which among other things can be used to purchase in-game items. GRADE can be saved and accumulated to provide perks for repeat playthroughs. Each character has a unique battle style, and your friends can play multiplayer with you by controlling one of the members of your party. The weapon system is essentially as basic as it gets - as you get stronger and go to places with higher level enemies you find better weapons for members of your party. Weapons don't have a modification system per se, but lower tier weapons can be combined with crafting items to create higher level weapons. Leveling is straightforward and easy, you can't ever run out of enemies to battle and while in some places it may be necessary to grind levels, in general I rarely had to farm experience. For the the average RPGer, this game probably won't be the biggest challenge.\n\nAs far as other mechanics, the item system is easy to learn and straight forward. RPG veterans will pick it up without thinking about it much and new players to the genre will find the learning curve gentle. Simplicity isn't bad, but the whole \"the next city in the story will have a shop with better items\" formula is definitely dated and may feel jarring to those accustomed to the large-scale open-world games out today. Symphonia is most definitely an open-world game, but it takes a good amount of time to be able to freely explore the world as you please.\n\nThe world-building and story progression happen at excellent paces. The game lays a fairly linear path for the first half of the game, then lets the player run wild over the world maps for the second half. While the overworld itself has some mechanical issues the maps each feel like unique worlds. As said above some of the dialogue isn't the greatest, but the overarching main story and the underlying individual character stories are mostly excellent. The themes vary from light and comedic to grim and violent. While the darkest pieces of the story are insinuated, adult players will see the many shades of grey this story takes, most especially in the second half of the story. In some stories the player or reader is given much more information than the characters in the story are given. But in Tales Of Symphonia the player mostly learns information at the same time the characters themselves do. This helps the story feel personal and like you are effecting change in the game. The blend between fantasy and sci-fi is introduced elegantly and far better than any other attempt at such a crossover I've seen. The world does change as you play, sometimes abrubtly and drastically, sometimes subtly. Many NPCs have different things to say at different points in the game. The setting changes drastically many times in the game but in ways that make sense to the story.\n\nGraphically this game isn't a powerhouse and it wasn't intended to be. It's the first 3D title this developer ever made, I believe. But the style is bright and charismatic. The 2D cutscenes are fairly few and far between but are absolutely beautiful, just watching the intro cutscene before the start menu is impressive. Symphonia enemies have awesome character models and are wildly different types of creatures from start to finish. Enemies have unique looks and styles. Each city and village also has its own style and all feel separate from each other. The art style is very colorful and pleasing to look at. I particularly love the artstyle of one late-game area.\n\nLastly, the soundtrack. While not showered in the accolades that Final Fantasy, Zelda, Elder Scrolls, and other RPGs receive for their soundtracks, this is a supremely outstanding soundtrack. There's 4 entire hours of themes and songs in this soundtrack. The music always sets the tone of the setting well. The character themes are simply excellent and do well to capture the personalities of each character. Even though lots of different instruments and styles of music are used at different times, the soundtrack sounds like one cohesive whole when played standalone. One piece I love from the soundtrack is this one: https://youtu.be/o_PCgbplpj4?t=3885\n\nI'll end this already-too-long review quickly. Tales Of Symphonia impacted me a lot when I was growing up, and it impacted me again when I replayed it last year. I'm about to dive into another playthrough, and I know there will be details I hadn't noticed before in the many times I've completed it. I love this game, even with its age and its minor flaws.

And you don't have to play all of them in order. Then I bought this game and I love the story so far and I think I'm fairly close to the end. Also decent combat mechanics for a game that is from 2003. Only downside is that it was made for console so it took some time (probably 30min+) to figure out how to use the rest of the combat ability buttons as the keybinds showed only as d-pad buttons. Overall a great game and I'm definitely buying the rest of the Tales games that are on Steam.

The style makes it hold up pretty well.\n\nThe sound is used well to create mood for certain areas, but it is similar to fantasy rpg music of it's era.\n\nThe gameplay, including the menu and UI, does not mesh well with keyboard, but plug an xbox controller in and you'll be good to go. It is fun, but depending on how much you grind to overlevel, or avoid fighting, really makes the difficulty. Grind a lot, it's easy, grind less, it's harder. In summary though, the gameplay is action based, and is quite fun when you figure out the combo mechanics. Add in that you get a list of allies to experiment with, and can play local co-op with friends, and it's top notch.\n\nThe story, and characters are where the game shines. Running jokes, albeit simple ones, the characters and the way they evolve, it's all just done extremely well.\n\nIf you are the type of person to get immersed in the story of a world, I would definitely say this would be the game for you.\n\nAs a final note, this is probably one of my personal top 10 games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1561931825, "timestamp_updated": 1561931825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52620139": {"recommendationid": "52620139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056419837", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1673324246}, "language": "english", "review": "First I'll get to the goods and the bads.\n\nGoods: \n   -Good story.\n   -Nice balance in the difficulty settings; you can make the game easy or hard enough for you. \n   -Great mechanics and battle system.\n   -Charming visuals if you're into cell-shading.\n   -Replayability and post-game are quite extensive.\n   -Hours of gameplay, tons of them.\n   -Incredible soundtrack.\nBads:\n   -Sometimes it's easy to break; making you reload saves that might be far away.\n   -Not all the mechanics and items are as easy to pick up as someone might expect.\n   -Quite a bad port, textures aren't great and framerate is capped, problems with V-Sync.

I loved it, every single time I played it, and ended up completing it 15 times on the GameCube, 3 of them being 100% which is quite challenging. Characters are great, they are constantly evolving in what in my opinion is a great story line. The visuals were nice back in the day, although now a bit of an overhaul is absolutely needed (There are texture packs for the game if you so desire). The soundtrack is incredible, maybe a bit too synth-y, but absolutely a masterpiece.

Empieza lento pero luego se pone muy interesante, y hay muchos giros inesperados, dolorosos y una trama extremadamente buena, much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s compleja de lo que parece en un principio.\n\nEl sistema de combate es divertido y puedes usar a 9 personajes distintos, por lo que nunca acaba cansando. Es f\u00e1cil jugar, pero dif\u00edcil hacerlo bien manejando t\u00e1cticas y dando \u00f3rdenes a los personajes. Tiene un sistema de combate en tiempo real en el que te puedes mover en l\u00ednea recta hacia el enemigo que has fijado en una zona que s\u00ed es 3D. La dificultad es bastante elevada, pero en novato puede pasarlo cualquiera. En general no hace falta farmear experiencia ni dinero excepto para alguna misi\u00f3n secundaria.\n\nEn definitiva, si te gustan los JRPGs, historias que te invitan a pensar y te hacen sentir emociones y no te dan miedo unos gr\u00e1ficos buenos pero de hace a\u00f1os, c\u00f3mpralo.

After that game I set my eyes out on Symphonia and eventually tried it out. The battle system is different and a bit more challenging, since there's no free run in this game. However it makes jumping useful, adding a layer of strategy to it. At the end of the game my party was just under level 75. It was a lot more grind heavy than I expected, as the EXP gained is much less than Vesperia's. This was my first playthrough though, so I haven't done NG+ yet to make things a lot easier. Some of the dungeons are a tad too short in my opinion, specifically the early game dungeons. However I do like that the Sorcerer's Ring in this game got a lot more functionality, and the dungeons take advantage of it instead of just stunning enemies. This made some of the puzzles more interesting. The story was pretty good, albeit kind of predictable, though it dealt with more serious topics which I liked a lot. The main cast was really likable and well-integrated into the story. \n\nThis game is too good to pass up on Steam so it's well worth the 20 bucks for 60-70+ hours of content.

I tried to keep my expectations in check going into this game, just so I would not end up disappointed, and I sure as hell wasn't!\n\nThe battle system in ToS is pretty basic compared to more recent Tales of games, but its simplicity is what makes it good. I guess the only compliment I can pay it is that after 40+ hours of gameplay, I made it to the final dungeon and I did NOT try to avoid any battles.\nThe best thing about ToS has to be the characters, which are VERY well fleshed out throughout the journey, due in no small part to the fantastic skits. The interactions between the party members were very well done, and the skits helped provide an insight into the party members' different personalities and their perspectives on various events and characters. \n\nThe plot was pretty solid and there were quite a few major twists that I did not see coming.

Party Shared EXP, no Random Encounters (Opting for a more Legend of Zelda 2 style of encounter, but actually done right) and minimalizing the management to a more workable level, great for newcomers to the genre. It focuses on realtime action battles, story, and characters that will grow on you by the very moment you surpass 20 odd minutes of gameplay.\n\nThis has been my gateway into becoming the first tales game I ever played, and beat, the 2nd JRPG I've beaten, and has ignited a fire inside me to go seek out more tales games in the series.\n\n\n-----My Port Rant----- \n\nThe port only runs at 30fps.. but it never strayed for me.. 720P? even at 2k @27in I never felt that to really harm my immersion in the game (The world traversal being dated does that more then the graphics and port) \n\nI'd rather stick to the graphics I have as mods don't do a whole lot and seem to create more issues then they fix.\n\nBetween sound issues and translation issues.. I must be blind and deaf.. because it only took up maybe 2hr of my entire gameplay in seperate bite sized pieces worth of minor issues.. 2hr/100hrs plus (less then maybe 2% of my gameplay had issues only seeing 3 minor sound issues that really wasn't a deal breaker for me)\n\nsuriously this isn't Saints Row fuckin' 2 people.. just because the port isn't the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci doesn't mean it's terrible and should be disreguarded as trash. I know these PC master race guys wanna believe that everything has to be perfection or it's unholy rubbish. But in it's current state, I enjoyed it.\n\nAll issues could be fixed by simply alt-tabbing, waiting a moment or just having patience.. the game it's self requires that form the player so if you can't breath a little already the game might not be for you.\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\non a side note, if I had to complain about anything.. it's that this and Abyss don't have English voiced skits and at least this title has odd times where it chooses to voice something vs not.. it'll choose an oddly unimportant scene to voice fully, and then a scene where you're talking to someone of power or government, someone pretty freakin' big.. and they aren't voiced in any language.\n\nAnd the graphical art style and repetitive music that can get corny or a little too silly for my taste here kinda clash with the dark tones of the story going on here. I'm excited to see Abyss's art direction looks more up my alley. \n\nBut you can write this off by saying it's the first 3D game in the series and cemented it as a classic to build off of.. ~~unlike many games that opted into 3D and fell on their face...~~", "timestamp_created": 1554005299, "timestamp_updated": 1554005465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65894395112991333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49742688": {"recommendationid": "49742688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170068006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2875, "last_played": 1553389547}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a huge fan of the Tales series.

I picked it up and originally played through to completion on the Gamecube and instantly fell in love. The characters, the story, the combat, the soundtrack, and everything else about this game was amazing. As this title came to PC I had to play through it again and everything is beautifully transferred over onto the PC platform. The music is clear and the combat isn't clunky or choppy, it's just as smooth as ever. This JRPG is a gem of its genre and anyone that is a fan of RPGs or JRPGs must have this game in their arsenal. The only problem I could find for the PC port is that I ran into occasional typos within the dialogue which included a missing space in between words or a misspelled word by one or two letters.

Just need to get past the story.\n\nSYSTEM: A low power Celeron Thinkpad. Able to run it at nearly full HD. Not that I think it looks any better over DVD (720). Studders some on \"cut scenes\" but is completely playable.\n\nSTORY: So far is bargain basement garbage. Most of the characters are shallow, typical and light on interest. Example of some dialogue: \u201cThere is NO WAY I can continue living in a village that has a treaty with them!\u201d \u2026 next toon: \u201cYah. \u2026 \u201cSo can you come to the village tomorrow?\u201d I LOLed.\n\nGAME PLAY: Seems simplistic. Run there press A, run over there press A. Fighting is a sequence of spamming A, but there does look to be some potential with it. The movement controls seem to add a little bit of freedom and the targeting system is decent on the controller. But the basic mechanics still seem pretty weak. \n\nVOICE ACTING: Pretty great! I'm kinda shocked that such a silly story got such good actors. Every time they show up it is worth it. They delivered the above line I quote perfectly. First actor was passionate. Second actor totally nailed the \u201cyah\u201d whatevs.\n\nGRAPHICS: Better than I was expecting on this low graphical machine. An intel HD 3000 would do better than my little laptop that I'm running this on for a review. But the game holds up. Beter than pixal graphics which is a welcome relief.\n\nMUSIC: Changes up but is pretty typical fair for Zelda like RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1546065629, "timestamp_updated": 1546137546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409463256597518921", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47913861": {"recommendationid": "47913861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366214934", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1609479064}, "language": "english", "review": "the anime cutscenes look a billion times better than the actual graphics of this crap looking game.

The fight sequence is pretty choppy and a poor evolution from the original Tales game. Healing in the beginning is non-existent making just a little money grinding a difficult feat. They pit some out of balance mobs at you throughout various sequences of the game. For example snakes that poison you often in an area that gives 20-40 gald per battle. The movement and camera angles are horrid but on par for the time. And there are small glitches and bugs which should have been polished out of a game being ported a decade later.\n\nThe story is by far cliche and the characters are developed badly from the beginning and showed no signs of getting better. The Japanese voices made things a little better but only barely. I do appreciate the lack of over-blown conversation but believe that again was just a thing of the time since these days half the game could easily be nothing but conversaion and/or cutscenes. Don't even get me started on the bad walking animations which make everyone looks like their moonwalking everywhere.\n\nThough choppy the battle was fun though unfair. Biggest annnoyance was only the computer could change axis while my biggest compliment was smooth combo to tech transitioning for the most part. Though cliche I was hoping they would deviate from the typical story due to certain characteristics of your party. I wont mention others to avoid spoiling but my favorite character aspect was Lloyd being very savvy and intelligent despite being a typical school drop out character.

As I only came late into playing this port, I have not really experienced any problems with it and so it was generally fine by me. My problems with the game are with the game itself.\n\nLet's start with the story and characters. The overarching story of the game is delivered slowly. It trickles out like molasses and its delivery slows the further in as you progress. I won't go into specifics with the story except to say it was quite mundane and not all that compelling. It is a fairly typical save the world plot that tries to do plots twists, but they generally fall flat because it simply isn't an interesting world and the characters do not have strong enough personalities to hammer any real drama home. And as exposition slows down between gameplay segments later in the game, it becomes excruciating because the few crumbs you get to push you along in the game just stop coming in fast enough to justify continuing. \n\nThe aforementioned flat characters are not bad per se, but they are not interesting either.  I didn't hate the characters, but I did not love them either. There's nothing memorable about them. None of the characters have intriguing relationships with each other. And none of them experience arcs that are all that compelling either. The whole experience just feels very rote and cliche. It is like every JRPG ever was distilled into one homogenous, uninteresting blob of a game. \n\nThe gameplay, however, is where the game shifts from being just average to being dull and bad. The game relies extremely heavily on padding itself out with lots of traveling, lots of tedious exploration of uninteresting locales, and puzzles. Oh, gods, the puzzles just never ended. I feel like the puzzles had puzzles in this game. The first 1/3rd to 1/2th of the game wasn't so bad. The story beats came fast enough and the dungeons moved quickly enough that it was easy enough to overcome them; however, around those marks, the game just becomes such a grind. Each dungeon got longer and longer. The puzzles became more and more obtuse and vexing. When I thought the latest dungeon was bad and nothing could be worse, another dungeon would show up and prove how wrong I was. The combat is as uninspired and uninteresting as the rest of the game. It just devolves into mindless repetition of the same attacks in similar orders all the time. Just a beat 'em up that's even less compelling because it is a game that never ends. It just goes on and on and on\n\nAnd the world map? One of the worst implementations of a world map I've ever seen in a game. It is horrifically bad. And whoever designed it should have never went near game design again. And this isn't hyperbole. It's that bad.\n\nI couldn't beat the game because I had to stop. I couldn't stand it any more. I reached a dungeon that broke any desire I had to continue. I was about 80% of the way through the game and I could not do it any more. I really recommend against playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1540068922, "timestamp_updated": 1546022718, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.341273128986358643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45160970": {"recommendationid": "45160970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124091284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2967, "last_played": 1537701580}, "language": "english", "review": "Made me remember why i love to play jrpgs when i was in high school.", "timestamp_created": 1538929619, "timestamp_updated": 1538929619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702554941177368164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45125259": {"recommendationid": "45125259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060529464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1693911948}, "language": "english", "review": "played this for the Gamecube when it first came out, loved everything about the game, highly recommend to anybody that loves RPG's", "timestamp_created": 1538773974, "timestamp_updated": 1538773974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480295568704605103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45064125": {"recommendationid": "45064125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243124624", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 48563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 166, "playtime_at_review": 27037, "last_played": 1700754472}, "language": "english", "review": "Well this is worth my money, time and mabey even my life.\nTakes some time to get used to the keybored but if you have a controler your good. Either way this game has some of the best story, gameplay and replayability in any JRPG I have played. The short review is a 9/10 for making me play for over 700 hours.\n\nPros: Solid 30fps even on an week GPU like mine.\n-The game is long even just the story, but not to long.\n- English and japanese options.\n-Can make over 100 save files, so feel free to save before a boss to fight them again later if you want. (Just be careful not to save or your other saves)\n-The story and characters are amazing.\n-Soundtrack is amazing\n-Story will change in small (or in one rare case, large) ways deppending on your choices .\n-Characters gain xp even if they did not participate in the battle. So no one fall behind in level.\n-Each character has 2 diffrent paths of what skills/attacks they will learn depending on the ex-gems you use. So you can play the game with diffrent skills and attacks a second time if you wish.\n-No level requiremnents for any story component. (so no nessasry grinding)\n-No less than 10 titles for each charater to obtain. (titles are like achivements, one can be used at a time per character for a small buff or costume change)\n-Costumes for dressing up. (because why not)\n-The grade points you get after every battle can be spent on a new-game+ to start over again with buffes or debuffes to change the game. (Including a free mania difficulty for those who want to go through hell)\n\n\nCons: No fps options, it's locked at 30\n-Graphycs have not aged to well and look a little odd in cutscens. Battles look great though.\n-Cutscenes cannot be skiped and there are alot of them, ok the first time but on a second playthrough your just waiting for them to be over.\n-Many of the compound unison attacks have audio problems and the voices are hard to hear.\n-Early game is tuff with the lack of hp, sp and attacks you have. (You will die alot.)\n-Some titles give stats and others give cosmetics but you can't have both at once.\n-Many of the temple puzzles are slow or just suck. (Some are good)\n-The few sidequest the game has are fun for the most part and have unique bosses and tittles. However these quests and even the 2 best ones (Niflheim and The devil arms) can only be done after opening the door to the final boss chamber and are extreamly easy to overlook. You will need a guide.\n-The casino is needed to get... a crappy costumes that glitches and clips (for me at least), a useless item so you can fill your item list, and 1 of the 9 devel arms. 3 shitty items that take either 10min or 10hours of gambling to get.\n-Each character has a special tittle that only one of witch be gotten per playthrough. (so to get every tittle you would have to play the game 8 times assumeing you dont miss any of the others) This game is hell on completionists.\n-The mystic arts look amazing are a super strong but will almost never be used unless you are trying and going out of your way to pull one off. This makes them unpractical for combat.\n\n\nI got this on on sale for 10 dollars and god damn it was worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1538519217, "timestamp_updated": 1546073959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497276097536087036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45001817": {"recommendationid": "45001817", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997768555", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 142, "playtime_forever": 2893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2893, "last_played": 1472915550}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yeah", "timestamp_created": 1538229583, "timestamp_updated": 1538229583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45001775": {"recommendationid": "45001775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029233296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1924, "last_played": 1513684849}, "language": "english", "review": "nope", "timestamp_created": 1538229456, "timestamp_updated": 1538229456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.0883137285709381104", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44991566": {"recommendationid": "44991566", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998926239", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 145, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1538165802}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Se ve muy llamativo en todo, pero la jugabilidad no me gusto, pense que era un rpg tipo chrono cross o similar.", "timestamp_created": 1538178442, "timestamp_updated": 1538178442, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.326415717601776123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44939296": {"recommendationid": "44939296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076880873", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 8479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4927, "last_played": 1649968434}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Recomendadisimo 11/10\nLa saga tales se ha reconocido por sacar juegos excelenter y este no es la exepcion siendo un juego muy destacable por su historia compleja y profunda y con un contexto politico incluso\nel rendimiento del juego es muy bueno aunque se queda fijo en los 30 fps y eso es algo que a muchos no les gusta\ntiene buena jugabilidad, accion y es de los pocos jrpg que se puede jugar cooperativamente junto a un hermano o amigo\ny sencillamente da nostalgia ya que este juego nacio en el game cube y llego a pc, espero con ansias el port de ToS2 para pc\n", "timestamp_created": 1537919699, "timestamp_updated": 1537919699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44769415": {"recommendationid": "44769415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116172568", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2953, "last_played": 1556430056}, "language": "english", "review": "Ports fine, played the whole game with no issues.

I must say there is a lot to like about Tales of Symphonia, but also quite a few niggling details which undermined my appreciation of the game. This is my second Tales game that I've ever played, with Tales of Phantasia being the first, so I'm fairly new to the series, but I like what I see so far.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Art Style[/h1]\n\nTales of Symphonia was originally a GameCube game, but I think it looks pretty darn good. It has a cartoonish look to it, but the colors are vibrant, the important characters \"pop\" visually in my opinion, and everything just works pretty well. It's graphically fairly ugly, but quite pretty in terms of art style, which I think makes up for the lack of graphical capabilities at the time the game was originally made. The user interface was very nice for the menus in and out of combat, text was easy to read, and yeah...just quite nice. There are 2D full-on anime cutscenes, but they are [i]extremly[/i] rare. Those look great! Oh, and towns are visually wonderful, in my opinion. No two towns looked similar to me, which is really saying something in a JRPG from more than a decade ago.\n\n[h1]Music\\Sound[/h1]\n\nThe music in this game is pretty great. I don't normally go for anime songs, but I will confess that I watched the opening music video/intro to this game at least a dozen times and still adore it. I will likely go back sometime in the near future and listen through the whole soundtrack on YouTube.\n\nVoice acting is wonderful here, in my opinion. Although it's disappointing that there are a lot of unvoiced lines, most plot-relevant dialog is generally voice-acted, and I think that the actors they got for each character worked just great. The main protagonist is basically Robin's voice from Teen Titans (yes, it's that voice actor), and I think it works excellently with the character. The characters seemed more cartoonish than like \"real people\" in regard to their voicing, but given the plot and art design for the characters, I think the voices chosen were a great fit.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\n\nDespite originally being released on console, this game has been brought to PC with customizable controls! Bless their hearts. 10/10 on that front. Everything was very responsive and I'm wholly satisfied concerning ToS' controls.\n\n[h1]Story/Characters[/h1]\n\nStory-wise, I was fairly pleased with ToS. Sadly, it goes the route of having \"hope\" have actual power at one point, and other such sappy, eye-rolling stuff. However, the majority of the time, the game uses logic and reason, and its characters even go into detail while talking with one another about making rational decisions rather than emotional ones, because the main protagonist means well but is so eager to rush to a solution that he might take dumb risks when a different approach is ideal. He is certainly a highly moral idealist steeped in naivete and good intentions, but he is no \"Gary Stu\" (a too-perfect character), as his anger and rushing is a clear weakness, and he isn't all that smart.\n\nDarnit, I'm drifting into talking about the characters. I'm having a difficult time resisting! Back on the story first, though, it's pretty good, but a lot of odd lore that isn't focused on long enough to feel fleshed out or make a lot of sense to me was in there, and several parts of the storyline felt like \"padding\" just to add to the length of the game. I liked quite a bit of the plot, but fair amounts did put me off.\n\nOkay, back to the characters. This is the pinnacle of the game for me: its protagonists and their interactions. There are little dialogs/skits between your characters which you can trigger by pushing a button when prompted (it stays available to press for quite a while). In it, your characters make little anime facial expressions like laughing, pouting, being snarky, etc., and they talk about whatever is in their minds, such as the quest at hand, a piece of lore, or even just slice-of-life stuff like messing with one another or talking about their values. If I had to pick a favorite thing in the game, these dialogs/skits between characters are it. I think more games need dialog like this between its characters to make them feel more like people and less like simply tools for combat.\n\nMoreover, I really liked the characters themselves and they had great dialog and chemistry together. I didn't really like Presea or Regal at all, aside from their usefulness in fights, as they were the least fun to me in the dialogs/skits, and Regal gimps the party's combat efficiency because he's pouty (he literally refuses to use his hands in fights in favor of his feet, out of remorse for something he did, even though he is jeopardizing the fate of every living being in the world by doing so.\n\nThe main villain is largely well-written. Of course, the villain inevitably does some rather mustache-twirling cliche evil stuff that cheapened the villain some, but over all, I was really pleased here, because when taking into consideration what the villain has been through, then subtracting almost all morality based on those experiences and a loss of \"humanity\" over time, a lot of the villain's intentions and goals actually made sense...really messed up and evil sense. No \"I want to kill everyone because I'm evil.\" There are reasons for the killing and the things the villain wants to do, even if it will ruin and/or end lives.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nCombat is kinda 2.5D. By that, I mean it's on a 2D axis, but characters can move behind one another and be angled a bit on a Z axis around enemies, etc. It plays very much like Tales of Phantasia, which I found kinda fun. You slash enemies, cast spells (character-dependent), have four characters and can set whomever you like to automatically do certain types of tasks in fights...it works well, for the most part. I will say one gripe: Zelos will not use his tier 2 combat skills (non-spells) automatically, no matter what strategies you set him to. You have to manually instruct him each time you want him to use one, which is pretty invasive. That said, I whooped the game just fine without him using those and he was usually in my combat party.\n\nBoss fights were surprisingly easy for me. Block a bunch, have a bunch of healers in your party, set them to prioritize healing, chip away at the boss' health, and use ridiculously cheap restorative items to refill TP (basically mana/MP). A few were challenging, but that was rare. There are higher difficulties that will make you bleed, supposedly, so no worries if you do want a challenge. I only did grinding a couple of times here and there, and it largely doesn't seem to be needed. Killing every enemy you see at every possible chance (including on the world map) seems like it would do the trick.\n\nOther than padding out the plot, I believe that the game's dungeons were its biggest padding problem. While a few dungeons were just wander-around-and-find-treasure-chests-or-go-to-your-goal, which is A-OK (and preferred by me, like in Chrono Trigger!), the majority of them have puzzles that can take a frustrating amount of time to solve. These added many hours to my play time. I love the Portal games, I had fun with Zelda games back in the day, and lots of other puzzles have delighted me, but these really got under my skin and padded out my play time. I would estimate that a good 8 hours was spent wandering around trying to solve puzzles...probably more, really. I never enjoyed the puzzles and I eventually got so tired of them that I finally just used a walkthrough for every dungeon in the last third of the game. It spoiled some things but was worth it to me as I had gotten very bored.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAlmost out of room! Awful and excessive dungeons, a few weak plot points, but everything else was GREAT. I'm glad I played through this one time (doubt I'll touch it again) for $4.99 on sale.

I enjoyed the game from the very beginning and have enjoyed it to the end (except for one section that stressed me out). The story follows Lloyd Irving, a human boy who has been raised by a dwarf for the majority of his life. During his time at school, he would also meet Genis Sage, an elf and is the smart one of the trio, and Colette Brunel, a clumsy girl, and is also the current Chosen of Regeneration, who would go on an adventure to regenerate the world (which is basically saving the world). Along the way, you'll meet more allies along the way, each one being unique in their own ways, like their specialties and many other aspects, which you'll learn as you progress through the game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWhen you're in combat against the monsters of the game, you'll be in a 3D field. However, when locking into an enemy, you'll only have 2D movement, so you can only move left and right (away and towards the enemy). During combat, you can do the following things:\n\n-Attack: Be able to do a simple combo attack (which can range from 3 to 6 hits max)\n-Guard: Block most physical attacks (besides magic attacks)\n-Techs: Moves that use up TP to allow you to use powerful attacks, magic and defensive moves\n-Menu: Allows you to pause combat to equip items, use items, change formations, change tech bindings or choose techs for your allies to use and to escape combat (besides boss battles)\n\nOutside of combat, you will be in an open-world environment, where you can encounter enemies and travel to different towns, dungeons and other locations across Sylvarant, where you can go to towns to stock up on items and weapons, sleep in inns to restore your HP and TP (for a price, of course) and sometimes, for plot reasons. \n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\n+Simple to learn, but hard to master combat system\n+Unique and interesting cast of characters that are memorable, each one having a deep story\n+Good soundtrack, especially in boss battles\n+Lots of locations that can offer you many things to do\n\nCons:\n\n-Restriction to only 30 fps\n-Movement on keyboard can be cumbersome in 3D Environment\n-Unable to change key binding to other keys\n-No markers on where to go next, which can leave new players confused\n-No way of knowing about things like Side Quests and progress on them\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the end of my first playthrough of the game, I loved the game to bits. I had some issues here and there sometimes, but I was able to overcome them in the end (sometimes by looking through a guide). I still remember the characters, even after weeks after playing it, showing how well the characters were handled and how invested one can be on the main cast, even the Antagonists as well.\n\nI do see that a lot of people do recommend that you should try the GameCube version, but I will say that just choose which version you want to play and well, just play that version. \n\nI hope that this review will help people choose to either buy the game and invest themselves in a possible 50-60+ hour game, or to avoid it, and possibly play the more recent Tales of games, like Berseria and in the future, Tales of Vesperia, which is coming out at some point this year (if I got that correct).", "timestamp_created": 1532368725, "timestamp_updated": 1532368725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43699604": {"recommendationid": "43699604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138374463", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1515, "last_played": 1563709864}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1532357019, "timestamp_updated": 1532357019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43673740": {"recommendationid": "43673740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124203554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4886, "last_played": 1534139054}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect RPG", "timestamp_created": 1532237037, "timestamp_updated": 1532237037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43658197": {"recommendationid": "43658197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128969056", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1673, "last_played": 1606749451}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first bought this game on steam, it was extremely difficult to set it up with my HoriPad (turns out you're meant to do it in Big Picture Mode) and the game kept crashing for no reason after a couple of minutes, but somehow I got it to work by simply persisting, and boy was it worth it.

There are a lot of things I didn't notice at first that could've helped make the game easier earlier on. Look up some mechanics because not all are explained completely (at least to my knowledge). For example, I had no idea that synopsis helped you find the next area you should go and continue quests. All in all a great game with a lot to do.

Es una verdadera joya, eso si, le tendr\u00e1s que invertir horas y horas para descubrir sus secretos si quieres terminarlo al 100%\n\nUna cosa es clara, la paciencia es la que necesitar\u00e1s para jugar, las primeras 10 horas de juego son un deleite, la historia est\u00e1 muy bien estructurada, no tiene pierde a la hora de jugarlo, personajes con carisma, seriedad e humor, en este apartado nada que reprocharle, es un juego que est\u00e1 a la altura de un Final Fantasy o incluso podr\u00eda estar a la par de Chrono Trigger, lo cu\u00e1l es mucho decir. El juego te entretiene bastante, como ya he dicho, lo he jugado teniendo la GameCube que a mi parecer es una de las mejores versiones aparte de que el intro de la canci\u00f3n en esta versi\u00f3n, es la japonesa, una pena que no incluyan la del GameCube, pues va m\u00e1s acorde pero cada quien supongo.\n\nEl sistema de combate es excelente, puedes manejarlo de manera manual, semi aut\u00f3matico o autom\u00e1tico e incluso puede jugar con un compa\u00f1ero, obviamente cada uno con su control, jugar con el teclado no lo recomiendo para nada, es complejo jugar con teclado y mouse, en el juego ya te van diciendo como es el sistema de combate y de qu\u00e9 maneras vas desbloqueando habilidades.\n\nAhora bien, este juego cuenta con demasiados secretos e incluso misiones opcionales que no son para nada aburridos, es m\u00e1s es un plus para dar descanso a la trama principal, ya que te dan beneficios, uno de los apartados es que al principio del juego puedes seguir la trama de los primeros sellos (calabozos) en el orden que quieras a partir del segundo sello, esto no altera para nada la trama al contrario, te beneficia.\n\nPuntos en contra, la traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol de espa\u00f1a para los subtitulos, es un asco, no corresponde a lo que est\u00e1n diciendo salvo que una que otra ocasi\u00f3n si lo hace pero si, es un asco la traducci\u00f3n que se hace en este apartado.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos podr\u00edan no ser los mejores dadao que es un juego que sali\u00f3 hace mucho y este es un port directo de la versi\u00f3n de PlayStation por lo que el intro suena con la m\u00fasica japonesa, lo cu\u00e1l no est\u00e1 nada mal pero la versi\u00f3n de GameCube quedaba mejor.\n\nEste punto es dudoso pero tengo que mencionar la c\u00e1mara cuando vas explorando al mundo abierto, si no mal recuerdo, la camara no me daba tantos problemas en GameCube, extra\u00f1amente en esta versi\u00f3n si le encuentro un fallo, no la siento tan igual como en la versi\u00f3n del cubo pero como dije, es dudoso porque no me acuerdo bien.\n\nSalvo por esos dos puntos en contra, todo lo dem\u00e1s, m\u00fasica, combates, personajes memorables, escenario abierto, objetos por encontrar y varias misiones opcionales, es un juego que te va a entretener por horas y horas, pero le tienes que invertir, no es un JRPG que acabes en una semana a no ser que de verdad tengas mucho tiempo libre, la historia es un verdadero deleite.

Dont get me wrong, the game is good, but it isnt any better than its Gamecube release.  There is higher resolutions and some small graphics options, but the game still looks very similar to the original release. \nThe game itself was brilliant for its time.  JRPG game, but in a beat 'em-up action format.  This game helped push the popularity of Cel Shaded graphics along with LOZ: Wind Waker and Viewtiful Joe.\n\nTOS is an action JRPG.  It is a blend of Cell shaded and 3d graphics.  The story is about yourself and a few loyal friends that have to travel to take the Chosen to her Destination so she can perform a ritual to save the world from the forces of evil.  The story is good, but it does meander at times.  Some twists and turns are pretty far-fetched, but hey, JRPG. \n\nCombat is done in side scrolling format.  Somewhat like the brawlers of old - Streets of Rage and Double Dragon.  There is a combination of button mashing and special actions when engaging the enemy.  There are different armour and weapons you can aquire through battles or quests. The weapons asthetics change, but the look of your character is the look of your character.  The character progression is good, but not really that deep.  \n\nOverall Conclusion - If you loved playing TOS the first time, this should bring back those warm memories of the PS2 or Gamecube.  Without the glow of nostalgia, this game really doesnt shine that bright.  \n\nI still recommend it due to it being a faithful recreation, but for new players, there are much better JRPG's to sink your time into. \n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1530912433, "timestamp_updated": 1530912433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43332611": {"recommendationid": "43332611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415743006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1530818991}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1530818334, "timestamp_updated": 1530818334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461373358964920044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43310769": {"recommendationid": "43310769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025020253", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 108, "last_played": 1545714119}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will not work.

eleg\u00ed no seguir\"\n\nTales of Symphonia nos narra la  historia de las moribundas tierras de  Sylvarant y su lucha por el man\u00e1 que da la vida a todos los seres, y en como cada cierto tiempo al perderse el man\u00e1  aparecen m\u00e1s enemigos que asolan la tierra y la vida se vuelve dif\u00edcil, por ello es enviada una persona elegida para que con su peregrinaci\u00f3n el mundo y el man\u00e1 sean regenerados.\n\nComo premisa b\u00e1sica ToS es un juego que en sus primeras horas parecer\u00e1 una trama clich\u00e9, pero de forma extraordinaria sabe cambiar de rumbo en el momento adecuado y hacerse impredecible, haciendo que de un momento a otro te sientas enganchado en la trama, no tengo que mencionar que la trama como tal est\u00e1 muy bien construida y argumentalmente todos los personajes que se ven tienen un peso y valor siendo no solamente \"decorados\", aclaro que para quien guste de este tipo de tramas, tambi\u00e9n tiene un trasfondo filos\u00f3fico como conceptos como la igualdad y dem\u00e1s, es una trama extensa as\u00ed que prepara unas palomitas y t\u00edrate unos d\u00edas pasando esta joya...\n\nMec\u00e1nicamente hay poco que pueda hablar siendo muy t\u00e9cnico pues mi experiencia con juegos del genero JRPG y similares tales como Zelda es poca, sin embargo he escuchado muchas comparativas al momento de hablar de mazmorras, algunos combates y dem\u00e1s... pues as\u00ed hablar\u00e9 desde mi punto de vista.\nDestaco enormemente el sistema de combate y puzzles pues son los que m\u00e1s resaltan al momento de jugar, el combate es un sistema similar a un hack n slash pero un tanto m\u00e1s automatizado, y el sistema de puzzles funciona de manera similar que en otros juegos, apelando m\u00e1s a la exploraci\u00f3n,  si bien gran parte de estos se llevan a cabo como ya he dicho en mazmorras su elaboraci\u00f3n es magistral dando paso a que mec\u00e1nicamente todos estos elementos congenian bien, \n\nEn relaci\u00f3n al port, tengo poco que hablar, tuve algunos problemas de fps al principio pero al mover ajustes de tarjeta gr\u00e1fica el juego iba a 60 fps estables, sin embargo es un juego que visualmente ha envejecido un tanto mal no de forma total pues algunos detalles como los personajes est\u00e1n muy pulidos mientras que el mapa y otros entornos est\u00e1n muy pobremente terminados (Siempre entendiendo que estaba sujeto a la sexta generaci\u00f3n y sus limitantes) aunque es un detalle que en horas de juego pasa desapercibido, por lo que a lo dem\u00e1s respecta el juego tiene gr\u00e1ficos propios de su generaci\u00f3n y que con su toque anime da buen aspecto.\n\nEn relaci\u00f3n a la banda sonora o efectos de sonido, resalto que el juego tiene m\u00fasica en casi cualquier momento y est\u00e1 muy bien  colocada, desde m\u00fasica de aspecto medieval hasta completas \"sinfon\u00edas\", por no hablar de que siempre tiene ese toque oriental en sus melod\u00edas, para mayor resumen el tema de Land of Sylvarant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwsQ50Au4k \nQue te acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 en gran parte de la aventura.\n\nA grandes rasgos es un videojuego de rol japon\u00e9s el cual es dif\u00edcil encontrar un fallo pese a su tiempo en el mercado, pues cuenta con grandes virtudes, y por ello es un videojuego que enteramente es recomendable tanto para fans del g\u00e9nero y tem\u00e1tica as\u00ed como para nuevos jugadores y experimentadores, prometiendo no solo una cantidad enorme de horas de juego, sino un guion rico en trama y personajes, as\u00ed como una gran banda sonora.\n\nPrecio:

In this game you play as a young man named Lloyd who starts the game living in a country village and ends up going on a journey with his friends to attempt to \"regenerate\" the dying planet. Here is an overview of some notes I took while playing.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fun combat system. It's fast paced with free movement. Build combo attacks, counter attack and spend a lot of time blocking,\n+ I enjoyed all the cities and villages I encountered. Lots of people to speak to and interact with.\n+ The characters are interesting. Lloyd is a fun protagonist to play as because of his youthful immaturity sometimes.\n+ The voice overs are good, I just wish there was more of them.\n+ The story is not fantastic, but it is solid enough to keep me interested and moving forward. The synopsis of the story and events that you can view in-game is a good feature and I used it a lot.\n+ The game can take anywhere between 50-90 hours to beat depending on how much you wish to complete.\n+ You can get this game on sale for $5. That is a steal for a game of this quality.\n\nCONS:\n- The graphics aren't fantastic but the game was originally made back in 2004 for the Nintendo Gamecube so I didn't punish it too much for that.\n- By the end of the game, the combat will feel repetitive. You will start actively trying to avoid some fights, at least I did.\n- I had to use a strategy guide a good amount while playing because I did not know where I had to go next. There are two worlds and a lot of locations within them so sometimes I forgot where certain places were located. I kinda wished they would have marked locations on the map better. Maybe I'm just lazy I guess.\n- I was disappointed in the small amount of anime cut scenes in the game. I was expecting more than there actually were. There are only about 6 of them and the majority are near the end of the game.\n\nOverall I would rate this game a 7.5 out of 10. It is a fun JRPG with fast paced combat.

Fun and intuitive without being shallow. Any game with no frustrating or damaging glitches - or features - earns an above average score from me, due to the high number of games which fail to meet even that low standard. This goes a bit beyond that to remain engaging throughout the playthrough.\n\nStory: 8/10 It looks to be incredibly cliche at the start of the game, but after a few hours you'll notice it beginning to slowly veer away in another direction. Without giving anything away, there are definitely cliche components to it throughout, but the way they are strung together and the way it's handled makes this a great experience. A few genuinely unexpected plot twists certainly help keep things fresh and interesting. It's not a dark story by any means, even if there are a few things which could get really dark if you think about them too much, but it also isn't a sugery-sweet frolic through a meadow. The ultimate theme seems to be racism, but it's glossed over to keep things light and shouldn't be approached with intellectual expectations. Feels primarily like a high-fantasy adventure.\n\nCharacters: 6/10 It pains me to give them such a low rating because I like them so much, but they really aren't unique in any way in terms of writing quality. A bit cliche at times, but it's no worse than the standard fare for the genre and better than many games I've played. Doing lots of sidequests will flesh out their personalities nicely, but most of the characters aren't especially deep. There is definitely some character development however, so don't expect them to remain static.\n\nMusic: 6.5/10 Lots of distinct tracks which work well in context, but very few pieces which are fun to listen to in their own right. Raine's, Kratos' and Mithos' themes are notable for their quality and/or versatility in use.\n\nGraphics: 6/10 The effects work well with each other, but they're outdated graphics by now and they're too cartoony to hold up over time. They weren't anything special upon release either. Not awful but certainly not up to par anymore.\n\nLength: 8/10 The shortest playthrough I've ever done was 36 hours, and that was with a walkthrough to help me maximize my efficiency. The game feels neither too short nor too long, though the Boring RPG Intro Segment could certainly use some trimming to help it hit its stride earlier. Intro Section lasts 2-3 hours before getting into the real meat of the game.\n\nOverall: 7/10 Enjoyable, engaging, pretty enough for its age, but not the best entry in the series.

So that means that while it has all the extra little goodies that the PS2 version had (some minor additions like some sidequests, costumes, somewhat updated secret dungeon, etc), it has a downgraded visual fidelity (battles run at 30fps instead of the Gamecube version's 60, cel-shading isn't as good, textures are a bit rougher, etc) and it lacks local co-op (where up to four players could play during the battle scenes, one player controling one of the active party members).\n\nStill, it's a (mostly) good port - it works and doesn't have any major problems.", "timestamp_created": 1527185633, "timestamp_updated": 1527185633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793989956378936768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42167446": {"recommendationid": "42167446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055729436", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7886, "last_played": 1590229013}, "language": "english", "review": "Great JRPG with a good story, music and gameplay.

I can guarantee now the review and suggestion mostly because the nostalgia alone.\n\nI never played ToS before , so nostalgia involved. from the first minute you found it very cliche. yes JRPG is about cliche and trope , but ToS is just next level. mind you I've played Tales of Vesperia , Zestria , Xillia that also cliche but still fun and acceptable. ToS is just plain cliche. the cartoony art feel like it is forced, and playing it on 1st hour is really hard to bear. and don't make me compare with Berseria because the difference could be night and day\n\nMovement feels clunky , it is somewhat acceptable because this is an old title , but I guess it's worth mentioning because I don't really like how we navigate around the game.\n\nCharacter feels like a plain trope. yes common JRPG trope , but they didn't add variance to the character , their dialogue is on point with the trope without eonugh twist, the good swordsman is just good swordsman , the good priestess is just good priestess , etc. period. I didn't find any twist around 1/3 of the game maybe.\n\nCombat is your usual tales , with this being barebone of the system , it's fun for those who like tales combat.\n\nSoundtrack is really catchy and JRPG-ish , melodic and has characteristic. I guess you can't never beat an old JRPG title for melodic soundtack.\n\nI stopped playing , watch let's play on youtube , on 10 ~ 15 hours , I still didn't find the game gonna be exciting soon , just ToS plain pacing and progression , so I choose to drop this game and take a refund instead.\n\nTL;DR The game lacks a lot and I prefer you to get other tales like Zestria , or for more mature and polished story , go with Berseria instead. but if you really like ToS, or just wanted to find first JRPG to play , this game might be for you. the problem is if this is not your first/early JRPG , you'll find the game really lack a lot for the genre", "timestamp_created": 1526892210, "timestamp_updated": 1526892210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.310859799385070801", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42146719": {"recommendationid": "42146719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352170491", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 686, "last_played": 1531142266}, "language": "english", "review": "when i was still have my ps2 tho, i used to play a lot of RPG games like this. thats why i bought this game. great fantasy action, great story line. if u are half weab , you will enjoy this game", "timestamp_created": 1526842075, "timestamp_updated": 1526842075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511160671710968018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42132958": {"recommendationid": "42132958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041188414", "num_games_owned": 2297, "num_reviews": 285, "playtime_forever": 4048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4048, "last_played": 1501188231}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game.

Tales series are the best for a reason.\n\nTL;DR;\nGrapicshly outdated and not flawless port, there are few glitch here and there but overall it has a freaking awsome story and the game is loooooong minimum 30-40 hours guranteed and if you like take your time like i did ending up with 53.4h gameplay hours.\n\nAnd now let the longer review begin:\nKeep in mind i write these stuff as they get in my mind.. im lazy to sort them in sections sorry.\n\nThe game is old but old doesnt mean thrash. I would say old but gold. The grapics is outdated compared to Tales of Berseria and it doesnt feel like an anime-ish because the characters more like small characters so i would say chibi-ish but it's cute. Voice actors are nice but some text doesnt have voice acting (like random NPC's in towns but the story is 100% VA'ed)\n\nThe story is good, it starts intresting but it gets really really repeative after making the 4-5th pact with the spirits. There is a little cutscene what to do and you have a little diary which sums up the story what happend so far so if you read it thru you can get a small hint where you need to go but otherwise you will spend a LOT of time by searching where to go next so take my advice and download the world's map from the web so you will know exactly where is the town you seek for.\n\nCharacters are well worked. The tales series stronges point beside the great story is the character design imo and i loved them all in the anime. Sheena is the best waifu for me from the series and Colette was cute tho. The humor is there, the characters like to make fun of each others back and forth durring their adventure which is always nice. You can read/watch the funny skits for it.\n\nThe music is not that good but not that bad..average altho i liked some of the tracks.\n\nBig cons was for me the clunky movement around the world. My character was keep stucking in everything!! If you moved too close to the wall you got stuck to it and you had to move backward to unstuck yourself which was frustrating as hell especially navigating in small place dungeons or corridors. Also big cons was what i mentioned above the game doesnt give clear information where to go what to do and the game is freaking long so even if i use google or watch walkthru i was not sure if i already did something or not (you dont have to do the quests in order to proceed your adventure). Some puzzles was really unnecesary and annoying like the \"infinite labrynth mazes\" but most of the puzzles felt rewarding.\n\nCity design was useless in the game i mean the exploration had zero reward. Some city was unnecessary huge and it was not worth to explore it because you got nothing useful information from the NPC's and you cant collect any items in towns like opening chests or investigating objects there was just 0 interaction in towns beside talking to useless npcs. Every town has a item shop, inn, weapon and armor shop and a special cat expedition shop.\n\nI played the game on normal difficulty i guess and on some point it was really hard. I cant imagine how \"hard mode\" looks like. My characters was Lv 60-65+ at the end boss and i had to use nearly all of my items from my inventory which was 100% full with all kinds of heals and buffs potions.\n\nThere was always a nice twist in the story which kept the game going and when it felt it's going to finnaly end guess what.. it doesnt and it keep happened over and over again. By the end i was like: \"Pleeaase game, let me finish you already!!\" After i finnaly ended the game lots of questions was unanserwed so i was sad about it but after the credits rolls up it anserwed everything how the characters future will be, one question left unaserwed but google anserwed me that.\n\nDo i recommend this game for you?\n- Hell yes! Its worth to beat it one time and it often goes on 75-80% sales.\nWould i replay it?\n- I don't think so or not anytime soon. maybe after years i'll give another go.\nYou complain a lot about this game. is it really good?\n- As i said it has its cons which can be frustrating but for the story and characters it's really worth the struggle.\n\nFor fans i recommend the anime series too but before you watch the show you MUST complete the game because you wont understand the anime's plot and who does something and why does that, where they going and why etc. Game story knowledge is STRONGLY recommended before the show. PS: the show animation is freaking gorgeous!!\n\nRate: 7.5 out of 10\n\n(edit: for autumn badge)", "timestamp_created": 1524080525, "timestamp_updated": 1542980024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41462920": {"recommendationid": "41462920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255276037", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 539, "last_played": 1612184397}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my first rpgs, my first Tales of, and my most played gamecube game (800+ hours playing through multiple times with my sister when we were kids).\n\nIt has its issues, but hey, I'm awash in nostalgia.\n\nThe ps2 version (which the ps3 and steam versions are based off) adds more costumes, and a few more skills, sidequests and post-game content.

This was what I found when I did a dictionary search as I was wondering how the name was even related to the game. However, a WIKI period article highlighted a theological view which speaks to the theory where Orthodox  Christian theological and political thought are to complement one another by establishing mutual respect with neither institution showing dominance over one another.\nI leave that thought with you as I highlight the positives and negatives of this brilliant JRPG especially in light of finding out the meaning of symphonia.\n\n                                                                                         Positives\nCharacters\nEach character positions itself as a prime representation of a symphonian system. Therefore, they really fitted crucial roles while being overall enjoyable with an shounen feel to it. The protagonist is the normative portrayal of what most lovers of the anime shounen genre liked; not too bright but with a fierce position on justice and doing the right thing despite the consequences with of course the downright incredulous personality. With that set, prepare for an amalgation of all different personality types woven together to create a team that gets the job done. Based on when this was made, in the early 2000s, characters were an A plus.\n\nPlot\nI have already set you up with an introduction that explains the subtleness and yet brilliance of the creators of this game. It further highlights that each work of art and creative ventures, no matter the format, expresses the thoughts of its creator. The plot was engaging and encompasses a great deal of humanity\u2019s strengths and perils particularly in the area of standing up for what is right with the opposite of the coin being that you add more fuel to the fire instead of achieving the justice you think should have been the outcome. Should you intervene or not? It is an ethical and moral issue that in our day to day lives we pay least attention to however it poses a great necessity in achieving a moral society. Plot is an A\n\nGameplay for PC\nGameplay was fluid, I encountered little to no difficulty, however it can get a bit repetitive but that is one of the \u201cusual\u201d for JRPGs. The one thing that irked me a bit was that controls weren\u2019t sufficiently explained and for the longest while I had no BLOODY idea how to switch characters in battle and when I did it without knowing after my main control died\u2026let\u2019s just say I was busy watching the battle. Also, what is the purpose of manual control for characters; to allow them to stand and get pummeled? That makes no sense, don\u2019t put an option that won\u2019t work how you intend it to. A minus for gameplay.\n\nMedia\nExcellent OSTs and voice acting. There was no interruption of lines or talking before subtitles. Furthermore, they used excellent voice actors such as Alucard\u2019s and Robin\u2019s voice actors. I really enjoyed hearing them talk. The only thing I would have wanted is more spoken dialogues, but I\u2019ll take what I can get. A for media.\n\n                                                                                  Negatives\nExplanation:\nThere needs to be a comprehensive translation for whatever games you are putting into production for another language. I struggled a bit with understanding what was the premise of certain instructions and how could I replicate those actions on PC. The training manual, still a bit over my head with combos and other things, maybe it works better for console. Also, what would have been bloody fantastic is to save the combos that we did so that at least I know what I did to get them. Also, it would be good to give some indication of how we could combine, I\u2019ve gotten two out of I don\u2019t even know\u2026.  Lastly, certain puzzles are lost in translation and so the difficulty became tenfold that I had to seek online assistance to solve the statues\u2026. Whatever.\n   \nGlitches\nThe damn glitches with the blocks in the sewers and minor ones in other places\u2026 and the bloody aumm shadow pieces. How on earth was I supposed to know that the save point with allow them to stay one place. I won\u2019t even tell how that frustrating aspect hindered my progress for a while and I knew how to solve it.\n\nFinality/ Climax\nI am just a bit meh about the ending, but a suppose it is due to the fact that it is a prelude of what is to come, but I felt as if the climax didn\u2019t come off as strong as it could have. Nonetheless, it was satisfying. \n\nFinal Score : 9/10\nOverall, the conception was brilliant and well executed considering the minor shortcomings. I would recommend anyone to purchase it.\n\nPs. It was worth my purchase, I believe I got in on sale for around $10 and it took me about 75 hours to complete my first playthrough, I think that is definitely a steal.\n", "timestamp_created": 1523120986, "timestamp_updated": 1523120986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513368964195251465", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41251005": {"recommendationid": "41251005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281344599", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4715, "last_played": 1520867668}, "language": "english", "review": "Over-all 3 star", "timestamp_created": 1522768312, "timestamp_updated": 1522768312, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.292272239923477173", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41169232": {"recommendationid": "41169232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993722735", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 28348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7852, "last_played": 1640785983}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic!\n\nI loved this game on the Gamecube and racked up hundreds of hours on it then, and it's even better in this port.

The story is still very engaging with its cast of diverse character personalities and the length of the story will keep you playing and getting your money's worth. The combat, while stiffer compared to the newer games, still holds up as well. This was the series' first big transition to 3D after all, and it still completely playable and enjoyable.

A really solid port and a great way to replay this classic JRPG of my childhood. \n\nThe only con of this port is that while the original GC version ran at 60 fps, this port of the ps3 version is locked at 30.

One of the best stories i have ever played. its open worold like final fantasy 7. it is not turn base tho which is ok with me because you have different options of battle ether control a character well the others do there own thing, leave them all free to auto fight or you can simply give commands throughout them being on auto like a semi auto play style. THE MOST PLOT TWIST i have ever experinced in a game. some were kinda predictable. but alot were surprising. in order to really enjoy everything this game has to offer you might ether want to play it more than once or use a guide so you dont miss stuff there is some easily missable stuff. if your a profectionist and need to unlock and do everything this game will be a challenge. theres alot to do i myself picked and chose my battle wisely. i would give some tips but i dont want to accidently spoil anything. the side quest  were pretty fun aswell as the first story and pretty interesting to do although alot of them unless you have played before or ever read a guide will have no idea how to start some of them or where to find and start.", "timestamp_created": 1520708521, "timestamp_updated": 1520708521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40581269": {"recommendationid": "40581269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286453290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 354, "playtime_forever": 2689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1681363468}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though this isnt the most excellent port for the PC, This an excellent game nonetheless.

However, I find there's a certain charm in learning how to work around the limitations of the battle system.\n\nAlthough this is the definitive version of the game in terms of available content and options, there are unfortunately still several cutscenes containing wrong or missing dialogue sprinkled throughout the game, including a very early part of the main story.

To top that off, the sale price for Tales of Symphonia is usually less than \u00a34 GBP, and I consider that an absolute steal.\n\nThe graphics are no better than they were on Gamecube, but that's to be expected - its a port of a port rather than a remake. They won't be winning any awards in 2018, but don't let them put you off. There's plenty of other beautiful art in the game, such as the anime-style cutscenes. Music is lovely too.\n\nOne of the main problems with the PC port is that the keyboard controls are incredibly clunky, so you might want to stay away from this release if you don't have a controller.

I still feel the Gamecube original is still a tiny bit better.\n\nThere's no random battles and no turn based combat, if those usally turn you away from JRPGs.\n\nTheres a few things added not in the Gamecube original; extra artes and costumes are nice, the casino is just sort of there. But wierdly enough theres some typos and missing spaces later on in the game, even tho' this game has been in english twice now. But they did use a far better font than what the Gamecube had.\n\nThe graphics still ooze charm and look great thanks to a stellar art direction. The colors seem a tad richer in the PC version, tho' I'm not sure if it has more to do with the S-video connection I use for my Gamecube. While some may be put off at the rather stiff cutscene animations, they have always stuck with me and I love the narminess they bring.\n\nThe audio is from the Gamecube original cept for a few new lines for the new moves that were wierdly low in volume. They are just as compressed sounding as they were on the Gamecube with the early voice lines sounding very hissy and even some occasional pops. Eventually you get use to it and barely notice cept on some of Colette's lines.\n\nThe port was rather terrible early on, but after a couple patches, it plays a LOT better now. I felt no need to use the fan patch. This port was originally capped at 30 FPS and it felt extremely slow and sluggish in the combat. They have since bumped it up to 40FPS which made it feel much better. It doesn't feel AS smooth as the 60 FPS Gamecube original, but close enough. The bump to 40 also seems to cause some earlier cutscenes dialog to be cut a bit short.\n\nI can admit to being a bit nostalgia blind to it, but everytime I play it I'm always finding something new. Even replaying the game to see the PC port, I've never noticed just how well all the systems for the combat played with each other. Even the cooking plays a decent roll for it, from keeping your HP and TP topped off to increasing the likelihood to go into Over limit.

I don't mean it so harshly. I'm sorry ToS, forgive me. :(\n\nSo I only recommend this game if you really like JRPGs, have played every quality JRPG out there, and you must play something else to hold you over until some other, higher-quality JRPG comes out. This game has an average story, with almost entirely bland characters, a dated mechanics and gameplay, and a decent soundtrack. It's by no means terrible. I've encountered no glitches and I had fun during my 100ish hours playthrough+post-game (I played this on gamecube console a year ago). But I wanted to wait a while before I wrote a review. I've reflected on my time invested in ToS. I've also played a bit of Tales of Berseria, and I have changed my stance on this game from \"an above-average JRPG, but nothing too special\" to \"Yeah, I mean, it's alright, certainly nothing special. I just think there are like, I don't know, maybefifty other things that would be more fulfilling than playing ToS. Want to experience a great story? Read Infinite Jest or The Metamorphosis,  play Undertale or Xenoblade Chronicles, or watch Your Lie in April. Want a fun experience? Watch Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,  Made in Abyss, or Assassination Classroom or read Infinite Jest. Want to experience aesthetically pleasing art? Read Lolita or play Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons or Journey.\n\n\nJust a quick note on the story, I gagged at how poorly written an executed this story is. I burst out laughing at how blatent the foreshadowing is, and how poorly developed the themes of friendship are. Antagonists and enemies, with the exception of Kratos (see, I said spoilers) and Mithos are all just unambiguously bad.The one part I will praise is how ToS deals with discrimination. \n\nMy point is ToS is is no way bad. Yet it fails to justify the 60-80+ hour investment. It's mediocre in terms of fun, story, or aestetic appeal. In fact, it's just another  \"meh\" JRPG. There is an abundance of other media that would so what ToS does better, either in terms of the components of the story (art, music, gameplay, etc.), or as a whole.

And BOY did I play that thing to death... it was easily my go-to RPG (that and KotOR, but hey, gotta give some love to the PC). So when they announced the game was being put on Steam, I just about flipped my lid in excitement. Then it came out and everyone was up in arms about the frame drop and other issues, and since my old computer could not even open the game, let alone run it, I had to pass it up. However, it died and I was able to procure a new one, and immediately bought this game.\n\nI have to be blunt, this plays FAR better than it did on the PS3 - I really can't tell any difference between this and the Gamecube version (text aside) because it plays just as smoothly on it. I even put the graphics settings on the highest settings possible and didn't experience any issues. Maybe it's just because the game was patched at some point between then and now (I haven't seen any news since March/April) but this has far too many 'not recommended'  settings. And my computer is just an average one; the components are not top-of-the-line, nor did they cost an arm and a leg. Now all I need is a Gamecube controller adapter... XD\n\nThe game has all of the content of not just the GC/PS2 but the additions of the ToSC release for the PS3, including the unlockable costumes that reference other games in the series. Lloyd and Genis, for example, get the outfits of Guy and Luke, respectively, from Tales of the Abyss. The mechanics work exactly the same as they did in the GC version, which can be a bit jarring if you're used to the mechanics from the more recent games - this game does not have a 'free run' mode that allows you to circle around your enemies. Even back when I had both this and Abyss, I'd find myself trying to free-run but not being able to, but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game.\n\nIn short, if you can at least meet the minimum requirements for the game, I highly recommend picking up this classic. There's a reason it stands alongside the likes of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess as the best games of the Gamecube.", "timestamp_created": 1512285484, "timestamp_updated": 1512285484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37979810": {"recommendationid": "37979810", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984622076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 325, "last_played": 1475919624}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Tales\" series is less well known than Final Fantasy, but I've always liked it a bit more. And Tales of Symphonia is my favorite one (though arguably Vesperia might be better in many ways).\n\nThe story, and characters, are every JRPG clich\u00e9 ever condensed into one game. But clich\u00e9s aren't a bad thing in and of itself, there's a reason they exist, reason for them to be, well clich\u00e9s. Symphonia executes all of them so well, you barely realize they're there. It's like you're watching the best 90's anime ever made. Think Lethal Weapon and buddycop clich\u00e9s.\n\nNormal JRPGs have the screen shatter, music start blasting, and you're moved into turn based combat. From the beginning, Tales did something different, you're moved into real time combat, with fighting game style moves. Think Soul Calibur or whatever. You have your team of four people, each with their own very specific gameplay. You control one of them, usually the main character Lloyd (heaviest hitter + decent mobility + second most HP + most moves). The gameplay is really satisfying even when it sometimes might get repetitive.\n\nIt's a world that pulls you in. Characters that you love more and more. Open field that opens just the right amounts for you to explore more and more. It's MWAHHH, it's perfect.\n\nThis PC port is honestly kind of shit though, even if elevated by the game itself. It's from the Play Station 2 version, the worse version (even though it has some additional content). It should have been made the best of both worlds, GameCube version with PS2's added outfits etc. The fighting UI and everything is just better on GC. There's a bunch of other changes that should have been made as well; 30fps doesn't bother me, 16:9 1080p with humongous UI elements blocking half the screen do.\nBUT. If you do not own any other version, please try this one.
