This atmospheric masterpiece effortlessly captivates, leaving players spellbound and yearning for more.\n\nThe game's greatest triumph lies within its narrative prowess and captivating setting. The story's depth and immersive quality kept me irresistibly hooked, yearning to delve deeper into the haunting mysteries of Amicia and Hugo's journey. The plague-infested world breathes life into a dark yet enthralling backdrop, where every step unravels a piece of the puzzle, compelling me to explore further.\n\nCrafting and combat mechanics, though vital, gracefully harmonise with the overarching narrative without overshadowing its essence. The simplicity and straightforwardness of these elements accentuate the storytelling, ensuring an uninterrupted flow. This delicate balance between gameplay and storytelling ensures that every moment spent engaging in combat or crafting feels seamlessly integrated, never detracting from the game's emotional resonance.\n\nMoreover, the visual allure of \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" stands as a testament to its sheer magnificence. The meticulous attention to detail paints a vivid and arresting canvas, evoking a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere that lingers long after the controller is set aside.\n\nThe characters, with their depth and genuine emotional resonance, etch themselves into memory. Amicia and Hugo's journey is not merely a quest for survival; it's a heartfelt narrative that explores the depths of sibling bonds amidst adversity. Each character encountered along the way adds layers to this rich tapestry, leaving an indelible mark on the player's heart.\n\nHowever, if there's a minor setback, it's the game's length. While the adventure is immersive and engaging, the brevity of its duration might leave some craving for more.\n\nIn conclusion, despite this small constraint, \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" remains an absolute gem. Its compelling storytelling, seamless gameplay integration, breathtaking visuals, and unforgettable characters make it an experience worth cherishing.

The gameplay could feel repetitive but the level design is brilliant and they don't feel like copy-paste even though you are repeating similar activities. The characters are lovely and the game makes you care for some of them. \n\nPros : \n+ Unique concept. This is a stealth game with rats and set during the 100 years war. \n+ Decent gameplay and puzzle. Sometimes you are doing repetitive things but because the level design is great they don't feel like copy-paste. For example, you'll repeat using a lantern to block the rats but you need to be creative on how you are going to block the rats to proceed. In addition, different chapters also give you different challenges. \n+ Pretty good story. At first, it is a little bit slow but once you get to the interesting part it will hook you up.\n+ Good characters with interesting dynamics. I love the dialogue and some banter between the characters. I like Amicia, Hugo, and their friends. \n+ Great voice acting. IMO the VAs did a great job and not many people talk about it.\n+ Great visual. This game is visually immersive and you'll feel the horror of living during a plague and being hunted.\n+ Good soundtrack. The theme song always gives me chills. \n+ Good aim assist. It's very snappy and accurate. \n\nCons : \n- Sometimes you are forced to be stealthy. I don't mind this but some sections punish you for not. Your main character (Amicia) will die in one hit if she gets hit.  \n- The main antagonist is not bad but not unique or well-written enough like the other characters.\n- If you are afraid of rats then you should NOT play this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699775294, "timestamp_updated": 1699775294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59583592414855957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149967860": {"recommendationid": "149967860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120018884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 529, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1699746126}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked the story and music.

One playthrough took me about ten hours. The setting of the world and characters were really well introduced and executed in the beginning. Having the protagonist accompanied by her little brother for most of the game was really nicely handled compared to other games in this genre. You aren't really slowed down by him and he doesn't get in your way and adds more to the gameplay than just being a talking sack of potatos.\n\nTowards the end of the game the game feels like it tries to wrap up its story too quickly. Some plot points seem to just happen without any input of yours or for the sake of the story (for example a captured character just reappearing saying he freed himself or another character acting completely moronic just to drive the plot). Some of the companions you gather around you also get some backstory and history while others doesn't even get mentioned. In general towards the end of the game many aspects and plot points seem to have fallen victim to cut gameplay and story. One of the later introduced gameplay mechanics also makes one of the biggest threats more or less harmless by which the atmosphere suffers quite a bit. The villains also fail to portray any meaningful reason for their actions besides being evil.\n\nThe cut content seems to have been a good idea though, because the game rarely overstays its welcome. The pacing in general is really nicely done and you don't end up doing either stealth, fighting or puzzle solving for too long. Some puzzles can be a bit janky though and are weirdly strict about how you should solve them. In most areas of the game you can play how you like without the game punishing you for being aggressive or not playing stealth. \n\nOverall a pretty fun game in my opinion which loses its spirit in the last third of the game. To be honest I find the game to be too expensive.

Unfortunately, none of these things managed to bite for me; no matter how good your models look or how tragic your premise is on the page, it is extraordinarily hard to achieve authentic and gripping storytelling when none of your characters have a third dimension or unique voice to them, your dialogue has all the flavor and texture of a spoonful of plain dry cornmeal, and all of your actors were so obviously forced to cold-read said dialogue in an isolated booth instead of being able to feed off of each other (as should be yet somehow still isn't the standard in story-forward cinematic games).\n\nAll of the work done here to get the audience invested is purely conceptual, and its core premise and backdrop are certainly novel enough in the greater video game landscape to potentially jolt a player into paying more attention than they otherwise might have.

It looked interesting and beautiful and definitely did not live up to expectations. The story is good and character writing is also good, also the graphics are beautiful.\n\nBUT to the problem...\n\nThe game literally has 3 types of mechanics that repeat throughout the game. And there near to none variance.\n1. You either have to sneak around and time your movements, or more realistically put: You run, stop for 2 seconds and run again. Nothing else. All these timing are always unrealistically convenient. You can also crouch at a guards heels with a torch withouth them noticing.\n\n2. You have to disable/knockout guards in an order without too many of them ambushing you too quick. Really no challenge here.\n\n3. You have to solve tunnel-type \"puzzles\" where you direct rats away and create a safe path. These are really solved by doing the only thing you can do. If there's a lantern, light it. If something can be dropped, drop it. If there is a guard with a light, either break the lantern to kill the guard or follow the guard in his light bubble.\n\nSummary:\n- The game is very tunnel-like, do what you can, and you'll beat the game with ease. Mechanics are very rinse-and-repeat.\n- The graphics are definitely more horroresque but the difficulty in the game overall is closer to a children's game.\n- The game introduces us to a more complex fighting mechanic which is never used again after the tutorial \"boss\" fight.", "timestamp_created": 1698296465, "timestamp_updated": 1698296465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148883154": {"recommendationid": "148883154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050308960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1698283558}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is shit.

There's just something about owning games on Steam that feels more satisfying. \ud83d\uddff\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a wonderful journey through medieval France, filled with rats, danger, and exciting moments. It follows the story of Amicia and her younger brother Hugo, and their friends, on a rescue and arrest mission.\n\nThe game\u2019s story is top-notch, and the characters, especially Amicia and Hugo, are likable. The graphics are gorgeous, and the music adds to the fun. The game is a mix of stealth, puzzles, and combat, which keeps things interesting.\n\nI've unlocked all the Steam achievements for this game as I wrote this review, which made it even more enjoyable!\n\nThe key to this game is the relationship between the characters. Amicia and Hugo\u2019s relationship feels genuine, and your companions aren\u2019t just helpful \u2013 they\u2019re essential to the story. The use of lights to keep groups of rats at a distance adds an interesting element.\n\nIn short, if you want a game with a strong story, wonderful characters, and enjoyable gameplay, this game is a must-play. It offers a unique and unforgettable emotional experience. I also want to express my appreciation for each and every team member who contributed to creating this amazing game\u2764\ufe0f.\n\nNow I can't wait to play A Plague Tale: Requiem, but I'm waiting for it to go on a huge sale. Can't wait to play it. Please put it on a huge discount this winter sale :( \n\nThank you for reading this review \ud83d\ude4f", "timestamp_created": 1697823059, "timestamp_updated": 1697823059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148545131": {"recommendationid": "148545131", "author": {"steamid": "76561199121415809", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1699551065}, "language": "english", "review": "9.5/10 game.

The story, is quite good, and it's set in a world that is both beautiful and creepy, peaceful and violent. It's also very sad, tragedy after tragedy, no one can catch a break.\n\nThe game as a package looks great. The graphics and character models, while perhaps not the perfect up close, are amazing when not under close scrutiny. But the design, style, ambient effects, and environments are what really make the graphics shine.\n\nThe music does an excellent job of setting the tone of each scene, and accents specific actions quite nicely.\n\nI got 71% achievements at about 18-19 hours. I had considered revisiting areas to get the rest of the achievements, but because of the heavy emphasis on story, I found it too cumbersome. For the amount of time and the price tag, I'd say wait for a sale. But definitely get the game, it's really good and definitely worth it. I look forward to playing the second one.\n\nSome issues I had. \n\n1. I found the limitation on backtracking to be frustrating. Sometimes I would leave a material right behind me because I was full, use it shortly after, attempt to backtrack to get it, to find myself blocked by a door, or once even an invisible wall. \n\n2. Perhaps this is nitpicky, but after a three week progression, I feel like the main character would have wiped the blood off her nose, but surely by the end of the game.\n\n3. Often time, during regular progression, dialogue overrides other dialogue. Sometimes it's main story dialogue triggers being too close, or side dialogue overriding story dialogue. This could be timed better.\n\n4. Despite having a custom made PC that was pretty top of the line after this game was made, I experienced some performance issues and couldn't run on max settings.

With the swarms of rats it's understandable why, although I think a QTE system like Metroid: Dread for escaping the EMMI robots (That are pretty hard, yet completing them is possible) could have made Innocence a touch more forgiving without undermining the harshness of the setting too much.\n\nAmicia's sling is one of the worst videogame weapons I've ever used and I wish she could have daggers/knives against human enemies like defense items in Resident Evil Remake (2002) or RE2Make (2019). There is sort of a similar system in there already, but it really takes a lot of your already meager resources to make and can prevent you from upgrading your equipment. RE style daggers could be scarce and still complement the existing method.\n\nThe later boss fights against [spoiler] Nicholas [/spoiler] & [spoiler] Vitalis [/spoiler] are also frustrating, because they will kill you in one hit, but unlike normal enemies they require slightly more elaborate attacks to damage them. The problem with this kind of trial & error gameplay is that it can lead to repeating certain sections over and over again and potentially dulling any emotional impact. It can also lead the player to making more mistakes from sloppiness induced by frustration of having to redo a section many times. Although this can be sometimes be attributed to skill issue and not the game itself. I wish games would stop boss enemies from repeating the same lines non-stop if the player has understood what to do, just failing at executing the winning tactic.\n\nCase in point, the boss fights I mentioned in earlier in spoiler tags are preceded by a [spoiler] supporting character death  [/spoiler], which at time of writing, I thought happened for stupid reasons. I don't think [spoiler] Arthur would just delay making sure Nicholas is dead[/spoiler] and [spoiler] Rodric's death just seemed too self-inflicted and should have been preventable, if not for gameplay limitations [/spoiler].\n\nThe visuals and performance are stellar though, I maxed out the settings at 1440p with an RTX 2080 and other components of that era and only ever noticed a few hitches that while I would have liked to see gone, didn't affect my playing much at all.\n\nIn summary: Bleak setting that's beautifully realized, solid performance through the entire game, yet frustrating gameplay and story gets weaker by the 2nd half.\n\n6.5/10, wait until it's discounted if you still want to buy it\n\nEdit: I really wanted to like this more.", "timestamp_created": 1697686177, "timestamp_updated": 1698781480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498257845640182495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148465223": {"recommendationid": "148465223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078647868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 785, "last_played": 1671944163}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool story and gameplay mechanics. at the end it's getting a bit repedativ and boring, but still makes allot of fun in a dark setting", "timestamp_created": 1697679057, "timestamp_updated": 1697679057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148462485": {"recommendationid": "148462485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013546982", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 192, "last_played": 1697591804}, "language": "english", "review": "It's something.\n\nMore movie than anything else.

The game is stable, and I never encountered any bugs during my ~16 hours of play time (enough to finish the game without rushing it, however I gathered maybe 30% of available optional collectibles).\n\nTha AI of characters (pathing and behaviour) is good enough to keep you fully engaged in the story. The puzzle elements are not really difficult to figure out, so you wouldn't be stuck in any particular place for longer, and still feel that you achieved something. \n\nThe story is mostly linear - no story changing decisions you can really make (besides dying of course) - however that's fine, as the game is telling you a particular story which is really worth following. There are some optional places you can miss if you rush, which may add some elements to the plot, but nothing very important, so you can just immerse yourself into story and play however fast you like.\n\nThe game is always nicely providing required resources whenever they are needed to push the game forward, so you don't have to gather everything, but still it could make some challenges a little easier if you are able to upgrade your equipment earlier. \n\nThe saving system is \"console style\" - so saving automatically on checkpoints, which are frequent enough to not make you frustrated if you die. And you might lose your life quite often - arcade parts although not super difficult, still pose some challenge. Additionally - if you want to collect everything, you can replay any particular chapter (each of them isn't very long, so you shouldn't get bored if you \"really need\" to collect all the achievements).\n\nThe graphics are good, sound effects and music are raising the immersion bar, and voice acting is great.

The lighting plays a significant role in setting the mood, with shadows and glows masterfully used to emphasize both the beauty and terror of the plague-ridden world.\n\nNarrative and Characters:\nAt its core, \"A Plague Tale\" is a story about family, resilience, and coming of age in a world gone awry. The bond between the siblings, Amicia and Hugo, serves as the emotional crux of the game. As they navigate a hostile world, their relationship is tested, strained, and ultimately strengthened. The game artfully delves into themes of loss, innocence, and the lengths to which one would go to protect loved ones.\n\nThe supporting characters, each with their unique backgrounds and quirks, enrich the narrative. Their interactions and story arcs add depth, ensuring the story remains multi-layered and compelling throughout.\n\nGameplay:\nWhile the stealth mechanics may seem familiar to fans of the genre, they are executed with finesse and seamlessly integrated into the story. Puzzles and challenges often require strategic utilization of the environment, especially with the unpredictable rat hordes serving as both an obstacle and a potential weapon.\n\nAmicia's sling, a primary tool and weapon, evolves over the course of the game. This evolution not only allows for a more varied combat approach but also reinforces the narrative of a young girl growing stronger and more resourceful in the face of adversity.\n\nSound Design and Music:\nThe auditory experience of \"A Plague Tale\" is equally commendable. The sound of chittering rats, the distant cries of anguish, and the subtle environmental sounds all coalesce to create an overwhelmingly immersive atmosphere. Olivier Derivi\u00e8re's haunting score punctuates the narrative beats, elevating moments of tension, sorrow, and hope.\n\nConclusion:\n\"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" is an outstanding achievement in storytelling, game design, and emotional engagement. Asobo Studio has not just given us a game but a deeply moving piece of interactive art that resonates with universal themes. For those yearning for a narrative-driven experience rich in atmosphere, character development, and emotional depth, this title is not to be missed. It's a poignant reminder of the power of video games to tell evocative, human stories.", "timestamp_created": 1696052331, "timestamp_updated": 1696052331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147313105": {"recommendationid": "147313105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325353023", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 554, "last_played": 1696172006}, "language": "english", "review": "good, but a lot bug", "timestamp_created": 1696026991, "timestamp_updated": 1696026991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147257543": {"recommendationid": "147257543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198836022777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1695963913}, "language": "english", "review": "Rats make me crazy.", "timestamp_created": 1695963981, "timestamp_updated": 1695963981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147249424": {"recommendationid": "147249424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133371151", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1665238156}, "language": "english", "review": "Story wise - 9/10\nGameplay- 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1695952037, "timestamp_updated": 1695952037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535714268684387207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147245208": {"recommendationid": "147245208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082121148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2536, "last_played": 1697698909}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll keep this short and sweet!

Although the entire storyline is linear, the story progression was entertaining and didn't feel like a drag! \n\nGameplay-wise, at rare chances, AI/NPCs following you may accidentally fall victim to the \"piranha rats\", resulting in a game restart from last save checkpoint\n\nStealth is very easy, to the point it is laughable! For instance, hiding behind a pile of barricades results in the enemies forgetting your existence after a while LOL!\n\nCombat is also very easy, you do not need much preplanning before you get into a fight. For reference, think of a difficulty level of 1/10 compared to Soulsborne games\n\nVisuals-wise, amazing game for a 2019 video game, it feels like the in-game engine is cranked up to 11/10. However, the visuals by default at maxed graphical preset are hampered, thanks to effects from blurry TAA, fuzzy film grain, annoying chromatic aberration and whatnot! \n\nAs the game is rather well optimised, MAXED graphical presets, averaged at 140FPS in 1920x1080 with a 5600x + 32GB 3800CL18 + 1080TI. I highly recommend running the game at a higher render resolution to minimize dithering effects from TAA or outright disable TAA and inject SMAA with Reshade along with AMD CAS or LumaSharpen to dramatically punch up the clarity of this game!\n\nSound-wise, the game integrates its soundtrack to align with the given setting. Upon encountering a pool of \"piranha rats\", the game starts to play eerie music. Another good use of its soundtrack is when you discover a mythological structure for the first time, the soundtrack fills in the \"ambience\" of what is before you\n\nIn summary, consider buying this game if you enjoy a linear story-based video game! The game is well optimised with some visual kinks but has good sound design and great storytelling experience!", "timestamp_created": 1695904084, "timestamp_updated": 1695904084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147182408": {"recommendationid": "147182408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120509850", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1696063806}, "language": "english", "review": "High quality.", "timestamp_created": 1695877018, "timestamp_updated": 1695877018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147176158": {"recommendationid": "147176158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068769863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1760, "last_played": 1695934296}, "language": "english", "review": "It's on rails, so you can't go exploring.

The mystery of the rats and their connection to Hugo - her younger brother is the main mystery of the story and it's very well executed. Story wise it's excellent and I would recommend the game for the story alone.\n\nVisually, the game is also excellent with moments of great beauty and gory horror as you traverse through lush forests, cities, and rat infested streets. The only issue is the facial models and animations which isn't as good as the more static objects. The facial animations can be stilted and unnatural but this is fine as for the most part it works.\n\nThe music of the game really brings out the tension of stealth based game play as the strings really puts you on edge at times. The overall ambiance of the music produces a creeping vibe throughout the game. It feels like a horror at times.\n\nAs for the game play itself, it's serviceable. the stealth is a tad too forgiving with the enemy losing you almost immediately when they lose visual contact. The action part is simple too since the game gives you auto-aim and plenty of ammo. The last boss what a bit of a pain though.\n\nOverall, the game was quite fun and the story excellent.

Certain cinematic moments mimic the color palette of an old portrait painting, creating truly captivating and beautiful shots. The soundtrack only adds to this experience, with string instruments juggling intensity and serenity between scenes. This is a cinematic experience, but that doesn\u2019t mean its gameplay pales by comparison.\n\nThe game is primarily a stealth game, with mechanics involving line of sight, sound, light, and this games signature: rats. You\u2019ll either be lighting the area to get passed the rats, or putting out lights to use them to your advantage. The Inquisition is the main threat \u2013 soldiers that search for you among the puzzles and scenarios you find yourself in. These soldiers range in weapon types and armor types, which both have varying affects on how you\u2019ll approach the situation. Bows and spears can kill you at long range, while melee weapons are usually accompanied by lights, allowing the guards to bypass the rats. Helmets will inhibit your ability to kill certain guards, but the game opens up with options for helmets, torches, lanterns\u2026 And then they\u2019ll come at you with shields and heavy armor, negating your options once again. This gameplay loop slowly gets harder, but as you progress through the game, you\u2019ll get more options in how you can deal with these gameplay elements. While at the start it comes across as rather simple and formulaic, the game expands its areas and your abilities, giving you many ways to approach each scenario. \n\nBecause the games length is rather short, it doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, with each act feeling unique and dense\u2026 There was never a point where I lost interest, and in fact I only got progressively more invested in both story and gameplay with each new act. \n\nHowever it\u2019s not all good, with story elements impacted by poor facial animations and the occasional stiff deliveries from the English voice actors. This made certain story beats not feel as impactful, taking away from an otherwise good story. Nonetheless, this is minor, and overall doesn\u2019t hurt the game as much as I initially thought it might. \n\nFunnily enough, the biggest reason A Plague Tale: Innocence is worth trying is because of the \u201crat tech\u201d. The technology to create thousands of rats on screen, and have them dynamically avoid light, as well as attack anyone in the dark, later on creating visual spectacles you wouldn\u2019t see anywhere else, is ultimately what sets this game apart. Accompany this with great visuals and music, and a decent story, and it becomes easy to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1695255343, "timestamp_updated": 1695255343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146678134": {"recommendationid": "146678134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204345872", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1695253372}, "language": "english", "review": "its like playing a well written book", "timestamp_created": 1695255329, "timestamp_updated": 1695255329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146675510": {"recommendationid": "146675510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146723046", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 782, "last_played": 1694821956}, "language": "english", "review": "A Plague Tale Innocence is a game I picked up on sale and thought I would give a try after hearing many positive reviews. I personally wasn't expecting much from the game i was expecting another slow paced story driven Last Of Us clone and im personally kind of tired of these games even though they are still enjoyable if your in the right mood. What I got was a game that exceeded all my expectations and even surpassed a few of them. This game is not perfect far from it in fact frustratingly so at times but it had heart and clearly a lot of passion which one me over in the end.\nThe story follows a teenage girl called Amicia and her younger brother Hugo who has some kind of illness and its up to you to find a cure for his illness. While being chased by the inquisition who seem to be very interested in Hugo while the hundred years war between France and England rages on around you and a deadly plague is causing disruption to your every step. \nVisually the game is excellent with many contrasting areas and moods like lush forests and fields on sunny days to dark fire lit city streets and rat infested caves. The character models are decent even though they all suffer from same face syndrome with just a different hairstyle which I found very distracting at times.\nThis is a stealth heavy game where you throw rocks and pots at metal to distract guards and get away as life is very hard if you get caught. Its not especially deep but it gets the job done and keeps you engaged enough. Fire plays a huge part in the game as rats are afraid of fire so many situations involve you finding ways to get fire around the area to make a safe escape. \nThe story is good for what it is I especially liked the dynamic between Amicia and Hugo as they slowly grow from being so distant to truly relying on one another and that's what holds the entire game together and I truly began to care for Hugo and his safety and that's something the Last Of Us never managed to do with Ellie. Unfortunately the side characters aren't so great as I found them to be very annoying which i suppose is OK since they're just kids and they add some diversity to the game but I just wish they had a little more development rather than just really angry all the time. The villain is so forgettable too that I cant even remember his name and his final boss battle is laughably bad which is a shame because the build up to him is actually paced pretty well. The other bosses fair much better and require more strategy and problem solving to overcome. \nI enjoyed this game a lot and im really glad I finally played if you haven't played I urge you to do so.

Developed by Asobo Studio and published by Focus Home Interactive, this gripping narrative-driven adventure stands out as a unique and unforgettable gaming experience.\n\nSet in 14th-century France during the height of the Black Plague, the game follows the story of Amicia de Rune, a young noble girl, and her younger brother Hugo, who must navigate a world ravaged by disease, war, and supernatural horrors. The narrative is one of the game's strongest aspects, weaving a tale of sibling bonds, survival, and sacrifice amidst the backdrop of a horrifying plague.\n\nGraphically, A Plague Tale: Innocence is a masterpiece. The attention to detail in recreating the bleak and grim atmosphere of plague-stricken France is impeccable. The environments are beautifully crafted, from the picturesque countryside to the haunting streets of disease-ridden towns. The use of lighting and shadows enhances the game's atmosphere, immersing players in its hauntingly atmospheric world.\n\nThe character design and animations are equally impressive. Amicia and Hugo are well-realized protagonists, and their relationship is at the heart of the story. As they struggle to survive, players become emotionally invested in their journey, feeling the weight of their burdens and the love between them.\n\nGameplay primarily revolves around stealth and puzzle-solving, as players must avoid both the relentless Inquisition soldiers and swarms of ravenous rats that are central to the game's plague motif. The game introduces new mechanics and challenges throughout its runtime, keeping the experience fresh and engaging. Amicia's sling, used for both combat and puzzle-solving, is an intuitive and versatile tool, allowing for a satisfying blend of action and strategy.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is the use of swarms of rats as a gameplay element. The swarms are both a threat and a resource, offering opportunities for creative solutions to obstacles and enemies. The way the game uses these swarms to create tension and atmosphere is nothing short of genius.\n\nThe sound design and music deserve special mention for their ability to enhance the game's immersion. The eerie sounds of rats scuttling, the whispers of the wind, and the unsettling ambient music all contribute to the game's haunting atmosphere.\n\nWhile A Plague Tale: Innocence excels in many areas, it's not without its minor flaws. Some might find the pacing a tad slow in certain sections, and there are moments when the AI of enemies can be predictable. However, these minor issues are easily overshadowed by the game's overall strengths.\n\nIn conclusion, A Plague Tale: Innocence is a compelling narrative-driven experience that combines outstanding storytelling with stunning visuals and atmospheric design. It successfully transports players to a grim and emotionally charged world, where they must rely on their wits and courage to survive. This game is a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming and stands as a must-play title for those who appreciate deeply immersive and emotionally resonant gaming experiences.", "timestamp_created": 1695240752, "timestamp_updated": 1695240752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146666888": {"recommendationid": "146666888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020369990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 916, "last_played": 1695238828}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful story, good music and sound, nice voice acting.

Your characters are fun, and develop some cool personalities in your time with them. I think on this side, the story is quite good. The voice acting was very good. I also thought It doesn't really flesh out the villains. I felt myself wondering what Vitalus wanted, and who he was.. The story just was left too empty on this side.\n\nThe gameplay was just ok IMO. The radial wheel doesn't stop or slow time, and radial wheels are never precise when trying to zero in on what you want. The combat sequences are just ok. It's just dodging and figuring out how to take enemies down. The game constantly locks out the ability to run, and this just frustrated me. It limits weapon use to the narrative occasions, which is fine, but the amount of times that I just wanted to move faster in a situation that had no enemies or stealth was infuriating. It was also locked out during some stealth areas. The game is pretty linear, and the paths are often easy enough to see. They give you a fair variety of tools to take enemies out. There's always resources laying around to craft upgrades, and ammo.\n\nThe only bug I encountered is a broken achievement for crafting 100 ammo. The game ran very well for me. There's quality there, and that's very good. No frame drops. No dropped inputs, which is far too common these days.

The story and artwork are impressive in both the 1st and second game.. so play the first if you want to appreciate that. Take it for what it is and its enjoyable.. but if you like to explore.. then don't play this.. as you cannot at all explore in this game.\n\nPros\n- Looks amazing\n- Is an excellent story that depending on execution will make a good film, I don't think it has enough content to make a good TV series (which I hear is in production right now).\n- I kinda want to learn how to use a sling shot, feels like a life skill that anyone should learn.\n- Sound design and music, are well executed, some great use of dissonance and atmosphere.\n- Finished in less than 20 hrs, so its a short investment in terms of game time, with some interesting ideas, unique (to me) combat style.\n- There is a sequel which I am play and some of the cons I mention below are addressed, so its worth playing this for the short investment, just to get the backdrop and see the progression of the game development and efforts.\n\nCons (for me, and has it been improved in the sequel)\n- Is entirely linear, which I understand is its design, but the more I play games that are linear, the more i realise I just don't enjoy them. There are no decisions to be made.. you just follow the story.. which is a good story I agree.. but I feel like I am just pushing it along.. I addition you are walking through a canvas.. not a world, very little ability to explore or reason to do so.. (So far this look to be the same in the sequel but too early to tell)\n- Its not that hard (I am 44, so maybe its my age).. but I didn't really get that stuck and all the puzzles all though they build in complexity. (Sequel is harder, you can have more choice on how you progress, all be it linear, and you gain skills based on your handling of certain tools and weapons)\n-  I have two kids and managing Hugo became a little annoying, I game to escape parenting :) (Hugo is still Hugo)\n- The combat style although unique I got immensely frustrated with selecting what I wanted to use, craft and so on. (Some tweaks to this in the sequel which catch you out actually if you have just played the 1st game.. but they do make some sense and make it easier to select, once i reprogram my muscle memory to use the new navigation of inventory and crafting.)\n- The crafting is odd, because very early on you can craft anywhere, which makes the concept of tool benches redundant 95% of the time.. and the points in which you can upgrade, are in fact very well set in stone, so although you have some choice in what you upgrade when its actually pretty limited (this reminded me of early games in the new Tomb Raider Series). (Undecided in this, it still feels a little contrived, rather than a choice.. but this might be again just its design)\n- I died a lot, and it didn't matter if I did, because you just try again..(I would say this goes back to the story nature of the game over the game play itself) - this means you get disconnected from it.. and over time it becomes more of just an exercise to complete the game and tasks other than anything else. (Dying less, because I am skilled sling shot, but on reflection the dying still happens a lot and again, it doesn't really matter if I do, just try again)", "timestamp_created": 1695110500, "timestamp_updated": 1695110500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567901253700256348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146575966": {"recommendationid": "146575966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297128888", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1696063909}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game", "timestamp_created": 1695107211, "timestamp_updated": 1695107211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592398524284362793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146572782": {"recommendationid": "146572782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347292840", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 795, "last_played": 1695002043}, "language": "english", "review": "rat simulator 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1695099974, "timestamp_updated": 1695099974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146569718": {"recommendationid": "146569718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324774777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 833, "last_played": 1695093250}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the game, came close to smashing my computer on a couple boss battles though not gonna lie.", "timestamp_created": 1695093750, "timestamp_updated": 1695093750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146562745": {"recommendationid": "146562745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198367296293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1695000318}, "language": "english", "review": "3/10", "timestamp_created": 1695082093, "timestamp_updated": 1695082093, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146561691": {"recommendationid": "146561691", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203765315", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2854, "last_played": 1698613071}, "language": "english", "review": "I think I got too attached to Hugo and Amicia...

It feels like a cinematic experience, but much more immersive than something from Supermassive or Quantic Dream. The story itself was excellent, I would have liked to see a bit more bonding and screen time with some of the side characters, but I appreciate the tight storytelling for what it is. The main focus is on the relationship between the siblings, which I thought felt fairly authentic. Still some mysteries to be solved, but I do know there is a sequel.\n\nThe camera and controls felt a bit clunky, but for the latter I also never bothered to memorize what number shortcut corresponded to which ability until the final fight, so I'm not fully qualified to give it a knock on that. Though I stand by the camera being frustrating to handle, particularly if you have to multitask. \n\nI'm happy with my purchase - It took around 11.5 hours to complete for me, with me being somewhat crap at the stealth sections - particularly as the game went on it became less of a hassle to just kill everything. I wouldn't call this game hard necessarily, but there are some sections that are a bit finnicky and take some retries. The guard AI stretches believability in their blindness at times, but it was still a fun gameplay loop. \n\nAnyways, this game has been out for a while - most people who are considering playing this are probably like me who have known about it for a while and never got around to hitting the purchase button. I'd say, if the price matches what you are comfortable spending for a game of this specific playtime (I think i saw some people complete it in 9 hours, so I'd say 9-12 is accurate), then go for it.

For me, story-driven games are my bread and butter, and that's exactly what this game delivers. Not only this but the excellent interwoven quality of European history, with just enough fiction attached was artfully carried out. \n\nThe Good: \n1. Scenery: exceptional detail was put in to create the medieval world of the Plague Tale. Right from the jump we're introduced to the de Rune family with a luscious forest backdrop and the goodness only continues from there. \n\n2. Characters: The voice acting was engaging and real, which I deeply appreciate. I was especially drawn in by the fact that, for whatever your politics are, how good of a protagonist Amicia (Charlotte McBurney) was. The story didn't attempt to paint men as evil, inept, or stupid as pop-culture often depicts us now-a-days. The characters struggled with real human experiences in times of crisis with such themes as: death of a family member, fights between siblings, guilt, revenge, etc. *Spoiler Alert* I really did feel my heart strings being pulled with regards to whether Amicia, Hugo, and Beatrice (Katherine Pageon) would, after all of that struggle and strife, make it out of that ordeal alive. Excellently crafted characters. \n\n3. Plot: A highly engaging tale for the true story-mode player. I am almost certain even a casual gamer would find enjoyment out of this game. The plot centers around the black plague/bubonic plague, which struck down 1/3 of Europes population. The fear created by the plague was a palpable theme, and an appreciation of the confusion and the reliance on religion to save those lucky enough not to \"catch it\". Beyond that, the main characters fight to simply survive, avoid capture, and keep their small band together proved to be a Herculean feat! \n\nOverall: 5 out of 5 stars.

It's completely linear, there are like 3 \"decisions\" you can make and all are due to achievements (ie. save the english soldier or letting him die) with 0 difference choosing either in the story or even in the chapter.\n\nThe flow of the story through \"chapters\" is pretty jarring, throwing in your face a few secondary characters and timeskips that don't let you \"know\" the the group. Yeah, I can understand that the characters may suffer if one dies... but I as the player don't care enough about them, so my only reaction can only be \"oh, they killed one for dramatic points, rip\".\nTo the players the secondary characters are noting but \"the kid who is an alchimist genius for reasons\", \"the girl who lockpicks\", \"the brother of the girl who lockpicks\" and \"the boy who smashes doors and punches guards\". Giving us a few moments between chapters, to learn more about the gang, their reasoning, their past etcetc. would have make me feel for them much more.\n\nThe opponents you face are exactly the same. There guards that you can OHK, guards that you need 2 hits to kill and guards that you have to break a lantern / extinguish the torch. The encounters are basically the same over and over, with just different archetypes around.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy (and if I say so, since I usually suck at doing them...) and solving them is rewarded either with a few consumables or a collectible. There are quite a few collectibles laying around, so you are rewarded for exploring everywhere.\n\nThe bosses have unique mechanics but they aren't too challenging. Since every error is followed by your death and starting from 0 again... it gets a bit tedious. Just as the levels, the boss fights are linear too. There is one way to win and you need to follow the exact same actions every time. The first time is... ok... but you probably won't be playing the game a second time. Tedious.\n\nThe story is nice, nothing new but with a few enjoying aspects. Not historically accurate enough to scratch that itch but not fantasy enough either. It flows quite well, very gothic.

This makes the player think \"I think the game wants me to go left... so let's go right first to see what's there\". If you guess wrong then you trigger a cutscene or door closes permanently so you can't go back and see what you've missed. It's not even about FOMO, it's just playing the game for the first time you don't know how hard the upcoming levels will be so you might need all those materials for upgrades. It ruins the immersion, sometimes instead of going forward as fast as possible (e.g. through a battlefield full of bodies) you will walk around checking if there's something to pick up. Anyway, in the end you can beat the game without all upgrades and if some encounter requires specific projectiles then materials for them will always VERY CONVENIENTLY lie somewhere close.\nOther than crafting it has another thing that's in almost every game nowadays - the idiotic hiding in tall grass. Yeah I'm sure walking in it and trampling it wouldn't make it obvious that someone is there and make way more noise.\n\nIt has some very odd design decisions:\nYou can't run with a torch whenever you want, only when the game lets you, this is to make you solve puzzles in the exact way devs intended when in reality you could just sprint and solve it in an easier way\n\nMain character can't go over a wall or a fence without dropping the torch/stick\n\nIf you put it in a torch holder and get on some elevation, you can't retrieve it. Why? Just crouch and reach for it.\n\nYou're supposed to get rats to focus on meat/animals/humans so they ignore you but it works only on scripted meat that you can drop with your sling and living npcs. There are moments where you're surrounded by dead bodies of animals or humans and rats ignore these but if you kill an enemy then they will start eating him. Why not just eat all the other bodies? It makes no sense.\n\nAlso it's funny how they made it so Amicia can't even pick up a knife, a sword or a bow and only has her sling to defend herself to make the character seem defenseless and more grounded in reality, not some killing machine like Lara Croft but... she can easily kill enemies with headshots from that sling. That makes her a scarier enemy than most video game protagonists, I think it's the opposite of what they wanted to achieve.\n\n\nThe story is supposed to be the highlight of the game but it's nothing special.

Characters are boring and 1 dimensional, the characters you meet along the way just got annoying to me and honestly I didn't care for them a single bit, if one of them died it sparked no emotion in me because of how one dimensional they are. The same goes for the main villain, very cartoonish.\n\n2. Voice acting, i came to this game after playing the last of us so i guess my expectations should have been readjusted, but i really didn't find any emotion behind there voices at some points. especially the mother.\n\n3. Slow and boring gameplay, there really isn't any room to experiment, one small mistake can kill you instantly with a potential checkpoint that will set you back another minute or so. The stealth was your run of the mill throw a rock and move past. This game also had a habit of intentionally slowing the character down so that you cant run around and explore, just slowly walking for no real reason.\n\n4. following on from walking slowly everywhere, the home base sections are just sooooo tedious, having to slowly trudge through this massive castle. Every time i was there i felt like i was being taken away from the story and had to talk to other characters that i really didn't care about.\n\nThe main issue i have with the game is a big one though, considering this is a story focused game. The story just never hooked me, it didn't hook me at the beginning and i was waiting till the very end for it to surprise me, but it never did. \n\nHowever this game isn't ALL bad the good points are:\n\n1:Gorgeous environments, basically every level is packing with detail. all towns look dark and grim with hanging corpses and rats eating bodies. Then you might go into a luscious forest with flowers and lots of foliage.

Many touching moments that make you smile.\n+ Not punishing, but definitely a few moments that will surprise you by the challenge.\n+ Short and sweet.

Bravo to the writers and the actors.\n\nNEUTRAL\n- The game is a story-driven game, which means that it's quite linear in its path. You're not left guessing where to go or what to do; rather, there are clear indications that you have a single path you can proceed on. Note that this is somewhat remedied by including challenges by finding \"gifts\", flowers, and relics that represent the history of the time this story is told. To find these items, you do need to deviate a bit from the path in front of you (where it allows).\n\nCONS\n- The ending was sweet, but I wouldn't have minded a bit more to it.

"review": "This is a hard one to review. I wish there was a \"neutral\" rating because the game isn't bad by any means, but it falls short of being a great one. The superb graphics in combination with a great narrative make for a very tight, cinematic experience. The gameplay itself is nothing to write home about since it is very much on-rails and with minimal freedom as to how you can approach problems. There is usually only one way of getting past an obstacle. That alone would be entirely forgivable if the game fully focused on the one thing it's doing well and that's stealth.\n\nSadly, the pacing changes entirely toward the end of the game, and what was a narrative heavy stealth survival experience becomes a fantasy action game where lightning reflexes are required to progress. The final boss fight was particularly egregious and I felt that the game broke character with the previous 95% of the experience. I won't spoil anything but the mechanics are very reminiscent of the way boss fights were being done 20-30 years ago: punishing timings, no mistakes allowed and having to redo difficult sequences if you slip up at any point. It makes no sense that the developers would want to punish the player in this way after sticking with their creation for 12+ hours. It felt like a slap in the face for no good reason. Someone who stuck with the game until the end certainly didn't do so to be abused for their trouble.\n\nIn a nutshell, the last 1-2 hours are pretty weak and the final encounter is executed so badly that it ruins the game for me.

Me dej\u00e9 guiar por las buenas rese\u00f1as y el conocimiento previo de que se trataba de una historia un tanto corta de una hermana con su peque\u00f1o, y me alegro de no haber tenido idea ni de qu\u00e9 se trataba el juego, ya que una vez que me di cuenta me vi bastante asombrado.\n\n\u25ae La historia de este juego es bastante particular. Lo que comienza siendo un intento de supervivencia entre 2 hermanos solitarios dentro de un mundo de podredumbre se convierte en algo mucho m\u00e1s grande. Conocemos varios personajes que se har\u00e1n due\u00f1os de una peque\u00f1a parte de la historia, pero el concepto fundamental es proteger a Hugo. Hugo es este peque\u00f1o hermano inocente, lleno de sentimientos nuevos encontrados que no sabe c\u00f3mo controlarlos ya que jam\u00e1s ha conocido el exterior, y esta vez se ve obligado a hacerlo ante un mundo devastado. La historia se divide en cap\u00edtulos, cosa que agradezco much\u00edsimo y me permiti\u00f3 separar mi sesi\u00f3n de juego por episodios y no hasta el hartazgo. Esto quiere decir que jam\u00e1s sal\u00eda de la historia del juego yo, sino que le daba una conclusi\u00f3n al episodio y de ah\u00ed dejaba mi sesi\u00f3n para el siguiente d\u00eda. En casi cualquier otro juego ponemos \"Guardar\" y dejamos al personaje en un lugar donde no sabemos si estamos por llegar a un giro de trama, un cl\u00edmax sorpresivo o 3 horas de farmeo. Ac\u00e1 eso no va a existir, puesto que se divide por cap\u00edtulos y la historia al ser tan corta es bastante nutritiva.\n\n\u25ae Gr\u00e1ficamente es un juego muy completo, habr\u00e1 dado que hablar cuando sali\u00f3 en 2019 con estos gr\u00e1ficos tan t\u00e9tricos y oscuros. Se vio bastante bien, simplemente algunas texturas eran visuales pero no f\u00edsicas, por lo que al comienzo del juego me puse a atravesar hojas de \u00e1rboles y estas desaparec\u00edan dentro de mi personaje, sin alguna animaci\u00f3n particular. S\u00ed, soy quisquilloso porque algunas entregas de a\u00f1os previos han dejado el list\u00f3n demasiado alto.\n\n\u25ae En cuanto a su jugabilidad, se hace entretenido. No ser\u00e1 la gran cosa, pero est\u00e1 bueno. Nuestro personaje maneja una gomera a partir de la cual arroja 9 proyectiles distintos, por lo que debemos ir cambiando a medida en que vayamos necesitando diferentes cosas o acciones a fin de vencer a los enemigos que se van presentando. El tema est\u00e1 en que el movimiento es bastante limitado, no es que sea exactamente lineal el camino a llevar a cabo para continuar, pero la verdad que lo es en su amplia mayor\u00eda. La exploraci\u00f3n es pr\u00e1cticamente nula, prep\u00e1rense para adentrarse en algo que se caracteriza por su flamante historia.\n\n\u25ae Apreciaci\u00f3n personal: no sab\u00eda con qu\u00e9 me iba a encontrar y sal\u00ed muy satisfecho. Me dieron much\u00edsimas ganas de jugar la segunda parte, pero no voy a ser apurado y voy a esperar una oferta. Si bien en un principio vamos anticipando qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda suceder, me sorprendi\u00f3 un poco c\u00f3mo se torn\u00f3 la historia al final. Quiz\u00e1s fue algo abrupto, pero al serlo tambi\u00e9n fue poderoso. C\u00f3mprenlo, no se van a arrepentir. La historia se les va a hacer corta porque termin\u00e9 sintiendo que necesitaba m\u00e1s cosas de este mundo, sentimiento que voy a reprimir cuando me compre el siguiente juego.", "timestamp_created": 1692561881, "timestamp_updated": 1692561881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144663747": {"recommendationid": "144663747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202661140", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1692816770}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has things I like alot:\n- Good story\n- Good Setting\n- Rats\n- Good graphics\n\nIt also has a bad thing:\n- Rats\n\nBut still would recommend for everyone to play this game!", "timestamp_created": 1692557765, "timestamp_updated": 1692557765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144654962": {"recommendationid": "144654962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161981015", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1689685857}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game:\n\n- Story: 8/10\n- Gameplay: 7/10\n- Technical section: 9/10\n- Artistic section: 9/10\n- Sound section: 8/10\n- Innovation: 7/10\n- Duration: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1692549635, "timestamp_updated": 1692549663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144654310": {"recommendationid": "144654310", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482889121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1098, "last_played": 1692037811}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Estetica y ambientalmente precioso, la historia podr\u00eda haber sido algo mejor.", "timestamp_created": 1692549027, "timestamp_updated": 1692549027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144648794": {"recommendationid": "144648794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307877683", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1692464768}, "language": "english", "review": "great story", "timestamp_created": 1692544167, "timestamp_updated": 1692544167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144643256": {"recommendationid": "144643256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340669208", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1692393530}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty boring, begrundgingly finished the game just because i paid for it", "timestamp_created": 1692539212, "timestamp_updated": 1692539212, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144638030": {"recommendationid": "144638030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295013998", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 992, "last_played": 1692496630}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, I was deciding whether to play this game or not so I can get on to play the second game as that was the main purpose.

half price, I couldn't resist. After finishing the campaign, I'm so glad that I bought it. This game has been an incredible experience, one that I won't be forgetting for a while.\n\n[h1] The Visuals [/h1]\nA Plague Tale is a dark and gritty game, but also a colourful and beautiful one. The visuals do well to deliver on those aspects, with a huge variety of locations ranging from creepy and mysterious to magnificent and gorgeous. There is a huge attention to detail with each of these levels that encourages you to explore. Even the characters are interesting to look at, as they are given the same level of attention, both in their looks and animations.\n\nEverything about the setting feels authentic, and that is greatly thanks to these visuals. My only complaint in this department would be the rats. They look terrifying, but when they chase after you and defy the laws of physics, it does ruin the immersion a bit.\n\n[h1] The Story [/h1]\n\"I did it for him, and I'll kill you again if I have to. I'll kill all of you!\"\n\nI don't want to talk about the story too much as I don't want to head into spoiler territory. It is the year 1349, the start of the Black Death in France. You play as Amicia De Rune, and are tasked with keeping your younger brother, Huge De Rune, alive. Hugo was born with a unique disease that has kept him isolated his whole life. When the plague arrives, everything begins to fall apart as you are both hunted by the Inquisition.\n\nIf I talk more about it, I will spoil something. It is best jumping into it blind. All I can say is that the story is probably one of the best video game stories I have ever experienced. It's dark, it's intense and it's emotionally gripping. The stakes get higher and higher as new characters are introduced. The writing quality is excellent, with each character bringing something to the story. There's a reason this game won the story rich Steam award.\n\n[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]\nAlthough the gameplay is rather simple, it's quite diverse in how you can approach certain situations. The game is primarily a stealth game, meaning you should avoid the enemies. You are only children after all. However, if you want to kill the enemies, most situations will allow that. You are equipped with a handy sling that can be used to either distract enemies or kill them.\n\nHowever, defeating some enemies requires more than just slinging a rock in their faces. As the game progresses, you are introduced to different types of projectiles. These can be crafted at any time, given that you have the right ingredients.\n\nCrafting is a major element in this game. You can find plenty of ingredients dotted around the maps, which encourages the player to explore more. These types of projectiles range from a substance that can melt enemy soldiers' helmets to fire bombs that can kill rats. Each projectile has its use, and are unlocked to the player at the appropriate times, which helps keeping the game feeling new and refreshing.\n\nAs well as crafting projectiles, the player can also craft upgrades for themselves. These types of upgrades range from an increased carrying capacity to faster reload times for your sling. Each upgrade is important so collecting any materials you can find is essential.\n\nAs I mentioned before, this game can be an intense game. There are plenty of sequences throughout the story where one wrong step could be the death of you. There are two types of enemies. Soldiers, and rats. With soldiers, you have to be smart and tactful. With rats, you must ensure that you stay in the light and watch where you move. There will be times where rats will come out of nowhere, making you run for your lives. This is seen in the game's opening chapters. The game doesn't waste any time with getting you engaged.\n\nMy main complaint however, is relating to combat. In the moments where stealth isn't an option, the gameplay simply just consists of throwing rocks in peoples faces. This is very noticeable in the boss fights. It does vary up later in the game, but a sense of repetitiveness always lingers throughout these sequences.\n\n[h1] The Sound Design [/h1]\nI had to talk about the sound for this game, because it is incredible. The moment you load up the game, you are greeted with a beautiful main menu track. I knew I was going to like this game the first time I heard it. The soundtrack is consistently spectacular throughout the story. It instantly sets the mood of the level, and helps with the tension. Just listen to this!\n\nThe voice acting is top notch, especially for the main character, Amicia. The sound effects are all good as well, especially with the rats. As soon as you hear the ground rumbling, or faint squeaks in the background, you know there are rats nearby which, again, adds to the tension.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nAll in all, an outstanding game. If you're looking for a story rich game, this needs to be on your list.

My experience did not conclude to that result. To put it shortly-  I'm having a hard time understanding how this game is as new as 2019, because it feels at the very least like 2010.\n\n\nThe story is great, even thought I'm sick to death of religious plotpoints of any kind, that's inargubly a my-preference-thing. Either way, it's a solid and creative story. However it's also unfortunately part of why I'm so pissed. The mechanics of the game completely ruined the story for me. Heavy and sad plotpoints didn't make me sad even one bit, because I was fuming with annoyance over uncomfortable, unintuitive and seemingly inconsistent controls.\nI will say that I'm not sure if some parts were buggy or if its my controller- that's could be likely, and maybe I'll try playing it on keyboard in the future, but even if I do, this was definitely NOT a game for me.\n\nIt's too much \"Do it maticulously right or re-do it\" and a LOT of that was time-based, either be fast enough- quickly grasp what you're even looking at, and if you've lost even a smidge of your bearings- Dead. OR be intentionally slow even though you have no idea if that's the better choice or not. (resulted in plently of re-do's for me, even when I did understand what to do. I never got a good grasp/sense of what the AI-characters understood and saw, or didn't.) \n\nI was constantly taken out of the immersion of the story because I kept dying- I kept dying because the controls never naturally came to me-in addition to the times I died because the script or direction fucked with my head and made literally no organic sense to me.\n\nNothing about \"do it again and do it better\" over and over and over, is fun or useful for ME personally, but that's what this game became. I only have the last fight left, and it literally hurts my head and makes me sad to even think about trying to finish, so I'mmaaaa... not do that!\n\nThere's plently of things I do like and appriciate about the game, but there's so many issues I have with it. Soooo, even though it might be as simple as this NOT being a game for ME and my brain specifically, just for my own sanity, I can't recommend it. At the very least, wait for sales. 39$ is crazytalk.\n\nAt some point I'll probably try the sequal, because the story feels new and creative enough, the characters feel new and creative enough.

Everything about it was absolutely brilliant - from the voice acting, musical score, visuals and narrative, all the way to the pacing and atmosphere. I'm a sucker for story-driven/medieval/horror games but this one absolutely takes the cake.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence follows the story of Amicia de Rune and her younger brother, Hugo, as they traverse the plague-ridden, war-torn countryside of 13th Century France.\n\nI automatically felt connected to the brother/sister duo from the get-go, as I also have a younger brother and could see a bit of myself in Amicia. The siblings' relationship started off a bit rocky, as Hugo had been isolated from the outside world his whole life due to a mysterious blood disease. Amicia, on the other hand, felt neglected, as her mother was always preoccupied with Hugo's care. I loved the subtle hints of jealousy through some of the dialogue between Amicia and Hugo. As you progress throughout the story, you can see the change in dialogue as their relationship improves.\n\nCharlotte McBurney did an outstanding job at voicing Amicia. Bought into every emotion she portrayed through her voice. I felt her pain, fear, anger, sadness and joy... Fantastic talent! One of the chapters that stood out specifically, was Chapter XIII - [spoiler]the one where she hallucinates after Hugo ran away. That whole segment of her walking through the tunnel of dead bodies, frantically screaming for Hugo not to follow Lord Nicholas - I got chills.[/spoiler] You could hear her agony and desperation, it just felt so real. Not many games can succeed in making me feel that way.\n\nThe fact that this wasn't nominated for best musical score is a crime. The last time I came across a score that managed to be as incredibly emotional, beautiful, horrifying, chilling, heartbreaking as this, was with The Last of Us. The Mystical Castle and rat theme specifically were very ominous and creepy. An absolute masterpiece of a game and a score.\n\nOverall, A Plague Tale: Innocence was an extraordinary experience. As someone who generally plays FPS games, it was a nice change of pace to play a game with minimal combat and to rather just enjoy the story and appreciate the stunning visuals. Undoubtedly one of the best games in recent years, especially history- and originality-wise. I fell in love with this game; a game based off of rats, stealth and survival is honestly such a cool premise.

Everything is laid out like a puzzle that must be tackled and every time you are given the needed amount of items to get through each section. Add to that clunky control schemes and scripted sequences that cannot be resolved in any other way than the way the designer intended it and any deviance from that leads to NPCs or Rats not behaving as they should, because they are waiting for a scripted trigger to resolve the \"obstacle\".\n\nThe upgrade system is almost entirely pointless and just comes across as adding mechanics for the sake of adding mechanics, with little thought put in to it.\n\nBut while the story is largely the high point of the game, it's not without issue, like the wholly unsatisfactory conclusion to Nicolas. He was a central figure of the plot but when the confrontation finally arrives, [spoiler]he's quickly toppled by Lucas, whom then proceeds to smash his helmet in with a huge rock in a cutscene, which seemingly has no effect in the next cutscene where Nicolas gets up again and cuts down Lucas, sloppy and cliche way to kill off a supporting character as well. Then follows a tedious dance around a small arena before his ultimate demise.[/spoiler]\n\nSimilarly the final chapters of the game has issues, such as the Final Fantasyesque boss fight, where you don't even get to use your sling much, the item that has been your mainstay throughout the story. You cannot even use the sling to extinguish the fires in the final fight, because god forbid you continue established precedence for gameplay mechanics.\n\nFollowing the final fight you are presented with rolling credits, followed by a small final chapter and yet another credit scene, leaving the ending of the story open and without a satisfactory conclusion.

The story takes you on a roller coaster adventure where at points you feel safe then suddenly everything goes wrong. The game does a good job of pacing you through the story giving you parts of information at a time so you don't get overwhelmed to eventually understanding what Hugo has and the power of it.\n\n(GAME PLAY) At first what seems a stealth/ running simulator, the game step by step introduces many different ways to avoid and take down the rats, the Inquisition and the English troops by giving you new recipes for alchemical potions you can use to tactically deal with the chaos you have to pass through. \n\n(CONS) There is one real off putting thing in the stealth part of the game when with another companion apart from Hugo where your hidden but your companion is out in the open for the enemies to see yet they are not detected which can ruin the amazing immersion of the game at times. The price of the game is also unjust at \u00a335 so unless its on sale i don't know if the quality can make up for it. \n\n(CONCLUSION) After fully completing the game i can say i did very much enjoy it and am glad there is a game reflecting apart of history that is mainly forgotten and brings it back to life in its own unique way.

Then move just ahead of the front wheel and hopefully the cart will block this archer\u2019s arrows and the ones on the terrace. Once it stops, watch that archer as best you can and pick when to take a chance with the sling (have it started before leaving cover). Hopefully you kill the archer before they kill you.

I didn't quite know what to expect from it going in, and while the amazing production values and engaging story immediately made a good impression on me, during the first 2 to 3 hours I was a bit worried that the gameplay would amount to doing the same thing over and over again. However, past that point the game started introducing new mechanics at a good pace, or at least repackaging old mechanics in new ways that made them feel fresh. \n\nI think I mostly expected this game to be akin to the Quantic Dreams games (Detroit: Become Human and so on). In reality, the gameplay style was closer to the Last of Us, or it least it began to remind me of that game after those first couple of hours. The gameplay here isn't quite so expansive as in Naughty Dog's classic, but the combat encounters in A Plague Tale become just open enough, and give you just enough options, to make it feel like you can tackle them with agency. \n\nMost importantly, however, I just really liked the story and characters. These elements are brought to life by visuals that (at least four years after its original release) are very impressive. It goes beyond good visuals though: the story and characters are the soul of this game, and they were so well-realized that they can stand on their own, without necessarily needing those graphics to back them up. I don't often attach myself to characters in video games, but in this game I liked just about all of the nice ones, and was appropriately revolted by the evil ones. Amicia's little brother especially is exactly the right amount of precocious, without ever feeling overwrought as a child character. Only one or two moments in the whole game felt contrived to create tension (or facilitate gameplay scenarios), and other than those small instances I enjoyed this game as though it were a movie. The way the story unfolded was satisfying enough that I found myself wanting to play on just to see what would happen, and that almost never happens to me in games. \n\nI played this game in French, and thought the dialogue was great and well-acted (I am not sure if French is supposed to be the 'original' language). There were one or two annoying gameplay sequences, and the gameplay logic of the rats that are an environmental hazard doesn't always make sense, but those details did not spoil the game for me.

Great voice acting combined with often really well written dialogue. Amazing soundtrack that I'm listening to regularly on spotify. Probably the best cutscene to gameplay transitions I've ever seen. And the most minimalist (basically nonexistent) HUD you could wish for. \n\nAll this combined results in a very immersive experience if you allow that to happen. I mostly played at night with my lights off and a drink on my desk (but I usually forgot to drink). The game being so linear only helps with this immersion because you don't have to worry about navigation, inventory, gear, quests, skill tree, or any of those kinds of mechanics and can get fully lost in the atmosphere and the sound of a thousand squeaking rats. \n\nMeanwhile the gameplay itself (mainly stealth complemented by puzzles and slingshot combat) while being simple remains interesting exactly because of the atmosphere created! I've never been scared of dying in games. That has changed. This game made me play so cautious, not wanting to make any mistakes, because I hated the gut wrenching feeling when Amicia got impaled by a spear or swarmed by rats. Or even worse: when I let something happen to Hugo. I simply was too emotionally involved. Obviously, a stealth-focused game instantly becomes ten times better in this case compared to when you're playing \"trial and error\", throwing yourself at the level over and over again to figure out how to complete it.\n\nYou could say that this game is a little bit like an interactive movie. And I'd also recommend to play it like you would direct a movie. You'll probably get the most out of it this way.

A linear story can be just a rewarding, especially concerning the narrative progression. \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" took me 13 hours to complete. I was hooked and the atmosphere was absolutely the main reason for that - especially the audio. And no, it doesn't have that much replay value, but you know what, neither does masterpieces like Campo Santo's \"Firewatch.\" If, in many years, I'll have forgotten much of the story or simply want to relive the grotesque ambience, I'll have it in my library. And I am certainly looking forward to playing \"Requiem\" next.\nA tiny critique if I may. I cannot stand dying because of an NPC. Which happens more than once over and over in this game. Lucas is slow, Rodric always takes the long way round. Shooting is also at times painfully slow (even though I focused on upgrading my sling), and it sucks knowing what and how to do something, but feeling the game doesn't allow it. Worst thing is when you're stuck and have to go through the same dialogue multiple times just to get another shot.\nSo gameplay isn't always wonderful (though chucking stones at guards is disturbingly satisfying), but the story more than makes up for it.

So i decided to buy it and play. It was a cool graphics and etc. I have installed the game, started to play. First one was kinda uncomfortable with The french accent which sounds a bit dumb to me, but thats okay. Next scene there was a massacre at my mansion, and you need to hide from soldiers right behind their backs holding your little kid, and they can not notice you at all while you talking out loud. Kinda weird mhm..... Like idk guys why do you make concept of the sneak mode in the game which you can not realize that it looks genuine???? Also over and over you have to throw rocks and NPC with IQ 20 give the same \"Oh whats the noice?\". Like guys i have played games like this 10 years ago and at that time it was alright. But for 2019 or when it was released its not ok. then as million games before like assasins creed and etc your parents died and you are young weak hero starting your journey, alright. But i still wanna give the game a chance. its just the beginning right? So next there was a city which was dead because of plague and you have to run on the \"corridors\" from people so they wont kill you holding your brother. I have never seen anyone running with a kid faster than crowd of angry men. All the time you need to lift up that kid babysit him powder his buttcheeks, i started to get really annoyed. I wanna play not pay money to virtually babysit a little brat who always crying screaming and runs from me right in the arms of crazy armored dude who i need to kill with that sling shooting the rings on the armor to break it (so original)! Then when i saw the catacombs with rats it was the last drop on realism of the game. Such a bad graphics like back to 2000 and who ever seen rats acting like that and slicing people for 2 second to the bones? And some rats were burning like ashes when you get them to the corner. Just feels like creators didnt really care about practical part of the game. They got idea and somehow on their knees make it alive. So next scene i hoped that i can get rid of annoying kid, but it didnt happen he was still there running with me holding my hand. I was done. i have stopped playing and deleted the Innocence and stopped uploading the second part of the game because screw this. This game its Like a Netflix movie - parasitizing on previous game concepts and tries to put it as something new fooling you with beautiful trailers. I asked for a refund. Very disappointed.

Not too long, not too short. (I finished the game to its story conclusion in under 17 hours and that included my own dawdling as I looked around and tried to find everything I could in one playthrough)\n-The graphics and other visuals are superb, plus there's a camera mode you can use to take pictures of the scenery.\n-There's a crafting system that allows you to collect components to craft ammunition and upgrade your pack and sling but it's convenient and basic enough to not be confusing.\n\nCons: (These are minor and don't really break anything)\n-The Story does suffer from leaning a bit too much into the linear side. There's very little room for deviation from the main story path. Aside from the various collections you can grab along the way, I'd have liked to have seen a bit more \"extra\" content involving possibly dynamic MC interactions with the other characters and places within the game.\n-Progression through the story is paced based and there are a couple times during my playthrough of the game where I moved Amicia forward too quickly and it caused the story dialogue to get cut off/interrupted by the next bit of dialogue.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game and if you like games that are linear and tell a story, then I'd recommend this title.

It's a great game, and I'm eager to play the sequel soon!", "timestamp_created": 1689147473, "timestamp_updated": 1689147473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141884152": {"recommendationid": "141884152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066590240", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2708, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1690004072}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]\n\nYou can view my 3D in VR gameplay here (TAB 3D): https://youtu.be/BD-dZsa1MFE\n\nSo I am not reviewing the game. The game is excellent. There's 46.5K positive reviews on Steam you can read to heart's content. I am instead reviewing the 3D in VR experience for this game. You can do this using only free, open-source downloads. \n\nI specifically used the Geo-11 3D driver along with the game fix by masterotaku and simply Google that name and a plague tale innocence and you should find the file to download. All you have to do is download the file and extract it to the game folder with the executable to get the game to render in 3D. By default it is SBS 3D stereo, however, I manually changed it to katanga_vr which uses Top and Bottom stereoscopic 3D. \n\nOnce you do that then you'll need a way to view 3D in VR. I used Helixvision (katanga) which is no longer for sale. However, you can use Virtual Desktop or the free, open-source VR screen cap (again just Google that for free download). By default the separation is set to 100 which will create a double image, so change it to 40 for VR headsets (control f3/f4). \n\nThe game almost looks perfect without any further modifications. I played the game with default game settings on my RTX 3080 and it looked wonderful. However, I did have variable frame rates from 70-140 fps, which caused some micro screen tears / stutters. It honestly wasn't too bad, and keep in mind, I had graphics basically all on ultra settings. Game looks amazing. One of the best 3rd person looking games in VR. The only real issue was the UI / menus and sometimes seeing these vertical red bars (it rarely happened).\n\n[b]3D in VR Rating 8/10.[/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed my review, please consider joining my Steam Curator Group.

I'd love to complain to you about that silly babysitting mechanic of gameplay, but instead I've got a more annoying issue to make you aware of.  The awful, no warning/no going back, cutscene/checkpoint system.  \nI'm only on the 4th chapter and this is like the third time this kind of thing has happened.  First, it was missing-out on collectables and next, it was areas I hadn't explored yet (so probably more materials and collectables).  They don't warn you before you are about to be put through a cut-scene and miss a ton of collectable sh*t and irreversibly lose the ability to upgrade.  I wanted to search the entire house, before having to talk with anyone, so I could upgrade at the workbench and then go back and collect the materials which I didn't have space to carry.  But no, I apparently opened the wrong door, so now, there's no way back because a video gets triggered by opening the door. \nIt isn't the video that I find frustrating, it is the fact that I'm now unable to complete the things I had intended on doing before being thrust into the cutscene.  Now I can't, not just get the extra valuables, I also can't upgrade now.  Why doesn't it warn you before proceeding? And I can't go back to a previous checkpoint, because it only offers the most recent, which puts me right AFTER the video, not before, where I want to be.  The only other option is to go back to the beginning of the chapter, which is like a whole Splinter Cell's level worth of stealthy manoeuvring and collecting all the items my pockets are now full to the brim with.  All that work and I can't even use the stuff to upgrade! \nThis is, in my mind, game-breaking.  Why didn't they sort this out before its release? I'm absolutely sure I'm not the only one who has been having this issue.

Normally, actors voicing small children are pretty bad, but this kid was very convincing and endearing.  \n\nThe interactions between all characters were great throughout the story, the combat was very basic and was more based on easy to solve (but satisfying nonetheless) puzzles.  \n\nOverall a short a sweet game, that is well worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1688598564, "timestamp_updated": 1688598564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141403677": {"recommendationid": "141403677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022682375", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 777, "last_played": 1688143925}, "language": "english", "review": "8.5/10 ;!!", "timestamp_created": 1688594497, "timestamp_updated": 1688594497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141393968": {"recommendationid": "141393968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078034751", "num_games_owned": 848, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 974, "last_played": 1688584065}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth buying even for the full price.

I love how it focused on the black plague way back in the 1300s but gave it a bit of a twist to make it interesting. It's a story about so many different things such as family, truth, and sacrifice. The game always had me wondering what was going to happen in the next chapter. The graphics were beautiful and detailed. I felt at points in the game I did have problems with the audio. The music would sometimes cut out or stop playing and then would turn back on. I am not sure if this is a problem with the game or a problem on my end, but it is something I noticed. I would say an issue that stands out to be with this game is there being no difficulty to choose from. It's a standard difficulty. There were times were the game was easy. There were times where I wanted to punch a hole through my monitor. So this game definitely gives you the best of both worlds. I love the length of this game as well. It's short, sweet, and to the point, instead of a story that drags on. Overall, I enjoyed the game. I didn't want to put it down and I had such a blast with it that it made me start doing research on the history of the black plague. I recently found out there is a sequel to this game, so I will definitely be checking that out.

The gameplay is all very basic and everything you do in this game has been done to death in many others. But all of those elements are done way better than I've seen in other games, such as the stealth and follower AI, mainly because its very forgiving. This was one of the first games to make me actually try and be stealthy whenever possible, rather than just killing everything, and I think that's because the combat has a nice balance of making you feel both helpless and powerful. And the pacing is perfect, constantly switching up what you're doing so you don't notice the repetitive gameplay too much. I was also expecting this to just be another plague sob story, but it was actually quite engaging and did a good job at setting up the gameplay. \n\nQuite a few bugs, but I was also expecting that with this being a AA game. If you get stuck in a tent, you have to toggle fullscreen and tab out. In chapter 9 and on you have to lock your monitor to 120hz max. \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.

A very unique story, and characters to match. Plague Tale: Innocence is a dark game for sure. Betrayal and grief are plenty, each person fighting their own conflicts while also being forced into those of others.\n\nThe gameplay excels through its varied stealth and combat. Many times you must be creative and persistent in this world, not necessarily due to difficulty, but instead for the purpose of immersion. I would often feel so enclosed in the narrative that each decision made felt personal, as if you really were trying to preserve the lives of these individuals, and often their sanity too. The writing is such to convey a perfect sense of what struggle your character is going through. \n\nThe combat is well implemented, and though not incredibly varied, offers the right amount of use as to not become repetitive. The stealth mends very well into the world; and unlike many other attempts at stealth, this feels more polished and very practical. \n\nI would definitely recommend this game to those looking for a cinematic adventure filled with many memorable moments, and above average gameplay mechanics. It never feels sluggish. I\u2019d describe it as meticulous, though not tedious. \n\nBe warned! There were a few moments where I was completely softlocked, and had to die or restart from a recent checkpoint to continue, and at the last boss fight, the game broke entirely and the action required to defeat it was not functioning. I was able to fix it by verifying my files, then restarting the game and continuing the boss fight in the  chapter. I originally wrote a negative review as I could not fix this, but as I stated, verifying my files did the trick and allowed me to continue thankfully. \n\nOtherwise, for the few issues I had, but the many positives, I would give this game a solid 8.5/10.

While I definitely enjoyed the game, it is far from perfect.\n\nThe game is set in dark fantasy medieval setting, both design and graphics are flawless. In-game mechanics such as stealth, fighting abilities, crafting and exploration are very smooth and well designed, I never felt like I'm wasting my time in this game and never got irritated by any of these aspects. \n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence has a number of very unique characters that feel alive, all thanks to the voice actors and animators.\n\nHowever, game design is not that perfect. You will spend 9+ hours either running away, figuring out your way from point A to point B using stealth mechanics, or solving puzzles. It quickly gets dull and repetitive, but engaging story around prevents you from getting bored. Stealth and scripted events in Plague Tale look very artificial and so non-realistic that it is almost surreal. You go just behind people in absolute silence being unnoticed, levels are built so that there's only one way through with all the stuff located so that you run through it and launch in-game scripts.\nI encountered 3 major bugs that prevented me from progressing so I had to google how to fix or get around them. 2 of them are connected to unlocked FPS in the game. It seems that the game works more stable with 60 fps lock. \n\nEven though I quickly got tired of artificial levels done for stealth I simply can't give this game less than 8 out of 10, it has a decent story and well-built, I just dislike some game design decisions, but it is not that much critical for that short game.", "timestamp_created": 1686961167, "timestamp_updated": 1686961167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140173014": {"recommendationid": "140173014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340984992", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1693761860}, "language": "english", "review": "It took me a while to get the dynamics of the game, because there's a lot of stealth moves and story telling.

The world, even in its tragic, apocalyptic state, finds ways to look stunning, beautiful, and real. The cinematic scenes, interactions, the atmosphere, events, and the people are very much alive. They all seamlessly work to elevate the story to a new level. Can we just talk about the number of times where I spam clicked the screenshot button during a cutscene or stopped to play with the camera feature in-game at the sight of something spectacular? Even without the screenshots, I still vividly recall the various places within the game. \n\nThe character development is big. Even though we do not meet a  ton of characters, the few companions that Amicia and Hugo make along the way feel like family. While I wouldn't consider myself an extremely sentimental person, I do often sympathize with the cast and rooting for their growth in the many ways that they happen. Unfortunately, you do not control which companions join you on chapters and quests as the game is purely story-driven. However, there is enough bonding time for them all. \n\nThe gameplay is rather simple and consists mostly of stealth and using items. Amicia's primary weapon is a slingshot which she finds creative ways to use. One shouldn't expect crazy and in-depth combat as it is somewhat out of character for the girl and her little brother trying to survive (and not to kill everyone). What makes the gameplay interesting is the multitude of ways that you can approach a scenario or event. There are many items in your arsenal that can be crafted at your choice; its about how you use them. There is no fixed way of doing something unless otherwise told. The boss fights have mechanisms that are not too difficult to understand - typically if something doesnt click right away, observe the surroundings for clues. \n\nAll and all, I personally found the game to be fun, enjoyable and a thrilling experience. It was like being apart of a movie with twists and turns. I was pleasantly surprised at the incredible execution of scenes and character/world building. I would definitely re-live the story again someday.

Si lo positivo es mas que lo negativo por supuesto que si.\n\nDe todas formas a nivel personal hay cosas que me obligaron a rendirme de rodillas sin chistar. Sus personajes, especialmente Amicia, yo pensaba que no podr\u00eda encontrarme otro personaje femenino tan entra\u00f1able desde Bioshock Infinite como con Elizabeth.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n juega mucho a su favor, los escenarios en general est\u00e1n muy logrados. Se juega mucho con los contrastes, los momentos felices realmente se ven felices, mientras que los momentos tristes y de dolor se van a ver justamente as\u00ed.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente esta muy bien, no es el portento gr\u00e1fico tampoco pero esta muy bien, esta bastante bien optimizado. Sin embargo si tenemos en cuenta que no parece tener un presupuesto tan impresionante comparado con otros titanes de la industria, algo respeto es lo mucho y muy bien que se puede hacer con poco, y aqu\u00ed no va solo por el apartado gr\u00e1fico. No tengo datos de cual fue el presupuesto para este juego, pero se nota que fue acotado pero en lo que a mi respecta, muy bien invertido.\n\nLa jugabilidad es optima, no hay lucha cuerpo a cuerpo, de hecho que un enemigo siquiera se acerque significa practicamente la muerte, por lo que nuestra arma principal es la distancia y el sigilo. Y por eso mismo tenemos la mejor arma de todas, la honda de Amicia que tendra ciertas municiones para ciertos facetas, en general muy bien diferenciadas entre si y casi siempre para un unico proposito. Agradecimientos especiales a Lucas, que hariamos sin ti amigo !!\n\nClaro que lo divertido del juego son las ratitas que a lo \u00fanico que le temen es a la luz y que no dudaran (y tampoco duraran) en comernos pedazo a pedazo si no tenemos con que iluminar nuestro camino y si bien el videojuego no tiene puzzles en si mismos, debemos plantearnos bien como dar cada paso entre las ratas y los soldados enemigos que tengamos que generalmente eludir. El juego realmente no desea que vayas por ah\u00ed eliminando a quien veas a tu paso, sin embargo es posible hacerlo, aun que en muchas ocasiones es preferible no hacerlo, especialmente si queremos mejorar las pocas pero claras habilidades que tenemos, pues hay objetos que son limitados que iremos encontrando durante la aventura que sirven tanto para mejorar habilidades como para crear ciertas herramientas que nos abrir\u00e1n camino o nos permitir\u00e1 sacarnos alg\u00fan que otro enemigo del trayecto.\n\nSon cinco las veces que termine el juego, esta ultima siendo oficial en Steam. Y si bien parece que el juego es posible terminarlo en poco tiempo, la primera vez tengo recuerdo de haber tardado mucho mas, por lo que no dejarse llevar por lo que dice Steam en cuanto a tiempo, a la quinta vez uno ya conoce cada tramo y mi intenci\u00f3n fue mas que nada sacar todos los logros y como agradecimiento finalmente comprarlo. Si se juega tranquilo y disfrut\u00e1ndolo es un titulo relativamente largo si tenemos en cuenta que no hay misiones secundarias ni nada por el estilo, o sea no hay relleno. El videojuego en si es mas bien lineal y no hay mapas o niveles donde tengamos mucha libertad mas que avanzar de un punto a otro, por supuesto que en algunos casos se podr\u00e1 elegir un trayecto A o B dependiendo del caso, pero son muy escasos y b\u00e1sicos.\n\n[spoiler]Amicia sin duda alguna el personaje que mas sufre toda la transici\u00f3n, y ya desde el principio absoluto, vemos ese lazo importante que tiene con su padre y como al poco tiempo lo pierde. Tiene un hermano del que pr\u00e1cticamente no sabe nada, casi que ni lo conoce al igual que a su madre Beatrice que vive y se desvive por curar a su hijo Hugo de la enfermedad que lo asola. Amicia de pronto se encuentra que se queda sin padre ni madre, sin hogar y con Hugo a cuestas sin pr\u00e1cticamente saber que hacer, indefensa en un mundo hostil con un ni\u00f1o que no sabe nada del mundo. Sin embargo ella va a hacer todo lo posible por proteger a su hermano y si bien al principio le cuesta aceptar todo, poco a poco se va dando cuenta de lo importante que es para su hermano estar cerca y protegerlo.\nSi bien es una ficci\u00f3n, me gusta mucho el crecimiento de este personaje en particular, por que es el cl\u00e1sico individuo que saca la fuerza que f\u00edsicamente no tiene por su complexi\u00f3n, pero que la saca igual desde donde puede, ese cl\u00e1sico dicho conocido de que una madre saca fuerza donde no la tiene y termina sobrepasando cualquier adversidad, pues b\u00e1sicamente eso. De todas maneras esta muy bien implementado y es cre\u00edble porque Amicia a la distancia resulta letal y eso es totalmente factible.\n\nHugo es el infante de la historia, el hermano peque\u00f1o de Amicia y el mas importante (desde el punto de vista de la historia) ya que sera el que tenga la habilidad y la desgracia de manipular a esta \"plaga\". Un ni\u00f1o que vivi\u00f3 pr\u00e1cticamente toda su vida encerrado sin conocer el exterior, por lo que incluso despu\u00e9s de haber perdido todo al igual que su hermana se le despierta ese esp\u00edritu de exploraci\u00f3n para con el mundo exterior, todo aquello con lo que no tuve contacto nunca lo va experimentando junto con Amicia, lo bueno y lo desagradable del mundo. Tambi\u00e9n me parece un personaje muy bien construido porque constantemente va cambiando de parecer, en general como somos los humanos, ya que vivimos mutando, cambiando de ideas al menos la mayor\u00eda de las veces, en este caso Hugo es muy vulnerable porque por un lado quiere creer que el mundo es bueno pero a medida que van pasando cosas se desilusiona mas y mas, y si no fuera por Amicia caer\u00eda pr\u00e1cticamente al instante.\nEntiendo que a mucha gente se le hizo cansino este personaje, sinceramente no se que esperaban de un ni\u00f1o de 5 o 6 a\u00f1os, poco de comprensi\u00f3n... tiene todo el sentido del mundo que este preguntando constantemente cosas, es un ni\u00f1o... y que en pr\u00e1cticamente todo el juego los hermanos vayan de la mano tiene tambi\u00e9n todo el sentido del mundo ya que es la base jugable del titulo.\n\nLucas que sin pena ni gloria no le queda otra que unirse al grupo, y muy bien que as\u00ed sea, pues es clave para que el peque\u00f1ajo pueda subsistir en la aventura.\n\nRodric es el hijo de un herrero que conoceremos en alg\u00fan punto de la historia, hay dos cosas que me gustaron mucho de este personaje. La primera es la interacci\u00f3n que tiene con Hugo, si me baso en los di\u00e1logos Rodric es quien le afianza la seguridad a Hugo y aparte es una figura paterna. La segunda raz\u00f3n es porque hace en lo que a mi respecta el mejor sacrificio de todo el juego y por ende uno de los momentos mas tristes de la aventura.[/spoiler]\n\nLa m\u00fasica va de la mano con el juego, ya sea en momento de tranquilidad o en esos momentos cr\u00edticos donde especialmente nuestros dos protagonistas deben enfrentarse a sus peores miedos, y todo ello al menos a mi me lo transmiti\u00f3 y lo sent\u00ed como tal, para mi es de agradecer, es lo que busco tambi\u00e9n cuando veo una pel\u00edcula, especialmente si es un buen drama.

[/spoiler] [spoiler] and then Hugo throws a tantrum because he wants to go see his mommy, so he grabs a wooden mallet and starts loudly banging on the tables, and then he RUNS OFF OUTSIDE, so you have to go chase him. Like, seriously? Did he forget about the HOARD of murderous townfolk that we JUST escaped from?

The puzzles aren\u2019t overly challenging, though I caught myself out a few times by over-thinking and over-complicating things.\n\nUsing an i5 12600k and RTX 3080, performance was excellent through the whole game, holding a rock-solid 120Hz at 1440p once I turned down the shadow maps by one click.

I must add that I played the game from start to the end on the Steam Deck.\n\nFirst, the setting is awesome, at least a game/story that take place in medieval France without looking like a boring history children classroom. Add some quality french voices! The scenery is just breathtaking, the level design make feel a bit restricted sometimes, but most of the times it fits well that you don't want to go wander (and get eaten by a gr-- err rats).\n\nStorywise, I'm happy. It add a supernatural component to the setting, but something that blends well with the setting. The characters are relatable and credible, it's a just a bit of shame the story do not manage to include some more characterization in some of them. I found Hugo especially well done for  a 5 year old. The plot is consistent, and makes the game story go forward like a movie.\n\nGraphics are quite good on the Deck. No performance issue despite the Deck compatibility chart. Like previously said, scenery is awesome, characters looks good even if the facial expressions are a little bit too shy -- but given the darkness of what the characters go through, maybe that's everybody PTSD taking place.\n\nGames mechanics and puzzle: collaborative puzzles are very nice and fit well your companions skill sets. You are kindly nudged if you don't see a puzzle solution, that's nice because ambiance-wise, you don't really expect to run around for hours looking how to proceed. Fighting is a bit weird: Amicia's slingshot skills make you think you're in a superhero movie, but you are a glass canon, not doomguy. It's a good thing it's not fighting all the time. The part I found a bit weird was the gear upgrade system that felt not intuitive on my first run -- and a bit frustrating because I was often at a bench without the possibility to upgrade anything.\n\nSo, this games deserves praises and recognition with a setting and story that really push the player forward.

Also I got the game in a discounted price for like I think less than 5 dollars\n\nRight so, I'm gonna be talking about the pros and cons and recommendation.\n\nPros\n-Have good story that you'll enjoy.\n-Visuals are phenomenal. If you are wondering if it has a Ray tracing because it came out in 2019. Unfortunately it does not have it but the game never failed to deliver stunning visuals, Trust me.\n-The development between amicia and hugo's relationship as siblings is good but I wish that it was also done to the other characters like Rodric and Lucas. Because as the story go, they will be important and yeah most of the character does but all throughout my play I didn't get any affection to them. The progress on them is just, I can't say it's poor but short.\n-The boss fights are decent and I enjoyed the last two boss fight.\n-Some of the story is intense and most of it requires you to be stealthy.\n-Animation is good\n-Optimization is decent I am able to play in ultra graphics with a bit of stutter but it will not affect your gameplay it will be less and less as the story go. I'm using RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 3600. So if you have the same specs as mine you will not have any problem.\n-Autosave so you won't have to worry to save your game.\n\nCons\n-Just like I said all the side characters doesn't have development between the sibling except for Lucas.\n-Acting is bland but the emotions is there.\n-There is a bug that I encountered at near end of the game. (spoiler alert) it's when Hugo is protecting her mother. If you failed to protect your mother from arrows but at the same time killed the enemies the game will not trigger the death animation and the dialogue will continue but everything will pause. I actually found a way to fix it without restarting the game you just have to alt+tab and the menu will show and you will be able to restart from the last checkpoint. Make sure to do it right after that.\n\nRecommendation\nFor full game experience. I suggest you to go the settings, game, advance hud settings and turn everything to no to make it a little bit harder, also turn your aim assist to low. Don't worry the controls is easy to find out. Go play in ultra graphical settings (if possible). Use the surround speaker in audio settings if you have a surround sound headset or speaker (it is for the better sound experience). It is ok to take your time in clearing every part of the places so don't be afraid to loot (don't do it in a chase scene).\n\nLast, is it worth it for 23.10 dollars? It's up to you. You'll be the one to tell if it's worth it because for me it is. I got it for a discounted price and enjoyed the 9 hours of gameplay so that's why for me it is worth it. Maybe you'll get the same experience even with the original price.", "timestamp_created": 1686135899, "timestamp_updated": 1686135899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139679242": {"recommendationid": "139679242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023136804", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1686128393}, "language": "english", "review": "The 14th century was one of the most horrible chapters in European history. The lands were ravaged by famine, war, and a terrifying pandemic of then-unknown origin. It is in these apocalyptic times that A Plague Tale: Innocence is set.\n\nThis is a game that really makes fantastic use of its setting to deliver a haunting story filled with memorable environments. From primeval forests to dead battlefields to crumbling castles and opulent cathedrals, there is rarely a moment where the visuals do not shine, and the story of orphaned siblings Amicia and Hugo is compelling from start to finish thanks in particular to outstanding voice acting for the main cast. It's an excellent narrative that should delight fans of story-centric gaming.\n\nWhat is also interesting is how the Black Death is represented in this world. If, like I was, you might be worried there will be graphic depictions of bubonic plague and what it does to the human body, rest assured: no, nothing quite like that. Instead, this devastating outbreak is presented through a fantasy lens, with enormous squirming hordes of outright demonic rats serving as the game's biggest threat. The only thing standing between you and a painful death at the hands (teeth?) of these chittering creatures is light. You'd better hope your torch doesn't go out...\n\nOn the subject of gameplay, what's on offer here is not particularly revolutionary, but the familiar blend of stealth-action and mild environmental puzzle-solving is executed robustly enough that it doesn't really matter that there are no great innovations; this does not feel like \"we have The Last of Us at home\", if you ask me. It is good enough to stand on its own feet. \n\nI've been a fan of the not-quite-AAA, often European-developed, narrative-driven games published by the likes of Focus for a while now, and this is easily one of the best ones in that category.

I wont lie, I did have to look up walkthroughs here and there and replayed parts countless times because for the life of me the slingshot would not lock on or the way forward was obscure.

Trata de mezclar una historia pseudohist\u00f3rica (plagada de falacias, por otro lado; t\u00edpicas justificaciones desde el desconocimiento de ni\u00f1os de 10 a\u00f1os adoctrinados) con una trama absurda y que a la mitad del \"juego\" pierde todo sentido y desvar\u00eda en un absurdo... Ideas buenas de opciones \"jugables\" y mec\u00e1nicas totalmente desaprovechadas, con un \u00e1rbol de progreso que no aporta mucho. Las nuevas opciones se solapan y al final hay poca variedad porque el movimiento y el punto de vista ortop\u00e9dico en tercera persona hacen que la \"jugabilidad\" se pierda. Hay, ahora que lo recuerdo, opciones como echarse a un lado que son totalmente inservivles, no las he usado nunca. No hay combates como tales, se trata de un juego con gr\u00e1ficos bastante aceptables, aunque necesita una GPU potente, una 970 apenas llegaba a los 60FPS al m\u00e1ximo a 1920x1200 (eso s\u00ed, no usa apenas VRAM, las texturas no son malas, pero en 4K deben verse bastante mal; con DSR 1600p que usa una RTX3080 12GB 384b OC no alcanza el 70% de uso y nunca llega a 4GB de VRAM). Quien guste de efectos del todo a  cien de postprocesado, pueden dejar la aberraci\u00f3n crom\u00e1tica, filtrado paso alto y ruido, pero si no te gusta estropear la imagen porque est\u00e9 de moda, toca poner a 0 esas opciones en el fichero de configuraci\u00f3n (no aparecen en el men\u00fa de gr\u00e1ficos del juego).\n\nGr\u00e1ficos: 8\nSonido: 8'5\nM\u00fasica: 8'5 (usar zanfo\u00f1a no evita que la inclusi\u00f3n de instrumentos totalmente ajenos a la \u00e9poca hagan de la m\u00fasica un quiero parecer pero no lo soy de la \u00e9poca).\nHistoria: 5. No dice nada, un algo que no se desarrolla y que ni es atrayente per se, ni se narra bien, los di\u00e1logos son abominables, con una forma de hablar y unas palabras que para nada \"parecen\" de la \u00e9poca, sino m\u00e1s bien de ni\u00f1atos nacidos hace 20 a\u00f1os. La representaci\u00f3n de la sociedad medieval es una aberraci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n, y sin mentar la fe cat\u00f3lica expl\u00edcitamente, pero usando su imaginer\u00eda e incluso a\u00f1adiendo en coleccionables personajes reales totalmente deformados y tratados como dicta la actual doctrina 2030, sin ning\u00fan tipo de trasfondo de realidad. La imagen de la inquisici\u00f3n (b\u00fasqueda) es la de \"siempre\" negrolegendaria; al menos en este caso es la francesa...\nJugabilidad: 5; y me estoy pasando. El juego en realidad son pasillos con alguna breve ramificaci\u00f3n que, al estar todo totalmente predefinido por \"scriot\", si llegas a un sitio antes de ir a otro, la animaci\u00f3n te salta, cota el camino y lo pierdes. Esto sumado a los objetos usables para crear objetos hace que pases el tiempo tratando de encontrar objetos olvidando la trama del momento... Estos pasillos que es el juego llevan a zonas donde se presentan sencillos puzles que al final con las opciones dadas (que se pueden simplemente resumir en disparar a la cabeza) apenas se exploran las opciones y en casi todos los casos est\u00e1n tan medidos que no puedes ahcer ciertas opciones porque te dan ya lo que hacer para que salga, de hecho te dan los materiales necesarios para que un\u00edvocamente crees el objeto a usar. De la supuesta inteligencia artificial mejor ni hablamos.\nTOTAL: 7 (pero como \"juego\", de 5).\n\nNo digo que no sea recomendable para echar un rato, pero es una oportunidad perdida en lo jugable, y una aberraci\u00f3n t\u00edpica pretendiendo mostrar el medievo que no fue as\u00ed. De la inquisici\u00f3n y la Iglesia, mejor ni hablar, es material anticat\u00f3lico y \"veintetr\u00e9inco\".

Lo \"escriptado\" que est\u00e1 todo, la ortop\u00e9dica movilidad cuando llevas lastres, digo \"compa\u00f1eros\" lo dejan en una serie de puzles simples, pseudo zonas de \"sigilo\" (ejem) y una pretendida trama que no hay por d\u00f3nde cogerla.

The story is also pretty good. \n\nCons: There were plenty of bugs that could be annoying, the game is short for its price, and some characters were written weirdly. \n\n7.5/10\n=====================================================================================\n\nFor context I 100 percent the game \n\nA plague tale is a game developed by Asobo Studios. I was made aware of this game by my brother, and I got it entirely based on his recommendations. I would say that the game is very good. I very much enjoyed the game, and I think you will too. Here are the pros and cons of the game\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\nAtmosphere - I would say that the biggest positive about this game is the atmosphere. It makes this game amazing and carries it hard. it was able to achieve this amazing atmosphere with 3 main components. \n\n\tMusic - the medieval percussive string music in this game is phenomenal. It adds to the game as a whole and allows for intense moments to shine. \n\n\tVoice Acting - The voice acting from most of the main cast is very good and adds to the emotions and the story\n\n\tArt Style - Not to get confused with graphics, the art style makes you feel like you are playing in the medieval period. This makes the game look really good even if the actual graphics fidelity is not so impressive\n\nStory - The story itself is pretty good. I won't talk about it here to not spoil it. \n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\nBugs - There were plenty of bugs that were very annoying to come across during this playthrough, one of them is invisible barriers, that for some reason do not allow Amica to move to another area. The only fix is to change the game to windowed mode, go past where ever you need to go, and then change it back to full screen.\n\nLength - The length for a game is 40 dollars at full price (most of the time tho, you can get a pretty good discount) The game is very short. The only reason why I have above 20 hours in the game, is because there were lengthy sections that I needed to go back and leave my game running. I probably spent around 14 hours playing the game. \n\nThe way that SOME characters were written - Sometimes, some character sections are written very weirdly. For example, not to name anyone. You meet them while trying to get an item important to the story. You save them while they were getting escorted by guards, and all of a sudden it feels like they will do whatever you want them to do, with no thought behind it. It just feels very weird.\n\n[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]\n\nOverall, this game is a short, but memorable experience that I will surely remember for a long time. I would recommend picking up this game when it is discounted. You will not regret it.\n\n[h2] 8/10 [/h2]", "timestamp_created": 1684983142, "timestamp_updated": 1692583307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138940838": {"recommendationid": "138940838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256304698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1684978029}, "language": "english", "review": "Had to quit the game because of glitch in chapter 7 at the water mill.

I'm not a gaming god or whatsoever but I do hold quite a lot of gaming experience in that grey matter which fills the upper part of my skull.\n\nSo i'll start with the positive things:\nOn my system the game runs decent on my system (1440P on a RX6700XT and i5-10600K and 16GB ram). I've seen worse ports so can't say it runs bad. The storytelling on the other hand is a lot better than tons of games. It's a nice story with characters that are very interesting themselves too and the story is picked up every 1 or 2 puzzles so you stay invested deeply to unfold the next part. The story itself has some very minor issues but overall i can't say bad things about it. The character building of the protagonist also is done quite well; you can upgrade your character with new skills and you get to discover a lot of \"tools/weapons\" during the game that will support you then and later on. The levels are well-built, you really get the feeling of walking around in France during the middle-ages while the Plague was wreaking havoc on the population. For a 2019 console game the graphics are not bad at all; but looking at other games from the same year (or even older) I can't say that this game stands out for its beauty or realism. Another thing i really liked is that the talk-animations are synced with the Original language those people were speaking; French.  It took me a while to find out exactly which of the voice-overs was the original, as the game was defaulted to English (i live in a country that has Dutch and French as official language) on my system and nowhere was stated that French was the original language. When u change the language for speech during a conversation, the sync will only be corrected in the next conversation you have with someone.\n\nNow some negatives ...\nI ended with the speech language; sadly you cannot set the game to use the OG language (French) while keeping the English for all the rest of the game. Eg if you set the subs to english, you'll hear french, read english subs but if you see an item and put your mouse over it, that text will still appear in french. So you can't change the complete game language to english and then set 'speech' to french. \nThe game could've run A LOT better had they not just blatantly made a port, add some settings and call it a day. For the graphics we get presented this game performs not that good. I'm sure that if they properly ported the game to PC and fixed their engine to use the available resources optimally, we could've seen some 30 to 50% extra frames per second. I've seen games that look a lot more realistic (and need more resources) and at the same time run a lot smoother.\nMy biggest problem with this game is sadly not how it looks, sounds or feels; but how it plays. In my experience this game doesn't leave a lot of room for creativity; If the devs want you to solve a puzzle THIS WAY, often that's the ONLY way you can do it without dying. It's ok during the very first part of the game, where you learn to handle the game and it's controls. Once you have the controls under your knee I don't think it's really opportune to restrict the player of being creative. I'm not saying there's no room for creativity during the complete game; but almost every puzzle that you need to solve inside a building is designed in such a way that you need to solve it the \"developer's way\". This results in having to retry puzzles a few times, until you finally discovered which solution, according to the devs, works best. I don't mind to have some puzzles that need an 'exact solution\" from time to time, but when half of the gameplay is like this it becomes boring and dull. That's also the reason i stopped playing after some 14hrs. I was playing in 2hr \"episodes\", and i already had problems finding motivation to begin with the 4th 2hr-episode but after the 7th part I was so bored with the game that even the nice story couldn't convince me anymore to just continue the game.  I'm really into good stories but this game kills the interest in that story by adding such a bad game-design between the evolution of the story. \nA game can have a good story, but the story can't be the main event of the game if the rest is just some bad gameplay to add extra time to the experience.. EIther you've got a good story you want to tell and use a walking sim type of gameplay to add time OR you put decent effort an playtesting in the game so it's enjoyable for at least 70% of the people that buy the game. In this game I can't believe they ever hit that mark. I've played worse games too, but for how this game is positioned (as a AAA game) I can truly say i've played TONS and TONS of games that were better.  It's sad that this fantastic and interesting story has to live with such bad gameplay in the same piece of entertainment software.\n\nConclusion:\nI really enjoyed the first few hours of the game, but soon it became dull, boring, uninteresting because of how the gameplay tears down every brick that was so nicely built by the story itself. I can't recommend this game other than if you get it on a promo or sale. It's not worth the full price and the chance is high that you'll stop playing before you even get to the halfway point of the game. I probably won't pick up the sequel, for those who did I really hope that the devs actually paid some attention to the problems that make this game so bad for a pc-game. I'll probably never find it out because right now Asobo is on my 'avoid-list' until i've heard, read and saw reviews from a new game of theirs where people are saying they really learned from the mistakes they made in their previous game(s).", "timestamp_created": 1684975705, "timestamp_updated": 1684975705, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562365412712097168", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138933389": {"recommendationid": "138933389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017475890", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1684966643}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy chulo, bonita historia y buen gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1684966685, "timestamp_updated": 1684966685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138930636": {"recommendationid": "138930636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099648091", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 582, "last_played": 1685962870}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than most AAA games, definitely need more like this.", "timestamp_created": 1684963195, "timestamp_updated": 1684963195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138927053": {"recommendationid": "138927053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065554023", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1684958127}, "language": "english", "review": "I was looking for a game with a good storyline after playing Telltale's TWD and this popped out.

However dying so often was very immersion breaking. The frequent check points made death all the more inconsequential. Quite often enemies would see me from a mile away while I'm 90% behind an obstacle and at the same time for me to then escape them by going round a half a meter object. This is also immersion-breaking and many times my death was unjustified considering the rules expectations I was set until that point.

Lightweight spoiler-free review below (though this is one of the games that is deserving of a novel of praise).\n\nThe -0.2 was for a shitty prologue that left a sour taste in my mouth for the first third of the game. Otherwise, this game is a 10/10. Graphics, story, gameplay, character, and just overall planning & writing for the game was excellent. I really wish more games were like this. I found myself really admiring the writing and the way the story was told, as well as the characters. I don't think that there is even one character that was poorly written. Hell, even the vile demon rats had quite the charm by the end! \n\nIt had drawn me in so much halfway through the first game that I was really bummed out when I heard it wasn't getting a third game. You know how One Piece, Naruto, etc etc has a gazillion episodes, and genres like The Elder Scrolls & Star Wars have never ending lore with new games? Yeah, I would totally buy into something like that with lots of content and follows these characters. To me, this is infinitely better than say, Harry Potter, yet there's just way less story to the universe. I would totally buy a game telling a backstory of Amicia's father or mother, or what happens to Meilia after she departs, or even more games just following Amicia. Amicia was very well written and I would like to see more content with her on screen. I could say the same of other unnamed characters, but that's not possible given story circumstances. \n\nI'm a dude that writs a lot of negative reviews.

The religious order is convinced that their royal bloodline is hiding the secret of liberating the country from the increasing hordes of bloodthirsty plague rats and, in an act of rage, murder the de Rune parents.\n\nThe story is unapologetically brutal, set in a dark atmosphere where piles of sick bodies line abandoned streets and others are hung to lure the monstrous swarms away from ruthless, patrolling guards. This is complimented by Olivier Deriviere\u2019s harsh symphony of violins, cellos, and a lute, which mix tones of dread with slivers of hope.\n\nIn fact, in the forefront, is a tale of inspiring, ruthless idealism for the siblings, contrasting the oppressive world that they live in and the people who would do them harm. Along the way, they make allies who add a strong dynamic to the de Rune family, without taking the spotlight from them.\n\nThe narrative itself is tight; there are no side-quests and only a few optional collectibles that are not terribly tedious if you have a guide or a few minutes to run around in the narrow world\u2026 which isn\u2019t a bad thing, either. Yes, the game is short \u2013 it took me about fifteen hours to a single playthrough \u2013 but the quality is strong and it never overstays its welcome, something that the market does not always understand.\n\nVoice-acting in this game really shines; despite a few adults voicing kids, I never found it jarring, and they do such a great job. The standouts are, of course, Charlotte McBurney (Amicia) and Logan Hannan (Hugo)\u2026 as well as Edan Hayhurst, whose character I will not spoil.\n\nI should mention that Asobo Studio is a French development team, so the original cast is voiced by francophones. I did play some of the game in their native language, but found that the English voice actors/actresses carried their scenes with far more emotion. This, of course, is a personal preference.\n\nGraphically, it looks good, although I should mention that facial animation is quite stiff, both in how characters move their mouths or the dead way they shift their eyes. I did not find it to be off-putting, but definitely noticeable.\n\nAs far as gameplay, this may be the biggest turnoff: You are cast into third-person, avoiding guards throughout the country, slipping behind blockades and buckets, or inside conveniently-placed tall grass like \u201cHorizon\u201d stealth mechanics. Attacking is minimal, especially as resources can be pretty scarce, so you will usually be trying to figure out how to sneak by guards after distracting them with a satchel full of rocks.\n\nThe only mechanic consists of sections where Amicia will need to go on her own\u2026 but only too far, otherwise her younger brother will have a panic attack and you will need to restart the mission.\n\nA Plague Tale: Innocence is a short, but powerful coming-of-age story about finding hope in spite of strife. Its character development is strong, never taking the spotlight off of its core: a sister and brother who become insufferable. The combat, while the weakest part, is not enough to keep people away from experiencing such a powerful tale.", "timestamp_created": 1683522207, "timestamp_updated": 1691811708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137983002": {"recommendationid": "137983002", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972884014", "num_games_owned": 1885, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1684991761}, "language": "english", "review": "story, voice acting and graphics are all top notch.  very enjoyable, i started this one because requiem had made references to this game, so i stopped playing that one to play this one first, in order.", "timestamp_created": 1683518784, "timestamp_updated": 1683518784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137976314": {"recommendationid": "137976314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049479724", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 674, "last_played": 1683505166}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing story! and so underrated! i cant wait to play the sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1683505270, "timestamp_updated": 1683505270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137975543": {"recommendationid": "137975543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280699539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 948, "last_played": 1683503683}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a reason that video games can be called as a form of art.", "timestamp_created": 1683503924, "timestamp_updated": 1683636868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800082683563232422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137966871": {"recommendationid": "137966871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124956171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1025, "last_played": 1683488481}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0446\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043e\u043c. \n\u041d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434\u044b \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e 1-2 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0445\u0443\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b.\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 FOV.\n", "timestamp_created": 1683490664, "timestamp_updated": 1683490664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137964991": {"recommendationid": "137964991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036459775", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1683488136}, "language": "english", "review": "Way more content, mechanics, and lore than expected.", "timestamp_created": 1683488365, "timestamp_updated": 1683488365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137963813": {"recommendationid": "137963813", "author": {"steamid": "76561199148443451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 936, "last_played": 1683486677}, "language": "english", "review": "It does a wonderful job of instilling a sense of fear and tension in you, despite the fact that it's a story-driven stealth action game.

Una historia oscura, triste y apagada. Y sobre todo la justificaci\u00f3n de c\u00f3mo un t\u00edtulo AA puede competir con cualquier AAA. Dentro rese\u00f1a!\n\nA plague tale nos propone un mundo que se va al traste por la aparici\u00f3n de una plaga de ratas que se come todo lo que se mueve. Imagina a zombies, pero en ratas. La historia narra el punto de vista de Amicia y Hugo De Rune, dos hermanos muy especiales. Por cosas del destino, Amicia deber\u00e1 proteger a su hermano de las personas que quieren capturar al chico y descubrir qui\u00e9n es y qu\u00e9 relaci\u00f3n guarda esa familia con las plagas. El juego propone un estilo de gameplay diferente, que se basa en el sigilo.\n\nAmicia porta una honda con la que disparar diferentes tipos de municiones que podremos ir creando a lo largo de las 10-11 horas que nos puede durar el juego. Hay municiones desde piedras normales, municiones que apagan fuegos, que aislan a las ratas...todo en una ruleta de \"armas\". Los recursos son escasos y deberemos explorar bien todas las zonas que si bien son lineales durante los 17 cap\u00edtulos del juego, podremos hacer peque\u00f1os desv\u00edos para encontrar un carro con recursos, por ejemplo. No siempre hay que optar por matar o por el sigilo, depender\u00e1 de las situaciones. \n\nA lo largo de la aventura, encontraremos compa\u00f1eros con diferentes habilidades que ayudar\u00e1n a Amicia y Hugo en su camino. Al haber pocos personajes importantes, estos poseen de mucha carisma y personalidad, donde podremos conocer sus historias, intenciones y miedos. El uso de la luz es de lo m\u00e1s importante pues los tonos oscuros del juego constantes, contrastan con el uso obligatorio de la luz para ahuyentar a las ratas. Y con eso llegan los peque\u00f1os puzzles donde se usar\u00e1n braseros, fogatas y dem\u00e1s para sortear a las ratas y poder avanzar. Las cinem\u00e1ticas est\u00e1n hechas in-game y el juego cuenta con modo foto. Podremos encontrar coleccionables por el mundo.\n\nA plague tale no tiene miedo de construir algo diferente, una historia adulta, con un gameplay si bien sencillo, efectivo para la duraci\u00f3n del t\u00edtulo. Los gr\u00e1ficos son muy bonitos aunque el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico no es muy variado. Las plagas de ratas impresionan y sientes constantemente que te enfrentas a algo que no puedes controlar. Los tipos de enemigos son muy escasos, caballeros de una \u00e9poca medieval con diferentes armaduras. A veces necesitamos que los juegos sean m\u00e1s guiados, como a plague tale, para ense\u00f1arnos llo que el equipo de desarrollo quiere transmitir. \n\nSi buscas algo corto, narraci\u00f3n en vena, plot twist constantes, unos personajes que transmiten y un gameplay sencillo donde deber\u00e1s darle al coco, entonces ju\u00e9galo, lo vas a gozar. Lo jugu\u00e9 de salida y ahora he podido pasarlo por segunda vez a 60 fps en mejor calidad que una consola. Hab\u00eda partes que no recordaba y me ha dejado un buen sabor de boca. Tanto como para aventurarme en Requiem, su secuela.

There are very few inconsistencies (that I could spot) and events feel like, they have meaning. This is true for character deaths (unless you count NPCs), boss fights and often times even the timing, with which the rats are coming - no part feels out of place. It lets us have hope enough, so that the tension can hit hard when it comes. It also doesn\u2019t just keep us in utter despair the entire time, so that we would always know there is no salvation coming, but rather makes us feel, like every bad thing that happens was ultimately avoidable, we were just unlucky, which in my opinion is exactly how you write fate. Plot armour as surprisingly very scarce. Almost every time, someone escapes death, it feels like they did so, because of their own skill, or that of those who saved them. There are a few exceptions to this though, for example [spoiler]the scene, where Amicia hides from arrows under a body[/spoiler]. \n\nInnocence\u2019s characters are very well written, they have strong motivations and feel like real people. Over the course of the game, you are made to love Amicia, Hugo and the others, learn to hate the inquisition, but also understand, why they are doing, what they are doing. The only exception to this is [spoiler]Milie[/spoiler], as [spoiler]her[/spoiler] motivation feels a little weak at times. Its not too bad and kind of a nit-pick, so only -0.5. Also, every time I died and heard Hugo scream for Amicia, a part of me died inside.\n\nWhile still great, the setting doesn\u2019t really reach quite as high as plot and characters. The holes it leaves don\u2019t feel intentional and don\u2019t add to any feeling of mystery in my opinion. None the less it is still believable, that such a world could exists, even the politics seem to have logic in themselves. [spoiler]A very nice touch I think was when the archbishop told the inquisitor, he would be excommunicated, it feels like the thing the church would do in a situation like this.[/spoiler]\n\nMechanics:\nThis is not the games strong suit! If you\u2019re looking for a game with a good combat system, boss fights and believable stealth, this might not be it. Most of the game doesn\u2019t really challenge the player. There is aim assist (which you can turn of), the guards lose you around two corners and are much slower than you. Most of the game you can clear with just running if you feel like it. The big exception to this is the last boss. There the difficulty does a 180\u00b0 and the game becomes kinda challenging all of a sudden. Me personally, I liked this, since it added to the feeling of fighting the bbeg, but since you don\u2019t really have to get good at dodging in the rest of the game, I do realize, a lot of people are not gonna enjoy this. The aim assist also feels really clunky when multiple targets are close to each other, the same goes for anything you have to interact with. \nThe sling is also very clunky at the start, but that\u2019s probably intentional, since you can upgrade it, which makes it quite a bit better. The alchemy system is the redeeming factor for this game. It gives a lot more depth to the gameplay (both in and out of combat), but not so much, that you can just brute force every encounter with it (as you can in Requiem).\nThe puzzles are not that big of a challenge either. While the \u201cpuzzles\u201d when you consider stealth and rats are a little interesting, since you often have to be wary. The real puzzles often boil down to \u201cdo you see this one thing or do you not\u201d, where the solutions are often handfed to you by your companions. \nThe interface is very clunky, especially on PC, since they just had to smoothen the mouse. Also: Why can\u2019t I just press F again to see where I\u2019m supposed to go?\n\nDesign:\nFor this, the game speaks for itself, I think. It has the best graphics I have ever seen, not only in the cutscenes, but also during gameplay. There are a lot of repeating textures, probably for recognition, but I still think that could have been just a little better, the same is true of facial expressions in gameplay, though I fear that might be just a little much for our time.\nThe music is also very good. It gives you exactly the right feeling at the right time (mostly anyway), but you can only hear a song so long until it becomes at least slightly annoying, the repetition is a problem. The effects are on point as well, from the sound of the rats up to the fire, it all sounds real. Same goes for the voice acting, you can really feel the characters emotions. A special shoutout, to who ever came up with the sound for the rats, anytime I listen to a crowd of people far enough away and enough voices so I can\u2019t understand any individual one, I swear it sounds almost exactly like those little beasts!\n\nFor me personally, this is one of my favourite games, I\u2019ve ever played, when it comes to story, it is the best one! If you care only for the story you need to buy this game! If you care for both story and gameplay equally, you should still by it, maybe when it\u2019s on sale, depending on how soon you want it. If you don\u2019t care for the story or care much more for the mechanics, youre probably not gonna be happy with this game though, you shouldn\u2019t buy it, I think.", "timestamp_created": 1683249482, "timestamp_updated": 1683626121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137804529": {"recommendationid": "137804529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973166524", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1683245665}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice story, good environment, decent gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1683246036, "timestamp_updated": 1683246036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137803668": {"recommendationid": "137803668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085764883", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1659759560}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the story and the game kept me hooked from start to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1683244452, "timestamp_updated": 1683244452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137789245": {"recommendationid": "137789245", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977832347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 672, "last_played": 1683222083}, "language": "english", "review": "16/20.\n\nA refreshing game with interesting mechanisms.\nIt is actually wierdly often more about stealth than most supposedly \"stealth\" games that have been released the past decade).\nI'm glad the release of the second game made me buy it, all the more as I now can't wait to explore this universe further by playing the recently released sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1683222227, "timestamp_updated": 1683222227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137777420": {"recommendationid": "137777420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375880499", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 596, "last_played": 1683132429}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game if you need a break from all the checklist gaming, open-world games and would rather want to play something story-driven and don't mind it being fairly linear.

minha a aten\u00e7\u00e3o pela ideia da trama, ambientada na Fran\u00e7a medieval e envolvida em torno de hordas de ratos pestilentos, contrastando com os protagonistas, buscando sobreviver e entender o que os cerca num ambiente cada vez mais hostil.\n\nTrama: \nFran\u00e7a, 1348-1349. Guerra dos Cem Anos. Peste Negra. Santa Inquisi\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, somos apresentados \u00e0 nobre fam\u00edlia De Rune, especialmente a jovem Amicia e seu irm\u00e3o Hugo, de 5 anos, portador de uma condi\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 a chave da trama. O jogo come\u00e7a ensinando a jogabilidade b\u00e1sica de combate e movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o num primeiro cap\u00edtulo tranquilo. Por\u00e9m, no segundo cap\u00edtulo j\u00e1 temos a invas\u00e3o da Inquisi\u00e7\u00e3o em busca do jovem Hugo, e, dali em diante, um turbilh\u00e3o de eventos acontecer\u00e1 com os dois irm\u00e3os, passando por diversos ambientes, de vilas a campos, de castelos \u00e0 campos de batalha. No decorrer dos eventos, aparecem aliados e muitos inimigos, sejam roedores ou humanos, com uma mistura de alquimia, religi\u00e3o, guerra e pestil\u00eancia, onde inoc\u00eancia vai dando lugar \u00e0 desola\u00e7\u00e3o e busca por respostas e vingan\u00e7as.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos:\nO jogo apresenta cen\u00e1rios bem detalhados, para o belo e para o m\u00f3rbido. Seja andando por vilas desertas ou se esgueirando por corpos e ossos, o detalhamento chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas o destaque principal fica por conta dos ratos. A ninhada explodindo ch\u00e3o acima, passando por cima de corpos e deixando somente ossos, ou formando turbilh\u00f5es e partindo para cima de voc\u00ea sem medo de nada ocorre com incr\u00edvel fluidez de movimentos.\n\nJogabilidade:\nO controle de Amicia responde bem. O combate pode n\u00e3o parecer muito din\u00e2mico para alguns, mas a tem\u00e1tica do jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito voltada \u00e0 a\u00e7\u00e3o fren\u00e9tica, pelo contr\u00e1rio, temos muitos momentos de \u201cstealth\u201d e h\u00e1 alternativas entre enfrentar e fugir sem ser visto de inimigos. Nesse ponto, a AI dos inimigos pode vacilar um pouco e perceber voc\u00ea bem longe ou n\u00e3o perceber perto, mas longe de estragar a experi\u00eancia. H\u00e1 um modo furtivo e um modo \u201cnormal\u201d para lan\u00e7ar pedras e chamar aten\u00e7\u00e3o ou ser discreto. O jogo oferece diversas inven\u00e7\u00f5es divertidas (e explosivas), com base na alquimia, para lidar com fogos e inimigos.\n\nSom:\nTrilha est\u00e1 sempre apropriada ao momento.

The series is currently short and only contains 2 different games, varying in length and depth! These 2 games, no matter the price are a MUST BUY if you love deep, intense, developing, and even immersive linear story games! The genuine love you see as you develop the years with Amecia and Hugo is unmatched in any other game!\n\nLet's use this review as an OVERALL look at \"A Plague Tale\", as I believe they are both worth a buy!  ---  in order of course!\n\n                                                                                                                (this will be long)\n\n1st: A Plague Tale: Innocence - 2019\n2nd: A Plague Tale: Requiem - 2022\n\nSo. \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" Starts off as our primary introduction into the series. We start off as a younger Amecia, who is accompanied by her father. Things quickly go wrong. While out hunting with the family dog, Lion, he runs off and gets killed by an unknown entity.\n\nThis QUICKLY sets the tone of the game. Throughout the entire journey of the game, you not only develop as a character yourself...but with your companions as-well! During the game, you will have certain friends who will join alongside your journey and help you. These characters all have their own unique personalities and develop dynamically as the story progresses! You will gain a real sense of attachment to characters, as you become a sort of \"family\" during your constant running, fighting, and hiding over the years. Some characters meant to stay, some meant to go. They all play a very important role on not only the game-play, but the development of the story and other characters as-well.\n\nLet's talk about the game-play aspect of the game! The guts of a game. They're... not bad. It is a stealth game after all. You  have your usual crouching behind or around people. YOU! Hide behind this conveniently placed dresser! OH! HERE! Hide in this perfectly places closet! No, jokes aside, it's not bad. There is a LOT of traversing through levels of enemies where you can either go all out and kill, using your arsenal and the environment around you to your benefit, or you can sneak around all stealthy-like, using tall-grass and building placed around the areas. The game also builds a distraction mechanic to help those players who really want to sneak around without killing! \n\nYour arsenal in the game is quite slim, but the capabilities extend past their worth! Amecia's main weapon of choice is her trusty Sling, which she uses rocks as a projectile. It is very deadly, at a 1 shot to every enemy which is unarmored. The main combat aspect of game-play revolves around Alchemy. You find and use alchameic powders to craft deadly and even helpful solutions which can be applied many ways! This all ties in directly with the development of the story. Each unique companion in the game also has their own ability you are able to use in your favor!\n\nTHIS! Is the main game-play draw. This is what makes A Plague Tale what it is. During the game, there are multiple breakouts of large hordes of rats which can kill you and your companions in an instant. The only way to defend yourself is with fire or light! You will have to use Ignifer, an alchameic solution to light fires to make your way past the hordes of rats. You will run into many puzzles in the game required to advance the story (some hidden optional ones as-well). These puzzles require you to use the environment around you to your advantage. From puzzles, to rats, to enemy encounters, to cut-scenes, to story filler, to exploration... the game really makes sure to fit it all in!\n\nOverall for \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\", it took me 20 hours to finish. I was 100% invested the entire time and LOVED every second of it! It was one of the most grabbing story games I have ever played. I was honestly sad it was over. It would be a lie to say my emotions were not all over the place during the end of the game, but at-least I had a second game to look forward to!\n\nNow, \"A Plague Tale: Requiem\". The second installment of the game took what they did right with the first one, and elevated it past the level I even though was possible! I thought I was in love with the story of the first game, but after seeing what we have now... it is hard to judge which is better. They are both amazing!\n\nThe story in \"A Plague Tale: Requiem\" starts right back where \"Innocence\" left off! You are accompanied by your Mother, Hugo, and Lucas. Thing's have settled and your family is happy again. At a new island, the plague seems to be unheard of...until all hell breaks loose. Just like the last game, you meet new characters which join you alongside your journey. They provide crucial aid to get Amecia and Hugo to find the Cure for the Macula! They help fight and pivot the way through even deadlier, scarier, more advanced hordes of killer rats! \"Requiem\" adds onto what the De Rune family is trying to accomplish and during the years you develop with these characters, you becomes even more attached as you have now spent hours and hours across multiple game titles with them! Your love and feelings for the protagonists will really make you feel like what hurts them really hurts you. This game really gets to your emotional side!\n\nThe game-play is pretty standard compared to the last game, but improved just enough to be interesting and actually really fun! You have your trusty Sling still, but during the story, you will obtain a VERY deadly crossbow! It's... pretty cool. You will have to find bolts around the play areas. You will also be using alchameic powders to craft the same solutions from last game, as-well as the addition of tar! Tar can be used against enemies or rats, whichever you prefer!\n\nSKILLS! This game added the Skill Tree Mechanic. What this does is passively progresses you down a certain skill tree based on your play style. There are 3 different skill paths you can go; Prudence, Aggressive, Opportunism. These all will grant you increasingly helpful buffs as you reach a 25% threshold mark. This adds for a variety of very different and unique play styles! (You can also find SECRET CHESTS on select levels!)\n\nOverall, \"A Plague Tale: Requiem\" follows a lot of the same story elements and principles as the first game. It progresses the story to what could be a possible completion, or hopefully what will be a 3rd installment of the game... way in the future :( However, I can wait! This game managed to bring me even more closely immersed into the story than I would've imagined possible! I was fighting every moment to keep everyone alive like I was there myself! The upgraded game-play really helped to keep me interested and wasn't as stale as \"Innocence\". \n\nI am a man, and I am more than okay to admit I cried hard at the end of the game. Harder than Red Dead Redemption 2... that says something... This game created a story that was so deeply developed and so real you could feel it as a person through the game. You felt real hurt and emotion when the character you loved, dies. \n\nThe \"A Plague Tale\" Series is something that is like nothing else. You see character development and such a deep story that will leave you feeling empty after you finish the games. It was such a wonderful and amazing series that I could not believe such a small indie studio was able to put together such a beautiful masterpiece! This has by far been some of my favorite games of all times and I really hope we will see another continuation!\n\nMake sure to use Photo Mode! Both games are incredibly gorgeous and you can use it to your advantage to get some incredible shots, which would otherwise be impossible! (Special shout-out to the beautiful character models and voice actors! It was all amazing and really made it fit so much better together!) \n\nBuy the \"A Plague Tale\" Series!!!

If you played any of Naughty Dog's cinematic experience games that Sony has pushed such as Uncharted and TLOU then you most likely played all of their competition's knockoffs that repeat the same formula as TLOU (Most recent example is the God of War reboots that to me are overrated) including this game. Games where instead of telling a good story & being more gameplay focused usually target the casual audience that want quick feels. I'm here to tell you that the only way to even tolerate the voice acting in this game is to either change the language to German or French. None of these characters at all are intriguing until Chapter 7 sort of when the game finally gives you the independence not to sneak around anymore since the stealth is the same as any other triple A game. Hiding in grass means you're instantly hidden, the enemy AI is dumb as rocks & the aiming system is very poor (especially for CQC) to the point that the problem could've been easily solved if Amicia during the game found a knife of some kind to defend herself.\n\nHugo while believable in his actions is still annoying through the entire time playing the game. An entire game as an escort mission while at the same time dealing with uninteresting side characters is not a good mix as a game to me. Even the PC performance despite all its patches doesn't even run 60 fps well even with high settings on. [spoiler]The story itself to me is a stretch that the inquisition gave a shit about one boy and it should've been developed better about why this specific boy is more important than any of the other people sick during the plague.[/spoiler]\n\nThe puzzles while simple are also repetitive. Why Amicia can't throw her torch or sticks to the side characters makes no sense & the only time I was somewhat invested was the castle puzzle since every other puzzle was a bore. Even the upgrading is restricted and the devs constructed it in a way so that they only give you crumbs on when to upgrade the exact same way the storytelling is. It's quite a chore just to keep checking your menu due to this regressive game design. Even if you try to break the path the devs made you're not rewarded for anything for exploring by yourself. Just crappy collectibles that don't add much to the worldbuilding at all and not even lore either.\n\nThroughout the game you meet a kid who knows alchemy that tags along with you after story related reasons. Why the hell do I have have to sacrifice my materials when he could've easily gave me spare materials or light faraway torches for me? I swear the only useful character was this thief kid you meet for story reasons because she at least can unlock chests and doors for you so why couldn't the alchemist kid be more useful?\n\nOverall if you want my rating, it's a hard pass and not even worth the money during a sale. The only positives that I can give are the rat mechanics and the skippable cutscenes since for some pretentious reason these modern games believe their story is so interesting that the player shouldn't have the option to skip cutscenes at all.", "timestamp_created": 1681976385, "timestamp_updated": 1681976544, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467844575643539429", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136992563": {"recommendationid": "136992563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022160541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1681974987}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked what I saw of the characters and the supernatural take on the plague, but the whole thing is undermined by extremely mediocre gameplay and some bugs.

And the puzzles and stealth elements keep the gameplay interesting and engaging throughout. I'd say if you're looking for a game with a killer story and beautiful visuals, A Plague Tale: Innocence is definitely worth checking out.

The setting and initial idea is really good and I can't objectively say it's a bad game, cause it's absolutely not, but I just can't deny there are so many flaws. \n\n- First, why go with the supernatural crap when you had such a unique setting not usually explored in games. The story could have been grounded in reality and tell what really happened at that time of history, but instead we get rat tornadoes.\n- Too many instant deaths. Many of them ruin very emotional moments by having to play them all over again several times. This is specially true in the last chapters.\n- The actual gameplay is pretty poor. Just kill the guards by exactly the way the game intends you to, since they are strategically positioned to be killed in said way. Also, the puzzles are so simple and boring that only serve to pad out the game.\n- Honestly too long. Considering the tedious gameplay, it could have ended half way through or have shorter sections, since the most important parts where the cut scenes. \n\nDespite all those flaws, the first part of the game is really good and overall it has very touching moments.

At times, it seems like the game wants to be a stealth platformer like Assassins Creed/Dishonored, but then the next minute all hell breaks loose and you're forced into scripted chase sequences with no variation or choice. The many puzzles in the game are mind-numbingly easy and the time you spend completing them takes up about 80% of actual gameplay time. \n\nThe story itself is packed with cliches that anyone who has seen more than a handful of movies will recognize from a mile away (your family is dead/younger sibling has a secret power/textbook revenge plot), and the lack of a lengthy buildup to the story means that there is little actual reason to care for the early deaths (within 10 minutes of the game beginning) of your character's family, which initiates the entire story. \n\nYour brother is completely insufferable, making most dialogue scenes with him tedious at best. There's also some highly questionable storyline choices involving your brother that similarly grind the game's pacing to a halt, especially around the middle section of the plot. \n\nThe game's two redeeming qualities are the voice acting of the protagonist, Amicia, and the atmospheric settings. While the level design doesn't inspire much imagination due to its backtracking and repetition, the atmosphere is actually quite effective at making you feel claustrophobic, paranoid, and isolated - which are all central themes of the story. \n\nOverall, I can't really recommend this game to anyone, since I'm not sure who the targeted audience of this game was supposed to be. It doesn't accomplish anything new in the way of storytelling, the worldbuilding itself is limited, the level design is so simple it's grating, and the few standout setpieces of the story don't last long when compared to the endless puzzle sequences that compose the majority of the game's runtime.", "timestamp_created": 1681015640, "timestamp_updated": 1681015640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518085658550262451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136386888": {"recommendationid": "136386888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146180894", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1681010739}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful looking game, beautiful soundtrack, engaging gameplay that isn't super hard but isn't super easy, and wonderful story.

It is a bit linear in play, and definitely not an \"Open World\" experience - however, the game play and story telling are absolutely fantastic. The voice acting and Mocap animation make the \"kids\" very real - which amps up the tension with them in peril.  I had heard a lot of good things about the game, but some people equated almost to a graphic novel based on the linear play - but it still felt like a game to me, though they are correct, there is no variation in the story line, you just work your way through it... still I was okay with that and actually pleasantly surprised by how engrossing the game is (especially the first time through). However, because of the linearity, I would suggest getting it on sale rather than paying the full $40 ticket price. It is often on sale on multiple platforms for $9.99 and that seems quite reasonable.\n\nI was expecting it to be a bit more \"real history\", and it was actually a second pleasant surprise that... how to say this... it wanders quite far away from \"reality\" by the end of the game and becomes something more than \"just survive the plague\". They did fill the game with little side things to find and read about that provided some historical background on \"The Plague\" and which if you are a completionist like Jackie and I pretty much guarantees at least two playthroughs just to find all the stuff and get the achievements. \n\nIn our case we finished the game and had found most of the side things on the first play through in around 18 hours. If you just focus on the story line and play through the first time it may depend on your game skills but 8 to 12 hours seems easily possible for most gamers (Watched Gab Smolders play after we completed it and it took her about 8.5 hours but she missed all kinds of things). Many people complete the achievements as well under the 20 hour mark - but we replayed the entire game trying to find it all without any assist - and on levels where the 2nd pass didn't find the stuff then we looked for a bit of help and then played the chapter a 3rd (sometimes 4th) time.\n\nVery much look forward to the second game \"Requiem\", but will wait for a sale as there are a ton of other games to play already in the library.", "timestamp_created": 1680464595, "timestamp_updated": 1680464595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135982592": {"recommendationid": "135982592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381077305", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1680464429}, "language": "english", "review": "Its ok", "timestamp_created": 1680464522, "timestamp_updated": 1680464522, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135978250": {"recommendationid": "135978250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261039434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1680460275}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1680460312, "timestamp_updated": 1680460312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135944765": {"recommendationid": "135944765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105289631", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1680429309}, "language": "english", "review": "Exceptional, magnificent, endearing characters, nothing more to say.

From the very beginning, the game hooks you in with its beautifully crafted visuals and hauntingly atmospheric soundtrack, transporting you to a world that is both stunningly beautiful and deeply unsettling.\n\nThe game takes place in 14th century France during the height of the Black Death, and the setting is expertly crafted to convey a sense of desperation and despair. The environments are beautifully rendered, with each location telling its own story through subtle details and intricate design.\n\nBut it's not just the visuals that make \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" such a standout game. The characters are expertly written, with each one feeling like a fully-realized individual with their own unique motivations and backstories. The relationship between the main characters, siblings Amicia and Hugo, is particularly well-developed and serves as the emotional core of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is equally impressive, seamlessly blending stealth, puzzle-solving, and action elements into a cohesive whole. The use of light and sound as gameplay mechanics is especially clever, adding a level of tension and strategy to every encounter.\n\nBut what really sets \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" apart is its storytelling. The game manages to tackle weighty themes like loss, grief, and sacrifice with sensitivity and nuance, making for a deeply affecting experience that lingers long after the credits roll.\n\nOverall, \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" is a truly divine game that deserves all the praise it has received. From the stunning visuals to the expertly crafted characters and narrative, everything about this game is top-notch. If you're looking for a beautiful, atmospheric, and emotionally resonant gaming experience, look no further than \"A Plague Tale: Innocence\".\n\n\"A Plague Tale: Innocence\" is a game that I highly recommend! I can't wait to play the second part of this game!

Need to get from point A to point B? Good thing there just happens to be an unlit pile of tinder there. It really makes you feel like you are 100% playing a game.\n\nThe relationship between the characters is not developed much beyond \"you should care about Hugo because he is your brother\". He is also super annoying, constantly running off, yelling, or otherwise doing basically everything he can to ruin your efforts. Yes some children are annoying but I would imagine any child in this situation would be so terrified they would be quiet and not just run off as a joke.\n\nVisually it is very impressive but I think it would be better to just watch a full play through on youtube as opposed to paying for it and playing it yourself.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1679933609, "timestamp_updated": 1679933609, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135524350": {"recommendationid": "135524350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004624474", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 245, "last_played": 1680312337}, "language": "english", "review": ":D", "timestamp_created": 1679889538, "timestamp_updated": 1679889538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135519084": {"recommendationid": "135519084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054268931", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1190, "last_played": 1679880470}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has an incredible story and is a true gem that's been sitting in my library untouched for too long.

My rating is heavily based on character/story, less on gameplay.\n\nSTORY:\nI honestly was kind of expecting more. It's about two siblings during the black plague being hunted by the inquisition, but it wasn't as compelling or emotional as I thought it was. I couldn't find myself caring about either of the two main characters. As far as the rest of cast, honestly didn't really like them either except Rodric. At first I thought that maybe it's because this is a 10-15 hour game, and you don't really get a whole lot of time with the characters, but then again, Rodric is the last character to join your party, maybe halfway through the game, and I liked him. Maybe it's just the way the characters were written, but I just couldn't empathize.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThis is a stealth game through and through. There are stealth mechanics and sometimes puzzle mechanics. It's all stuff you've probably seen before: tall grass to hide in, suspicious/alert guards, noise diversions, dumb AI, etc. The new things here are the rats and light interaction, and the different alchemy potions you can craft for different effects. Lots of collectibles for those with OCD. Also lots of crafting materials everywhere for your stealth crafting needs.\n\nART:\nDefinitely the highlight for me. It looks and sounds good.

The AI of the enemies were very one dimensional and weren't much of a challenge during the stealth missions but the pace at which this game is played along with the amazing voice acting in a way makes up for this.\n\nIf you're reading this review and having second thoughts about playing this game.

You will have a lot of fun with Tale: Innocence, and maybe even the story weaknesses of this game will not be as important to you as they should be.\n\nBut if your goal in gaming is to enjoy fun and engaging gameplay, and you expect A Plague Tale: Innocence to be a high-quality stealth experience in this regard, this work will not be able to meet your expectations of such an experience and its mechanisms.

As of recent this has been one of the best immersive story games I have played; I absolutely adore the connection to the historical events of the Justinian and Bubonic plagues. While I was not expecting the heavy amount of gore included, the settings where corpses can be found are both unsettling and extremely detailed but very idiosyncratic. I'm very excited to move on to the second game of this newer generation series. \n\n[h1] Historical Context [/h1]\n\nI got so excited to find a historical fiction rooted 'horror' game, especially with the unique supernatural spin on the infamous plague carrying rats. Without giving spoilers to the secrets we learn carried by these rats and the Inquisitions obsession to Hugo there is a lot to be said about this plague. This game heavily takes influence to many deadly plagues that occurred through history, some to include for reference in my opinion but are not limited to;\n[list]\n    [*]The Justinian Plague (541 A.D)\n    [*]The Black Plague (1347)\n    [*]The Italian Plague (1629)\n    [*]The Bubonic Plague (1720)\n[/list]\nIn this case, the Plague we see in this game begins in 1348 in medieval France, and is referred to as 'The Bite'. Historically this plague lands in the path of the Hundred Years' War fought from 1337-1453 between the French and English for power of the French aristocratic throne. The game has heavy details and notions of the war from commentary to accurate visuals. One detail I was blown away by was the entirety of Chapter 5, 'The Raven's Spoils'. this entire chapter is the characters struggle to make it across a battle field riddled of bodies, rats, and abandoned siege equipment for what seems like forever. This battle field was supposed to be a recreation or at least take heavy inspiration of The Battle of Crecy; one of the bloodiest battles of the affair that lasted 116 years. Without giving much more away, it's easy to say i'm obsessed with the historical accuracy and little hints too historical events in this story. \n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\n\nI really enjoyed the set of young protagonists given in the game, especially watching the growth and development of their bonds and loyalty to one another. A set of characters I especially enjoyed seeing a dynamic character progression with was that of the De Rune siblings. In the prologue and first chapter of the game where we are introduced to Amisia, we learn she lacks a connection with her younger brother, Hugo. Through the story, we see the growth of their bond as the 'Macula' continues to take over Hugo. All of the characters were unique and dynamic, from the band of kids the De Rune siblings accompany to the unique enemies of the Inquisition. Overall the unique narrative and plot was immersive and brought to life by these characters.

I don't know. But I do know why I couldn't get into Plague Tale.\n\nIt's a beautiful game and the story and characters are engaging, almost.\nThe scenery is gorgeous, the voice acting well done, the story interesting and the pacing pretty good as well.\nSo why'd I quit?\n\nTwo reasons, the first was the gameplay. It got old way to fast for me. The sneaking mechanics are absurd to the point of breaking immersion and repetitive. The whole, throw rocks and pots to distract guards is unbelievable and not very exciting. I don't mind escorting my kid brother through army encampments but don't pretend I'm invisible and silent because their backs are turned even though we're three feet a part. Once or twice stretches the imagination but this is the core of the sneaking mechanic.\n\nThe rat/darkness levels are hardly any better, why do thousands of rats forget about you to eat a sack full of meat when there are literally piles of carcasses everywhere? The epitome of this is wandering through the aftermath of a battlefield, literally climbing over piles of bodies and then shooting down a hanged man for the rats to devour so that you can walk past them. It breaks the immersion. And it gets old fast, the sling is neat but the puzzles are all the same so there's no reason to keep doing them over and over again.\n\nLastly, it's hard for me to feel emotionally engaged with the main character when she wantonly murders and sacrifices other people to achieve her own goals, and not even in ways that make sense. I get that she's just a kid who isn't good at reasoning through consequences, but maybe you should walk around instead of driving the rats to devour people who have nothing to do with you.

It's a fictionalised account of the Black Death (or the Plague) with an interesting supernatural twist. So, the first strength of this game is the clear passion from behind the scenes. There's something about AA or indie titles where you can see just the clear passion on screen. The scope is focused, it isn't a meandering mess and overall, a well-paced adventure. From just a graphical perspective it's better than most last-generation games (and even this generation). This is a combination of high-quality assets, beautiful lighting, stunning art direction and fitting music. There is a considerable amount of period piece architecture that's breathing taking to experience. From the churches and paintings like during Byzantine Empire and so forth. As this was before the Renaissance, so overall the world is rich and lived in. The developers take advantage of the diversity of the world.\n\nMy favourite chapter location would be chapter 5, It\u2019s like seeing a terrible period in history at its worst. Without any glorification, just that dread, the sound design of walking through ... the lighting particularly makes it feel uncomfortable and sort of claustrophobic. It just showcases the vulnerability you have so well and makes this plague even more frightening as there\u2019s so little you can do. When you start up the game, I think the ICO inspiration is fairly obvious, especially in terms of its design for Escort missions. Hugo isn't an intangible, like from games such as The Last of Us or Bioshock Infinite, but a character in gameplay you have to hold their hand and take care of. There is definitely more the developers could have done, to make it even more immersive but I do applaud the effort in general, compared to many game developers who don't bother adding a basic feature (like this) in general. This remedy does expose some weaknesses when it comes to AI. The brain-dead AI is a curse and a blessing in disguise because from a mechanical perspective, it\u2019s pretty brain-dead, but the stealth of the game is far from great, so I guess it makes it a less frustrating experience. The weaker levels were the ones that had to rely on those mechanics except one which I won't spoil besides stating it was very good.\n\nThe crafting is pretty much the same as the Last of Us which the developers openly stated it's the reason they could make the game, as these games would be financially viable. So, this is the first obvious homage and others that are scattered throughout the game. I think what was truly satisfying was the sling, yeah it does the majority aiming for you, but man the recoil is very good. Especially as you upgrade it.\n\nThe writing across the board is strong, especially some good character writing. Both in and out of gameplay, the relationship between the siblings is enhanced because of how you treat each other in gameplay. Simple stuff like holding Hugo when he is scared, or tired or him putting a flower above your ear. Though I do admit I think there's some odd audio editing. Like sometimes characters respond so awkwardly and less to do the actor but the editing. Generally, there was some funkiness to it. I'm unsure what the cause of the weirdness but it does appear briefly.\n\nIn Conclusion, this is a fantastic AA game that's worth experiencing and I would highly recommend it. I\u2019m curious where the sequel would go considering the ending is quite closed and as a whole satisfying.", "timestamp_created": 1678250903, "timestamp_updated": 1678250903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908168792724609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134262575": {"recommendationid": "134262575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104217985", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1424, "last_played": 1678224385}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Come on Amicia!", "timestamp_created": 1678224422, "timestamp_updated": 1678224422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134261774": {"recommendationid": "134261774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815521734", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 718, "last_played": 1678223194}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful enviroment setting and a very good story with a horror touch", "timestamp_created": 1678223406, "timestamp_updated": 1678223406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134235759": {"recommendationid": "134235759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052505753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1952, "last_played": 1680426870}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, have enjoyed playing it", "timestamp_created": 1678190418, "timestamp_updated": 1678190418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134235112": {"recommendationid": "134235112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168706573", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 966, "last_played": 1678188953}, "language": "english", "review": "Originally I misjudged this game back in 2019 because of Amicia looking like your typical strong female protagonist.

From start to finish, I was engaged in the story. Each character felt necessary towards the story, and wasn't just used as a \"tool.\" The people that were lost along the way felt like I was actually feeling the emotions the characters were feeling. \n\nPros\n- The graphics are insanely well done. It feels like I was truly inside of the game at every step of the way. To add to that, the visuals in the distance were portrayed REALLY well. Seeing the massive church (I forgot what it was called) in the distance at the end, just before fighting Vitaly was unbelievable.\n- The story telling was extremely intriguing and engaging. I wanted to progress through the story and figure out what the Inquisition wanted with me, and I was curious to understand the story behind these zombie rats.\n- The plague was portrayed perfectly, with the crosses on the doors along the way to represent the infected, and obviously the tremendous amounts of zombie-like rats.\n- The voice actors were almost perfect. The only thing that I will say is sometimes I got mixed up with Amicia and Mellie, but it didn't happen often (and could've been avoided altogether with subtitles w/ names on).\n- Important fights (boss fight at the end especially) wasn't incredibly difficult like some games in this genre. I love story games with fights that you don't want to pull each individual hair out for.\n\nCons\n- I really wish the game was longer. As much as I feel the time frame of the game fit the story being told, I was really sad once I completed the game (I know there is a second game, and I will be buying it shortly). Also, I spent maybe 10-12 hours on the game, not 19. I fell asleep with the game open, which bumped up the hours quite a bit\n- Sometimes, being stealthy was extremely difficult. The one that really frustrated me was when we first met Mellie and had to escape all the guards (with the tents and everything). I tried to be stealthy for about 30 minutes with no luck, and eventually I accidentally completed it just by making it to the halfway point and b-lining it towards the cutscene checkpoint (which i didn't actually realize it was where i stepped). Of course, this was before I had learned a lot of the abilities in the game, I think all I had were rocks at that point (maybe a few other abilities that weren't useful to me at the time)\n\nOverall though, it's one of the best games I've played in a LONG time. I have a hard time getting through most story games, but this one I did not want to put down. It was the only thing on my mind for a couple days getting home from work.

Set in 14th century France during the 100 Years War, A Plague Tale's compelling story weaves a realistic and gritty medieval setting with fantastical elements in a way which never feels overdone. This game is an admirable feat of medieval fantasy that strikes a perfect balance between realism, and an exciting originality in an over-saturated and often tired genre. \n\n The characters are well written, and major props goes to the voice actors of both Amicia and Hugo. I played the game in both French and English, and while there's great performances in both languages, the French voice actors really stole the show. I really recommend playing this game in French for an experience that is as close as possible to what the dev's envisioned. \n\nFor me personally, the creative art direction of this game should take centre-stage. Despite being an older game now, the environments are gorgeous. I ran the game on a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 and was blown away by the detailed, mesmerising and sometimes horrifying set pieces in this game.  This game was no doubt a labour of love and it shows, it's one of the prettiest and immersive worlds I've experienced in a while\n\nThe gameplay is great too, and for those of you who are less interested in the setting and plot, and perhaps players more interested in stealth-orientated gaming, with light puzzle solving and a bit of combat will find enough here to keep them interested. I say enough because there are moments where this game feels a little jankey, with some very cheap deaths leading to some frustrating moments. These moments are few and far between; however, with the majority of the game loop being seriously fun. \n\nThe developers have done an awesome job at making the gameplay add to the sense that Amicia and Hugo are very vulnerable in a very dangerous world. You'll never feel overpowered in this game, and I like that. \n\nMy only other criticism of the gameplay is that there is often only one way to progress through a level or encounter, which means that you WILL die. Over and over again until you find the 'right' route through the level. \n\nThis game is excellent, and if you're also late to the Plague party like I was, please do yourself a favour and give this thing a whirl - you won't regret it. Bravo to the developers.

Both Amicia and Sean are fiercely dedicated to their younger brothers, Hugo and Daniel, respectively (and get blamed for not being the perfect ones for most of the time). While it's admirable to see siblings looking out for each other, I couldn't help feeling a bit sad about the situation. Amicia and Sean are just teenagers themselves who need care and leadership from elder ones as well, and yet they're burdened with so much responsibility.\n\nAmicia especially seems to have been thrust into the role of protector, with little time to pursue her own interests or seek her own way to live. When Hugo gets himself into trouble by sneaking out and trying to rescue his mother, it becomes painfully clear that they only have each other to rely on as they seem to be the only two family members left alive. The mother has never even once shown solicitude for Amicia but merely disinterest. I did not even feel it heartwarming when they bonded together, for Amicia does not belong to the ship.\n\nWhat really gets to me is the contrast between Amicia and Hugo's upbringings. Amicia seems to have been told from a young age to be the responsible one, while Hugo has been encouraged to be himself and live by his own power instead of for others. It creates a stark divide between them that's hard to ignore, even during the game's quieter moments.\n\nAll in all, A Plague Tale is a beautifully crafted game, but the relationship between Amicia and Hugo can be tough to watch at times.", "timestamp_created": 1677504961, "timestamp_updated": 1679133887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133735844": {"recommendationid": "133735844", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987368141", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 564, "last_played": 1677500162}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent adventure through waves of rats", "timestamp_created": 1677500211, "timestamp_updated": 1677500211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133732360": {"recommendationid": "133732360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006582446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1091, "last_played": 1677487405}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this a part of my humble choice monthly sub. Didn\u2019t think much of it until I burned out on hogwarts legacy and needed something to play. Installed this game and at about an hour in, i knew this game was special. \n\nThe fact that not a lot of devs are making survival horror set in the Middle Ages should be a crime. It is the perfect time line to do it. People lead miserable lives, die of war, disease, starvation etc and this game captures all of that beautifully. Just in terms of atmosphere alone it is one of my absolute favorites. The visuals, the music, the art do a tremendous job of really immersing you in this historical hellhole. And the rats\u2026 holy Christ the rats. Nightmare fuel. \n\n\nAs for the gameplay, I enjoyed the take on survival stealth. You can\u2019t really action hero your way through this game (until you upgrade the sling). You have to play cautiously, smartly and use the environment to your advantage. You get no health bars. If you get caught and hit you will die. Each leve is a set piece with puzzles to solve involving rats, your use of fire and cleverly avoiding (or killing) the various human nuisance along the way. \n\nThere is an upgrade system in the game but it isn\u2019t that extensive\u2026 it is however, extremely useful. I appreciate this take. The early levels have you managing your resources (you don\u2019t get much) and encourage you to explore and take risks to get that one piece of cord/leather/fabric for that one upgrade to change your gameplay. If you\u2019re diligent, and explore each level you will be rewarded with a pretty powerful character. The game becomes more action packed but it never loses that horror/survival aspect. \n\nOverall, this was a pleasant, amazing surprise hit for me this year. The mixture of great atmosphere, awesome time period, engaging gameplay and tremendous story really elevate the whole package. It\u2019s not a long game, but it throws you into one hell of a roller coaster ride. Get it if you love survival with a mix of mysticism, gore and spiritual horror. \n\n9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1677494830, "timestamp_updated": 1677494830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133728428": {"recommendationid": "133728428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118477733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1677489386}, "language": "english", "review": "It really feels a lot like this was ment to be played using a gamepad and not optimized for PC.

Memorable characters, absolutely stunning scenery, and unique combat techniques are all rolled into this superb title from Asobo.\n\nThe stealth-action gameplay will appeal to fans of games like The Last of Us and Resident Evil 2, and the fantasy-inspired medieval setting creates the ideal atmosphere for fans of The Witcher or Thymesia.\n\nI can highly recommend this game for its story, design, and characters alone, but I must also praise the way it utilises stealth-centric combat mechanics with a teenage protagonist. 15-year-old Amicia, despite her experience hunting in the woods with her father, is still young and has little knowledge of survival beyond the forest, as she grew up in an estate with noble parents. It would not make any sense for her to be grappling grown men in full suits of armour by herself, so I enjoyed the sling and her own wits being Amicia's only real weapons. Using alchemical concoctions and distraction techniques alongside the sling prompts the player to think, and offers them a variety of ways to handle a situation, even more so when accompanied by companions with special abilities. While the combat can be clunky at times, it's not too difficult to grasp and feels very gratifying to master.\n\nThe voice cast for this game is also outstanding. Charlotte McBurney and Tabitha Rubens can scream like nobody's business! Not to mention, both St\u00e9phane Cornicard and Mark Healy are utterly chilling as Vitalis and Nicholas respectively. In combination with the gorgeous sound design, Innocence nails the atmospheric balance between unease and awe. The intensity of the strings during showdowns with the rats will make your heart skip a beat, while their more delicate crooning in the cinematic scenes will pull more than a few heartstrings (again, pun intended).\n\nOverall, A Plague Tale: Innocence captured my attention quickly and held it fast for the entire duration of the game. I could play it over and over and still marvel at the love and dedication that went into creating it.

It has a good story and it's enjoyable to play it.\n\nHowever, it lacks in many ways and I don't recommend it.\n\nThe few good points:\n- Graphics are beautiful. The scenery, the colors, like candy to the eye.\n- Story, the characters, voice actors and all that combined. It's a pleasant ride. Almost like a movie plot.\nThat's about it. \n\nThe bad points:\n- Way too expensive for what it has to offer. From what I will mention below, if you [i]really[/i] want this game then get it when it's on sale, because \u00a339,99 ain't it.\n- Gameplay and story is extremely linear. There's only one way of playing this game, and that's it. There's no freedom, no choices, everything is scripted to be played in one way. Once you reach a checkpoint, you can't go back if you for example forgot to pick up an item. And there's no way to get back to that item unless you replay the whole chapter which means you lose the progress you've done. \n- The stealth is ridiculous ngl. My first thought was \"what the hell is this\" when I was apparently \"sneaking\" around. The characters are 10 centimeters away from the guards, whispering really loud, the steps when sneaking are loud enough but no, they hear nothing unless you stand right in front of their sight. \n- Playing through the game will take about 10 hours, after that you're finished. Nothing else to do with this game, it has nothing else to offer. There are no difficulty levels. No way to affect the story, everything is already decided how it will turn out. You only either kill guards or sneak past them, but if you do kill them you waste resources which means you can't upgrade your equipment or sling if you don't pay attention to what you use. And you can't upgrade all of your stuff in one save, what's the point in that? You either fully upgrade the sling/equipment for the 2 achievements, or fully upgrade the alchemy which leaves the sling and equipment being half upgraded. You can still very much beat the game without the full upgrades so I'm not sure what the use of the upgrades are.\n\nSo in conclusion, uninstalling and never touching this game again will be the results.\n\nI still like this game it was fun to play it, but I don't recommend it at it's full price.", "timestamp_created": 1676725703, "timestamp_updated": 1676828624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530487775802612305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133082213": {"recommendationid": "133082213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198382170184", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1722, "last_played": 1680147917}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with beautiful scenery and a great story line!
