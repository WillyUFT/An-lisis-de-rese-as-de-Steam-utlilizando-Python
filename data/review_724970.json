The combat is tense, the characters are amazing, and the graphics are fantastic. Literally my ONLY complaint is that the load screens are horrible and it lags ALOT at times. I'm running the game at half the graphical/performance settings and it lags less, but still happens. Now, my PC isn't by any means spectacular, but I haven't had issues running Elden Rings or any other games really on my PC so this, is troubling to me.

Nothing complicated . But, fluid and fast paced where battles don't take up to much time. Where most rpgs tend to over stretch battles. Based on the voice acting the game seems to take a anime style mixed with slice of life. Even, tho I don't speak Chinese I can say the characters are easy to understand just from body language.   Thanks to the devs making hints at where to go I found Faith of Danschant pretty easy to go to where I needed to. \n\n  But, at the same time it was fun to see what the npc characters were doing. From daily life to dancing , and other things. I felt like this game could be a good entry point to learn some Chinese history in some reguards. The music is nice and scerene so I would easily recommend supporting the game devs if they releasea mp3 ost purchase in the future. \n\n So all an all I have to say for a new Chinese dev team the game hits all my check marks for a good game.  Tho my only issue is the lack of english subtitles . But, that could be a lack of translators on the devs end. But, even without the transltions. I'm pretty sure anyone could get some enjoyment out of this game :) \n\n Even, if you don't support the Chinese goverment .

This turn-based jprg game has impressed me with the delicate graph. With the background set in an imagenary dynasty and the hero is unusual from his birth. He maintained his kindness, gained love and friendship in his long journey.\n\nThis story is quite old style and all the characters are built plain. You could find them in any of the Chinese drama, cute girls, simple and honest man and so on. The battling system is super time-consuming when you trigger the ultimate skills and I failed to finish the game while getting too boring and knowing the end with half of the story done. The map is quite small and you are restricted to explore with the story goes. With the rising of open-world games, I found it quite boring when I get stuck in a small corner without finding the critical clue to move on.\n\nEven if our game is quite lagged behind in terms of technology, I still believe we win not for the graphics but definitely some else.\n\nSo overall I think it's the second best made-in-china game I have played in 2017-2018 and I will keep purchasing

But a game with such a price, I can't demand more than this. Compared to other big RPG titles, this game is really value to buy.\n\nPro:\n-Brilliant graphics\n\n-Not much graphics glitches as other chinese RPG do.\n\n\nCon:\n\n-Just a so so Storyline.\n\n-Lame character interaction design\n(Sometimes u will see the mouth of character is not catching up with what the voice casting)\n(Stupid lines design such as \"Thanks for god giving\" everytime u pickup item on map)\n\n- No map????\n(they just give u a compass)\n\n-Outdated battle design\n(Inner still old school turn based like Chinese paladin. Bro it's been more than 20 years chinese RPG using this, why don't try something different?)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1522395937, "timestamp_updated": 1522395937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56479191780090332", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41143827": {"recommendationid": "41143827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338155145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 846, "last_played": 1613154016}, "language": "english", "review": "No map sytem is really worse for a rpg game hehe\nStabilisation of game and tuning for the game is not good enough if compared to usual 3A game hehe\nThe loading of scene just too slow hehe\nOverall, in my opinion, the quality of this game has not up to 3A game standard hehe\nHowever, this is a big step for China game and hope can see a really good game produced by China in future.", "timestamp_created": 1522381353, "timestamp_updated": 1522381480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.318888604640960693", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41044303": {"recommendationid": "41044303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322661076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1522487713}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY SLOW!!!", "timestamp_created": 1521989407, "timestamp_updated": 1521989407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.241851314902305603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41008262": {"recommendationid": "41008262", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969887570", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 94, "last_played": 1594689711}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game developed by Unreal 4 Engine.
