This game still holds up years after its release. Visually stunning with meticulous attention to detail, [i] Alien: Isolation [/i] captures the essence of the original film, bringing Sevastopol Station to life in a way that will leave you in awe and fear. The game's commitment to authenticity, coupled with its strategic gameplay, results in a heart-racing adventure that keeps you on edge from start to finish.\n\nThis 2014 release is a love letter to Ridley Scott's iconic science fiction horror film, and it stands out as one of the most immersive and terrifying gaming experiences ever crafted. This is in no small part to its faithful replication of the aesthetic and design of [i] Alien [/i], nostalgic retro-futuristic technology and spine-chilling noises the Xenomorph makes as it stalks you throughout the station, every element contributes to an atmosphere that's incredibly immersive and tense.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the claustrophobic halls of the space station, the game envelops you in an atmosphere of sheer dread. The attention to detail is staggering; the flickering lights, ominous hums, and distant echoes all contribute to an unsettling ambience that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Navigating through these environments requires strategy and resourcefulness, as the threat of the Xenomorph looms around every corner. The non-linear structure encourages exploration, and the game rewards players who take the time to uncover the station's secrets and lore.\n\nThe attention to detail in the environments, and the lighting effects contribute significantly to the game's oppressive atmosphere. The sound design is equally impressive, with the iconic hisses and screeches of the Xenomorph sending shivers down your spine. The haunting musical score complements the visuals perfectly, adding an extra layer of tension to an already nerve-racking experience.\n\nAnother aspect that sets this game apart is the A.I. behaviour of the Xenomorph. Unlike other horror games where the enemy's behaviour is predictable, the Alien in this game is a dynamic and adaptive adversary. It learns from your actions, making each encounter a unique and nerve-wracking experience. The tension peaks as you desperately try to outsmart this relentless hunter, using the environment to your advantage or simply holding your breath, praying it doesn't hear you. So however you choose to explore the station, try not to make too much noise...\n\nIf you're a fan of the [i] Alien [/i] franchise or just love a good, heart-pounding horror experience, this is a must-play. It is perhaps the best [i] Alien [/i] game out there and still have a large following that continues to attract new fans. It's a true testament to the power of interactive storytelling and a shining example of what survival horror games can achieve when by a dedicated team who deserve the chance to develop a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1700636824, "timestamp_updated": 1700637505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150875376": {"recommendationid": "150875376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991082824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "playtime_at_review": 4839, "last_played": 1700755158}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Alien game ever.

The commitment to crafting a true-to-source horror experience ensures that this game remains a standout title in the genre.\n\nIn summary, Alien Isolation is a timeless gem that continues to be a pinnacle of horror and thriller gaming.

The first time I tried to play Isolation, I uninstalled it halfway through the medical wing.  The second time I pushed through it because the parts of the game that I liked felt like they were worth revisiting.  In the end I beat the game, and I'm putting a yes on checking this game out, but I strongly recommend you wait for a sale.  It's not worth full price. \n\n\nLong version: Alien Isolation gets several things right and those deserve their spotlight in addition to the issues and frustrations.  First off, the good: \n\nAll but two of the enemy types are well designed.  The Working Joe's, the other survivors, Seegson Security, you name it, they all have ways by which you can bypass them to get through an area, or take the fight directly to them if you're desperate.  Generally speaking however, you're a squishy little engineer and they're either tougher than you, stronger than you, or both, so the game strongly encourages you to avoid them if at all possible and gives you more tools to that effect than for fighting.  Flares, noisemakers, smoke bombs, the gadgets in the game each have specific purposes and enemy types they're effective against, and the game's generous in giving you enough materials to craft everything you could want as long as you're not spamming like a maniac.  The few combat options you do get ARE effective, so it's worth making sure you have those reserves on hand. And the way the game gives you some options and then makes it clear that they have dangerous consequences, so you're always considering them but more often than not end up not using them out of worry?  It's a stellar example of managing player expectations on the design side.\n\nEarly-game level design is simply fantastic.  Between the map and the motion tracker's built-in compass you never get lost, but you'll be surprised at how rarely you need it in the early parts of the game.  The hallways make it feel like you could get lost, but are actually very linear in where you can and can't go and the lighting is designed in such a way as to guide you if you start to feel stuck.  It's an extremely effective atmosphere and further adds to the tension in the equally stellar audio design.  In addition, by using save points throughout the game, the devs found a way to ensure that you as the player have tension buildup - how long has it been since your last one?  How much progress will get ruined if you die now?  Better be careful, you actually have something invested that you can lose.  It adds intimidation factors for all but the two enemy types I briefly mentioned earlier, which I'll get to in the cons section. \n\nStory and writing wise, it makes perfect sense - people vanishing to a mysterious killer, everyone for themselves, a dying facility, and one scared woman cut off from her escape route by an accident, trying to find answers in the middle of it all.  Each of the characters met along the way are solidly written; a couple are there just for exposition, but even those have personality and motivations that don't necessarily mesh with the rest of the cast. The puzzles to solve and the slow actions for certain types of activities all make it feel like you have a need to rush before getting caught, further adding to the atmosphere, and while it wasn't necessary that the actions had contextual button presses to synchronize with it, I would certainly say they added to the immersion of you being in Amanda's shoes and taking those actions directly. \n\n\nBut for the bad: \n\nThe worst part of the game is, ironically, the alien itself.  The Xenomorph and Facehuggers instakill you if they catch you.  No escape, no recourse.  You have fire weapons which can scare off the Xeno, and the Facehuggers can be killed by basically any ranged weapon in your arsenal, but that doesn't excuse the xeno's ability to spot and rush you before you have time to even react or figure out what you did wrong for the next attempt - or worse, round a corner and run into it yourself because it stopped moving long enough for the motion tracker to lose it and make you think it went into a vent.  There are entire GUIDES written about how to deal with the Xeno, on reddit and beyond, because it's got this \"horror director\" algorithm that changes its behavior constantly so you can never properly predict it - cool in some cases, but more often than not it makes the Xeno come right back 10 seconds after leaving so you don't even have time to act.  And the number of times it will stand directly in the way of your objective so you have to sit and wait, when the game's trying to encourage you to keep moving? Well, I lost count of mine, let's put it that way. \n\nIn the lategame, the level design loses a lot of that early guide-aid and becomes more aggravating.  Up one ramp, down another, through this transit to load a new map and straight into an elevator that loads ANOTHER new map!  It almost feels like going through a Metroidvania game - except you're not exploring to unlock anything, you're trying to get from Point A to Point B as efficiently as possible before you're instagibbed again. And there's one room in particular where four doors you have to double back across multiple times and have difficulty knowing which door to go through when as there's nothing but the compass to go off, while trying to avoid an idiot with a gun who will call the Xeno by shooting at you if he so much as spots you. \n\nAnd last but not least: It just.... keeps.... going.  There's two scenes where you're going around in a spacesuit and the walk pace is so painfully slow that what you could cross in 15 seconds with a sprint takes 4-5 minutes in these segments.  It's unnecessary, and made worse by the fact that literally nothing happens while you're in suit, so you're just Holding W and waiting to get to your next turn or objective.  You could literally weigh down the W key and navigate with your mouse one-handed.  That's bad design.  And the number of false endings would make LOTR: Return of the King jealous!\n\nAnger crushes fear.  Frustration breaks immersion.  A horror game cannot afford to cause either of these emotions on a consistent basis, and yet that's exactly what happens in Alien Isolation.  The parts of the game that are good are really, REALLY good, and I will praise those elements all day long.

From the very beginning, we get to the fanservice location - a ship of the same model as the Nostromo. To wander through its compartments is already an incredible experience. But this is just the beginning and the most interesting will begin a little later, but for now we will be given the necessary minimum of exposure and thrown into a new location - the Sevastopol station, which was already planned to be decommissioned. This is a fairly large, relatively open location. The interior of the station is based on the style of the first film and perfectly copes with the task of narration through the environment. Despite the constant danger, I regularly stayed at the locations to wander and see all the details. I think it's worth stopping the discussion of the visual on the fact that the graphics due to the stylistics look nice to this day (which cannot be said about the facial animation).\n\nWhat besides the atmosphere makes this game my favorite survival horror? Of course, hide-and-seek and confrontation with various opponents. The developers logically assumed that running exclusively from xenomorphs for several hours would get bored pretty quickly. The setting allowed us to add not only androids who decided not to follow the laws of robotics and became contentedly frightening, although not as immortal and unstoppable as xenomorphs. There are also quite a lot of people left at the station, most of whom do not really want you to move around their territory and are ready to shoot anyone who comes too close. The crafting system is responsible for survival in this aggressive environment, the interface of which, by the way, looks as stylish as everything in this game. You can craft small devices that can facilitate the passage. There are also weapons that allow you to stay alive in a critical situation, but no more. Even a flamethrower can only force the xenomorph to retreat, and if you do not hide, the enraged alien will return with an even greater desire to kill. This allows you to solve game problems in various ways, but always reminds you that the safest option is stealth. And even though I can't call it the best stealth, it's pretty close to that. At least the AI system adds to the interest, which seriously changes depending on the level of complexity. The plot, though quite simple, as in the film, is based on survival. Yes, sometimes backtracking is a little confusing. I have often found parallels with Prey, where the map hardly helps in the search. The absence of a global map of the station can completely lead to frustration, the benefit is that you can quickly understand that you are not where you should be.\n\nAll this makes this game one of the few where every aspect is performed at such a high level that nothing distracts you from the gameplay and you get exactly the emotions that you should.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1699959451,

I didn't finish it, but that's not important. Look, I'm a coward. I'm not going to hide it. You have to know that going into what follows.\n\nThe game terrified me. It was the most upsetting video gaming experience of my life. Why haven't I reviewed this game until now, 7 years since I played it? Because it still unsettles me to think about it. In nearly every moment of play, there's an aura of worry. Why is everything so dark? Why do the lights flash irregularly? Why is the music so tense? Why are creepy androids patrolling around, violently condemning my presence? Why why why?\n\nAnd then there's the alien. Singular. Just the one. There might as well have been hundreds. I worried about every corner, every shadow. I spent more time imagining the enemy's possible presence than actually seeing it, yet I was consistently on edge. You know you're never going to kill it--its name is the game's title, after all--so you run and hide and sweat and consider turning off the game, but ha ha, it's just pixels, keep on going. Each new room becomes nothing but an opportunity for the alien to show up and terrify you. In my case, the playthrough was mostly sneaking from bleak hallway to darkened passage, wishing I'd brought anyone along to keep me company.\n\nOkay, that word: \"playthrough.\" At least a quarter of my time in the game was spent hiding in a locker, trying to psych myself up to advance through the levels. I put pictures of puppies on my second monitor. I tried talking to a friend. I just frowned a lot, reminding myself that video games are fun.\n\nDid I turn my room's overhead light on four minutes in? Yes. Did I put my headphones on my shoulders rather than my ears? Yes. Did I yelp in terror at a wafting smoke plume, imagining it to be the alien come to consume me? ...  I don't want to answer that.\n\nLet me be clear: in the 8 hours I played A:I, I saw the alien probably ... twice. Three times, maybe. But that doesn't matter. Any game that allows the player to be so immersed in its environment that the lurking horror's absence is perhaps scarier than its presence has pulled off a feat. Its greatest terrors weren't in the game world; they were in me.\n\nIs this the scariest game ever made? I don't know. I don't want to know.\n\nRecommended.", "timestamp_created": 1699691942, "timestamp_updated": 1699691942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.774015724658966064", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149915172": {"recommendationid": "149915172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384351293", "num_games_owned": 1140, "num_reviews": 696, "playtime_forever": 1888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1888, "last_played": 1699344406}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game! it is a little long and doesn't have diverse gameplay, but alien isolation definitely is a worthwhile gaming experience. the actual game starts around chapter 5, as the first 4 are just story and gameplay intro. but it's a movie game that captures the experience and horror well.\n\nthe dlc is definitely worth it if you're a fan of the 1979 film.", "timestamp_created": 1699684185, "timestamp_updated": 1699684185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149909694": {"recommendationid": "149909694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080557005", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "playtime_at_review": 759, "last_played": 1700256164}, "language": "english", "review": "alien alone D:", "timestamp_created": 1699675354, "timestamp_updated": 1699675354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149887429": {"recommendationid": "149887429", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247809579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "playtime_at_review": 1607, "last_played": 1699645106}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great, what a fun time playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1699645267, "timestamp_updated": 1699645267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149881294": {"recommendationid": "149881294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278662866", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1036, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1700438211}, "language": "english", "review": "What AAA survival horror should be nowadays, but isn't.

A continuaci\u00f3n voy a destacar los que, para m\u00ed, son los mejores aspectos de este.\n\n- Ambientaci\u00f3n y fidelidad al universo \"Alien\": Este juego se desarrolla en el mismo universo que las pel\u00edculas de \"Alien\" y captura fielmente la atm\u00f3sfera claustrof\u00f3bica y aterradora de la franquicia. El transcurso de la historia gira en torno a una estaci\u00f3n espacial llamada Sevastopol, que ha ca\u00eddo en el caos despu\u00e9s de un brote de Xenomorfos.\n\n- Jugabilidad de supervivencia: El juego se centra en la supervivencia, asumiremos el papel de Amanda Ripley, la hija de Ellen Ripley, en su b\u00fasqueda de respuestas sobre la desaparici\u00f3n de su madre. Habr\u00e1 que utilizar sigilo y recursos limitados para evitar tanto al Xenomorfo como a otros peligros que acechan en la estaci\u00f3n.\n\n- La inteligencia artificial del Xenomorfo: Este enemigo es impredecible y aprende de las acciones del jugador, lo que hace que cada encuentro sea una experiencia tensa y aterradora.\n\n- Elementos de sigilo: En el juego, habr\u00e1 que moverse en silencio, esconderse y utilizar objetos para distraer al Xenomorfo y otros enemigos. La gesti\u00f3n de recursos es esencial para sobrevivir.\n\n- Gr\u00e1ficos y sonido: Para ser un juego de 2014, cuenta con una impresionante calidad gr\u00e1fica y una banda sonora que contribuye a crear una atm\u00f3sfera de terror. El sonido juega un papel fundamental para alertarte de la presencia del Xenomorfo y crear una experiencia inmersiva.\n\n- Narrativa y personajes: La trama del juego se desarrolla a medida que Amanda Ripley busca respuestas sobre la desaparici\u00f3n de su madre y los eventos en la estaci\u00f3n Sevastopol. Los personajes que se encuentran en el juego contribuyen a la historia y al sentido de peligro constante.\n\nEn resumen, tanto si eres un fan\u00e1tico de la saga o eres alguien cuyo primer contacto con esta franquicia ha sido este videojuego (al igual que yo), te recomiendo jugarlo, no te arrepentir\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1699192745, "timestamp_updated": 1699230726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149576489": {"recommendationid": "149576489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868531545", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 286, "last_played": 1606665837}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so scary that this poor cat is now scared, everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064", "timestamp_created": 1699178461, "timestamp_updated": 1699178461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486979156732559204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149575358": {"recommendationid": "149575358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198823375977", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1699687675}, "language": "english", "review": "Now I have played through this game before on another platform so I just felt like I had to leave a review. \nThe game is amazing and especially so if you watched the first Alien movie.

decent-at-best Alien franchise movie set. Everything about it is shallow, half baked and gets old in hour 3. The puzzles are basic and boring, the alien is constantly on your ass and the only counter-play is hiding, which really just means sit in a locker for up to five minutes until the alien gets bored and goes up a vent just to return 30 seconds later, rinse, repeat until you've made it from one end of the room to another.

I played this game a couple months off release on the Xbox One, but never finished it. Came back to it and finished it on PC, and can safely say that this is the greatest Alien game ever made, and a masterpiece of horror.\n\nAlien: Isolation does an absolutely phenomenal job with its worldbuilding, audio design, and claustrophobic gameplay. The developers clearly cared about the original series, with the game looking as if it was directly from the original film. The audio and musical score is amazingly tense, filling the player with dread as they clamber through vents and craft pipe bombs with spare parts.\nThe star of the game, the Alien, is by far one of the most engaging, terrifying, and wondrous enemies I have ever encountered in a game. At no point does the Alien become boring: even after hours of the campaign and replaying levels for speedrunning certain sections, the Alien never became uninteresting. This, to me, is the most important aspect of the game: the core gameplay of hiding from the Alien is incredibly tense and amazingly terror-inducing. To this day, the Alien's ability to amaze me with its horrible intelligence has yet to be topped by another horror game. \n\nBesides the Alien, the game's combat and stealth is really well done. The Working Joe robots are freaky and do a good job of serving as a secondary antagonist, and although the human sections can get a bit frustrating on the hardest difficulty (while playing pacifist, in fairness), they're still fun to see, and you can always whack your jack on a wall to summon the starbeast as backup.\n\nThe story isn't particularly special, but it's still pretty engaging, especially for an Alien title. Nothing too complicated, but it's fun and there are plenty of great callbacks for Alien fans (including a remake of the original LV426 derelict), and the game stays fun throughout. Some might say that it can have a bit of a slow start before the Alien is in full force, or that the campaign can drag on a bit, but I can't say I agree. Best of all, the two DLCs for the game let you play through two iconic situations from the original film, with the original actors reprising their roles as voices in audio logs and gameplay. It's pretty fun.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is a modern classic, and ought to be considered as one of the best horror games ever made. It's a lovingly crafted gift, dedicated to Alien fans and horror enthusiasts alike. Although it's a shame that it got a lukewarm reception on release, its quality has been better appreciated over time, and I hope that by playing it, (you) can see how great it really is. \nYou can buy it on sale, since it goes for cheap often, but I'd 100% endorse purchasing it at full price. The two story based DLC are also highly worth it if you're an Alien fan. The other DLC are challenge levels, so it really depends on whether you enjoy that gamemode and want more variety in the levels. If you ask me, buy the game and both story DLC: you won't regret it!", "timestamp_created": 1698467732, "timestamp_updated": 1698467732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673511147499084473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149019895": {"recommendationid": "149019895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375475068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 920, "last_played": 1698570371}, "language": "english", "review": "Its beautiful.

Alien isolation absolutely nails the atmosphere of the first Alien movie, using exquisite sound and graphic design, from the unsettling creaking of the sevastopol station and other environmental sounds to the alternation of very dark and very bright areas. The game is full of visual cues to the near constant threat of the creature, and its heavy steps as it stalks you, bear witness to its overwhelming deadliness. \n\nI played the game on hard as is recommended by the developers and I found it to be a terrifying but fair experience. I caught myself quite a few times having a heavy heartbeat and needing to take a small break to relax. The joy of reaching a save station after crouching around a crate  for a few minutes as the Xenomorph searches the room for you, is genuine and keeps you going, objective after objective. BTW, as other people have said, don't hide in lockers for too long, they are death traps. It's much better to move around a piece of furniture and swiftly pursue your next objective when the coast is clear. \n\nStory wise, there aren't a lot of new perspectives to be gained, but IMO that's beyond the scope of the game anyway. Just enjoy it as the massive fan service that it is (but with great gameplay!). If OTOH you're a horror fan but not familiar with the franchise, what are you doing with your life?

That pushed the expectations on how good of a horror game this is. Don't get me wrong, it is creepy.

Altough I found that some sequences are masterpieces, I found some others to be bland, and I couldn't play through these without a few day of pause inbetween. \n\nThe cause of this is that the gameplay is honestly not the best. Crouch, wait, press on buttons, go where the map tells you to go, occasionally spit some fire, pickup some items which aren't very useful (I think I haven't used a single craftable item in my playthrough except medikits), ...\n\nBut the atmosphere and sound design of this game were simply amazing. This game absolutely nailed the horror part imo. I think I had a nightmare about these damn androids. The alien is a constant source of fear, although it becomes less of a threat once you understand how to play around it, and even less after unlocking the flamethrower, as you then get a ton of opportunities to scare the alien away yourself.\n\nIn the end, not the best horror game, but one of the scariest one.

also buggy and glitchy as fuck specialy when youn climb the camera jerks arround and the Flamethrower fuel tank makes noise even whe full tank our when you select another item and you dont have full tank and continues to make noise\n\nits a must play for all Alien or horror fans to jizz all over this game with an over accelareted heartrate, beathaking as Keanu, if not better, the game came out at the same time as my PC and the graphics and visuals sill weld up incredilby well, unilke my PC, great gameplay, has its flaws but almost under the radar for the game in general\n\n  overhall, 9/10,

The entire environment is alive and keeps you guessing and tense.\n\nGame mechanics 7/10 - the game mechanics are a little difficult and some of the interactions can be problematic to figure out, but overall not too complicated and once you're playing and have controls sorted, you're fine. Some of the mechanics get a little repetitive towards the end quarter of the game.\n\nGameplay and Story 9/10 - very true to the source material, this looks and feels like being part of the cinematic world of Aliens. The story is well written, if slightly predictable in some areas. Some of the back and forth to locate items might be frustrating to some players, but overall a solid story and engrossing gameplay. The environment is well crafted with attention to detail, and nothing is as nerve wracking as crawling through potentially occupied air vents.\n\nHorror 11/10 - Going up against the Xenomorph is horrifying and nerve wracking, the movements and interactions are top tier, this is one of the most iconic horror antagonists and the game does the experience of facing a xenomorph justice.  Facing multiple is terrifying.\n\nOverall highly recommended as an unforgettable experience - this game stands up excellent to the test of time.", "timestamp_created": 1697093009, "timestamp_updated": 1697093009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148057337": {"recommendationid": "148057337", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985514753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "playtime_at_review": 3718, "last_played": 1700459704}, "language": "english", "review": "This is without any doubt, the definitive experience of alien.

Amnesia and Outlast AI is nowhere near the Xenomorph. It is truly something to behold due it's mostly non-scripted hunting and leads to incredibly tense hide and seek gameplay.\n\nThe story is again, in my opinion wonderful.

As someone who is both a fan of the Alien films and the horror game genre, I think what they were able to achieve by capturing the first film's atmosphere is incredible but that all falls flat on it's face when it comes to actual being a \"game\" and an entertaining enjoyable experience.\n\nI tried so many times to love this game and finally \"get it\" but sadly I've come to the realization that it just fucking sucks. I understand that this is a stealth game, but the actual stealth aspect itself is absolutely horrendous. You can't move more than 5 feet without being detected, you have to pretty much crouch through the entire game or you're going to get ass blasted every minute or so, even on the lower difficulties. Once you are detected you have to find a locker and sit in there forever as whatever enemy you triggered patrols the area as thoroughly as fucking possible. These motherfuckers inspect every room, every corner, every surface, every crack in the wall and make sure every dust particle is undisturbed before they give up. The sheer amount of bullshit, out of my control moments this game punishes you for is insanity.

I have wanted to play Alien Isolation for a pretty long while and I finally have gotten around to doing that. I'm a huge fan of the Alien movies and so this game always interested me.\n\nI really enjoyed it and it was a great game, very well made, but I don't think I can give it a 10/10 for a couple reasons, though it was a lot of fun and I think it deserves a solid 8 or 8.5 out of 10. \n\nAs a caveat, I don't really play survival games, and this might honestly be the first I've ever played, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe Pros:\n - Alien Isolation does a great job of bringing the Alien setting to life. So much of the game is drawn from and inspired from the Alien and Aliens movies and it does a fantastic job of recreating those themes, the art design, the lore, and the general feeling of being vulnerable in space.\n- The graphics are really great, even almost ten years later. Everything looks great, straight out of Alien the movie, and the graphics work with the atmosphere to really sell the low-fi futuristic space age. \n- The gameplay is pretty fun, it can be hard at times and I obviously died a lot, but while being challenged, I never felt like things were impossible while playing on the second hardest difficulty (not Nightmare). Crafting system is not super complicated and you don't even really have to use it. I didn't use items other than medpacks for about 95% of the game and in retrospect I might have had an easier time if I did.\n- The story is fun, it's straight out of the Alien franchise so while you're not going to get anything world-shatteringly new, it's still a great story with great voice acting.\n\nThe Cons:\n- Maybe because this was my first survival game, I didn't really know what to expect, but because the AI does different things each time you play for different enemies, I feel like there's a lot of luck in surviving. You do learn some strategies as you play through to deal with different enemies and avoid the alien, but at the same time, many times, if I was having trouble with a particular area, I just had to die enough times and then the alien wouldn't show up, just out of the random spawn point or aggression point or the AI deciding to do a different thing, and I would just advance at that point, without doing anything different, just lucky the alien didn't show up.\n- Because of the above point, I didn't really feel like the game was scary and the alien didn't really scare me, it just was mostly frustrating that like I might open the next door and it's standing there, and then I die, and the next time I open the door, it's gone, and I'm fine.\n- The middle of the game is a bit of a slog from a story perspective, I would have preferred they cut maybe two or three of the missions, personally, but it's not a huge deal overall.\n\nSo, overall, a very fun game and one I enjoyed, I just didn't think it was exactly the masterpiece people said it was. In the future, I have no plans to replay it, I'll just rewatch the movies instead if I want that kind of sci fi engagement. But, like I also said, it was very fun, I did enjoy it a lot, and if you are interested in the movies and a game like this, I highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1696791597, "timestamp_updated": 1696791597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147863684": {"recommendationid": "147863684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001429506", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1344, "last_played": 1696654118}, "language": "english", "review": "It does a great job of capturing the atmosphere and environment of the first alien film.

The space station you are on looks exactly like something you would expect to exist in the Alien universe. It takes heavy inspiration from the first movie especially.\nThese influences are not only visible in the art design, but also the game play:\nYou cannot kill the alien. You have to hide and outwit the xenomorph. You get some weapons later on, but they can only scare it away and buy you a short amount of time. Also like the movie the game takes some time to show you the alien. Don't expect to see the xenomorph in the first 2-3 hours of the game.\nThe alien learns as you play through the campaign. This means if you e.g. hide a lot in lockers it will begin to check them regularly so you have to change your tactic like hide under tables or behind boxes instead. \nYou could use noise makers or flares to distract it, but if you do it often enough the alien will begin to ignore them and instead look for where they came from.\nThe atmosphere in the game is so thick you could cut it with a knive.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to every alien or stealth horror fan out there.\n\nThe game is not recommended for people who hate stealth gameplay or unkillable enemies as well as slow and atmospheric openings.", "timestamp_created": 1696695094, "timestamp_updated": 1696695094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147777548": {"recommendationid": "147777548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062040803", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1700273220}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, the best horror game I've ever played, and, in my opinion, ever made.\n\nNo other horror game has properly scared me, with the environment itself being claustrophobic, decayed, quite creepy, and featuring few jumpscares, but the ones the game does have, are well done, from the environment itself being its own enemy; a station half-decommissioned, with gas vents that can explode scaring the bejeezus out of me, rather than the typical \"loud noise and audio-stinger to remind you you're meant to be scared!\" antic from other horror games, often those involving haunted houses with pictures that change faces, or some other cheap scare.\nOn Sevastopol Station, the scares don't feel like they're aimed at you, they're ambient, and you just happened to be there. It's worldbuilding, not just a stinger.\n\nThe game is quite replayable, I find, cause even after you've beaten it once, as I did back nearly a decade ago on my old XBOX, I have wanted to play this again on PC for so long. I know the opening few chapters of the game off by heart, and yet, still, I can find myself with the hairs on my neck standing up when I have to try and navigate around the Alien. \nI know the Alien's routines quite well, and you grow used to the audiocues it gives you, but still, it can act quite unpredictably at hand, and, worst of all, it can adapt to your behaviour, and pre-empt your actions if you act predictably.\nIf you like to wait and hide, it will patrol more. If you are a tunnel rat, it will learn this, and meet you in there, with a friendly grin of its second set of jaws ready to greet you. If you spam the flamethrower, it will come back, quicker, angrier. I really, really hope you learn to economise your gas usage for the flamethrower, you'll need it.\n\nThe audio-visual feel of this game is sublime. Hats off to the audio team. Though I've learned the audio-cues for your games, and though I've memorised nearly all of the bleeps and boops of the technology in this game, it's still so charming. And it's a really nice touch to use so many of the sounds from the original films too. Same story with the environmental design and the use of technology; everything looks and feels like the first film, down to the very layout of the first chapter, on-board an M-Class starship, which, the characters note, is \"Much like the ship [Ellen Ripley] served on.\" \n\nThe story is amazingly done, fits neatly into the universe, and feels like a real nightmare on the station. Her daughter, Amanda, is well voice acted for most of the segments of the game, and it makes her quite empathetic in my opinion. She's my favourite playable woman in gaming, if I can claim such a thing. Pragmatic, determined, and driven, even after a life of hardship and grievence; she's developed a wide skill-set in all things technical, and after a steep learning curve, learns to become a survivor, too. The only unlikeable aspect of the story in my opinion is the tutorial section with Axel, who, in his segment, bosses you about and tells you to be quiet about 7 times while you're more quiet than him, and there's some hiccups in the writing on the Torrens, where some of Taylor's delivery doesnt perfectly sync up with the conversation she's meant to be having with Amanda, but then again, it's hard for voice actors' lines to perfectly match the gameplay, as they're often acting months ahead of time for a game that they can't even see in front of them, and this is only a minor gripe, as the lines are just fine.\n\nDid I mention I love this game?\nI'll leave it at that.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1696648437, "timestamp_updated": 1696648437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147773898": {"recommendationid": "147773898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198950424582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1700635353}, "language": "english", "review": "Little girl giant alien? \"RIPLEEEYYY\" no? anyone?\n", "timestamp_created": 1696642437, "timestamp_updated": 1696642437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147761814": {"recommendationid": "147761814", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960543554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1700512268}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is single-player hide and seek.

The visuals are absolutely immaculate both technically, and artistically. The gameplay is everything you could want of the genre. The AI alone is deserving of a rant of its own, like seriously, wow. And the DLC allows you to play as the characters from the 1979 original(A movie preserved in the library of congress btw), all being played by their original actors. This game is the ultimate mix of genius minds in all parties involved. The one time a movie company and game studio came together and both did everything flawlessly.

And the root cause of it is, unfortunately, the xenomorph itself.  The game is designed to be slow, in an attempt to make it more 'strategic' or 'tactical'.  That means even basic things like reloading a weapon require you to hold down a button while your character loads rounds one at a time.  That in itself isn't bad.  The game is paced around that when dealing with human or Working Joe enemies.  However, in order to balance that around the indestructible xenomorph, they made it lumber slowly through hallways, stalking the player like it's Jason Voorhees.  Something no xenomorph in the movies ever did.  They are fast, agile ambush predators.  They hide in vents, they climb walls, they hang from dark ceilings waiting to strike down at unsuspecting prey.  They DON'T walk very slowly through circular hallways while the player hides in a locker.  That wouldn't prevent them from finding you anyway.  Another issue with the game.  Things like a slightly foggy room are enough to make the xenomorph unable to see you from 6 inches away.  Apparently this xenomorph hatched from Mr. Magoo.\n\nIf the game used the xenomorph sparingly, used its presence to punctuate tense areas, escapes that made you have to figure out how to distract it, disable pathways, and run to an exit into another area where you lose it for another good portion of the game, when you're then forced to deal with the humans and Working Joes again, it would be a significantly better game.  Instead you get prolonged areas of an hour or more where you're just playing hide and seek with lockers as the xenomorph is always no more than two halls away from you, and you have no way of knowing if it's safe or not to come out of the locker.\n\nThe story seems interesting.  I love the main character, Ellen Ripley's daughter who's also a mechanic and thus uses various tools she picks up to open areas of the station bit by bit.  But the overuse of the universe's dumbest xenomorph and the incredibly boring hide-and-seek sections where you spend most of your time staring at the inside of a locker door just kill this game for me.  When Colonial Marines is not only more entertaining, but even with the broken AI has more accurate xenomorphs, then your game is just not worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1695149407, "timestamp_updated": 1695149407, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423250585794448853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146594314": {"recommendationid": "146594314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317269371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2143, "last_played": 1695093319}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like being in the original movie", "timestamp_created": 1695136942, "timestamp_updated": 1695136942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146574640": {"recommendationid": "146574640", "author": {"steamid": "76561199184646883", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1695534256}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the year yurt", "timestamp_created": 1695104088, "timestamp_updated": 1695104088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146571448": {"recommendationid": "146571448", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229445109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1694998487}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great.

The entire ship is in chaos as an alien has been killing crew members and cyborgs has also seemed to turn on humans.\n\nThe gameplay consists of mainly stealth and hiding. While you do have an assortment of weapons and tools they are really only useful on human enemies and the basic androids.

You will die even at full health with 2 bullets. Yes that seems realistic, but god damn they seem to hit you from across then map as you hide behind a vending machine.\n\nThe androids - honestly these enemies where funny AF. They would say some funny one liners as you ran for your life because these things would beat you down while asking you if you need assistance lmao.\n\nHonestly if I were to play this game again I would choose an easier mode just to avoid the bs deaths.\n\nOther than that the game was a blast and really kept you engaged. \n\nI played this on steam deck max settings and it ran at a constant 60fps through the whole game \n\n8.5/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694589903, "timestamp_updated": 1694589903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146200068": {"recommendationid": "146200068", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972012659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1081, "last_played": 1695914503}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

I am not talking about examples like The Outer Worlds or Borderlands, where humour and crudeness is an obvious by-product of the artist's inability to thoroughly conceive a post-capitalist society and the despair this limit on imagination creates. I am not talking about examples like Cameron's Aliens either, where heavy handed use of allegory limits the critique itself to a specific timeframe of capitalist era.\n\nI'm talking about critique like Ridley Scott's Alien and Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation which are quite unique, where handled material is fundamental to the capitalist society. Both are concerned with space and future on the surface, but you can move both of these stories in any kind of setting where capitalism is the dominant mode of production, and they would still work. The inherent thirst for any kind of \"technological leap\" that makes the cost insignificant, whether they are human lives or temporary financial setbacks, due to how complete a hegemony over society and politics this leap could provide (think of General Electric, Ford etc.) is a continuous theme throughout capitalist era and the Alien\u2019s presence in that setting only works as a fulcrum to crystalize latent dilemmas of capitalist society.\n\nIt is also due to a failed capital venture the Sevastopol is crumbling, the decommissioning work is not up to standards and cost-cutting measures ensured that functionality of the station is extremely limited. This is a regular story in our boring, non-Xenomorph filled world. Think of a not up-to-code highrise collapses and resulting in the death of hundreds (like Grenfell Tower). No one on the space station reacts to Sevastopol\u2019s collapse with sarcastic and dejected humour either, this is their livelihood, and their reactions are blue collar to the bone. This is what makes Alien: Isolation much more palatable than the whole genre of \u201cspace as final frontier games\u201d. A dysfunctional elevator can kill you, even if you're not chased by an Alien. If the reason of why the elevator doesn't work is capitalist economic practices, you would not joke about them, you'd get furious.\n \nAlien: Isolation is a horrible, terrifying game. Not only because you, the player character, is the favourite delicacy of a relentless stalker, a perfect organism. Lightning does not work half the time, computerised systems are old and prone to malfunction, there are poisonous gas leakages and there is an unreliable AI network. The station is actively trying to kill you and all these factors contribute massively to the faithful recreation of 70's sci-fi, and the horror of original Alien alike. There have been numerous times I was more scared by some other fault of Sevastopol, than the Xenomorph itself. This game made me earnestly think that I'd rather get killed by Alien than be a mechanic of a poorly maintained space station. Especially the first half of the game is unmatched in this sense. While exploring a beautifully crafted 70's sci-fi station, trying not to get too carried by how good it looks, you'll never know the loud thud you heard was another part of the ship falling off, or the Alien dropping off a vent.\n \nIf anything, Xenomorph serves as a perfect distraction for the corporate suits. In the first half of Alien: Isolation is we witness people who are reduced to their basic survival instincts, forming groups and primarily trying to stay alive. Frontal cortex is suppressed, and only nonethical/tribal reactions are permitted. Only when the Alien threat subsides briefly in the latter half, working-class consciousness surfaces again and some of the inhabitants of Sevastopol, begin to show a clear understanding what this knowledge would mean in a capitalist society. The cost would be dismissible, and executives would not stop pursuing this object of massive technological leap. At that moment, the enemy that needs to be stopped ultimately becomes the capitalists.\n\nUnfortunately, this conceptual elevation in storytelling during the second half does not correspond to gameplay itself. After twelve hours mark, I was scared in every possible way. I knew I was still going to be scared until the game's end, but resignation caused by this idea dropped the tension incredibly low. Creative Assembly discovered the perfect formula to translate Scott\u2019s Alien to gaming medium. Play hide and seek with an opponent you can\u2019t cheat or beat, while malfunctions will leave you frustrated or even serve to take you down if you get overconfident in your abilities, reminding you of your place. \n\nOn a surprisingly related note, I love butter very much, it\u2019s fulfilling, tasty and feels fresh in the mouth. It goes with almost every ingredient you can put in a sandwich. Still \u201clike butter scraped over too much bread\u201d, the game\u2019s \u223c19 hour runtime is too much bread for a single ingredient to carry all the weight (not really going to count endlessly repeating 2-3 mini-games) and if the game was compressed to end at around 12th hour mark, its impact would be much more hard-hitting. Without insider knowledge, it is impossible to know if the game was padded to make 60$ singleplayer only, linear game appealing to the masses, as we have been conditioned to evaluate quantity as the primary denominator in the value formula. \n \nEven then, compared to most fifteen or twenty hour mark singleplayer games, Alien: Isolation\u2019s \u201cpadding\u201d does not feel like it is there for padding\u2019s sake. If there have been new ingredients in the gameplay formula, I\u2019d have no qualms with it, as only then, the story had hit its full stride. Characters like Samuels and Marlow start to exceed their function as non-interactable story locomotives and revealed the depth of their personality and their viewpoints. Contrastingly, the number of small, scripted events that do much of \u201cshow, not tell\u201d heavy lifting for the story also decrease in number in the middle. Brief moments where we witnessed scripted NPCs trying to find their own way through the devastation of Sevastopol was one of my favourite parts of the game, increasing realism that Ripley is not the only one that is at least half sane in this hellhole.\n\nTo be honest, if I had written this review right after completing the game, this would have been a much more negative one. If the original movie\u2019s Facehugger is a metaphor for getting a forced face-sitting, this whole game is a metaphor for a plumber porn that frustratingly never moves on from fake fixing stuff part. Nevertheless, after two days of reflecting upon the game, I finally recognized that I loved it and there are many parts of it that I will always carry, like this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSZPxHppXBE]song[/url], or seeing an NPC solemnly sitting, watching the stars, stoically waiting for her inevitable death.\n\nDamn, I made myself emotional now/10", "timestamp_created": 1694450697, "timestamp_updated": 1694784979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61200261116027832", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146123399": {"recommendationid": "146123399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184120751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1939, "last_played": 1694639463}, "language": "english", "review": "shit graphics, a.i buggedto hell", "timestamp_created": 1694449049, "timestamp_updated": 1694449049, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423309504985809326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146104733": {"recommendationid": "146104733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450542031", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2296, "last_played": 1692458511}, "language": "english", "review": "alien shit-my-pants isolation good", "timestamp_created": 1694421396, "timestamp_updated": 1694421396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146098786": {"recommendationid": "146098786", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972082582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1573, "last_played": 1694405583}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a decent game, but sadly I often found it more annoying than fun. The plot, characters, environments, enemy design, sound design, and music are all solid, but there are major gameplay issues. \n\nThe gameplay has some major problems that drag down the experience. The general controls and exploration gameplay is great. The problems arise when it comes to enemy AI and the gameplay around them. There are three types of enemies in the game with some variation in each category. Humans, Synthetics, and Aliens. The gameplay with the first two types works great. Fighting them is exciting and the stealth mechanics are mostly solid, though I encountered a couple issues with them seeing me through walls or them getting stuck in place. It's a lot of fun getting these two types to fight when you can or luring the Aliens to the humans. The Aliens aren't hostile to synthetics and as far as I can tell there isn't a way to make those two groups fight. It would've been nice if there were a way to provoke conflict between them, but that's not a huge deal.\n\nThe real issues are with the Alien gameplay which, unsurprisingly, is at the core of the game. All the Alien enemies can instakill you immediately on contact and there are no QTEs or escape items to save you. That's a very risky approach when it comes to a stealth game. If everything isn't right on point, it can get frustrating very quickly. Sadly, the Alien AI is very buggy and they behave in ways that make no sesne. Multiple times during a single play through I had an Alien glitch through a solid wall or floor and instakill me. I also encountered times when the Alien's tail would clip through objects or walls resulting in the alien catching me even though I wasn't even in the same room. Glitches aside, the Alien AI hovers around you and camps your objectives in a way that makes not sense for the context. Why would the Alien know to camp a specific switch? It doesn't know what the switch does and there's a huge map for it to patrol so why does it just walking in a 5 foot radius around my objective? There are some weapons/items that can scare the Alien away, but supplies can be scarce so it's very annoying to need to waste them scaring off a Alien that's stuck in an AI loop (for example jumping in an out of the same vent dozens of times in a row) or is camping an objective.\n\nThese issues are exacerbated by the save system. You can only save at set points and those points are distributed very illogically. Some sections have long sequences with no save points, while overs seem to have a save point every other room. If the devs consistently used one of those approaches, I would think it was intentional but the fact that they flip flop level to level makes me think that it's just poor design from devs that didn't know what they wanted to do.\n\nThere are a few levels in the game without the Alien and those levels are excellent. You get to fight the humans and synths and use all the fun weapons you picked up. When the Alien is around using a weapon summons it, so it usually isn't worth the risk of instakill. Which make one wonder why the game gives you all these weapons when they are basically useless for 80% of the game? Eventually, the glitchy, bad AI mess that is the Alien comes back and the game becomes a chore again.\n\nDue to all these issues, the game also dragged terribly and felt far too long. The horror elements are also very weak, so I wouldn't recommend getting it for that aspect. \n\nOverall, if you like the Alien movies, this game captures them quite well from a visual and audio standpoint. It's just a shame that certain parts of the gameplay are some broken that they drag down the whole experience. I would give this game like a 6/10 for Alien fans, mostly for the visual, audio, and plot elements. If you don't mind dealing with all the jank and resulting frustration, there is some enjoyment there, but know what you're getting into. I recommend only getting it on deep, deep sale.\n\nIf you aren't already an Alien fan or a Stealth game fanatic, I would probably pass, since this game is largely a love letter fans of those movies and has many issues weighing it down.", "timestamp_created": 1694407754, "timestamp_updated": 1694407754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146094399": {"recommendationid": "146094399", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082167468", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1313, "last_played": 1683400820}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is so crazy. there is so much to do and at some points when you think the game is over, it's not. it's awesome, 10/10, now i have to go play the dlcs!", "timestamp_created": 1694399406, "timestamp_updated": 1694399406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146090810": {"recommendationid": "146090810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073113238", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 980, "last_played": 1694393287}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, ending was a bit stretched bro lul", "timestamp_created": 1694393382, "timestamp_updated": 1694393382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146082867": {"recommendationid": "146082867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001010387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1694637579}, "language": "english", "review": "Would have been better if the alien didn't have a Ripley scanner.

While it\u2019s not essential, it will make you appreciate how faithful this game\u2019s atmosphere is to the movie. Also, it\u2019s a great classic.\nYou play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley, one of the movie protagonists. While searching for clues about her mother's whereabouts, she lands on Sevastopol, a big space station where things aren\u2019t what they seem at first. That\u2019s where the majority of the game takes place.\nThe big selling point of the game is obviously the Alien and its AI. It\u2019s terrifying and requires you to take a stealthy approach. You can\u2019t kill it, only hide and use distractions. Not only that, but it learns from you, so it becomes more aggressive and counters your strategies if you rely on them too much.\nFor example, if you hide in lockers a lot, it\u2019ll eventually start checking them before leaving a room, forcing you to rely on different methods to survive. Although sometimes it feels cheap, especially in the beginning where your options are more limited.\nYou can explore to find resources to craft useful items, and the station even has some Metroidvania elements. However, the longer you explore, the harder it becomes to evade the Alien, especially because there\u2019re no autosaves. You need to reach phone booths and save manually, and they may be a bit apart from each other.\nIt has a great AI, and you can find a lot of info on the internet explaining it. It\u2019s not scripted and has a lot of interesting elements, like being actually 2 AIs. One of them always knows your position, but only tells the Alien AI the general area you\u2019re in, and the Alien AI is responsible for searching.\nHowever, the Alien isn\u2019t the only threat on the station, and some missions don\u2019t even feature the Alien at all. The other main threat is the station's working androids, that act more like zombies. They\u2019re annoying, but you can actually kill them. They add a bit more variety to the game.\nThere are also other humans that may be hostile, and even the station itself has some surprises for you. While a bit claustrophobic and repetitive, it\u2019s a character on its own. It has good graphics and lighting, but being mostly enclosed spaces also helps with optimization. The game runs generally well, even on weaker hardware.\nMy main complaint about the game is that it is long, too long. It sounds weird, and I\u2019m not advocating for shorter games overall, but this one feels too padded. There\u2019s a lot of backtracking and most objectives are similar. There was a point where you might think the game is over after 8-12 hours, but you\u2019re actually only halfway there\u2026 I had to play it in shorter sessions because I was getting tired of it, and it just kept on going.\nThere are also collectibles and achievements that further extend playtime. Not only that, there are also some DLC available, but they\u2019re also optional. They don\u2019t even have achievements associated, so they don\u2019t ruin your overall completion, a small detail I enjoyed.\nBut yeah, if you\u2019re a fan of horror and/or the Alien franchise, this is a must-buy. It\u2019s one of the best horror games available, even after all these years, and one of the best Alien video games as well since it captures that universe so well.", "timestamp_created": 1693432862, "timestamp_updated": 1693432862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145343444": {"recommendationid": "145343444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028547896", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1365, "last_played": 1693428783}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeap.", "timestamp_created": 1693428919, "timestamp_updated": 1693428919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145338181": {"recommendationid": "145338181", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989174133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2859, "last_played": 1696456845}, "language": "english", "review": "best whole neigh ass team developers", "timestamp_created": 1693422536, "timestamp_updated": 1693422536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145327474": {"recommendationid": "145327474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418727318", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1693413781}, "language": "english", "review": "Bring some extra boxers/pants", "timestamp_created": 1693409946, "timestamp_updated": 1693409946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145310997": {"recommendationid": "145310997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049113951", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 900, "last_played": 1693388638}, "language": "english", "review": "Dirty magazine down the throat.

A casual play through/ speed run will land you about 14 hours, but you miss way too much of the groundwork laid for the amazing details of the back story to everything hidden in the exploration.

Recomiendo a todo aquel que le guste los juegos de terror jugar a esta obra de arte. Para empezar consigue hacerte sentir que se te hiele la sangre cada segundo. Es bastante raro encontrar ese momento en el que te sientas tranquilo. Esa sensaci\u00f3n de sentirte indefenso ante una amenaza que hagas lo que hagas a a ser superior a ti consigue de la mejor manera ponerme la piel de gallina. Respecto a la narrativa creo que esta bastante bien, consigue encajar y utilizar el personaje de Amanda Ripley con la historia que se forja a lo largo de las pel\u00edculas originales. Lo \u00fanico que veo negativo es la motivaci\u00f3n de Apolo y los sint\u00e9ticos, que me parece una copia de Madre en el Octavo pasajero, dejando ese detalle de lado el resto me parece correcto. En el tema gr\u00e1fico me parece que est\u00e1 incre\u00edble, sobretodo con los reflejos de la luz, la ambientaci\u00f3n es alucinante, me ha encantado el dise\u00f1o de la Sevastopol, sobretodo cuando encuentras algun ventanal y puedes ver el espacio. Todo consigue crear una atm\u00f3sfera que le viene como anillo al dedo al juego. Por ultimo quiero recalcar lo bien conseguido que esta la IA de los personajes. Detalles tan tontos como que los NPC humanos te amenacen con dispararte si no te vas, hagas esto y no lo hagan es algo que en much\u00edsimos juegos actuales no se ve. Pero lo que se lleva la guinda del pastel es el Alien, la IA esta muy lograda y ver como se va complicando a lo largo del juego es la ostia. \nLo recomiendo 100%, al principio se puede hacer algo tedioso y dif\u00edcil pero si le das una oportunidad no te arrepentir\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1693261842, "timestamp_updated": 1693261842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145206597": {"recommendationid": "145206597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035975022", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2052, "last_played": 1697320497}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1693239135, "timestamp_updated": 1693239135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492424249649047852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145204755": {"recommendationid": "145204755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027983793", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5085, "last_played": 1693236459}, "language": "english", "review": "Very very original Alien vibes.

The claustrophobia, terror and hide-or-die gameplay mechanics catch on quickly for fans of the films. With enough patience, and generous pauses in your play sessions, you can make it through this horror game. The story is satisfying and the gameplay is more than a fulfillment of a film fans dream of being aboard a derelict ship in outer space.\n\nSidenote: I fantasized about having one chapter where you would be given a huge amount of ammo and weapons to fight off aliens. A short respite from terror. I felt like there was a needed Rambo moment that could have increased the enjoyment in Isolation.

Unfortunately what I got was not what I was expecting. The game has a really slow start, it takes it's time setting up the Sevastapol and the tone of the game to come, which is welcome. What I didn't find that thrilling is how long the iconic Alien takes to be introduced, which is a down for me personally. \n\nThe thing about this game is that it's simply way too long, it overstays it's welcome HARD, even after what I thought was the last mission of the game there were still almost two hours of gameplay left and by then the horror was already completely gone. The second complain I have is that anything besides the Alien itself is absolutely boring or not scary, the human enemies are really underwhelming and the Working Joes are interesting at first but just become frustrating and a hassle later, having to rely on numbers to be a threat to you. The crafting system is also unnecessary and just slow gameplay down.\n\nBeing an Alien game, I also expected the titular Xeno to be in a good chunk of the game but unfortunately, it isn't. The Alien is in basically 50% of the game, which in my opinion simply isn't enough since the entire premise of the game, and fun of it, is being hunted by a smart and deadly predator. \n\nNow, the game isn't all bad, it's actually quite good whenever you are being chased by the Xeno. It's AI has stood the test of time, and that creates a really tense and creepy experience, where it really feels like you're being hunted by a smart and observant apex predator. The way the AI works also creates really natural and cinematic cenarios since the creature doesn't actually teleport anywhere and has to use the vent system to move around, which increases tensions and makes the sections where they are present just that much cooler.\n\nOverall I think it's a good game, I would recommend it while on sale since I don't think it's worth the full price.\n\nTL;DR: Too little Alien and too much Isolation. 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1692660036, "timestamp_updated": 1692660291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508111536502838135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144746385": {"recommendationid": "144746385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198950018249", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1692651101}, "language": "english", "review": "OH NO! the power is out! fix power. now cut that panel with the torch and pull down a lever! oh no that didnt work. find an alternative route (if there happens to be an alien spawned in a random matter that is clearly your fault)", "timestamp_created": 1692651177, "timestamp_updated": 1692651177, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144742642": {"recommendationid": "144742642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001992515", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1119, "last_played": 1614987631}, "language": "english", "review": "Super atmospheric, it can get really tense when the alien is knocking about!  \nWish I could experience this one again.\nSlightly too long in my opinion, minor issue.", "timestamp_created": 1692649798, "timestamp_updated": 1692649798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144729290": {"recommendationid": "144729290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990187550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1532, "last_played": 1692636501}, "language": "english", "review": "Tis good arisen.", "timestamp_created": 1692637398, "timestamp_updated": 1692637398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144714170": {"recommendationid": "144714170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181953247", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1881, "last_played": 1692634673}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoy a sci-fi horror game and I love the classic alien movie and the other chapters.

Instead of being marketing tools to promote a movie or TV show, developers lucky enough to get an IP could elaborate on the source material. This was the case with great titles like The Batman Arkham games, Ghostbusters: The Video Game, South Park: The Stick of Truth, and then came Creative Assembly\u2019s survival horror masterwork, Alien Isolation. \n\nOriginally playing it on PS4 back in 2014, I was stunned by the game\u2019s presentation and story. I appreciate the game harkening to the 1979 original as opposed to the more action-packed Aliens 2. The less is more approach elevates the horror. The gameplay is solid, with some dated mapping and menus, but the use of analog terminals and save ports is utter genius. It feels so much like the period of the original film!\n\nReplaying this on the PC has shown that this game has aged really well, still impressing visually and gameplay wise to this day. It\u2019s a port that is well-optimized to the PC with little to no stutter and really smooth gameplay. Since I have a lot of experience with this title, I played this on the nightmare difficulty and holy shiiiiii is it terrifying! Like, I\u2019ve never been so antsy playing a game since playing the nightmare sequences in Max Payne. With equal measure of terror, I also found the difficulty incredibly trying.

Alien Isolation is a direct sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 scifi horror classic, \"Alien,\" a movie and franchise that I'm sure needs no introduction. Right when you start the game the opening credits displays the 70s 20th Century Fox intro in low analog quality. When SEGA's logo shows up, it's just quiet. No iconic SEGA chimes, the only sound being the hum of an old analog display. Just from that, you can already tell things are not what they seem.\n\nAlien Isolation takes place 15 years after the events of the original 1979 film. You play as Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda Ripley, an engineer working in the sector her mom disappeared hoping to find answers to what happened to the Nostromo when she's approached by a Wayland-Yutani executive saying they have a possible lead. The Nostromo's flight recorder was recovered on a decommissioned spaceport space station, and you agree to go with them in the hopes it would provide closure. Something's wrong though, as the station's coming apart, the docking clamp is inoperable, and communications are not going through. Ripley and co don spacesuits to make an EVA jump to the station, but an explosion cause you to become separated. Now you're trapped on a space station full of crazed looters, worker androids malfunctioning, and of course...you know...\n\nWhich brings me to the star of the game: The Xenomorph. The bulk of the game's development went into the Xenomorph's AI. The Xenomorph does it's own thing, exploring it's new unfamiliar surroundings, but if it so much as catches a hint of you it'll begin investigating. Not just that, but the Xenomorph can be anywhere at anytime. When you think you're safe it could be crawling through the ducts. You could be in a fight with human enemies then the Xenomorph suddenly decides to drop in and join the party. You could be hiding in a locker but made an error and made your hiding spot too obvious and the Xenomorph finds you. You need to study the Xenomorph's unpredictable nature, and adapt to any situation it shows up. Just remember: Nowhere is safe, and if it hears you, you're already dead. Your weapons do not harm it. All you can do is move silently and hide.\n\nNot limited to just the intro, the entire game's art direction follows the same from the movie. Analog lofi computers everywhere, analog data cards, text based command line operating systems on all the computers buttons and knobs everywhere, wood and beige architecture and electronics just like the late 70s. Creative Assembly wanted to make the game as immersive and faithful as possible as if you were directly in the movie.\n\nIn terms of technicality, this game is a programming marvel. Feral ported the game not just to macOS (even updating it to 64 bit so Apple Silicon Macs can play it) but they also ported it to Linux and made damn sure it runs beautifully on Steam Deck. Hell they recently ported it to iOS and Android too, because we need to suffer more.\n\nBuy the game. This game is heavily underrated and is the best horror game ever made, but just be warned: it is really really scary. The extreme intelligence of the Xenomorph combined with the lack of a checkpoint system requiring manual saves at save stations adds to the fear as if you die you have to go back to your last save...still trapped with that thing...that could be anywhere...", "timestamp_created": 1692502198, "timestamp_updated": 1692502227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144601807": {"recommendationid": "144601807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286058400", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1819, "last_played": 1692500153}, "language": "english", "review": "was lucky enough to buy this game on sale but it would have been well worth paying full price for!

While Crystal Assembly recommends Hard, Nightmare is the way to go in my opinion.\n[*]The horror/stealth game-play is a breath of fresh air for the franchise, but you're not completely defenceless, unless you're playing Nightmare... then you're almost defenceless.\n[*]There's an overwhelming sense of dread. Alien: Isolation practically oozes suspense.\n[*]With a lengthy campaign, five difficulty settings, collectables, achievements, DLC, and Survivor mode, Alien: Isolation definitely has plenty of meat on its bones.\n[*]If you like a bit of punishment and the thrill of being scared, have at it. It's a great game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]The game is somewhat linear, despite the shallow attempts to make it otherwise, and there's a decent amount of backtracking.\n[*]Arguably, you can have too much of a good thing. Missions 10 - 14 should have been condensed considerably, with the Working Joes having much less time to... 'shine' (?).\n[*]While the console versions of this game are very stable, there's some stability issues with the PC version (surprise, surprise).\n[*]If patience is not one of your virtues or you get frustrated easily, I would give the game a miss.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Nitpick:[/b] A logic statement allowing players to skip what are essentially interactive cut-scenes after their first play-through would have been nice (happens twice and goes on for about 5 - 10 minutes).\n\n[b]Score:[/b]  I love it. 8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1692061233, "timestamp_updated": 1692062499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144215727": {"recommendationid": "144215727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374749560", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1274, "last_played": 1692053081}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Para el tiempo que tiene lo he pasado incre\u00edble.

The unpredictable Alien AI kept me on my toes, knowing I could be in life threatening danger at any moment. The attention to detail was almost perfect \u2013 it felt like I was living in the movie. The androids, while a bit irritating, furthered the sense of dread, as I never knew who or what could be in the next room.\n\nOverall, Alien Isolation is an incredible game that perfectly captures the essence of the Alien franchise. Even with some minor issues such as backtracking and occasional android irritation, the overall experience of survival and genuine sense of accomplishment from making it through the game is well worth it.

As someone who thought I had nerves of steel (turns out it's more like aluminium foil), this game provided me with a level of tension that can only be compared to.. well.. I haven't come across anything else this intense yet. \n\nFrom the moment you step onto the abandoned space station, your heart will getting quite the workout! The attention to detail in recreating the eerie atmosphere of the Alien universe is astounding. Dark corridors, flickering lights, and an impending sense of doom that's almost cozy once you get used to it. \n\nThe game's protagonist, Amanda Ripley, deserves a round of applause for her dedication to finding her missing mother. She's the kind of person who, instead of running away at the first sign of danger, decides to take a leisurely stroll through alien-infested hallways just to appreciate the architecture. Talk about commitment to sightseeing! And don't even get me started on her ability to find hidey-holes that would make a ninja jealous. If hiding in lockers was an Olympic sport, Amanda would be the undisputed champion. \n\nLet's not forget the star of the show\u2014the xenomorph itself. It's like playing hide-and-seek with a cat who's had a few too many espressos. One moment it's right behind you, and the next it's vanished into thin air, leaving you questioning if you're dealing with an alien or a magical Houdini cat. And when it does catch up, well, let's just say I've hit notes during those chase scenes that Mariah Carey would envy. \n\nIn conclusion, Alien: Isolation is a masterpiece that brings terror and amusement in equal measures. It's like going on a roller coaster that simultaneously makes you scream and laugh uncontrollably.

I'll give a link to my Youtube play-through at the end if anyone wants to see a sample of gameplay before buying, but be warned: it's an older series of mine and at the time I had a less-than-beefy PC, so the frame rate of the videos is kind of crap and doesn't really do the game justice. But with that out the way...\n\nAlien Isolation is an excellent sci-fi horror game based on the Alien movie franchise, but be warned: I'd very much describe this game as Type 2 fun. Be ready for one heck of a challenge; one thing the devs excelled at here was the AI of the alien itself. It's unpredictable and it adapts to your play style, so you can never be complacent and think you've got its behaviour completely figured out. As a result, one thing I found is that whenever the alien's around, this game can get stressful very quickly. Hence why I'd call it Type 2 fun, because whilst you're playing you might be freaking out, but afterwards you'll feel triumph at beating the game.\n\nThat point aside, Alien Isolation is essentially a sequel to the original Alien movie. You take on the role of Amanda Ripley, daughter of original protagonist Ellen Ripley. After learning that the flight recorder of the Nostromo ship has been recovered, you travel to the Sevastopol space station to take a look - but when you arrive, it's pretty clear that the shizz has already hit the fan there, and law and order have broken down. There's an alien on the loose, there are scattered gangs of surviving humans (some hostile), and furthermore the station's android workforce seems to have gone rogue and is acting under someone else's instructions. Thrust into this, you have to survive and gradually unravel the mystery.\n\nFans of the original Alien movie will likely love the attention to detail in this game. The general aesthetic is spot on and evocative of the grimy, analog sci-fi design from the original movie, lending the game a fantastic degree of creepy, unsettling atmosphere. In terms of gameplay, there's a huge emphasis on stealth; you'll spend a lot of time sneaking about, hiding in lockers, under desks or in any other nook or cranny you can find, and there are a mix of weapons and craft-able objects (from medkits to a variety of improvised weapons and stealth-aiding equipment). But don't get cocky - there may be weapons but you'll only have limited ammo, and those arms are only really useful for dealing with lesser enemies; the alien itself is far too tough to be harmed by a measly shotgun or revolver!\n\nThe sound design is also great, and the voice actors did a good job of conveying the stress and anxiety of the situation on Sevastopol station. Taken altogether, the devs did do a tremendous job with this game.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't have one or two minor gripes, though. One source of stress for me was the odd level where save points can be quite dispersed (EG the San Cristobal medical facility area). In essence, there is a manual save system in Alien Isolation; you have to find registration points scattered throughout each level and use these to save your progress. However, you need to take care - enemies can still get you whilst you're saving! And given that certain levels can be a bit sparse when it comes to these save points, it can be very stressful and frustrating if you make one little slip-up, the alien kills you, and then you end up having to redo a load of stuff you previously did successfully.\n\nAlso (and this may sound a little contradictory after I praised this earlier) but the alien's AI can itself become a bit of an issue on the odd occasion. What I mean is, the alien's appearances aren't scripted for the most part; it's just always present, wandering about looking for you. The benefit of this is that it lends a huge amount of unpredictability to its behaviour, which really boosts the tension and the scares. The downside to this is that you might find yourself in the odd situation where your progress slows to a crawl, because the alien decides it's going to hang around for ages in that one room you need to enter, forcing you to hide in a locker for 10 minutes until it's AI eventually decides to direct it elsewhere.\n\nBut as I said, on the whole those are minor gripes. I'd still say I look back at playing this game and am glad that I did so, for it's a phenomenal game and a very worthy successor to the original Alien movie. I definitely recommend it, just make sure you have a beefy PC that can really do it justice!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWjESuz3PUA&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpMipXRVgWyM9VRiA-XdMx4L", "timestamp_created": 1691421174, "timestamp_updated": 1691421174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143587042": {"recommendationid": "143587042", "author": {"steamid": "76561199068187618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1692739277}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

I remember playing this game when I was in high school, Scared shitless! More Iconic 80s films should get games just like Alien did, Predator: Hunting Grounds was disappointing but Robocop: Rogue City looks awesome.\nThe way Isolation recreates the atmosphere and look near identical to the original film was 10/10 alone. Getting a game inbetween the first and second movies is a smart move, but making Ellen's daughter the protagonist was even smarter. Expanding on a character we never see in person in the movies, to giving her a full story about her encounter with the Xenomorph race. The story is very direct and simple, which I love, no crazy twist or plot holes. It is a shame the sequel for this game was a mobile game however. The mobile game was decent for mobile, but a waste and disappointment compared to this. Although unlikely, a true sequel to this game would be amazing. The A.I. of the Alien is incredible, especially for its time of release, not just a dumb animal charging at you, but a intelligent being capable of learning your tactics and finding ways around you. Favourite detail of the Alien for me is the Flamethrower, once you spray it a few times, merely pulling it out without using it is enough to force the Alien to stop and act cautious with you, still slowly approaching but careful to not get burnt.\nThe music is perfect for the horror the game captures, playing at the right moments and exact times of pressure or intensity. The DLC was honestly perfect! Playing as Ellen herself in this was enough for me, being in the movie itself was a good choice of DLC.\nI only hope we get more games like this with Predator or other famous films.\nAlien: Isolation is 10/10, I wouldn't see it any other way with the Perfect Organism.", "timestamp_created": 1691324386, "timestamp_updated": 1691324386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143515629": {"recommendationid": "143515629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065341278", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1691398542}, "language": "english", "review": "yes", "timestamp_created": 1691321483, "timestamp_updated": 1691321483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143511706": {"recommendationid": "143511706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321959426", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1691224285}, "language": "english", "review": "Still holds up excellently nearly 10 years later.

The attention to detail in everything is out of this world (especially for a game from 2014).  The games story is amazing.\n\nYou have 3 types of enemies: The alien, humans and androids. All of them require different ways of dealing with.\nYou have a large arsenal of crafter weapons which you find blueprints and resources to build them, you have weapons like a revolver, shotgun and a flamethrower. \nThe alien has only 2 3 scripted places. EVERYTHING ELSE IS AI. Meaning that the Alien might come in the room, search and leave. Or it might circle the room 5 times and then decide to check under the table, in the locker or in the vent that you may be hiding. Theres great youtube videos explaining how the Alien is an AI with a behaviour tree which studies your gamestyle and adapts to it and evolves with time. Difficulty level also affects the behaviour. When i played on easy the alien searched really quick and then canceled the search in seconds and left. On Hard it felt like every 2 steps i take the Alien senses my presence from far far away and is extremely stubborn in his search for me. \n\nUsing your weapons on the Alien won't kill it, it will only make it more furious than before. And when humans shoot at you it will only result in the Alien coming and killing you first and them second (usually). The androids dodge every frontal attack after you have pissed them off.

It's a game that knows how to play with its atmosphere, creating a very immersive experience. It has great mechanics, story, and atmosphere. \n\nThe only thing you need to prepare for is patience. \n\n[h1]First Impressions[/h1]\nMy first impressions of Alien Isolation were during launch day: 9 years ago. I remember this game being penned as an actual survival horror game using the Alien franchise -- at a time when the last Alien game was the disastrous Aliens: Colonial Marines. \n\n9 years after launch, I finally gave this game a shot and was delighted to know that those initial impressions rang true. \n\nAlien Isolation from boot up wants to capture the same feeling of the first Alien movie. On boot up, the game greets you with an old 20th Century Fox logo reminiscent of the Alien movie. Then, the game reveals that its story is set over a decade after the Nostromo incident surrounding a crew looking to discover what happened. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAlien Isolation's gameplay is a standard survival horror and stealth. You spend plenty of time hiding and sneaking your way through levels so you don't alert your enemies. Your character, Amanda Ripley, is pretty underpowered with very little means of fighting back. Most of your arsenal consists of distractions and healing. The weapons you do receive have limited uses, and it feels tense whenever you have to use them. \n\nThe game rewards you for taking stealthier approaches while severely punishing you for being careless and noisy. It can be brutal whenever you decide to run through the levels. The enemies will slap you back to the previous save spot. \n\nThis gameplay requires a lot of patience. There are times when you'll have to stay in hiding for minutes at a time because there's an Instakill machine lurking around the corner. It forces you to slow down, breathe, and weigh your options and routes. \n\nThe tension is pretty fun.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIn Alien Isolation, you play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Nostromo's own Ellen Ripley, looking to discover what happened to her mother in the Nostromo Incident from the first Alien movie. \n\nThe story begins with Ripley learning that the Nostromo's flight recorder has been located. As a result, you and a crew travel to Sevastopol Station to retrieve the recorder-- only to find out that the station isn't doing too great. It turns out that retrieving a foreign object from space is uhh... a little dangerous. \n\nNow you have to survive Sevastopol, discover the root of its problems, and find out about the Nostromo's flight recorder while trying not to be melted by an Alien. \n\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\nThis game nails its tense atmosphere. The game's environmental and sound design really shine. It knows when to kill all the noise as it guides you through a quiet corridor for your anxieties to grow -- and then releases the floodgates with levels that activate your fight or flight response. \n\nThe quiet levels could be just you and the echoes of your footsteps, the ominous rumbling of the events, and the hum of the ship. \n\nThe loud levels can be a sensory overload. These levels could include smoke filling a room, alarms BLARING through the speakers, your radar beeping incessantly, and more, all at the same time. \n\nIt is effective, and it is a blast. \n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nAlien Isolation is a great addition to any library.

Sin entrar en detalles y volviendo a la cuesti\u00f3n, si buscas un juego donde la tensi\u00f3n y el miedo se apoderen de ti, pregunta en la remiser\u00eda de enfrente, quiz\u00e1s te orienten en tu b\u00fasqueda porque ac\u00e1 no hay nada que se ajuste a dicha descripci\u00f3n \u00bf[b]O s\u00ed[/b]? No, claro que no.\n\n     En primer lugar, hablemos de la trama.

The lighting is incredible, the environments look right out of the movie. Overall, one of the best looking games ever made, and on top of that it's performant.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly stealth gameplay. Against the alien, you have a type of stealth where staying still makes you die, while at the same time punishing making noise. Against the robots, you have more freedom to make noise and sprint around and even kill them. The game mixes the two together sometimes. \n\nOverall, if you like stealth games that give you varied enemies and some gadgets to mess around with, you'll like this.

Cat and mouse. Never fully understanding what it is that is hunting you.\n\nAs a big fan of the first film, I was fairly hesitant to try out Isolation. Truth is, the idea of it was scary as this was heavily painted as a horror title. I myself, am not a big horror video game fan, as I feel developers set out to scare at every corner with jump scares, scripted moments, over the top violence or gore, and linear experiences. \n\nWell, as of 2023 I got back into the Alien mood and decided it was time to give the game a chance. \n\nWhat has unfolded in front of me is an experience I will not soon forget. \n\nThis has fed the craving for more Alien 1979 in more ways than I can name. \n\nFirst and foremost, the setting and atmosphere is INCREDIBLE, if you are even remotely a fan of the \"setting\" of Alien 1979 then this is a love letter to you. The fact that this game came out in the early 2010's is mind blowing as the game plays and looks amazing. \n\nI mentioned the \"analog\" scifi aesthetic from the film, well its here, in all of its glory. Buttons, levers, hacking tools, old school dos computers. Its all here. Tangible scifi. The gun shoots bullets, not lasers. Majority of your \"tools\" are crafted from basic items and look the part. It all fits.\n\nMy concern of this game being a \"forced\" horror title, meaning filled to the brim with shocking moments quickly dissipated. \n\nDont get me wrong, this game, well, its scary. Very scary at times.\n\nBut this game is scary in a way that YOU have control. If you are killed, its your fault. Its not scripted or forced on you. \n\nNo, its circumstances, its dependent on your play style. And there are different way to accomplish your goals. \n\nYou can go in loud and proud and have to deal with the consequences. Or you can be as silent as a mouse and you will be treated with a stealth experience. Regardless, space is scary, Alien is scary, scary is scary, but its genuinely FUN, and thats the problem I feel with horror titles, is they just tend to be so stressful that they feel like an emotional chore to play. Not here, or at the least, not the entire time.\n\nI have had some laugh out loud moments (circumstantial), nail biting moments, and some overall an experience that will stay with me a long long time. \n\nSo in a brief conclusion for someone who is playing this for the first time in 2023. If you are looking for an atmospheric game in the style of Ridley Scotts masterpiece, there is no game that does it better. \n\nDare i say it, \n\nThis is, at least for me, one of the best \"games based off of a movie\" ever made. \n\nWhat ever you do, dont play the DLC before you play the base game, it can be difficult especially if you are not familiar with how the game works. Play the campaign first, it gently gets you used to its control scheme.\n\nSo in conclusion, \n\nIn space... no one can hear you scream...\n\nHowever... my neighbors definitely have...\n\n*motion tracker beep*", "timestamp_created": 1689806226, "timestamp_updated": 1689806650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142431203": {"recommendationid": "142431203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965853328", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1689803203}, "language": "english", "review": "good shit", "timestamp_created": 1689803340, "timestamp_updated": 1689803340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142431131": {"recommendationid": "142431131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070523937", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1689799900}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the standout horror games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1689803228, "timestamp_updated": 1689803228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142430739": {"recommendationid": "142430739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273750708", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 489, "last_played": 1672518406}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games of all time!\nAlso scary AF when played in VR.

The only things that I could find even remotely negative is that some things (like selecting/playing terminal recordings) aren't the most clear at first, and some sections just feel drug on (particularly spacesuit sections and all of mission 12). It did not detract from my enjoyment of the game at all though, since after the first couple missions, you can figure out what to do more often than not, and the drug on sections only begin to happen closer to the end of the story.  The game has a wonderful way of luring you to your objective while also building up the alien. \n\nThe alien is incredibly intelligent and aggressive, making it an extremely formidable foe. The other survivors are a nice enemy that pose less and less of a threat as you become more competent and your arsenal increases. Working joes are sturdy and annoying, but they can only melee you, can be outpaced easily, and can be stunned (with some exceptions). The only thing I don't like about them is how they just overpopulate some of the later sections, and from about the halfway point on you see very few hostile survivors. \n\nSomething I find rather refreshing is that the story is simple and explains itself very clearly as the game unfolds. Motivation is relatively simple and most questions and curiosities explain themselves through the main story or through terminals you're likely to read anyway. Too many games in the horror genre, modern ones especially, try to go for super complicated and convoluted mess of lore that's very missable and just somewhat confusing if you don't play the other games in that particular franchise, and causes players to become more fixated on lore than actual horror. Alien Isolation lets the story take a backseat so they can focus on a \"show, don't tell\" style of horror, unlike modern horror games tendency to tell you about a lot of the horrors that happened in their game.\n\nOverall, I think this game is great for those that want terrifying gameplay, and one of the smartest AI enemies in gaming history, and aren't hoping for a convoluted story.", "timestamp_created": 1689779669, "timestamp_updated": 1689779669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142407593": {"recommendationid": "142407593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052406100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1899, "last_played": 1693008804}, "language": "english", "review": "Spooky af", "timestamp_created": 1689776049, "timestamp_updated": 1689776049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142401772": {"recommendationid": "142401772", "author": {"steamid": "76561199095622472", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1690127078}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly i think the androids made me piss myself more than the alien", "timestamp_created": 1689769389, "timestamp_updated": 1689769389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142400521": {"recommendationid": "142400521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973178390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5300, "last_played": 1657232645}, "language": "english", "review": "Actually i'm not into survival horror games, this one is an exception.

But the game quickly became overshadowed by tedium. Until you get the flamethrower: it is basically a tutorial. Giving you the basics of the game. Then you will get access to a bunch of (mostly) useless craftables. The tedium comes a lot from intentionally slowing down movements/interactions. When you access a computer it's like you're going through a full Skyrim NPC sitting down animation. When the xenomorph is programmed to \"always keep you in fear\": it kills the fear. I started worrying more about when the last save point was than the xenomorph itself. Don't make the game slower, or the interactions more clunky. Allow me to type from under the desk at a penalty. Make the AI less of a suicidal psychopath and more of a menacer. The beauty of Alien the film was that there was less of the xenomorph. It was something that you had some anticipation about.

Even having played the game once before when it came out replaying it this many years later solidifies it as a treasure in gaming history. \n\nThe treasure does have its faults though... Just about anything you interact with (computers, circuit breakers, locking mechanisms, etc) requires a 2-4 second long warm-up animation that you cannot cancel out of which, for a game where an invincible insta-kill alien has a non-zero chance of randomly deciding to grace you with its presence, takes only one instance to turn an otherwise mesmerizing experience into hair-pullingly frustrating. Not sure about you but if an alien dropped from the ceiling ten paces away from me I wouldn't be caught waiting for my computer to completely finish booting up and pre-open steam before I dropped to my knees and crawled under the nearest table.\n\nThat said there is something uniquely satisfying sneaking around the few human enemies in the game, and should you make a mistake, get spotted, and they open fire on you, the feeling of silently slinking away into a hideaway while the director AI-controlled alien \"OH YEAH\"s onto the scene there's few things more hilarious and terrifying at the same time. Coupled with the alien's ability to learn throughout the course of the campaign means you never truly feel safe hiding from it. There's hiding places galore in many scenes, but there's only so many times the alien will hear something sprint into a room down the hall and find nothing behind the tables before it starts checking lockers or under desks. Once or twice it glanced into a room I was in, smirked like nothing was there, left the area through a nearby ceiling vent (successfully baiting me out of my hiding spot) before dropping back through the ceiling a few paces behind. \n\nIt is an A-grade game weather you're a fan of the Alien franchise or never heard of them.

I don't know what will happens now, seems now is survival against humans and malfunction androids)[/spoiler].\n\nThe game is slow and very linear. You may explore other rooms, but why? You'll only find a death end, maybe resources, maybe you can find a shorter path, and if you are have luck the Alien may down from the vent to hunt you, now what? You need to wait to return.\n\nAfter you first encounter the Alien, he will stick with you almost entirely, running and screaming in the vents, even if you travel between stations or use elevators. Any weapon is pointless, the game is about seek, stealth and hide (but not quite, sometimes the Alien just found you), you'll never run, you only crouch during the entire game. If you use the flamethrower, the Alien will become very aggressive, and you will never move forward. The Alien is not scary as other people say, only the first couple of levels, after that it'll be usual.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll finish the game, I bought the game years ago in a sale because I'm a fan, however this game is not for me. I can't find the game good but neither bad.\n\nEDIT: Still playing, four levels of boredom, playing 16 now. The only weapon you will use the most is the flamethrower against the Alien. Every mission from the start is to reboot or power something on the ship from one end to the other, when you finish something, something else needs power or gets damaged somehow, and you need to go to the other end of the ship to turn it on, then repeat throughout the game.\n\nEDIT2: I force me to finish the game, if it is not now, I'll never finish it. Overall the game is very bad, bland, annoy, and fu-ck-ing long, you crawl all the game, to move from one locket to another with wait in between until the Alien go away, and you always need to power something during the entire game, on top of that the game is slow for everything, to walk, to run or when you do some action like open something.\n\nI know there are people that like the game, but this game is not for me.

More so the gameplay loop and few visual issues and glitches that pop up from time to time.\n\nVisually, A:I looks fantastic. The entire 1980's \"future-past\" tech that is featured in the first Alien film is very well recreated here, in every detail possible. Seas of CRT monitors, big chunky buttons and switches, even the iconic \"double LCD\" calculator watch that Ripley wears. The soundscape is incredible, the whole package really immerses the player. You actually feel like your on a big orbital station (the Sevastopol) and the various ships that you also go onboard throughout the game.\n\nHowever there are a couple of minor texture issues in the game here and there, sometimes your weapon model \"hangs\" midair, you can see the Xenomorph T-Pose just before it leaves the rendered map when it enters a vent, and the flamethrower keeps playing the sloshing sound when you reload it until you cycle to another weapon and aim.\n\nThe music does set the mood and tone when it plays, although there were a couple times it was either very quiet, to the point where it wasn't adding much, to booming loud, so much so I couldn't hear the log entry I had just found.\n\nSpeaking about logs, there are some collectibles to find and achievements to get. In the main campaign at least, all the DLCs are \"survivor mode challenge maps\" which idc too much about, and a couple maps to recreate the Alien movie in the game. If your a mega-fan, get them, if not, your not missing much if you've seen the movie.\n\nNow, A:I isn't a \"Run and Gun\" game, and it's one that was anticipated for a long time, since as near as I know, most of not all the other games, official and otherwise, are more focused on the sequel Alien films, which are more about gunning the Xenos down and less about terrified survival. The game does give the player weapons, though I didn't use them too often save the Flamethrower and the Bolt Gun, relying far more on craftables like Molotovs.\n\n So, how well does A:I pull the survival aspect off?\n\nBy enemy type, it depends. First off, you have Human Survivors. The problem is, with how dark the environments can get sometimes, unless if it's *really* obvious, you can't tell right away if a person is just going to passively stand there and repeat a few voice lines (or hide from you), or will start yelling at you and shooting, ofc usually attracting the Xenomorph in the process. When I was in the Mall section of the Solomon Habitation Tower about halfway through the game, a hostile human I didn't initially see started to shoot at me. I responded, and they ducked behind cover. Then someone *very close to, if not basically in the same spot* broke cover and started to run. I shot again and they went down, then the game over screen pops up with \"Don't Kill Civilians!\".\n\nOh yeah, like I knew that in the dark Mall while being shot at in the same spot by someone else.\n\nLater on trying to sneak past a Xenomorph and a group of Humans, one spotted me and shotgunned me in the face. (We will come back to AI prioritization in a moment)\n\nThen there are the Androids. The Seegson Working Joes really remind me of the Autons from the classic Dr. Who era. And they are just as unnerving, though usually easy to evade. Taking them out can be a bit of a hassle, especially the Industrial Models encountered later. But the Joes are usually not too big a worry. They won't do anything about a Xenomorph and vice-versa though.\n\nOfc, the Xenomorph, which thankfully the writers made sure none of the characters or logs refer to it by that name, is a big part of the title. About 80% of the game you are hunted by one, with very few \"safe\" areas in between.\n\nThe Xenomorph is your biggest problem. It will actively stalk the player throughout the campaign, checking rooms, setting up ambushes, and even checking vents and lockers. The devs tried to make the Xeno \"learn\" and adapt to the player, use too many noisemakers and it will eventually realize they are pointless distractions. Hide in locker after locker and it will eventually figure out where you are. Use your motion tracker too close, and it will hear it. You have to play smart, and when the loop works, it's exhilarating fun. \n\nWhen it falls apart a bit, it becomes a tedious annoyance. For reference I played on the \"Normal\" difficulty, which I do with every game I play for the 1st time.\n\nThe Xenomorph's AI has a director function that will tell it not *precisely* where the player is, but the general area. The idea behind this is to keep the player on their toes, and unless a very well placed distraction is pulled off, the Xeno will usually always be nearby. Once it climbs into a vent it's movement is sped up, but it can only travel in straight lines and exit vents. The Xeno can, and often will, \"camp\" in one room or a set of rooms and hallways, constantly looking for the player. The idea being that you have to time your moment well, otherwise your dead. Very infrequently you can get away with some damage taken as the Xeno barrels past you.\n\nWhere it breaks down is when the Xeno keeps cycling between the same 2, 3 or 4 spots in a couple rooms over and over and over, and it feels less natural. I get that it's supposed to be \"The Perfect Hunter\", but having it rarely go to another area within the level giving the player a small window before returning to the old spot again would have been a better execution imho. Sometimes, the player will get killed just by sheer dumb luck.\n\nWhere this section of the game works is by making the player *feel* like they have a chance, no matter how slim. But when the level layout doesn't give many hiding spaces, and the save points are at opposite ends of the level, it feels like the player is being forced to engage the Xeno, which you don't want to do unless as a last resort. One area towards the end of the game really became tedious as after a few deaths, I realized then it was pure chance if the Xeno would pop out of the vent in the next room as soon as I primed the generator or not.\n\nAnother issue with the Xeno's AI is it will focus the player something fierce. In the Hospital it kept coming back to the same area I was hiding in a locker, even going so far as to \"smell\" the locker I was in. The entire time this happened there were a bunch of Humans, a couple of which had just shot at the Xeno, that were running about the Hospital screaming and crying their heads off.\n\nNope. Gotta focus the player.\n\nSo, long story short, come for the story and the visuals, possibly the collectibles as well. And prepare for when the gameplay loop doesn't execute as well as the devs were hoping it would do 24/7.", "timestamp_created": 1688934113, "timestamp_updated": 1688934113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141708821": {"recommendationid": "141708821", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972061953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1689369757}, "language": "english", "review": "Very effective at being frightening, stressful, surprising.

Set in the universe of the famous Alien film series, it successfully captures the atmosphere and style of the first film. Players can expect stunning graphics, excellent sound design, and challenging gameplay that immerses them in its world from beginning to end.\n\nOne of the game's biggest strengths is its emphasis on a realistic approach to survival. As Amanda Ripley, the daughter of the renowned protagonist Ellen Ripley from the first Alien film, you'll be trying to escape the space station Sevastopol, which is infested by the dangerous Xenomorph. You must hide, utilize the environment, and employ cunning to evade the deadly threat that lurks everywhere. This constant tension and fear of encountering the alien is particularly impactful and creates a truly terrifying experience.\n\nThe game boasts fantastic visuals with meticulously crafted environmental details that create an authentic atmosphere of the space station. The dark and claustrophobic environments contribute to a sense of uncertainty and tension. The sound design is also excellent, with the sounds of the alien's approaching footsteps and chilling hisses that truly get under your skin. Alien: Isolation truly engulfs players in its world and delivers an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe gameplay is demanding yet satisfying. You must make quick and tactical decisions to survive. The use of various tools and gadgets, such as crafting items, is crucial to your chances of success. You must not only avoid the alien but also contend with other dangers, including corrupt humans and androids.

I set my DSR smoothness to 15% because my native resolution is 1440p. \nI tried the modifications that increase shadow and reflection resolutions but they cause additional flickering and shimmering for me.

I had to find a keycard in a medical facility patrolled by the alien. The medical area is a large circle with locked doors. Unlocking a door opens up another section, and opening another locked door there gives you another large circle with lots of rooms to hide in.\n\nUnfortunately the alien has been programmed to stay near you, or when it wonders too far, return to you. The alien never patrols the areas you leave as you expand its and your access. It's always near. So the whole process is slow while you sneak room to room with your scanner out always looking over your shoulder.\n\nConsidering it walked by me multiple times as I hid and it never found anyone in the medical facility (until scripted later), doing circles over and over, you'd think it would give up its search and let me explore freely. It is a game but it kinda broke the immersion for the sake of \"now you will just sneak around for hours till you unlock that last door\".\n\nThe area before the medical facility had patrolling androids to avoid by sneaking around. That was more fun to deal with. More like the gameplay of Dishonored and Hitman that I enjoy. I expect the game has more of all of the above but I've stopped playing. A more forgiving save system may have saved it rather than the specific save points.\n\nI'm a fan of the movies. In the movies people hide and stay still.

I had played it sometime soon after its release on console, and have just finished a replay of it on PC. This time around I decided to play it on the hardest difficulty to get a new experience. Overall, I feel that Alien: Isolation is a very good game in most regards. In particular, I want to praise the awesome, atmospheric score as well as the faithful, interesting design of the Sevastopol map. The early encounters with the Xenomorphs are extremely tense, and even the space station's \"Working Joes\" serve as challenging foes at times. The challenge of avoiding, hiding from, or distracting these unkillable alien foes serve as some extremely compelling horror. However, as others have commented, the game is a bit too long for its own good. My run this time around took roughly 19 hours to complete, and especially in the last quarter the game becomes extremely tedious. The addition of the flamethrower/molotovs allow for a way to fight back against the Xenomorphs, however they also allow for certain scripted segments of the game which can be challenging to bypass depending on how you've managed your resources. There was a segment in the last two hours of the game which took me roughly 10-15 retries to complete successfully due to some scripted Xenomorph spawns and limited resources. Furthermore, the pacing of the game (especially in its latter half) could be much improved; as it stands the latter half of the game feels like a series of constant climaxes as opposed to a grand payoff (and the ending as a whole is pretty unsatisfying). Despite these complaints, Alien: Isolation remains a success in creating a tense horror experience within a familiar, yet fleshed out sci-fi setting. I would definitely recommend the game for those who haven't engaged with it.", "timestamp_created": 1688441756, "timestamp_updated": 1688441756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141258677": {"recommendationid": "141258677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044097667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 861, "last_played": 1665878090}, "language": "english", "review": "Uno de los juegos mas desesperantes que he jugado, en el buen sentido.

I know nothing about the Alien series and haven't watched a single movie but I think Amanda was supposed to die from the beginning... Which for me personally it feels like a slap to the face to sit thru 20 hours of surviving and especially dying just to have what I feel was the only good character (not saying much since she was the protagonist) just get shit on by an alien. Beautiful game, cut scenes were rlly low-fps for some reason. The Alien itself and all other NPCs were done very well. Except for the human/companion NPCs they did not act real at all. In the campaign mode, I feel like it almost gave you a little too much freedom, or could've made the paths a little more obvious. Because at times I found myself looking up gameplay videos just to find where to go next, and eventually I found that the motion detector guides you to where you need to go in the ladder-half of the

It's way too hard even on medium. In the end, it literally requires a walktrough to finish it, and returning to save stations after every action. Which is absurd. I edit my review to \"Recommend\", only because it's probably very good in its genre and as a story, it's good. And for masochists that replay games until they know each map by heart.  But I personally do not like it. \n\nI don't like the save stations (sure, it adds intensity, but replaying stuff is really BORING). I did not like the different combinations when you open smt and the absurd cutscenes after each door/hatch open. I didn't not like the alien AI that can get into frenzy mode and chase you EVERYWHERE (I flamed it twice on Mission 10 and it got crazy, finding me literally everywhere and appearing every 15 secs and not being afraid from the flame. I had to decrease to Easy to leave the area. It returned to normal behavior in a level or two). I disliked the way in the first 14 missions, you literally have no time to stop and take a screenshot or just enjoy the station, because you're always running. Not to mention the absurd waiting time and confirmation dialogue when you save. I think devs should realise that Medium level should not feel like waste of hours of your life. Sure, some people like to replay a game until they can finish it in 4 hours but not everyone. For normal people, it should feel like their time is well spent. I didn't feel so. Sure, the game is very immersive and scary and pretty at times. But making it super hard, missing any explanation on the weapons, having to replay scripted events, and re-listen/re-read the logs, that's BORING. It's a waste of time. Also, the game is too long. In the end I just finished it in one day (on Medium), because I didn't want to have to play it anymore.\n\nSo yeah, I recommend that people start on Normal/Medium difficulty and if they get super annoyed, just move it to Easy.

big fan of the Alien franchise, I remembered this game existed and picked it up on a sale but honestly it's worth the full price. This is everything you could want in a video game set in the Alien universe, scary as shit, impressive graphics that hold up to today still, this doesn't play like just any other survival horror 'run for your fucking life every time anything bad turns up and hide' kind of game all the way through, it still gives you an array of weapons and tools which each in their own regard are useful and will mean the difference between life and death in all sorts of scenarios and moments, adds a really nice level of depth to the core game play itself, overall just a beautifully made game that I remember at the time really raised the bar for the genre and for good reason. \n\nSo, unless you don't like horror games, get it, you will not regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1687159396, "timestamp_updated":

For the first half it is a really solid game that keeps you on your toes and tense. However, after Mission 10 the game takes a huge dip for about 3 missions before returning back to what made the first half great.\n\nWhat I liked most about Alien: Isolation was the presentation. The creators 100% nailed the retro-futuristic look of the original film with blocky computers and very little tech. I also enjoyed the star of the game, the Alien. Never before has a enemy in a horror game made me so tense, as the Alien is invincible and kills the character instantly. However, after playing for a while, the AI is easily exploitable and you have enough tools to deal with it.\n\nSome things that brought the experience down for me was the lack of said Alien. This was mostly my fault though since I did a full playthrough on Normal and a quick speedrun on Hard for the last achievement so I didn't have to play the whole game again. If you want to get the full experience, play on Hard. The game could also have been cut just a little bit due to 3 missions being redundant in the end.\n\nOverall, Alien: Isolation is a terrifying game that has it's highs and lows but will leave you shaking in your seat.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1687033022, "timestamp_updated": 1687033022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140224973": {"recommendationid": "140224973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056447618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6637, "last_played": 1686927958}, "language": "english", "review": "Alien Isolation is  a sci fi survival horror game that uses the xenomorph from the first alien film as the main enemy along with some hostile human enemies and androids to add a bit of variety. It also makes the first films events  a prequel to to this games story where they are kind of linked together. You play as Amanda Ripley  who is Ellen Ripleys non cannon daughter who is in a crew that belongs to a ship called The Torrens. If you are a fan or the Alien film esp the first one and like the sci fi survival horror genre I recommend this game to you. You should play it.\n\nStory: 9/10\nWithout spoiling anything they did a good job with using the first movie's story as inspiration and as a prequel to this game. It flows on nicely into this games story. There is a lot of nice twists and turns that keep the story interesting as well. The characters and dialogue is well done except for maybe like the pilot and captain of the Torrens cause they don't really do or say much story wise. The main character that you play as is interesting. Unfortunately though the characters from the Alien movie aren't in this game. They are only referenced through audio recordings. There is a separate campaign DLC you can get where you play as Ripley or one of her crew members on the Nostromo. This game is quite long as well with 19 Chapters. Some chapters are long and others are short overall it is a good length and plenty of  stuff happens in them.\n\nSound/Music: 9/10\nThe sound choices are really good and realistic almost like the movie.  They fit really well for a survival horror game. You hear a lot of different noises in this game and some are some are good indicators towards danger like heavy ground footsteps or ventilation shaft footsteps. The alien sounds are very good and keep you  aware and cautious in game. Weapons and item sounds are good and pretty loud and iconic in this game as well. As for music there is what you would expect for a survival horror  game. Some suspenseful tracks and some eerie tracks but mostly a lot of silence which helps for the scary and dark atmosphere of the game.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe gameplay is pretty good and balanced for a survival horror game. You have  to scavenge and look around for weapons and ammo.  You don't get a lot of guns and they are not super powerful either. The two best guns are the iconic flamethrower to scare the alien with, and a new gun called the bolt gun which is useful against the andoids. in this game and the alien can't be killed by them only scared away temporarily which is a nice change I like. It helps keep the fear factor going and the suspense cause you never know when he will come back.  There is also blueprints  for items like medkits, molotovs and smoke bombs  you can craft  lying around as well as crafting components. They are all useful.  You get the motion tracker in  this game as well which is nice and it works pretty well for detecting  enemies that are not too far away from you. The enemy A.I is pretty smart and challenging esp the Alien so long as you don't put the the difficulty to low. Recommended is hard difficulty on first playthrough by the developers for the best experience. It makes you think how to approach each situation and encounter . A lot of the time you will have to hide and be patient esp early on. There is a lot more emphasis on the survival aspect in this game esp on the harder difficulties. You can't  be wasteful with ammo or crafting items cause you don't get a huge amount and it is really easy to die in this game. Also this game uses save stations instead of manual save system where you can save anywhere which I think is probably better for this game as it adds another layer of difficulty and suspense. They are not too far apart and can be used  multiple times as well. \n\nOverall Score: 9/10\nThis game is a must get if you like and have the patience for this type of survival horror game and you are a fan of the first Alien film. It is not a action shooter horror game like Dead Space or Resident Evil but if you give it time and have patience it will grow on you.", "timestamp_created": 1687018425, "timestamp_updated": 1687018425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140199882": {"recommendationid": "140199882", "author": {"steamid": "76561199509905076", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1686637395}, "language": "english", "review": "Alien got me good......", "timestamp_created": 1686984336, "timestamp_updated": 1686984336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503105580806732178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140185647": {"recommendationid": "140185647", "author": {"steamid": "76561199514374978", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 189, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1700622842}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best stealth games I ever played.

The Xenomorph runs away when you use molotovs and the flamethrower, and since the game pretty much keeps you stocked up even in Hard difficulty (if you avoid most encounters and conserve your ammo), the last few missions feel more like a nuisance to play through, rather than being scary.\n\nStill, I have to hand it to the developers, the game still looks great after all these years and offers a great horror experience for the most part. Plus, Sevastopol is interesting to explore and I like the fact that you slowly begin to find out how the alien got aboard the station and get to see where it all started as well.\n\nAlso, fuck those Working Joe Synth bastards.

An artist even revealed they had a in-house rule that if an item/prop couldn't have been made/done in 1979 then they weren't allowed to use it in the game. the art design sets alien: isolation apart from the likes of a system shock or dead space by creating a legitimately convincing sci-fi world with machines and environments that are unique and still realistic-looking, rather than overtly futuristic. for a a game that is almost ten years old as of the time of writing this review (june 2023), i was definitely impressed with the visuals, especially as I am playing a lot of games from this era right about now as i work through my steam backlog. \n\nthe characters, however, are all mostly forgettable. we never really spend enough time for deaths to ever mean anything significant, and a lot of the added lore/plot/narrative that is delivered through \"logs\" are uninspired, at least to me, which is sad because i normally eat these kinds of things up with no complaints in almost any circumstance. the alien itself has extremely good AI and the gameplay is fun, even as someone who normally hates playing through horror games. it can be repetitive but luckily doesn't drag on for too long and the biggest complaint was hiding for way too long just waiting for an opening to leave. \n\noverall, this is a amazing game that delivered on a lot of aspects and really impressed me. i can only imagine how people felt who played this for the first time in 2014 or shortly thereafter as this probably was a mind-blowing experience. while full price for this was lowered to $40 from $50 in july 2016, you can routinely find this for 80% off during sales, making it only $8 for what is maybe the best horror game of all time. definitely in my top-3, probably currently tied for #1 with outlast. i'm definitely looking forward to getting to other horror games in the future, as i think outlast and now this game have kind of made them all a bit more accessible to me. while you wouldn't be overpaying if you bought at full price, i definitely recommend waiting for a sale and grabbing this.", "timestamp_created": 1685991390, "timestamp_updated": 1685991390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485011786222457886", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139603200": {"recommendationid": "139603200", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984737096", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1686058516}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!", "timestamp_created": 1685989665, "timestamp_updated": 1699899301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139598657": {"recommendationid": "139598657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080045733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 547, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 934, "last_played": 1685982230}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Te digo una cosa;

There are a few glitches in sound sometimes, though.\n-Decent Story: The story it nothing to write home about, it's just basic fair..but it's not complete garbage and doesn't detract from the game.\n-Gameplay: Cool mix of puzzles/minigames (super easy though), stealth/some FPS combat and exploration.\n-Length: If you want a long game, this one is pretty long (however, I'll mention this again in negatives)\n-Cool Gadgets: Lots of cool weapons and gadgets, although you might find yourself barely using most of them.\n\nCons:\n-Alien AI: The AI is touted as top notch, however the Alien AI is quite garbage. The alien will teleport around the map and sometimes get you in the middle of events and stuff where you have no chance to get away. Since the game uses a checkpoint style save system, you will end up repeating a lot of sections, which is annoying, and wears on you over time. If you're going for 100%,then this will REALLY be a problem. You'll be forced to play on Easy and quickly reload saves when you undoubtedly get caught by the alien.\n-Repetitive: The game is awesome, but over time some will get bored and just want the game to end.\n-Length: This goes with the above, but due to the length of the game you will eventually start to get bored and tired with the game. This might be a problem for some, and not a problem for others.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, and it is definitely one of the best Aliens games ever created. Even in 2023, I really enjoyed this play through and feel like it's a must play for any Aliens fans (and maybe even some that are not fans of the Aliens franchise).\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1685372037, "timestamp_updated": 1685372037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139213681": {"recommendationid": "139213681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041016946", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 785, "last_played": 1504029454}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]An Unforgettable Nightmare in the Alien franchise.[/h1]\n\nAs a fan of the horror genre and a lover of intense gaming experiences, \"Alien: Isolation\" exceeded my expectations in delivering a truly terrifying and heart-pounding encounter with the iconic Xenomorph. Developed by Creative Assembly, this survival horror game immersed me in the haunting atmosphere of the Alien franchise.\n\nPros: [list]\n[*]The fear factor in \"Alien: Isolation\" is unparalleled, especially when crawling through the vents while the Xenomorph hunts you. The constant tension and fear of being discovered kept me on the edge of my seat.\n\n[*]The first encounter with the Xenomorph is a spine-chilling moment that leaves a lasting impact. The creature's design and behaviour are incredibly menacing and realistic, enhancing the fear factor.\n\n[*]The game's atmospheric and detailed environments, set aboard a derelict space station, effectively conveyed a sense of isolation and dread, contributing to the overall immersion.\n\n[*]The sound design deserves praise, with creaking metal, distant screams, and the Xenomorph's eerie screeches creating an unsettling ambience.\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]While the fear factor is a major strength, it can also be overwhelming for some players, making it difficult to progress or even causing excessive stress.\n\n[*]The game's save system, relying solely on manual save points, can be frustrating, as a single mistake or death can result in significant progress loss.\n\n[*]The game's pacing can feel slow at times, with lengthy periods of exploration and stealth game play, which may not suit players seeking constant action.\n[/list]\n\nIn conclusion, \"Alien: Isolation\" offers a terrifying and unforgettable horror experience, successfully capturing the fear of being pursued by the Xenomorph. Despite some potential drawbacks, the game's unparalleled fear factor, atmospheric environments, and immersive sound design make it a must-play for fans of the genre, providing an intense and memorable journey.", "timestamp_created": 1685368783, "timestamp_updated": 1685368818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139210670": {"recommendationid": "139210670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017597894", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7170, "last_played": 1689375061}, "language": "english", "review": "most immersive locker-hiding simulator i have ever played.

With very high quality graphics for its time and a well structured Gameplay, Alien Isolation really manages to put the player into an adventure of pure terror and anxiety, making it as alive as in the famous Movies. Engaging storyline and spectacular animations, good weapon combos and remarkable AI in many cases, maybe a bit repetitive with the missions as you go along but that's very little if we compare the rest.\n\nPros:\n-Really well done graphics, animations and voice acting for the time of release of this game\n-Interesting gameplay, especially with the use of the Controller; excellent combos with weapons and good freedom of movement\n-Compelling and interesting story, manages to immerse you in the plot\n- Remarkable AI, quite smart and fast in many cases\n-100% perfect terror effect, with the use of background sounds and cinematic effects\n\nAgainst:\n-It has, not always, a certain amount of bugs or defects. It could happen that, for those who do not have a powerful computer, sudden exits or slowness in the FPS occur\n-Good storyline, but repetitive with unnecessarily boring missions and moments\n-AI remarkable, but not perfect. Often slow to understand certain things or simply interact with them\n\nConclusions:\nFor those looking for a scary but exciting adventure, which can enhance the surprise effect at any time and with the addition of many references to the original Films, Alien Isolation is definitely for you\n\nRating: 7,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1685227000, "timestamp_updated": 1685227000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139113016": {"recommendationid": "139113016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016801416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 496, "last_played": 1685559340}, "language": "english", "review": "What a game!

The gameplay is shallow, it's mostly walking around flipping switches and hiding in lockers. The last half of the game was especially repetitive. \n-Realizing that sprint was disabled for the space walks where you literally spend 10 minutes just holding W slowly walking along a path was when I knew I had to leave a negative review.\n-When you hide in a locker go get a snack because it takes 30+ seconds for the alien to leave. It's immersive and scary peaking out the locker slats waiting for safety the first time - very boring the 50th time.\n-The ending may be the single most anticlimactic disappointing ending of any game I've ever played. \n\nIf you want to kill aliens on a spaceship go play Dead Space.

I played it first and platinum it on PS4 initially, few years later I thought I would buy the game again on PC as it was on sale and I quite enjoy the game as a fan of the Alien franchise. However.... upon revisiting the game on PC I remembered how much of a chore and bore the first few hours of the game was, it's not until you get the flamethrower that things starts to get a little more interesting and the story starts to move forward. I was only able to power through the first few hours and finish the game because I'm a Alien fan and a completionist, but to those that aren't ..... well...\n\nI can see why a lot of people that aren't Alien fans drop the game after the first few hours, i myself included dropped the game on PC until almost a year later i decided to get back into the game to 100% it. This game is one of those games that doesn't offer much replay value in terms of the main campaign, its really hard to recommend this game to anyone that doesn't have much or any interest in the Alien franchise as to them its just a glorified hide and seek game. To those that are fond of the franchise and are looking to explore and dive deep into the lore of the Alien universe I'd say this is the best game to experience it. \n\nI love that the game offers and expands the lore but also able to exist in its own bubble outside of the movies but the gameplay and story is kinda stale in the beginning. Other than that, this game is a tough sell to anyone that has no interest in the Alien Universe and why IGN gave this game a 5.9 / 10 rating.

It just makes it annoying. Setting the difficulty up a level does not make the alien's AI more advanced, it just makes it more persistent and bullsh*tty. Instead of a scary, cunning monster, you can tell it's a coded entity that sometimes makes the gameplay unnecessarily more effortful. Raising the difficulty makes you notice the flaws of the Alien creature more.\n\nBeat it on hard, wanting a challenge, but all I felt was I learned how to navigate around a glitchy, predictable AI.\n\nAlso, I get how, in theory, making you start at your last save station makes you more careful and effortful on how you play, since all your progress up to that point will be lost when you die, but it ended up being more of a nuisance.

I really wanted a challenge and thought the nightmare mode would be the scariest, however that isn't really the case. I regret playing the game on nightmare mode (as a FIRST playthrough) cause I think it kinda ruined the game for me. I didn't know anything about the map, the enemies, the allies, the missions, the lore so I died a *lot* of times. I feel like this really killed the horror for me and it was more sneaking, playing immersive and smart and camping under a table for 5 minutes straight every 2 minutes. In the end the nightmare mode isnt very scary (cause you die a lot of times and you get used to the enemies killing you and chasing you) but very hard. Items/ ammo/ weapons/ loot is EXTREMELY limited, I think it is save to say out of probably 150 item boxes and dead bodies I looted I only found 5x something. I didn't use any ammo nor Items until mission 10 and even then I barely had anything before. I do have to say I liked this aspect of the nightmare mode as I prefer harder challenges anyways and it really pushed me to my limits to play smart rather to run everyone and everything down with the shotgun. I just disliked how if you killed humans with pistols that you couldnt loot their ammo/ weapon (cause on nightmare you almost never find anything with looting), this is the only part I disliked and it really made little sense to me.\nI really liked that on nightmare mode the motion sensor is broken (to a certain degree), which does add some thrill to it. The motion sensor sadly wasn't 100% accurate always, I did die a few times to enemies not being picked up by the motion sensor even tho they were walking (The motion sensor does not pick up enemies which stand still which is good and fair). I don't know if thats part of the nightmare mode, I would have to replay the game on a different difficulty to see the difference.\nAlso one time the alien was in the vents behind me and when I opened the door it suddenly spawned in front of me, which very clearly was just a bug. Annoying if you go for a 0 deaths playthrough (which obviously I didn't). However this only happened once and besides that the aliens movement was very accurate and good. I really liked that after some time the alien even started sniffing around and found you hiding behind tables and chairs, this is something the aliens started doing to me at the end of the game so the alien intelligence really adapts to your movement. \nI thought not having a map would be my biggest struggle as I have terrible sense of direction however the missions were in most instances very clear were you have to go and despite my orientation struggle I usually found my way through the building rather quickly. I really liked that you don't have a map on nightmare mode, it is more realistic and more thrilling.\nThere were some sound bugs after dying which were easily fixable (pulling out your weapon usually helped) except for one time where the audio logs were super slowed and deep voices and they wouldnt stop after finishing the audio log. I had to die to make it stop. Besides that bugs were usually minor and definetely nothing which breaks the game. I did find it funny that there is one passcode which you cannot use in the game cause the developers most likely forgot about it. I was stressing out when I finally get to use it .. well never :D \n\nDespite wishing I didn't do my first playthrough ever on the hardest gamemode, I do have to say this is my mistake and from an objective perspective I really enjoyed the game. I love immersive, stealth games in general and enjoyed having to go around enemies, sneak past them to get some clues or items/ objectives needed. I just wish that the horror aspect wasn't killed for me from dying so often but as being said this is my fault.\nI would say the game is rather survival than horror (on nightmare mode at least) which is also fine by me. The atmosphere was always amazing and I LOVED the music/ soundtracks being played. I do think 3x the music was misplaced (\"chasing\" music when nothing and no one was chasing me) but besides that I really loved the instrumental approach this game offers. \nThe map layout is HUGE and you can clearly tell how much planning, structuring and design was put into this game. I loved the entire station and think it was beautifully designed. I loved going past the big windows being able to see outside (especially when events happened outside). I also loved the outer space walks towards the end of the game, the atmosphere was unbelievable good and I felt very euphoric being outside in the space. I also enjoyed the inverted mission where you play as Marlow on another planet.\n\nIn the end I can definetely say this is one of the best games I played and I will play it on another difficulty to go for my 50 achievements (I got 45 achievements out of 48 possible in the first run, which did make me a little proud :)). I am sure I will enjoy it just like I did the first time and maybe this time on an easier difficulty + knowing the enemies, their movement and the map the horror atmosphere might come back for me. I will also play the DLCs to see what they have to offer so this review is solely on my first playthrough from the main story.\nI can 100% recommend this game, and I cannot wait for another alien/ space game which comes close to this game from an artistic approach (scenes, layout, music). \n", "timestamp_created": 1684501341, "timestamp_updated": 1684501341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421077728271484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138533833": {"recommendationid": "138533833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009143905", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1684973090}, "language": "english", "review": "So immersive", "timestamp_created": 1684484427, "timestamp_updated": 1684484427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138531624": {"recommendationid": "138531624", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208022550", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1684729140}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much fun ...

Every little detail, from the curved crt monitors to the clean hexagonal corridors has been recreated to such a high degree that it feels like being in the movie. The way the game is focused more on escaping and hiding from dangers rather than confronting them adds to your feeling of vulnerability, and really takes this game from solely being a tense space game to a full on horror one. \n\nI attempted to play it years ago, but stopped after meeting the Xenomorph face to face for the first time. It just had such a ridiculous presence and force on the player that the dread became palpable. It was only recently I managed to push through and complete the game, and thank god I did. From the moment you meet the Alien right through to the end of the game, you NEVER feel safe. And by the end, you'll feel somewhat proud of the fact that you managed to make it through to the end. It's a weird sense of achievement that I assume only a seriously good horror game can provide. \n\nIf you're even remotely interested in the Alien franchise you HAVE to pick this up.

While other products in the franchise mainly focus on the trigger-happy feeling of overpowering xenomorphs and killing them as a team (fun to some, boring to others), this game provides the intended feeling you should get when coming face-to-face with a xenomorph; pure terror. The alien is quite possibly the best unstoppable killer in any video game, everything from its model design down to the ingenious AI dead-set on finding you could not be more perfect.\n\nThe aesthetic is ripped beautifully from the first movie in 1979, essentially 'how we thought space stations would look like back then', meaning there are plenty of claustrophobically tight spaces that make you feel truly trapped on Sevastopol, as well as outdated technology doomed to fail at almost every turn during your escape. And then of course, the occasional banging in the vents above, a reminder of the looming threat that will pursue you no matter how much you're armed. You're by yourself, but not alone.\n\nThere have been, and still will be many games that try to replicate the sense of despair Alien: Isolation brings to newcomers on their first playthrough, but I believe there will truly be no other game quite like it.

I am in LOVE with the entire retro feeling and worldbuilding. My main issues are with the plot which gets sort of convoluted after SO many anti-climaxes, and all the bits that feel like self-indulgent padding. \n\n I loved how much this ISN'T like any sequel to Alien. It is NOT a FPS and there is no way to kill the alien or really do anything to it. Even though we see it frequently (it is burned into my retinas) the fear of it doesn't really go away-- even though I played it only on medium mode. Honestly while I was playing and encountered the alien, it was a huge exercise in patience and deep breaths. Its movement always gave me little jolts since I still am not capable of recognizing when it spots me. Interestingly, I got the feeling several times that it was toying with me (e.g lockers) which was very cool. I understand why some people feel that the xenomorph was \"cheating\" and zoned in on you, but it makes me feel like I (as the player) am being hunted.  I was scared it could look through the screen. I would like to clarify that the xeno does NOT feel clairvoyant, but it absolutely does feel tethered to you. Personally, I am fine with that because of the whole \"if a tree falls in the forest did it really fall\" deal-- I WANT TO WITNESS IT! However, some of the best parts for visceral horror were hearing the alien slaughter other people, so more of that could increase the realism. I also like the different kill animations and the lack of pre-programmed jumpscares. \n\nSurprisingly there were only a few rough patches where I kept dying and had to keep trying, but the frustration did not come from my deaths-- it came from the convoluted plot. The majority of the playing is performing pain-in-the-ass errands that are realistic on a space station that is falling apart, but nonetheless a little frustrating. Especially when my allies are alive and completely useless (pretty sure Samuels was the most helpful).  I really liked having to do errands UNDER PRESSURE (like M18 when priming the release mechanisms or M6/M5) because all the meaningless levers and buttons added to the tension. Sometimes you could see Ripley's hands shaking, and that made me realize why all the stupid tasks in dangerous situations (e.g M18) were so effective at making me feel frustrated, angry and scared all at the same time. I find that when I'm scared, everything is in the way. Opening a door, dialing a phone, etc. all suddenly become incredibly cumbersome with stiff fingers and sweaty palms, which makes the stress even more poignant. It's especially fitting for a game that criticizes bureaucracy and corporate ladders. BUT. I think this was overused in moments where I was not scared at ALL. So pretty much from M10-M14 where it's all dealing with working joes. I genuinely got bored dealing with the tasks AND the synthetics, and I pulled through for the sake of exploring the beautiful map, regardless of the plot padding. \n \nWhich brings me to the working joes. Oh boy. They were just annoying, not scary. That was one of the only bits for me that was NOT true to the movie. The humans (especially Seegson Security) were also fairly annoying because I often found myself thinking \"why are they still alive with all that noise??\". However, I did see a couple of humans get wrecked by the alien without my interference (I only used one noisemaker!). I strongly believe that there should NOT have been that many humans clomping around, just enough to remind the player that people lived at Sevastopol and tug at their heartstrings. I don't really remember where it was but I found a dude cowering by some lockers that really did that, along with the scattered crayon boxes. On the other hand, with the joes it was pretty much hack and slash, which was a nice change of pace sometimes but it just got annoying over time. \n\nSomething I liked was that my choices don't really impact the plot, which freed me up so much to enjoy the game. I also liked the manual save mechanism (maybe a hot take?). It's like that aforementioned \"cumbersome fear\". It feels sort of like dropping the keys when you're about to get into the car to escape, or when you're sloppily reloading bullets while the enemy gets closer. I've heard some people say that it \"broke immersion\" which I don't disagree with, but I think it's fine here. They added more tension while saving-- not just because Ripley could die, but also because you could lose all your progress. So that double layered fear was nice. \n\nOn the other hand, I felt that a lot of emotional tension was missing here (especially against the movie). Of course, I do not think the game should be a carbon copy of the movie, but I think the emotional dimension here would have been gorgeous. Especially because there was potential for it and it went unused. Fundamentally, the OG movie is about real people. Here, I got very few moments of visceral horror from Ripley, especially on all the human bodies. There were just a remark or two, but as a player it is very easy to get used to the dead people and not treat them how a person in that situation really would. I think the game could have used a few more of those reminders to snap players out of their distance (re more of the Alien killing people and hearing the screaming from afar). I also would have liked to see more from the human NPCs and the allies! Especially the allies. For a lot of the tasks I was thinking about how they could be done by two people, and how that could raise the stakes even more. Thinking back to Alien, it's very hard to think of parts where the fate of Ellen Ripley was only dependent on her. A lot of the fear comes from the uncertainty of teamwork (e.g Lambert and Parker when Lambert does not move). Even with Jonesy, there's always someone to watch out for which helps add another layer of emotional tension-- the whole \"will she or won't she?\" bit when Ellen goes back for Jones is awesome. I mean, I found one of the most intense parts of the game to be M5/M6 in San Cristobal, because of Taylor weighing on my mind. I would have loved some character development too! I got flashes of personality, but they were mostly archetypal or just scratching at the surface. Alien (1979) does a great job of subtle but organic character arcs, which I found sort of missing. Especially because there is so much! All the voice logs, the journals, are RICH for reactions from Ripley and all the idiots in her headset. Also I HATE all their lip-synching but that's a 0.000001 concern. \n\nI also think another issue is time pressure. The only time pressure I experienced was with Samuels and on the Anesidora, and there were only consequences on the Anesidora. I assume in-game this is less than 24 hrs of hell for Ripley, but I do not feel that pressure at ALLLLL (note: I am a slow player). I also hated the whole derelict cutscene, bogged down the game for me. \n\nSO TOTAL RATING!!\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nMap: 10/10 \nSoundtrack: 10/10\nAntagonists: 9.5/10 (it is called ALIEN not 50% alien 40% working joes 10% humans)\nPlot: 4/10 \nCharacters: 6/10\n\nOverall amazing game!", "timestamp_created": 1682222142, "timestamp_updated": 1682223058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137144955": {"recommendationid": "137144955", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977685077", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1682211926}, "language": "english", "review": "On my third play-through to take on Nightmare mode.

It is like playing hide and seek with a homicidal maniac who has a degree in hiding.\n\nThe game's graphics are stunning, with the space station looking so realistic you can almost smell the recycled air. The sound design is also top-notch, with every creak and groan making you jump like a cat on a hot tin roof.\n\nThis is a thrilling experience that will have you on the edge of your seat, as long as you do not fall off from fear.

I would also recommend watching  below 2 Movies before proceeding or thinking of purchasing the title as it will add thrilling and elements to it.\n\n1. Alien (directed by Ridley Scott)\n2. Aliens- Directors Cut (directed by James Cameron) \n\nFurther to the note, The game is set 15 years after the events of the original Alien film, and follows Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she investigates the disappearance of her mother. The gameplay revolves around stealth, exploration, and resource management, as players must avoid the alien and other enemies while completing objectives.\n\nOne of the strengths of Alien: Isolation is its atmosphere. Boy o Man you gotta love it, The game does an excellent job of capturing the claustrophobic and tense feel of the original Alien film. The sound design and graphics are top-notch, and the use of lighting and shadows creates an eerie and unsettling environment.\n\nThe AI of the alien is also a standout feature. It's unpredictable and relentless, and players must constantly be on their guard to avoid detection. This creates a sense of tension and fear that is rare in modern horror games. Players must use the environment to their advantage, hiding behind objects, crawling through vents, and using distractions to avoid the alien's gaze. The game's mechanics are designed to create tension and fear, with players never quite sure when the alien will strike.\n\nThe story is engaging, and the voice acting is top-notch. The game also includes several nods to the original Alien film, which fans of the series will appreciate.\n\nWell i must say its a perfect Horror Genre to ever exist \"G.O.A.T\". But according to my analysis there is One potential downside of the game. There are additional modes and DLC some players may find the overall package a bit thin. Guess it wont matter unless you're a true Alien fan.   \n\nOverall, Alien: Isolation is an excellent survival horror game that captures the spirit of the original Alien film. The atmosphere, AI, and story are all top-notch, and the game is a must-play for fans of the horror genre.\n\nA true justice to the Alien Franchise and Ellen Ripley. \n\nAbsolutely Nerve touching. \n\n~", "timestamp_created": 1680967363, "timestamp_updated": 1680967837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136308691": {"recommendationid": "136308691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226608464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2104, "last_played": 1680916190}, "language": "english", "review": "scariest game i've ever played, also a gem for fans of the alien franchise", "timestamp_created": 1680916247, "timestamp_updated": 1680916247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136305359": {"recommendationid": "136305359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291542581", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1684101493}, "language": "english", "review": "bad game", "timestamp_created": 1680911322, "timestamp_updated": 1681240537, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474452555179595947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136289551": {"recommendationid": "136289551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052476800", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1377, "last_played": 1685032939}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere of first movie Alien.

I first played this game in 2014, but I quit an hour in because I was too damn scared.\n\nI came back in 2023 with the following conditions:\n- Play with a controller so I can sit further back from the screen\n- Resist the impulse to explore: Go directly to every objective to reduce exposure to the alien\n- Play on easy difficulty\n- Bay's Alien Overhaul: This mod changes the Xenomorph's behavior to be less predictable and tedious, making it more \"realistic\" instead of feeling like he's only stalking YOU (A bit of a difficulty increase, but reduces tedium)\n\nI was finally able to man up and beat the game, and it was a great experience. If you love Alien and/or survival horror, this game won't disappoint you.\n\nSeeing and interacting with the Xenomorph, possibly the coolest creature ever seen in a movie, is the highlight of the game. The space station aesthetics and atmosphere capture the first Alien movie perfectly and really draw you in. The visuals in this game are fantastic.\n\nThe sound design is incredible. Hearing the alien crawl around in the vents above your head while you're navigating the station will make your hair stand up on end. Headphones are recommended.\n\nThe sheer terror of the first several hours eventually gives way to a manageable dread at a certain point in the game (which I won't spoil). I wish I had played on Normal or even Hard, but I didn't know in advance how much the terror and difficulty would drop.\n\nMy only gripes with the game:\n- Some objective points were hard to locate, causing me to have to search a room 2-3 times to find things. This can be irritating because you might get killed while you're looking for something that's in plain view. One time I had to look up how to exit a room, only for the walkthrough to tell me that there was a ladder 5 feet in front of my face. I always have this problem in games, though, so it might be a \"me\" thing.\n- Item switching doesn't slow or pause time. A few of my deaths (i.e. checkpoint restarts) could have been avoided if I had an extra 1-2 seconds to pull out a specific item that I needed.\n- Crafting some items takes 6+ components, which requires double the number of clicks (arrow buttons + X button). I may have missed something, but that's way too many clicks to craft a molotov cocktail.\n- The main character's voice acting was mediocre.\n\nThis game is almost a decade old and frequently goes on deep discount.

Creative Assembly learned from the horror games genre revival, and made the xenomorph scary again. Not only is the creature genuinely terrifying, but the attention to detail that was put into the scenario is simply phenomenal. In the movie, the spaceship was an integral character of the story, with its claustrophobic corridors and gritty aesthetics that made you feel trapped and unconfortable. That same retro vibe is perfectly translated to the game. The tight spaces, the technology, the gadgets, the sounds, textures and flikering lights, the sensation of being observed and followed, cornered like a rat, not knowing when the creature will come from to end you. In terms of atmosphere, tension, level design and enemy AI, this is hands down the best Alien game that could have existed. \nIf I had to point some defect, though, I'd say that the main story is a bit too long, and the missions start to feel repetitive after some hours. Too many errands going from A to B to C, turning generators and talking to key people that give you yet another task. It feels dragging after a while, which is a pity in a game that hits the spot in every other department.

While the game did an admirable job of recreating the claustrophobic, terror-filled environment of the Nostromo, I found myself constantly frustrated by the fact that I, Starscream, could easily defeat a single Xenomorph.\n\nIn the game, the Xenomorph is presented as an unstoppable killing machine, a relentless predator that is all but invincible. But as a Transformer, I possess the strength, speed, and weaponry necessary to take on even the most fearsome opponents. It was hard to suspend my disbelief and get fully invested in the experience when I knew that, in real life, I could easily dispatch one of these creatures with ease.\n\nThat being said, I can't deny that Alien: Isolation is a masterclass in survival horror. The tension is thick, the atmosphere is oppressive, and the Xenomorph's AI is truly impressive. Even as someone who feels confident in their ability to defeat one of these creatures, I found myself on the edge of my seat, heart pounding, as I tried to evade the creature's deadly grasp.\n\nOverall, while I can't say that Alien: Isolation fully transported me into its world, I can still appreciate the game's craftsmanship and its ability to keep me on the edge of my seat. If you're a fan of survival horror, or just looking for a game that will keep you up at night, Alien: Isolation is definitely worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1679554010, "timestamp_updated": 1679554010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773739874362945557", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135197866": {"recommendationid": "135197866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293156059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 105618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105476, "last_played": 1697411774}, "language": "english", "review": "this is one of the videogames of all time", "timestamp_created": 1679531339, "timestamp_updated": 1679531339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135186747": {"recommendationid": "135186747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128239228", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 795, "last_played": 1662849588}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun cat and mouse horror game but the game play loop get's kinda dull after about 10 hours of it. get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1679519632, "timestamp_updated": 1679519632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506633520126342773", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135186612": {"recommendationid": "135186612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213548545", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1164, "last_played": 1589236927}, "language": "english", "review": "Yep", "timestamp_created": 1679519547, "timestamp_updated": 1679519547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47486037015914917", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135181176": {"recommendationid": "135181176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319763112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 413, "last_played": 1679361479}, "language": "english", "review": "no sex with alien", "timestamp_created": 1679515562, "timestamp_updated": 1679515562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469163805246353149", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135180093": {"recommendationid": "135180093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008476376", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 1381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1381, "last_played": 1679437574}, "language": "english", "review": "While horror games and survival elements aren't usually my thing, I was surprised by how fresh and interesting Alien: Isolation still felt in 2023. Despite the graphics and visual effects showing their age, the game looks better than most current \"AAA\" projects. I watched the original movie a long time ago and I still got chills from hearing the musical theme. Plus, the game had plenty of scary moments to keep me on edge.\n\nThe animations and interactions with objects and the environment were done in a way that constantly kept me on my toes. Coming from modern games with casual stealth, I was impressed by how smart the AI was here. Humans and androids could be fooled, but the Alien was relentless and would quickly catch me if I made a wrong move. As a result, I spent most of the time hiding and sneaking, frantically checking the motion sensor.\n\nHowever, by the second half of the game, this gameplay loop started to become tiresome. At times, the alien seemed to be camping outside my hiding spot, forcing me to crawl back and forth for extended periods. This was especially frustrating when I had run out of resources and had to scavenge every cabinet in the area. While I'm not a fan of looting in games, crafting was essential as each device had a specific use.\n\nThere were a few drawbacks to the game:\n-Backtracking with enemy respawns felt unnecessary and tedious. Just added more hiding hustle.\n-Some doors were closed and special equipment was required, but after receiving the item I mostly couldn't remember how many doors to open are left. Some locations just got forgotten. \n-Towards the end of the game, the game throws in shooting mechanics only to take them away shortly after. This rollercoaster ride of gameplay could be jarring for some players. \n-The most common task was to turn on the generator, which became repetitive and tedious in the final stages.\n\nOverall, while the ending of the game felt drawn out I still found Alien: Isolation to be a very cool product.", "timestamp_created": 1679514542, "timestamp_updated": 1679514542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135169302": {"recommendationid": "135169302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262310033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1869, "last_played": 1679503904}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc7e", "timestamp_created": 1679503973, "timestamp_updated": 1679503973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135166255": {"recommendationid": "135166255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839356869", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1693346785}, "language": "english", "review": "great game although it scares me so much I have to stop playing now and then and nothing scares me (not even pennywise or the alien movies).", "timestamp_created": 1679500580, "timestamp_updated": 1679500580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135162604": {"recommendationid": "135162604", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996160620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 616, "last_played": 1679575105}, "language": "english", "review": "great game for any alien fan, best game weve had from the franchise.\nreally hope they make a sequel just like this", "timestamp_created": 1679496677, "timestamp_updated": 1679496677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135143194": {"recommendationid": "135143194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246007284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1391, "last_played": 1679477947}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and hours of fun and horror.", "timestamp_created": 1679464229, "timestamp_updated": 1679464229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135137850": {"recommendationid": "135137850", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970514284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 421, "last_played": 1434083799}, "language": "english", "review": "Cmon, this is an amazing actualization; continuing to expand the universe those movies began.

It is worse on harder difficulties, so I would recommend lowering the difficulty to match the feeling you expect from the alien universe. I hope that if the game is ever remastered or a new release is done, that the interactions with the alien are more scripted or they are more rare but maybe have bigger consequences on how you need to play when encountering it.

This game is set in the same universe as the famous Alien franchise, and it does a great job of capturing the atmosphere and tension of the films.\n\nFirst and foremost, let's talk about the graphics. The developers did an excellent job of creating a believable and immersive world that feels like it belongs in the Alien universe. The lighting and sound design are top-notch, and the attention to detail is impressive. You can almost feel the cold metal of the space station and the dampness of the air vents. \n\nNow, let's move on to the gameplay. Alien: Isolation is a true survival horror game that emphasizes stealth and evasion over combat. The main antagonist, the xenomorph, is a formidable foe that will hunt you down relentlessly throughout the game. You must use all of your wits and resources to evade it, distract it, or hide from it. The game's pacing is slow and deliberate, with moments of tension and terror interspersed throughout. It's not a game for those who prefer fast-paced action or a constant stream of jump scares. But for those who appreciate a well-crafted horror experience, Alien: Isolation is a gem.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the story. The game takes place 15 years after the events of the original Alien film and follows Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley, as she searches for clues about her mother's disappearance.

Mission 5 is the first one where you really face the alien. And yes, it took me over 5 years to grow some balls and go back to actually play and finishing the game in hard difficulty.\n\nI've played so many survival horrors. And I think this is the only one that actually made feel so anxious... it's the adrenaline of knowing you cannot beat that thing and you have to hide, but at the same time, knowing you have to keep moving, and hiding in a locker forever is useless. This game is a masterpiece but definitely not for everyone.\n\nPersonally, I don't like this kind of survival. I also tried Outlast in the past and hated it... but I love the movie so much that I had to really experience this. The way the game has been developed showing a huge respect and love for the first movie is unbelievable. From the design of the space station and ships, to the OST, and all those interactions with the machines and computers you need to do, that look so much like everything in the movie (Including the sound they emit, the keys... really resembling that opening scene of the film).\n\nThe game has probably the best sound that I've ever hear in a video game.\n\nAnd for a game that it's going to be a decade old, it looks amazing. It's really fun how this game can run at fixed 144fps while looking amazing, and some new games run like absolute garbage and look worse. I'm no expert regarding programming... but seriously, the reflections in this game are simply perfect with zero impact in the performance (RTX I'm looking at you), all the effects, the lighting and shadows, the fire, the fog on the floor in some areas... It's just so beautiful.\n\n9.5/10\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943792635\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943792620\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943792605\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2943792595", "timestamp_created": 1678233594, "timestamp_updated": 1678233701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727603793144226074", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134266799": {"recommendationid": "134266799", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182661602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3068, "last_played": 1668107781}, "language": "english", "review": "what an amazing, highly recommend for any fan of horror survival. \nthis is truly one of the greatest out their\n", "timestamp_created": 1678230640, "timestamp_updated": 1678230640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134265195": {"recommendationid": "134265195", "author": {"steamid": "76561199377651139", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1695511346}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely one of the best story driven games I have ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1678228186, "timestamp_updated": 1678228186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134261175": {"recommendationid": "134261175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024950334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1160, "last_played": 1426620465}, "language": "english", "review": "Spent what felt like hours at a time just hiding under tables.

You get to explore a creepy abandoned spaceship, hide from a terrifying alien, and try not to die in the process. What's not to love?\n\nThe sound effects are so realistic that you'll be looking over your shoulder every five seconds. Every creak and squeak of the spaceship will have you on the edge of your seat, and that's not even mentioning the sounds the alien makes when it's hunting you down. shudders\n\nThe graphics are top-notch. The dark, gritty atmosphere of the spaceship is so well done that you'll forget you're even playing a game. You'll feel like you're actually there, being stalked by a murderous alien.\n\nThe tension is palpable. You'll be sneaking around, trying not to make any noise, and then BAM! The alien comes out of nowhere and your heart jumps out of your chest. It's like playing a game of hide-and-seek with your worst nightmare.\n\nThe storyline is fantastic. You play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley (the main character from the Alien movies).

It is a little bit to short for such an Amazing Environment. It could have done more with a huge Station like it has introduced, but decided to go straight trough the Main-Story.\nNot that this is bad, but after finishing it on the highest Difficulty, there is simply nothing new to it.\nStill, its a solid Horror-Game experience.\n\nI recommend this Game to Players who like scary Horror Atmospheres in Games and for Fans of the Alien (Xenomorph) Franchise.\n---------------------------------\n[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 8,56 / 10):[/h3]\n8,9 / 10 Graphic (Amazing graphics and Animations and a lots of Details in each Environment)\n8,4 / 10 Gameplay (Game tends to surprise with even more Tools to use from and more dangers to avoid)\n7,2 / 10 Story (It has a good Story and well implemented Dialogues, but was a little bit short, could have been far longer Story there.)\n8 / 10 Soundtrack (Totally Nostalgia for Fans of the ALIEN Movie.

This is the story of Amanda Ripley. While she was working, Christopher Samuels will arrive and inform her about retrieval of black box from the Nostromo ship. It was salvaged by the Anesidora ship and is now in ownership of the Seegson Corporation at the Sevastopol space station. Amanda wants to suss what happened to her mother on that ship. So journey to the space station begins with an access ticket to the [i]Torrens[/i] ship. Upon arrival in Sevastopol after a spacewalk, she finds that the station is almost empty. Communications fail, looters are hostile, androids turn enemies, and a perilous enemy prowls in air ducts as well as in every corner of the station. She will do everything possible to abscond, the ending of which is unexpected, abstruse and open. \n\nThe design of the game follows a lot of visual and artistic design based on the [i]Alien[/i] movie by Ridley Scott. We can appreciate details of the interior design composed by human technology. It has an insightful combination between different spatial dimensions of each place based on symmetrical and structuralism design with the variation of lighting on the predominant white colour. The interior of the Torrens, the places in Sevastopol and its exterior are extremely well cared for. Without forgetting the special effects in sounds and in reverberation, with which it evokes nostalgia and fear when remembering the film. Outside: we can undergo petrifying darkness of space, while in background orbit a giant gas planet KG-348. There, in the distance, perplexed, the bright star barely illuminates enveloping darkness. The game preserves the biotechnological art of H. R. Giger. It maintains the artistic design of Alien and its ship. This is a contrast that I like: the human design (formal and cold) and the alien design (organic and sinister).\n\nThe game also has a good direction in photography. That can be seen in every cinematographic shot, hence it is guided according to the narrative, in such a way that a step-by-step immersion is present as we enter the story. Also, this creative idea of narrative layers allows for better character development within the plot. We experience Amanda's story, the (hi)story of Sevastopol's past, and anecdote of survivors before and after contact with the xenomorph. All the characters develop and end tragically at each step of our journey into the plot. Something that caught my attention was the fiction of androids with their artificial intelligence controlled by Apollo. We can tell difference between them with humans through their gestures and behaviours. Androids don't have facial expressions and with that it allows us to bond more with Amanda and Christopher, even though he's an android too. It is worth noting the feeling of vulnerability before the Alien. A powerful, invincible and terrifying enemy. How fragile is the human. All of that maintains the genuine essence of the Alien story.\n\n[b]Playability[/b] 10/10\n\nAs the game is based on the Ridley Scott movie, we'll be facing a powerful and immortal enemy. Although androids and humans will also become foes. The intent of the game is to feel horror and vulnerability, so the gameplay focuses on survival and stealth. The ideal is to balance both gameplay modes, but that will depend on each player.\n\nStealth mode will be an important game mode. We'll make less noise when walking in a crouch, since when running there is necessary risk of being located by enemies. They also make a lot of clatter and racket, so it will be easy to notice their presence. But if the Alien grabs us, death is instant. There is action of leaning out, in case we're waiting for enemy to move in another direction. The air ducts and switches to activate vapour, alarms or open doors, all of this will allow us to find routes to avoid frenemy. In case someone locates us, there is option to run; but the Alien is too fast, so lockers and some \u00abboxes\u00bb can be used to hide us. Inside we'll hold our breath and avoid moving so as not to be detected. To complement the stealth mode, a small portable detector was added. With that we can detect enemies as well as allow us to orient ourselves in correct direction of the objective.\n\nBut if we go into struggle, the use of self-defence will be necessary. There is always the option to shun any enemy. Five weapons that we can use, but they have limited ammo. Each weapon, as the game indicates, is a type of tool that inflicts damage to a type of enemy. On the other hand, we can loot pieces with which it will allow us to craft objects from diagrams found in certain places in the game. There are seven in total, they can be enhanced and each of those are nifty to cause a distraction, repel attack or stun. \n\nThere is a third gameplay, but this is linked to the essence and character of Amanda Ripley. Since she's an engineer, she'll know how to survive, is agile and knowledgeable. Common in-game activities related to Amanda's personality are: starting controls, opening doors by welding, and hacking. This last activity will permit us to use a device with which we'll access doors, computers and controls. It has small puzzles in the form of a mini-game. Remember to read the notes on computer, as it contains important info. This is something I loved about the game: the character is linked to the gameplay, it is concise, coherent and logical.\n\n[b]Music and FX[/b] 10/10\n\nAbout the soundtrack I will be brief due to the length of the review as it is a good idea to listen to the music in the game. Something worth noting first is the game's sound effects. It preserves the sounds that computers produce, the muffled noises inside the space helmet, and the beeps of alarms. Something that is inevitably noticed are the surround sounds, binaural type, with which our environment is perceived. It offers an immersive experience. This sound effect will allow music to seep into every pore of our soul.\n\nAbout the soundtrack, I understand that it was composed by Christian Henson, Joe Henson and Alexis Smith. The idea is to recover the melody heard in Scott's film. The music fits perfectly into each segment of the narrative, it does so through magnificent timing. The form of music is to reveal the horrors that jealously guard the dark space. This is achieved in many moments of the game through background music with drone-dark ambient and space ambient. Silence predominates to give way to the introduction of suspenseful spatial narrative the sound of flutes. In the moments where it generates tension of horror and anxiety, we'll listen to it in synchronization of the alien with orchestral music. This is done through powerful string instruments and percussion. Or when detected whose music consists of rhythms similar to heartbeats. Listening to it reminded me a lot of the movie, it's quite an interesting piece of work.\n\n[b]Duration[/b] 10/10\n\nThe duration depends on the way each player enters the game. It is made up of 18 missions. But we won't notice because of the fluidity or continuity of the story. We will have wall phones for game saves. It keeps us waiting for the horror, but also to continue exploring on the space station. It has various difficulties and a survival mode. Also, there are some DLCs, but we don't really need them to enjoy this game in its entirety. Alien movie fan or not, I highly recommend this game for its original story, gameplay, art, and design.\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1676739812, "timestamp_updated": 1676739812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608795642852783203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133110349": {"recommendationid": "133110349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059887571", "num_games_owned": 1322, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1667448835}, "language": "english", "review": "I know it is heresy to dislike this game, and I assure you I nowhere near hate it.

Like many games I play nowadays, it is not particularly bad while also not being particularly great. No features or gameplay elements stand out all too much, but there's also no glaring issues that hold back the game from being enjoyable; only minor bumps in the road.\n\nYou have three types of enemies; the alien, the rouge androids, and other humans. I see it as quite a bit of a cliche to have humans as enemies, especially since I don't see it making sense in this games plot. I can understand that, say, in a post-apocalyptic world that people would be pitted against each other for resources. But on the Nostromo it seems very much more of a 'us V.S the Alien' type of situation. But maybe I missed something in the story between the big playtime gap I had from the first third and the last two thirds of the game. In terms of gameplay, I didn't like encountering the humans. It was generally annoying to sneak around them for long periods of time, and the game fails at being able to distinguish allies from enemies since they all wear the same clothing. I would walk into a room and hide from everyone, only to find out that they're all friendly. Then I would walk into the next room and I'm staring down the barrel of a shotgun.\n\nThe rouge androids are alright. They certainly have an ominous and intimidating demeanour to them (to the point that you question how someone made this without realising how creepy they are) but they don't pose very much of a threat. They do have the capacity to soak up quite a few bullets before falling, so it's advised to try and avoid them as much as you to conserve on resources. But they're so slow that if you do get caught you can usually just run away before they ever create any legitimate problems for you.\n\nThe alien is obviously the star of the show. The alien will spend most of it's time crawling around in the vents, bumping around above you as you try to pinpoint it's position using the motion tracker. It creates this great sense of fear an ominousness. The developers really understood the idea that an enemy is more scary when you can't fully see them, and don't have all the information at your disposal, but still allowed the motion tracker to assist the player in feeling like the game isn't being unfair. If the alien spots you while on the ground, it'll charge at you so fast that most weapons won't be able to stop it. Only the flamethrower and Molotov are very effective at stopping it, which pressures the player into resource management even more so.\n\nI do like that, for the non-human enemy types, is isn't necessarily just pure survival horror. You do have some capacity to defend yourself, but resorting to that as your only means of getting around will quickly fail as you run out of equipment.\n\nI do feel that there can often times be an overabundance of materials to create items. Maybe I just didn't use items as often as I should have been, but I often found that I was maxed out on most materials about halfway through the game.\n\nThere were also some points in the game where it was incredibly hard to navigate due to level design and map layout. In one section, due to randomly opening doors and overlapping floors, I had to refer to a walkthrough just to get around because I had no idea which doors would and wouldn't open.\n\nBut yeah, generally a decent horror game despite some minor complaints. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys horror games a lot, especially since you can pick it up for quite cheap nowadays.\n\n3 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1676176568, "timestamp_updated": 1676176568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132678192": {"recommendationid": "132678192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202221586", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 377, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1665082903}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't enjoy or finish the game.

That it's a modern classic and presumably the best horror game to come out in recent years? That as a megafan of the original Alien movie, you will really enjoy how it not only is faithful to the source material but expands the world with many interesting ideas and characters that have long since been accepted as canon? That it's a damn shame we'll never get a sequel?\n\nI honestly adore this title and I invite anyone who's curious to pick this up and play it with a nice set of headphones on a pc that can run the best graphical settings. I have also enjoyed the game on PS3 but the extra atmosphere makes all the difference.  Whatever your specs, you'll still get the same amazing gameplay. The art direction is amazing with a retrofuturistic style befitting the universe and equipment and machinery very similar to the original film. If you like the tech in the original film or something like Star Wars, I am sure you'll be hooked on the aestethic. The titular Alien is a formidable foe, especially on hard mode and while the behaviour is random, it acts by a set rules of engagement that are possible to learn and take advantage of to outsmart the beast and even use it to your advantage. This does admittedly take a bit of the scare away from the monster, as you get better, but your first couple of hours you'll definetely be spending way too much time crouching under tables or hiding in closets and vents. Apparently the monster learns from your behaviour and adapts, but I can't say it's something I've experienced that much in either of my two playthroughs. Both human and android enemies (the latter known as Working Joes) are also sufficiently challenging and creepy, in part because you can never really be sure if they are friend or foe.\n\nAre there snakes in paradise? Yes, but mainly related to the story. Pacingwise the game is far too long. Though not as unbearable the second time around, both the beginning and the ending of the story stretches beyond the necessary, and the goalpost is moved one or two times too many for things to still be exciting. I think it'd been better to have a shorter but more focused experience, even if that would mean rearranging certain story beats. It could all have been forgiven had the ending been good, but sadly I just find it very lacklustre, in part because the main character Amanda Ripley never really gets time to be fleshed out as a character and also because of an annoying last minute twist. The new characters are a mixed back, with the android Samuels and the spacer Marlow as stand outs. I also experienced some age signs with the game: audio doesn't always sync perfectly, there was a bit of screen tearing at points and sometimes the character model clipped through surfaces, showed the edge where the arm met the invisible torso, left floating wrenches and guns hanging in the air, shook violently and other such quirks, that did poke holes in the illusion.\n\nThat however does not change the fact that I enjoy being immersed in this universe, and there is still a lot of replayability left. Should I try the grueling \"Nightmare Mode\" where the alien has heightened senses and starts with knowing more search strategies, and where you take more damage from gunshots, have a faulty motion tracker and no minimap? Should I dip my toes into survival mode, where you play as side characters discovering even more of the space station while avoiding the alien in a fun challenge mode? Should I replay the DLC taking place on the Nostromo with voices by the original cast (where I must say, that I find Crew Expendable a bit disappointing...) Or should I do a roleplay focused playthrough, where I rely mostly on gadgets and never kill a human being (which is totally possible) while really searching the Sevastopol for the hidden Nostromo logs?

If you are playing on the hard or nightmare difficulty, expect it to be exactly hard or nightmare. The game is fairly immersive and doesn't rely on only jumpscares to be \"scary\". Once you think you're used to the aliens and androids, they start to learn your hiding and fighting tactics. Only took me 12 hours to play the whole game through on hard, but it was my second time playing it, just on a different account.", "timestamp_created": 1675817804, "timestamp_updated": 1675817804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132374885": {"recommendationid": "132374885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010573847", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1189, "last_played": 1675753379}, "language": "english", "review": "I was able to play this on a steam deck without issues for the most part.

Although at this point the game is now almost 9 years old, it is still visually stunning, and an absolute treat to launch myself into. At no point am I bored during this game. At no point do I wish I could skip a section. And despite knowing the game inside and out, at no point am I not terrified while the Xeno is active. The AI is incredibly smart, and really does make you feel like you need to constantly crouch your way around for fear of accidentally giving away where you currently are. The story flows beautifully, with moments of respite to catch your breath, but you will at other times be forced into small sections where it's just you, and one angry Xeno out for blood. There are so many things that I can say about this game that I haven't already, like getting back the cast of the original movie for some new never-before heard dialogue. The attention to detail, the care and craftsmanship put into this game, but I could never do the game enough justice.

The game effectively builds upon the world, characters, and scenery from the original movie, offering fans of the franchise a new and exciting way to experience the Alien universe.\n\nOne of the standout features of Alien: Isolation is its intense and suspenseful gameplay, which is set aboard the maze-like space station known as Sevastopol. Players take on the role of Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, as they navigate the station while being hunted by a deadly Xenomorph. The game's AI system is highly advanced, allowing the Xenomorph to actively search for the player and react to their actions in real-time, making each encounter feel unique and unpredictable.\n\nAnother positive aspect of Alien: Isolation is its stunning visuals and sound design, which effectively capture the atmosphere of the original movie. The game features highly detailed environments aboard Sevastopol, excellent use of lighting, and a top-notch soundtrack that effectively captures the feeling of being lost in space and under attack by a dangerous alien creature.\n\nThe game also features a compelling storyline that is true to the source material. With its well-written characters, immersive world-building, and unexpected twists, Alien: Isolation is a true love letter to the Alien franchise and builds upon the classic movie in exciting and meaningful ways.\n\nOverall, Alien: Isolation is a highly enjoyable and memorable survival-horror game that offers fans of the Alien franchise a new and exciting way to experience the world, characters, and scenery from the original movie.

The game is absolutely brilliant- and that Alien AI is an absolute nightmare to deal with- just the way it's suppose to be. As much as I understand, the AI itself was relatively new in the way it worked and remains quite unique to this date. It truly feels like a predator- prey situation. And since it's quite smart and unpredictable (which only gets worse on higher difficulty levels), you have to be strategic and patient in the way you approach every mission. Also- The environments and sound design completely immerse you into the surroundings of this game. Admittedly, I find it hard not to gush over the details and how great of a job they did being true to the design of the films. The DLCs also have a very special place in my heart because of that. The gameplay itself and pacing at certain points can get the tiniest bit repetitive. Yet the unpredictability of the Alien itself gives the game a lot of replay value and keep things relatively fresh. Lastly- most of the characters are a little vanilla too. Ripley herself is quite stoic but it would have been nice to see some more personality from her. The story arc with her mother, Ellen, too barely has an impact on the game. So I do wish the narrative and drama played a stronger role in this game- however that would have been an additional bonus since the game itself is pretty darn close to perfect as is. As a parting note- if you like survival horror as a genre and like the Alien franchise, you will a 100% enjoy this game.
