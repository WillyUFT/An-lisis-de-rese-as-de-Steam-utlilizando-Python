This made character death feel like less of a punishment, and more like just another tool to progress the game. Once death became a routine part of advancing the game, the whole creepy vibe sort of fell apart.\n\nFor anyone who's looking at this game because of that creepy atmosphere, I would strongly suggest Inside.

But the most thing I felt was the feeling of fear and emptiness. I felt so lonely when I played this boy character like he was lost in the darkness and tried to find a way out of this situation.\n\nThis game gives any perspective from its storyline and has a deep meaning. That is the main reason why I fall in love with Limbo. So, If you are the type of person who loves knowing a storyline, I suggest you play this game and feel what kind of feeling when you play this boy character because you will get your perspective meaning from it.\n\n\u00b0Graphic\u00b0\nI think for a game that was launched 12 years ago, the graphic is not outdated and still can compete with other indie games that launched a few years ago.\n\nI really like Limbo so much, It really touched from the storyline and match with the background.

[/h3]\n\nDirectional arrows aside, Limbo only has two other inputs: Jump and use. The game begins without any cutscenes or context. There is no colour, only shades of black and white. Annoyingly, there are no accessibility or graphics options in the menu. This dichotomy represents the best and worst that Limbo has to offer. \n\nLimbo\u2019s use of black, which typically makes up 1/3 of the screen, encourages the player\u2019s imagination to fill in the gaps. Just enough is shown, whether through blurry perimeters of trees or machinery, to allude to an outside world. This means simple objects often invite the player to extract deeper meanings. One chapter shows a single person, rope around their neck, hanging solemnly from a tree in the background; an easy detail to miss, but one which suggests a dysfunctional world outside the player\u2019s understanding.\n\nGameplay toes the line between accessible and perhaps too simple. When you boil it down, Limbo is mostly jumping puzzles with the occasionally pushing and dragging of an object. This means it\u2019s easy to pick-up yet deceptively headscratching at times. By the end, you\u2019re still mostly jumping, mainly during narrower windows of opportunity, and little else is really added. You can swing from ropes using your momentum, and that\u2019s really it.\n\nOn the one hand, this simplicity is a love letter to the basics of gaming. However, there isn\u2019t much of a sandbox to play around with. There\u2019s no level editor, and the game is a brisk 4 hours \u2013 maybe 3 if you\u2019re smarter than I was. Limbo launched during the initial batch of Xbox 360 arcade titles in the late 2000s, and while visually it\u2019s the polar opposite to titles like Castle Crashers, it doesn\u2019t feel as developed gameplay-wise as even those rudimentary button mashers. \n\nIt\u2019s worthwhile if you\u2019re into 2D platformers to play one of the modern classics of the genre, especially given its pivotal contribution to the rise of indie publishers in the digital era. But its dedication to keeping things simple unsurprisingly leads to a very basic game that\u2019s largely been built superseded nowadays, albeit on the foundations it created.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698697630, "timestamp_updated": 1698697630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149213714": {"recommendationid": "149213714", "author": {"steamid": "76561199101796871", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1698771682}, "language": "english", "review": "the game frozen in the last chapter when you break the glass", "timestamp_created": 1698696536, "timestamp_updated": 1698696536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149209709": {"recommendationid": "149209709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017743179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 256, "last_played": 1698691550}, "language": "english", "review": "Gaming equivalent of sweeping the floor in a monastery with a shrewd nun rapping your knuckles and having you do it over every time a slightest movement is not to her liking, genuinely one of the most unfun experiences ive ever had", "timestamp_created": 1698691710, "timestamp_updated": 1698691710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149197147": {"recommendationid": "149197147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021123554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1697851218}, "language": "english", "review": "Limbo was a great physics puzzle solving game.

Such a dark and rich atmosphere that shrouds this disturbing world in a black and white static haze, leaving a lot up to the imagination, working wonders for the games striking imagery. The small glowing eyes of the Boy, a leg of a spider poking out of the overgrown wild. Mirroring the world, the gameplay is harsh; many unforgiving jumps and timings and traps that seem impenetrable, doing everything they can to keep you from progressing.  However, a lot of the puzzles can be tedious, there\u2019s some very precise timing and platforming needed and a lot of the deaths in the game can seem cheap, especially as you can\u2019t see a lot of them coming.\n\nBut maybe that's the point? The world Limbo drags you down into is dark and oppressing, around every corner there's death. This boy fucking DIES. Like from basically anything and everything. Over and over again. Again the visual design elevates this imagery, with your mind filling in the details left from the simple graphics, almost protecting you from seeing and experiencing what this boy is going through. Stuck in a constant loop, a purgatory, learning and slowly you overcome all of this darkness, crawling out of the endless cycle, this limbo...\n\nMany, MANY thoughts and a few mixed feelings about this. The story is simple on the surface, but through the obtuse storytelling and even just writing this review I can't stop thinking about it and all the theories and questions I have. \n\nSpoiler territory (conclusion under):\n[spoiler] Seen people think the conclusion is underwhelming or wondering what the point of the game is? I adore how ambiguous this story is, and I hope everyone can come up with their own conclusions. I see this as a very bittersweet story. The ending shows the boy\u2019s sister burying him. The boy pushes on through Limbo, conquering his fears until the very end where his final fear is conquered; his sister's safety. Yes he cannot come back to her, but just knowing she\u2019s okay allows him to move on. \nThere is a LOT I want to say and dive into, but gonna save it while I think about this game and potentially replay it in the future. [/spoiler]\n\nLimbo has had a really weird effect on me and I'm struggling to place my feelings about it, but all I can say is I definitely recommend this. I am looking forward to seeing how the team evolves in the coming games, and maybe after a replay of this is needed. Definitely needed to process this a bit before coming up with my feelings about it. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 4/5", "timestamp_created": 1697986063, "timestamp_updated": 1698330374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557163536548614502", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148666978": {"recommendationid": "148666978", "author": {"steamid": "76561199177299514", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 266, "last_played": 1697976240}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1697976270, "timestamp_updated": 1697976270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148659790": {"recommendationid": "148659790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370030928", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1697915916}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] \\\\\\ TRAINING YOUR PATIENCE, AND BRAIN OF COURSE \\\\\\ [/h1]\n[b] ABOUT | [/b] Saving her girlfriend I guess?\n\n[b] STORY: [/b] Dunnow the story.

Yeah, [b]Limbo[/b] may be a very pretty little two to three hour work of monochrome art, but it has virtually no replay value other than a couple collectibles that uncover a secret which reveals... next to nothing about the plot. There is also an achievement for beating this game with less than five deaths, but that is practically impossible unless you've finished the game already or are following a guide very closely. Every area you enter in this game plays out like this:\n\n\"Wow this is a pretty, noir looking- wait what?! I just got crushed/skewered/crucified/burned/shot/eaten/drowned/electrified/blown up/smothered/forced to watch Keemstar's entire catalog of videos??? How the hell was I supposed to see that until it was right on top of me?\"\n\nThen you know that thing will kill you, you try again to avoid, usually succeed unless the weighty and physics based platforming is having a weird stimming break, and you press on. It's not absurdly difficult, the game is quite short after all, but there are few games that are the definition of trial and error like [b]Limbo[/b] is. If you're ok with dropping dead every couple minutes and then quickly respawning to solve the puzzle, this game could be quite satisfying for you. But the deaths in this game somehow manage to be both obnoxious and yet also inconsequential. It's like the game has an obligation to kill you without any consequence on your end, as if you're Prometheus and this game is the eagle.\n\nNobody can deny how utterly gorgeous this game is, but also how amazing the sound work is. Not talked about often with this game, but the atmospheric tracks do a good job of hinting at key areas that contain puzzle solutions, industrial chimes, foreboding hums for incoming danger, the list is endless. Although the monochrome color scheme can frustrate with how little anything in the environment is telegraphed, it still is beautiful. Lighting, shadows, and animation honestly all belong in a museum they're so great.\n\nSo if you are up for less than a handful of hours of good atmosphere and presentation, somewhat weak puzzles, and questionable deaths then [b]Limbo[/b] is certainly worth drowning in.

Requieren pensamiento lateral y experimentaci\u00f3n para resolverlos, lo que proporciona una satisfacci\u00f3n genuina cuando encuentras la soluci\u00f3n. Eso s\u00ed, el nivel de complejidad al momento de la ejecuci\u00f3n va en picada, es decir, lo complicado est\u00e1 al inicio, poco a poco se vuelve mon\u00f3tono y predecible.\n\n[*][b]Narrativa sugerida:[/b] LIMBO cuenta su historia de una manera no convencional, sin di\u00e1logos ni explicaciones directas.

Unfortunately, I rate the games that I play based on my own personal enjoyment and unfortunately I didn't have very much enjoyment playing this game.\n\n Let's get the most obvious and well known out of the way first. Limbo, as simplistic looking as it is, is a very beautiful game. The entire game is in black, white, and grey. There are no hints of bright colors anywhere, but somehow it manages to look beautiful. I played it on my Steam Deck and everything from the backgrounds to animations was very pleasing to the eye. The visuals as well as the sound made for a very haunting atmosphere, which suits October especially well.\n\n Limbo is a side scrolling platformer with a main focus on puzzles and this is where it falls flat for me. To be honest I don't play puzzle games often and when it comes to puzzles in other genres, I am not very good at them. The problem is not that I'm dumb or anything, but I'm just very impatient. I will try a puzzle 3 or 4 times and after that I go straight to a guide because I feel that tedious repetition is a waste of time. With that said, I feel that its only partly my fault why I didn't enjoy Limbo. First of all, the game does not explain anything at all. It's far from a complex game as it only uses two buttons for jump and push/pull, as well as an analog stick to walk. However there is no HUD or tutorial of any kind. You press start and you're right in the game. Figure it all out. I don't mind this approach because it adds to the mystique atmosphere of the game, but it also doesn't explain its own rules. I think that understanding the rules is very important when completing puzzles. Limbo is almost entirely based on trial and error. Many of the puzzles I felt like I had to purposely die in order to see what would happen so that I can know what's allowed and what's not in each particular area. Imagine if you took a multiple choice test, and you had infinite attempts. Sooner or later you will get the correct answer, even if its the last one you choose, and even though you finally get to move on to the next question, you didn't pass the previous question due to your intelligence, but rather because you've tried everything else. In the second half of the game I felt like I needed to use a video guide for almost every section and to me that was not fun. I didn't have a sense of accomplishment. True, its my fault for looking it up, but like I said earlier, time is valuable and I often felt like this game was wasting my time.\n\nOn the plus side this game is very short and can be completed in one sitting. It also has pretty forgiving checkpoints so I give it props for that. Again, take my review with a grain of salt. Context is very important here and even though I didn't enjoy the game, I can still totally see why some people view this game as one of their all time favorites.", "timestamp_created": 1696620487, "timestamp_updated": 1696621045, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147756302": {"recommendationid": "147756302", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060888524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1696529522}, "language": "english", "review": "a solid, short little game with some nice puzzles and great atmosphere and environmental storytelling.

It stands as a stark and mesmerizing example of the power of minimalism in video game design. With its hauntingly beautiful black-and-white visuals, eerie ambient soundscape, and cleverly crafted puzzles, Limbo offers an unforgettable and emotionally charged gaming experience.\n\nVisually, Limbo is a marvel. Its monochromatic, silhouetted aesthetic creates a sense of otherworldly beauty and dread simultaneously. The game's minimalist approach to graphics manages to convey a sense of depth and atmosphere that few other titles can match. The stark contrast between light and shadow serves as a metaphor for the game's thematic exploration of life and death.\n\nLimbo's gameplay is equally minimalist but incredibly effective. You control a young boy who awakens in a nightmarish forest and embarks on a perilous journey to find his sister. The controls are simple - move, jump, and interact - yet the game manages to present increasingly complex challenges. Puzzles in Limbo often require precise timing and lateral thinking, but they never feel frustratingly obtuse. The trial-and-error gameplay encourages experimentation and rewards players for their persistence.\n\nOne of the game's most striking aspects is its approach to storytelling. Limbo eschews traditional narrative exposition and dialogue, instead opting for environmental storytelling and symbolism. The game invites players to interpret its haunting world and story for themselves, creating a deeper connection to the protagonist's plight. This ambiguity adds to the game's sense of mystery and unease, leaving players with lingering questions long after the credits roll.\n\nThe audio design in Limbo deserves special mention. The ambient soundscape is hauntingly beautiful, with every footstep, creaking tree, and ominous hum contributing to the game's eerie atmosphere. It's a masterclass in audio immersion and adds immeasurably to the overall experience.\n\nLimbo is not without its criticisms. Some players may find the game's length a bit short, as it can be completed in a few hours. Additionally, some might argue that the puzzles can occasionally feel repetitive. However, these issues are minor in the grand scheme of things, as the brevity of the experience ensures that it remains consistently engaging from start to finish.\n\nIn conclusion, Limbo is a true work of art in the world of video games. Its minimalist design, breathtaking visuals, and enigmatic storytelling combine to create an unforgettable and emotionally resonant experience. While it may not be a lengthy adventure, its impact is undeniably profound. Limbo is a game that lingers in the mind long after you've completed it, and it stands as a testament to the artistic potential of the medium. If you appreciate games as an art form and are willing to embark on a journey into the unknown, Limbo is an essential experience that should not be missed.", "timestamp_created": 1696534902, "timestamp_updated": 1696534902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147675698": {"recommendationid": "147675698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040706188", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1699131116}, "language": "english", "review": "It's difficult to explain what makes Limbo so good.

This is more frustrating than it sounds, as Limbo's artsy aesthetic and inconsistent logic mean that its rarely clear how you might interact with a puzzle. The result is that most puzzles are exercises in trial and error.\n\nEven when a solution is apparent, the execution can be unreasonably demanding. Very tight timing and perfect accuracy are often required, and the platforming and physics of the game do not lend themselves to precision.\n\nLIMBO's visuals are elegantly simple, although they often fail to communicate necessary information to the player. At times, LIMBO dabbles in \"gotcha\" design, punishing players for believing that it will behave consistently or using visual cues to mislead the player. The audio is effective, if stark.\n\nOverall, this is just a subpar puzzle game. I can only believe that the style of the game blinded reviewers to its shortcomings.

Released in 2010, it remains a classic in the indie game genre.\n\nSet in a monochromatic, grayscale environment, Limbo immediately immerses you in its eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The lack of color adds to the sense of foreboding, making every shadow, trap, and creature you encounter all the more menacing. The game's minimalist art style is nothing short of breathtaking, with meticulously detailed backgrounds and character animations that evoke a sense of both beauty and dread.\n\nThe narrative in Limbo is intentionally cryptic and open to interpretation. You control a young boy who awakens in a dark forest and embarks on a perilous quest to find his sister. The absence of dialogue or text prompts encourages players to piece together the story themselves, adding an extra layer of immersion. It's a tale of innocence and vulnerability set against a backdrop of cruelty and danger.\n\nGameplay in Limbo revolves around solving a series of environmental puzzles and avoiding deadly traps. The puzzles are cleverly designed and often require both logic and timing to overcome. Death in Limbo is frequent and often gruesome, but it serves as a learning experience rather than a punishment. Each death provides a clue or teaches a lesson, encouraging experimentation and perseverance.\n\nWhat truly sets Limbo apart is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. The sense of isolation and unease is palpable, yet there are moments of beauty and even tenderness amidst the darkness.

It's also a competent puzzle-platformer, though sometimes marred by frustration. The worst offences are when its emotional moments or big setpieces are undermined by its trial-and-error nature, Despite its short length, I was a bit relieved when the chapter list showed that I was nearing the end of the game, as I didn't know how many more times I could sit through its wonderfully grisly death animations. \n\nHowever, once I reached the end I felt fulfilled. This despite there being no narration. Limbo does an admirable job of manipulating the player's emotions through its contextual storytelling and excellent sound design. I'm fairly certain the developers didn't have a clue what the story is about. But so what? Noel Gallagher doesn't know what Champagne Supernova is about either, and he wrote the bloody song.\n\nGenerations from now, Limbo will still stand as aesthetically timeless. A tale told entirely in silhouette, its visuals are a stroke of genius. Its lack of words lets players have an abundance of feeling. This is an extremely pretty game, and a very artsy one.

Presentado en blanco y negro con sombras sutiles, el juego crea una atm\u00f3sfera opresiva y sombr\u00eda que sumerge al jugador en un mundo desconocido y peligroso. Los detalles en el dise\u00f1o de los personajes y el entorno, aunque simples, son impactantes. Cada escena se siente como una obra de arte cuidadosamente compuesta.\n\nHistoria y Narrativa (4.5/5): Limbo es una experiencia misteriosa y sin di\u00e1logos que se basa en la interpretaci\u00f3n del jugador. Sigues la historia de un joven ni\u00f1o en busca de su hermana perdida en un mundo hostil y surrealista. La narrativa se desarrolla de manera sutil a trav\u00e9s de los eventos del juego y los elementos visuales, lo que permite que cada jugador cree su propia interpretaci\u00f3n de la historia. Este enfoque no convencional en la narraci\u00f3n es refrescante y desafiante.\n\nJugabilidad (4.5/5): Limbo es un juego de plataformas y resoluci\u00f3n de acertijos en su forma m\u00e1s pura. Los desaf\u00edos son inteligentes y a menudo mortales, lo que te obliga a experimentar y aprender de tus errores. La simplicidad de los controles, con solo unos pocos botones para moverte y saltar, se convierte en una ventaja, ya que te permite concentrarte en la resoluci\u00f3n de los intrincados acertijos. La dificultad es elevada pero gratificante.\n\nSonido y M\u00fasica (5/5): La banda sonora minimalista y los efectos de sonido contribuyen significativamente a la atm\u00f3sfera del juego. Los susurros inquietantes y los ruidos ambientales a\u00f1aden tensi\u00f3n a cada paso que das en el mundo de Limbo. La m\u00fasica, compuesta por Martin Stig Andersen, es sublime en su simplicidad y profundidad emocional.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n (4.5/5): Limbo es una obra maestra del dise\u00f1o de juegos independientes que desaf\u00eda las convenciones y ofrece una experiencia \u00fanica.

I'm somewhere in the middle, but it's a thumb down from me.\n\nI'll start with the things that I actually liked about LIMBO.\nFirst of all... the ambiance and sound design. You can really feel immersed in this title just by wearing headphones and letting the ambiance play for a while. It can be loud and unsettling, but also gentle and quiet when needed.\n\nNext is level design (some of them, to be exact). The level designers did a good job in creating interesting and often non-obvious puzzles. Most of the time, they place us in an area with only a few objects, which really forces us to think.\n\nThere are also things that, in my personal opinion, are not really good, or sometimes even bad.\nThe main thing that bothers me is the later part of the game, specifically its difficulty and checkpoint placement.\nThe perfectly timed puzzles were cool as long as they didn't result in death, requiring you to walk all the way back to where you died. The idea is good, but the execution falls short.\n\nIn conclusion\nPros:\n- Sound design\n- Atmosphere\n- Creative puzzles (most of them)\n- Interesting world-building\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty in the later stages of the game\n- Checkpoint placement\n- Ending\n\nI expected something more, but it's still a cool game to buy (only on sale!).", "timestamp_created": 1691701047, "timestamp_updated": 1691701141, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143757466": {"recommendationid": "143757466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333740695", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1682459511}, "language": "english", "review": "playdead's inside", "timestamp_created": 1691640028, "timestamp_updated": 1691640028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143748622": {"recommendationid": "143748622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073314967", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1181, "last_played": 1411054046}, "language": "english", "review": "Bleak and boring.

This game is none other than Playdead's critically acclaimed masterpiece, LIMBO.\n\nAt first glance, one could be deceived into thinking that LIMBO is a simple platformer, but it transcends that genre and blossoms into something much more. It is a grand tapestry of art, philosophy, and storytelling, carefully woven together into an unforgettable gaming experience.\n\nThe graphics, while seemingly minimalist, are a study in thoughtful artistry. The monochromatic, silhouetted visuals render the game's environment with an eerie beauty that is both captivating and haunting. The intricate design of each level, laden with layered shadows and infused with a sense of melancholic charm, not only elicits a sense of desolation but also of fascination. It's a testament to the adage, \"less is more\".\n\nLIMBO's eerie, soundless soundtrack enhances its mysterious ambiance, inviting the player to become fully immersed in the world around them. The lack of music heightens the player's senses, creating a raw and unnerving atmosphere that is perfectly synced with the visuals.\n\nThe gameplay is marked by clever and innovative puzzles, each with its own unique twist, effectively testing the player's ingenuity and quick reflexes. The controls are perfectly calibrated, simple and responsive, allowing players of all experience levels to navigate with ease through the shadowy world.\n\nWhat really sets LIMBO apart is its ability to tell a poignant and emotionally resonant story without the use of dialogue or text. Through carefully crafted animations, subtle visual clues, and evocative gameplay mechanics, it weaves an ambiguous yet touching narrative of a little boy's quest to find his lost sister, leaving players to draw their own conclusions and interpretations.\n\nWhile LIMBO does tread on dark themes and delivers a fair share of tense, hair-raising moments, its overall emotional impact is profound and surprisingly uplifting. It challenges players to confront their fears and persist through adversity, offering a silent yet powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nPlaydead's LIMBO is not merely a game; it is a rich, immersive experience that stimulates the senses, challenges the mind, and touches the heart. It's a hauntingly beautiful journey through the shadows, and a testament to the art of video game creation. In its quiet, understated way, LIMBO illuminates the potential of the gaming medium to tell deeply compelling, emotionally resonant stories. It's an absolute must-play for anyone who cherishes the opportunity to embark on a unique, thought-provoking adventure. I couldn't recommend it more highly.\n\nSimply put, LIMBO is a transcendent triumph that leaves you forever changed. It lingers in your consciousness long after the credits roll, a spectral reminder of your journey through the light and darkness of the human condition.", "timestamp_created": 1690912450, "timestamp_updated": 1690912450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143200627": {"recommendationid": "143200627", "author": {"steamid": "76561199146159313", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1697647504}, "language": "english", "review": "very good vibe\ncool puccle", "timestamp_created": 1690893218, "timestamp_updated": 1690893218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527220606803894043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143172871": {"recommendationid": "143172871", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986982981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1690843464}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember liking this back in 2010 but couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember why I never finished it. Well, doing a full playthrough now brought it all back.\n\nAs a puzzle platformer, for the most part Limbo follows the tropes of the genre in terms of gameplay. Follow the path to the right and solve any obstacles coming your way. Where Limbo differs is how it dabbles in trial-and-error gameplay and constantly tries to \u201cget\u201d the player. It never tells or indicates what the traps are or how to avoid them and it\u2019s not consistent with its own rules; Big dangerous button on the ground? Sorry you were supposed to jump on it. Second button on the ground? Sorry you were supposed to jump over it. It\u2019s just a waste of time. Many times the game also relies on janky physics to solve some of the puzzles where you have to predict how the physics will work in-game; It turns out to be the puzzle equivalent of climbing mountains in the Elder Scrolls games.\n\nI wasn\u2019t blown away or entertained by what the game did. For the most part it was just annoying. As was the pretentious nothing of a story that had no connection at all to the environments the game threw my way. It\u2019s like a poorly put together map from Little Big Planet where someone wrote a paragraph for context at the start of the game. Sorry but it\u2019s not good enough. If the game completely lacks story and is severely lacking in terms of gameplay or narrative, there really isn\u2019t much to recommend here. \n\nAs for the port; It\u2019s terrible. While the game runs well and has decent controls the only way to adjust video settings is in the game files so unless you go digging there you\u2019ll have to play it in a grainy 720p mess. Granted there isn't really much to look at here anyway so it's not that big of a deal.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690845383, "timestamp_updated": 1690845383, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592779576778411865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143154485": {"recommendationid": "143154485", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208423611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 168, "last_played": 1700601986}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I loved Inside, I didn't like Limbo.

I dont even know where to begin. There are parts where the game just kills you for pretty much no reason and you can\u00b4t prevent it since you don\u00b4t know it is about to happen. As a result quite a few things will take you a multiple tries just because the game has a shitty design that revolves around dying in order to find the right way to solve a problem. That with the combination of when you die it takes the game multiple seconds to respawn you makes for some frustrating experience, because you are like sitting there just watching your dead body or death animation like an idiot. \nAt the beginning of the game there is a giant spider chasing you and i fucking hate spiders (sad part is, that was the most interesting part of the game even for me), after that it pretty much just turns into a series of idiotic puzzles often just based on timing or shitty interactions with environment. In some puzzles the game makes you go back because there is something you need which seemed just weird to me. To be honest the last quarter of the game i just looked up how to solve the puzzles, because i was so fucking fed up with how stupid this game is i just couldn\u00b4t be bothered to try solving them for my self since solving them wasn\u00b4t even fun most of the time (and i like solving puzzles)\nThe game\u00b4s controls are simplistic yet idiotic at the same time. Quite a few times the game revolves around jumping at the right moment but sometimes it seems as if there is like a half second imput lag, like what is this? reminded me of the OG prince of persia (a game that is more than 30 years old btw) if you know you know\nNot to mention the story is pretty much non existent. If you were to ask me what this game is about i genually have no fucking clue. The game is also short af. Most will be done with this torture around 3 hours.\nThe game graphics are fine if you ask me, but it does seem like the devs didn\u00b4t even want to put the work in so they just left it black and white.\n\nI dont even remember buying this game, i think I might have claimed it during a time when it was for free and that is the only reasonable price for this game according to my personal opinion, since for playing dogshit games like this the devs should be paying you.", "timestamp_created": 1690750114, "timestamp_updated": 1690765509, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143075506": {"recommendationid": "143075506", "author": {"steamid": "76561199160598972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1690275417}, "language": "english", "review": "Limbo yes its Limbo is crazy Crazy?

Especially the ending was just a meaningless 10 second scene. So it becomes impossible to make a connection with the game.\n\nSecondly, controls are so annoying and it makes you crazy. The character doesn't jump as I wanted or he doesn't hold as I wish. It feels like I'm not controlling him, the character does whatever he wants.\n\nDespite all this you can get entertained by Limbo's brilliantly designed puzzles. They can be really creative and difficult to solve. But one bad thing about the puzzles is they can be really cryptic and that's not good for me. Sometimes it becomes extremely challenging and i believe that %95 of the people can't finish this game without looking to a guide or walk-through video. Especially the secret level was that close to make me rage-quit.\n\nThe soundtracks are also very bad chosen and there are music only in the 10 second \"storytelling\" cutscenes.\n\nOverall\nPros:\nEntertaining puzzles\nGood art style\nSometimes fun gameplay\n\nCons:\nNo story\nNo soundtracks\nBad controls\nSome over difficult puzzles\n\nOnly buy it if you are a real big puzzle fan", "timestamp_created": 1689965047, "timestamp_updated": 1690031738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460076063871383667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142529220": {"recommendationid": "142529220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239337330", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 999, "last_played": 1689900423}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]My review after playing the whole game with all the achievements:[/h1]\n\n[b]The good side:[/b]\n\n1. Beautiful, dark and immersive graphics. Not only that, but the music and atmosphere makes you feel like you're into the game.\n\n2. The puzzles have a medium difficult, makes them fun and not so much frustrating. \n\n3. Not a long game, It's an adventure that you can finish in one day.\n\n[b]The bad side:[/b]\n\n1. I have a couple issues with lag. I have a good PC, so it's strange, the game drops from 60 fps to 30 fps in just seconds. Not a big problem, but it can be annoying\n\n2.

"[h1]Overview[/h1]\nYou play as a boy trying to find his sister through the Limbo, a dark and mysterious world full of all kinds of mortal hazards. The game doesn't really have any dialogue, so much of the lore is up to your interpretation.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game has a very simple platforming mechanic, you just walk around and jump, there are also stairs and ropes you can climb, there are some special sections where your movements will be limited, and you will have to solve a puzzle to get back to normal. The puzzles are basically pushing/pulling objects or activating buttons at the right time. Almost every section will be full of things that can kill you, so you have to always proceed with caution.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game features 2D black and white graphics, the protagonist and platforms have a simple design while the backgrounds are more detailed, which adds some surreality to the already dark environment.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThere's practically no music in the game, just environment and atmospheric sounds, giving the game a depressive vibe, which fits well with the dark and mysterious scenarios. The sound effects are kinda loud compared to the rest of the game, but not enough to be a problem.\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]\nWhile the game is really well done, it's very short and it's already a bit old, so I think it should be a little cheaper than it is, so I suggest buying it when it's on sale.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThe platforming and puzzles aren't particularly hard (some of them require timing, but nothing unfair). However, there's a lot of trial and error, so you may die a bunch of times before finding a way to solve some of them, fortunately, there's also lots of checkpoints.\n\n[h1]Duration[/h1]\nThe game is very short, revisiting chapters and replaying it to get the achievements may extend your playtime a bit, but it will still be kinda short.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nYou'll have to play the game again to get the 'No Point in Dying\" achievement, there's also a secret level that's unlocked after finishing the game for the first time and finding all hidden eggs, which will let you skip a bunch of chapters passing through a dark tunnel with some sound puzzles, this tunnel also leads you to the 'DING!' achievement.\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\nMost achievements are quite easy to get, you just have to step on the hidden eggs. 'DING!' and 'No Point in Dying' are a little more complicated and may take a few tries, but are still doable.\n\n[h1]Problems[/h1]\nSome boxes in early game have a glitch where they may hurl you away, but that rarely happens and does not kill you.", "timestamp_created": 1689695832, "timestamp_updated": 1689695832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142333573": {"recommendationid": "142333573", "author": {"steamid": "76561199089693650", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 336, "last_played": 1689690319}, "language": "spanish", "review": "delicioso juego. corto, eso s\u00ed, pero perfecto", "timestamp_created": 1689691063, "timestamp_updated": 1689691063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142317314": {"recommendationid": "142317314", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995257972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 541, "last_played": 1696961351}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game. makes one think. the mood and tone is still so relevant to modern day gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1689668597, "timestamp_updated": 1689668597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142311031": {"recommendationid": "142311031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991585109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 229, "last_played": 1689656874}, "language": "english", "review": "trial and error, long \"cutscenes\" and not what I expected at all.

The only objective you have is given to you on the steam page. Without it, it's a complete mystery and not in a good way. There aren't really characters and the boy you play as doesn't really have any expressions or anything to indicate emotion. I've play Playdeads other game Inside and while it might have some more clearer imagery to indicate some story, i don't get how people love the \"story\". Don't get me wrong i love narratives that are vague and leave the interpretation to the consumer, but there needs to be at least something for player to interpret. While the ending might be the closest thing to a plot point, the game just feels empty and out of place for the majority of the runtime. \nThe Settings are fine as they're pretty typical for the platforming/puzzle genre. \nVisually I will say that it is quite unique. Performance was solid throughout my playtime and there were no signs of bugs or glitches. The Art Direction is definitely a highlight as the noir colours and silhouette design gives the game feel unsettling and tense. I also like the film/grain effect giving more character to the game. \nSound and Audio are also pretty good with the soundtrack adding to the tension and the audio for the different items other things around the world feels fitting. \nIn terms of gameplay, it got old pretty quick. The movement for the character feels right for this game as the boy with every action he takes feeling swingy and each jump that you take to climb an edge feeling really intense. The puzzles are just boring and where not satisfying to complete. There wasn't really any enemies in the game except for the spider at the start which i really enjoyed as it added a horror element to the game and was fun to try and avoid. However, the spider felt like the only threat in the game which was a real let down as i really enjoyed the spider section. Even though this game is an hour, it felt like it was dragging on for too long. While it did introduce new mechanics like flipped gravity, it didn't change it up enough resulting in the final experience feeling pretty stale at the end. \nOverall, Limbo was a disappointment as i heard some great things from it.

Many parts of puzzles are just completely obfuscated by the dark aesthetic and in some cases it specifically teaches you to cross an obstacle one way and then immediately punishes you for learning. It's like a troll game where it seems like the creator is just trying to kill / punish you for not knowing the answers before it even reveals the parts of the puzzle to you. It just seemed kinda lame. It kills you unfairly so much that it becomes meaningless and dying stops being a deterrent... you just end up throwing yourself forward into obstacles so you can get the dying over with and learn whatever secret knowledge it's keeping from you so you can progress.\n\nPerhaps some people like that, and perhaps I would've been able to overlook it if there was anything else in this game to latch onto. There is no story, there's no development, there's no motivation provided to even keep playing beyond morbid curiosity. The end is nothing, it's not even the hint of something, it's the most meaningless archetypal \"imagine I made a good ending\" fake ending I've seen in a game that isn't panned. \n\nThe platforming is fine... it does what it can with the limited controls made available.\n\nI'm not sure why this game is so recommended and well reviewed. It's mid as mid can get. It's not terrible, I guess. I've played worse. It's worth the 99 cents it's on sale for right now but that's about it. You probably have better games to play. It's short. It's annoying. Most of the \"puzzles\" don't require intelligence, the require perseverance and patience to die over and over to unfair obstacles that you could't possibly know ahead of time.

striking silhouetted artstyle and a really neat creepy atmosphere that doesn't really have much in the way of a DELIBERATE story and instead chooses to be as vague as possible.\nYou don't really get a full-on \"conclusion\" by the end of it, just bits and pieces for you to try and figure out what you just spent the last couple hours doing.\n\n\nIt's REALLY short, and the only other thing you get in the way of content are some extra collectibles for achievements (which were actually pretty fun once you got a guide because FUCK some of these are cryptic), and, uh...\n...a really bad really terrible really awful 'chievo for beating the whole game with less than 5 deaths.\nWhich isn't that good of an idea in a janky physics-based platformer that loves to throw trial and error traps at you and where the controls will occasionally screw up being physics-based as they are leading to a cheap death.\nLike I was genuinely going to try and go for it and then got all 5 deaths in a row like two thirds in from one really cheap part and instantly gave up on it at that point.\n\n\nAt least it goes for 90% off often, it's definitely worth it like that, it's just... there isn't much here to speak

No usa ni una sola palabra, y sin embargo la comunidad ha creado muchas teor\u00edas fant\u00e1sticas para la historia de este juego. A pesar de que los controles son algo toscos a veces, la jugabilidad es sencilla y agradable. La ambientaci\u00f3n y dise\u00f1os visuales y sonoros son espectaculares y le vienen como anillo al dedo. Los niveles son variados, interesantes y muy originales en su dise\u00f1os y mec\u00e1nicas. \n\nSolo quisiera mencionar tres aspectos que, a mi parecer, hacen el juego un poco menos disfrutable. El primero es siento que Limbo es particularmente largo. Quiz\u00e1 demasiado para un juego que no usa palabras ni tiene una historia clara. He visto videogu\u00edas completas que van desde cuarenta minutos hasta poco m\u00e1s de una hora, y secciones como las de la persecuci\u00f3n de la ara\u00f1a o toda la parte que involucra agua hacen que el juego, a veces, se sienta bastante tedioso y aburrido, ya que implica esperar mucho tiempo.\n\nDos. A veces, las mec\u00e1nicas son algo injustas. M\u00e1s all\u00e1 de morir de maneras tontas porque se necesitaba un salto largo y el protagonista hace un salto muy corto, hay cosas que de verdad no me gustan. Los \u00faltimos niveles suben bastante la dificultad del juego, a\u00f1adiendo timings muy precisos que, de fallarlos, te cuestan la vida. La manera en la que los controles cambian si est\u00e1s en el techo o en una pared puede agarrar muy desprevenidos a algunos jugadores. A veces te sueltas de las cuerdas de la absoluta nada. A veces parece que vas a llegar en el salto y te quedas demasiado corto. Pero lo m\u00e1s injusto que me ha llegado a pasar es lo siguiente. \n\nSin ponerme demasiado realista, intentando hacer 'speedrun' para sacar un logro he saltado o me he dejado caer desde ciertas alturas para ahorrar algunos segundos. Me choca much\u00edsimo que, en algunos puntos o incluso secciones el ni\u00f1o caiga desde grandes alturas sin que le pase nada, pero en un buen intento de poco m\u00e1s de media hora ca\u00ed desde una altura similar y mor\u00ed de la absoluta nada.\n\nY bueno, hablando de realismo... Dadas las caracter\u00edsticas del juego, el realismo no es TAN importante, pero me genera algo de tirria que el chico sea capaz de agarrarse de sogas o bordes (incluso en plena ca\u00edda), tenga la fuerza suficiente para trepar cuerdas o muros (o, lo que es lo mismo, la fuerza suficiente para levantar dos veces el peso de su propio cuerpo), sea capaz de dar saltos de entre tres y cuatro metros de largo aproximadamente y, en un todo, parezca que tiene entrenamiento de gimnasia (se los digo por experiencia: hacer esas cosas es dif\u00edcil y se requiere mucha fuerza y entrenamiento), pero luego no sea capaz de nadar o, al menos, de aguantar diez segundos la respiraci\u00f3n por debajo del agua.\n\nTercero y \u00faltimo: no me termina de gustar que uno de los logros sea pasarse el juego con un m\u00e1ximo de cinco muertes y en una sola sesi\u00f3n. Lo de las muertes no es lo que me molesta. Al contrario, no me parecer\u00eda mal que el juego te pidiera que lo completaras sin morir, pero s\u00ed me fastidia que deba ser en una sola sesi\u00f3n de juego. Pr\u00e1cticamente te est\u00e1n obligando a durar alrededor de una hora clavado frente al computador y, si pierdes, a empezar todo otra vez, lo cual es tedioso teniendo en cuenta secciones como las de la ara\u00f1a o la del agua. Tuve un buen intento en el que mor\u00ed una sexta vez justo en la parte final, y todo porque llevaba bien el juego hasta ese momento, pero algunas mec\u00e1nicas injustas se metieron en zonas complicadas y, al final, un buen intento qued\u00f3 arruinado y me frustr\u00f3 bastante.\n\nNo son fallos graves que te arruinen la experiencia ni nada de eso. Son cosas menores que molestan por en medio. \n\nPor todo lo dem\u00e1s, Limbo es un verdadero juegazo de plataformeo y puzzles, que vale completamente la pena jugar. \u00bfY el precio? Bueno, si estuviera al doble de lo que cuesta realmente, pagar\u00eda sin dudarlo.

He slowly opens his eyes with great pain. He gets up and finds himself in a big forest. A forest that a boy so small is afraid of. But the boy overcomes fear. Because he has to find his sister\u2026\n\n[h2]Black, white, thousands of colors![/h2]\n\nNothing can be said in praise of the graphics of this wonderful game. The creators of this game have created thousands of colors and images using white and black. The player in all places of the game praises the stunning graphics and the high accuracy of the creators in the design of the environment and objects. In fact, the environment is painted with thousands of shadows and lights, and this has caused a great increase in the beauty of the artistic graphics of this game. In fact, the creators have done a great job and have used thousands of different black and white colors. So that you feel that the whole environment of the game is painted and each color is different from the other. The design of objects in the game is also really wonderful. So that you are surprised by all this precision. From making gears and light bulbs to making a giant spider. An important point has been observed in all of these, that is, quality and accuracy! So I tell you that you will not feel any shortage in the graphics of this game. But in some places the graphics could be stronger.\n\n[h2]Silence is the greatest music[/h2]\n\nThe sounding of this title has been done in a very precise manner and in accordance with the principles. Before dealing with the music of the game, it is necessary to mention the sounds of the objects, movement and various events of the game. From the foot of the spider sinking into the boy's body to the sound of him running on the ground, it is set so precisely that it makes the environment and atmosphere of the game more believable for the player. The sound of the rustling of the wind and the falling and rolling of a stone on the mountain is no different from the real sound of this happening in life and in the real world. It's as if the creators have made a giant spider for sound and stuck its sharp leg in a boy's body and recorded this sound and put it on their game\n\n[h2]And the soundtrack:[/h2]\n\nIn this sector as well, Playdead has been quite successful. It is true that in many scenes silence is the only music of the game, but... but it must be admitted that this silence in the game is wonderful. Silence, next to which real sounds can be heard from the environment of a terrible forest. The silence that multiplies stress and fear in the game. A silence that should really be praised. Of course, the game in its special and emotional parts also has music that is completely in harmony with the events and makes the story more interesting.\n\n[h2]Alone in the forest[/h2]\n\nOne of the most important parts of a game is its gameplay. No matter how great the music, graphics and story of the game are, if the gameplay of that game does not complete the rest, we will definitely face a weak title. But it must be said that this title has not left anything short for the players in this section as well.\n\nWhat do you expect from the gameplay of a platformer title? If in your opinion, the great gameplay of a platformer title should be full of puzzles and different tasks, and you are supposed to face the biggest enemies in the game with simple methods and experience all kinds of vehicles in a very simple but beautiful game, and in general Never get tired of playing that title, I have to tell you that Limbo has a great gameplay.\n\nIn this game, there are no options on the game screen. In fact, you and the up, down, left and right buttons and a button to interact with the environment! There is no amount of life or... in the game, and as it was said, the game environment is completely free of any pictures or signs or writings. It is as if you are sitting in front of an animation screen. In the game you have only 2 modes, alive or dead. There is no middle ground. One mistake will kill you, and doing a simple task correctly will keep you alive, and it is not the case that, for example, your energy or life will decrease and you will be fine again! The game is completely real! Anything can cause death and death is really simple and real!\n\n[h2]An effort for nothing[/h2]\n\nWe talked about all the parts of the game, but now we come to the biggest story of this game: its wonderful story. A story whose many parts are dumb for you. In fact, you and your belief must complete those parts of the game and complete the story. Limbo is made in such a way that everyone can make their own interpretation of it. But all perceptions are actually summed up in one concept. Something that only the player will understand after completing all the stages of the game.\n\nLimbo literally means purgatory. The limbo in which this boy is caught. It's a terrible place for anyone\u2026\nThe player is drowning in thoughts and questions. But the child overcomes the most difficult places. The boy tries his best. Finally, he uses magnetism. He does something difficult and the boy breaks the glass and is thrown in that direction. The boy is unconscious on the ground. Just like the first game...\n\nDoes the player get scared that I have been around myself all this time? What is going to happen to this little boy? The boy opens his eyes again in the same shot as the beginning of the game. He is in pain. He gets up and moves forward. It reaches the same tree house at the beginning of the game. The boy sees his sister crying over her dead body. Does this mean that this was a boy's torment? For what mistake is he tormented? This child who has not done anything to want to suffer in Purgatory. Did I mean something else? But the final message is clear:\n\nThe boy has been dead for a long time.\nBut there are still thousands of questions left in the mind. This game has literally destroyed the player in the story. Of course, the most painful message of the game is determined after the list of creators goes up and the game menu reappears.\n\nBoth the boy and his sister were dead.\nMaybe many have not noticed this message, but if you look carefully, you will see flies flying above the 2 corpses under the tree house...\n\n[h2]Here, several thoughts arise for the player, the best and most complete of which were as follows:[/h2]\n\n[h2]First:[/h2] The boy and his sister go to a tree house in a forest for fun or escape. The boy's sister goes out of the hut for some reason or for example to fetch something. The boy wants to follow him, but suddenly he falls on the ground and dies. The soul of the boy who knows nothing wants to find his sister. But the forest that the player and the boy see is no longer a happy and fun forest. Rather, it is a scary and purgatory environment. A limbo that is never clear why an oppressed boy should face it! When the boy's soul wanders and passes through purgatory, the girl returns to the hut and sees her brother's dead body. The girl cries so much that she dies next to the boy...\n\n[h2]Second:[/h2] The second theory is exactly like the above theory, except that it says that the boy and his sister both fell together and died. The boy was looking for his sister and the sister was looking for her brother. Both of them have been tasting its good torment. The girl's soul finds her brother's body and cries over his body thinking that she is alive. While both of them were dead.\n\nThe second theory is more likely to be true due to the evidence. Because at the end of the game, the girl sees the boy and gets up and runs away. How could he see a ghost if he wasn't dead? In addition, in the middle of the game, a girl can be seen wandering in the forest in several places. Just like his brother.\n\nBut all this is of no importance. Your opinion of this wonderful story is important. A story that many of us still don't understand...\nA game that you have to think about after finishing it...\nTo the boy and his sister.", "timestamp_created": 1686746850, "timestamp_updated": 1696142641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698171138763427734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140044783": {"recommendationid": "140044783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198983900735", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 856, "last_played": 1686746231}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate this game", "timestamp_created": 1686746254, "timestamp_updated": 1686746254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140044689": {"recommendationid": "140044689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144347279", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1686745809}, "language": "english", "review": "A little bit dark if you understand the game until the end. you should play it to know the true meaning of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1686746098, "timestamp_updated": 1686746098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140037198": {"recommendationid": "140037198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289103905", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 1811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1811, "last_played": 1599807327}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such a unique game, one of my top 10 platform games on Steam.\nWhether it be by style, art, atmosphere or story.\nThe first game I played that let me think of purgatory.\n\nAlso this was the game I went for all the achievements to 100% it.\nIt was the beginning, to the marvelous (and enraging) time consuming achievements hunter!", "timestamp_created": 1686731242, "timestamp_updated": 1686731242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528356552124023438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140034559": {"recommendationid": "140034559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846538510", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1686935281}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 45 years old father with a teenage son who loves playing video games.

Developed by Playdead, this indie game captivates with its minimalist visuals, eerie ambiance, and thought-provoking puzzles, creating an unforgettable experience that lingers in the mind long after the game is over.\n\nOne of the standout features of LIMBO is its unique art style.

The lack of hand-holding and explicit instructions adds to the game's allure, allowing players to discover and unravel its secrets at their own pace.\n\nOne of the game's strengths is its ability to create a sense of fear and unease without relying on jump scares or explicit violence. The foreboding atmosphere and the lurking dangers keep players on edge throughout their journey, making every step forward a nerve-wracking experience. LIMBO expertly balances suspense and intrigue, delivering an immersive and emotional narrative that resonates with players on a deep level.\n\nThe relatively short length of LIMBO may be seen as a drawback for some, but it is precisely this brevity that allows the game to maintain its captivating momentum. Each puzzle and encounter feels purposeful, and the concise storytelling keeps players engaged from start to finish. It's a concentrated dose of atmospheric brilliance that leaves a lasting impact.\n\nIn conclusion, LIMBO is a masterclass in atmospheric storytelling and puzzle design.

From the moment you start playing, you are drawn into a grayscale landscape filled with eerie silhouettes and ambient sounds that create a sense of unease and tension.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of \"Limbo\" is its unique art style. The game's visuals are presented in black and white, with stark contrasts and minimalistic details that contribute to the overall sense of foreboding. The use of lighting and shadows is masterfully executed, adding depth and a haunting atmosphere to every scene.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Limbo\" is centered around solving environmental puzzles and overcoming various obstacles. The puzzles are cleverly designed, requiring players to think outside the box and experiment with different approaches. The lack of tutorials or explicit instructions adds to the sense of discovery and encourages players to explore and learn through trial and error.\n\nWhat sets \"Limbo\" apart is its ability to create a sense of vulnerability and tension.As the protagonist,a young boy,you navigate treacherous environments and encounter deadly traps and creatures.The game's unforgiving nature adds to the feeling of constant danger,heightening the suspense and making each success feel rewarding.\n\nWhile \"Limbo\" is an exceptional game,it's important to note that it may not be suitable for everyone.The dark and unsettling themes,along with its challenging puzzles,can be intense and may not appeal to players seeking a more lighthearted experience.Additionally, the narrative is left open to interpretation,which some players may find ambiguous or unsatisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Limbo\" is a remarkable and atmospheric game that delivers a unique and immersive experience.Its striking visual style, engaging puzzles, and eerie ambiance make it a standout title in the indie gaming scene.If you enjoy atmospheric,thought-provoking games with a touch of darkness, \"Limbo\" is definitely worth experiencing.\n\n[b] Ukrainian: [/b]\n[u] \"Limbo\" [/u] - \u0446\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0447\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0456

I've heard this game be described as a horror game, and while there are a few moments that might shock you or motivate you to run, it's not the primary focus of the game to terrify the player.\nAlthough it's not mentioned in-game, the point of the game is for the protagonist, the boy, to find his sister. In his pursuit, you will have to navigate a lot of dangerous environments and enemies.\nIt seems like this game takes place within the same universe as INSIDE, the spiritual successor to LIMBO. Even though it doesn't seem that they share the same location, you can draw parallels between parts of each game (for example, a transition from a natural to an industrial setting, and calming music playing during very stressful and intense timed puzzles). However, LIMBO is much, much less graphic and body-horror focused than INSIDE, so if you are looking to try Playdead games, I would start here.\nMost of the puzzles are intuitively explained, but there are a few that feel a little poorly designed. I had to look up a guide for a puzzle involving a pulley relatively early on in the game, and the solution was something I didn't even think was doable. INSIDE improves on this mostly, though.\nAs far as the story goes: Nearly all storytelling is done environmentally, so pay attention to the environment and use that to speculate on the ending and the world as a whole.

were so stupid on my part i should have just kept trying). this is one of those games where you can be stuck for a good while and then out of nowhere have a eureka moment, so if you have the patience for that then you wont mind the challenges. if you dont tho i totally understand LOL. puzzles aside, the whole atmosphere both visually and aurally of limbo is something very unique and just the right amount of disturbing. because there is no dialogue, its just the sounds of everything around you. wearing headphones with the volume pretty high lemme tell you i JUMPED at many of my deaths. near total silence and then BAM a spider just impaled your heart with its leg. its the small things that make it unsettling, like the sound when limboy's legs break after falling or the animation of his body parts being spewed after being grinded by a saw blade. and also the bodies of children hanging in the background everywhere :/ it would be considered subtle because its in black and white and theres no blood but its still graphic regardless so if youre uncomfortable with that stuff then i wouldnt recommend it. playing was really nostalgic for me because my brother played with me when i was

Developed by Playdead, this indie gem casts players into a hauntingly beautiful monochromatic world where danger lurks at every turn.\n\nFrom the moment you step into Limbo's grim and foreboding environment, you're immediately captivated by its eerie atmosphere. The game's grayscale visuals, accompanied by moody lighting and subtle animations, create an ambiance that is both enchanting and disquieting. The absence of colors allows the game's meticulously crafted environments and intricate level design to shine, immersing you in a world that feels ethereal yet disturbingly real.\n\nLimbo's narrative is entirely wordless, relying solely on visual cues and environmental storytelling to convey its enigmatic tale. As you guide the young protagonist through a macabre landscape filled with perilous traps and enigmatic creatures, you gradually unravel the mystery behind his journey. The story's enigmatic nature leaves much open to interpretation, inviting players to speculate and contemplate its deeper meaning, which adds a layer of intellectual engagement to the experience.\n\nThe true brilliance of Limbo lies in its puzzles, which are ingeniously designed to challenge your wits and intuition. Each obstacle presents a unique and often deadly dilemma that requires careful observation and experimentation to overcome. The game's physics-based puzzles are refreshingly inventive, requiring you to manipulate objects, time movements precisely, and think outside the box to progress. Every triumph over an obstacle feels immensely rewarding, and the sense of satisfaction it elicits is unparalleled.\n\nThe attention to detail in Limbo is simply astonishing. The atmospheric sound design, composed of subtle ambient sounds and eerie melodies, heightens the tension and adds another layer of immersion to the gameplay. Combined with the meticulous animation and seamless controls, the game feels incredibly polished and refined, offering a smooth and intuitive experience from start to finish.\n\nDespite its dark and gloomy tone, Limbo manages to evoke a sense of beauty and wonderment through its artistry and creativity. It is a testament to the fact that games can be emotionally evocative and thought-provoking without relying on excessive dialogue or flashy graphics.\n\nLimbo is a breathtaking journey that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming. Its combination of artistic prowess, atmospheric brilliance, and ingenious puzzles makes it an unforgettable experience that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. If you're a fan of immersive storytelling and enjoy intellectual challenges, Limbo is an absolute must-play, an exceptional masterpiece that showcases the true potential of indie gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1684391140, "timestamp_updated": 1684403040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138470251": {"recommendationid": "138470251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398398796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1684386473}, "language": "english", "review": "While the game as a whole is fairly short in length, I thought it was fun and some of the puzzles were really tough.", "timestamp_created": 1684386725, "timestamp_updated": 1684386725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138466744": {"recommendationid": "138466744", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099695372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1684379937}, "language": "english", "review": "noice", "timestamp_created": 1684379956, "timestamp_updated": 1684379956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138456902": {"recommendationid": "138456902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129193287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1426, "last_played": 1684359810}, "language": "english", "review": "Much as I would recommend to at the very least take a *look* at this game for its beautiful aesthetics, I have words on its gameplay and puzzle elements. The controls are easy and straightforward; the movement associated with those is fine enough. Unfortunately, the animations slow down the response time, creating a slight input lag of a sort. In a game not based around timing, that would be perfectly acceptable. This game hinges on it. Most timing windows are extremely narrow and failing them means death.

The game's eerie aesthetics, challenging puzzles, and engaging gameplay make for an experience I won't forget any time soon (for my girlfriend was a little too hardcore but she finally enjoyed it).\n\nRight from the start, Limbo's grayscale visuals and minimalistic sound design create a unique atmosphere that is simultaneously haunting and enchanting. The game plunges you into a world of silhouettes and shadows, with background details that are both intriguing and unsettling. The sparse use of sound and music adds to the eerie ambience, making even the quietest moments feel tense.\n\nThe story in Limbo is minimalistic, yet powerful. You play as a young boy searching for his sister in an eerie, otherworldly landscape. The game doesn't rely on exposition or dialogue; instead, it allows you to interpret the narrative based on the environment and situations you encounter. This leaves room for personal interpretation and makes the experience feel more immersive and mysterious.\n\nLimbo's gameplay is a well-balanced blend of platforming and puzzle-solving. The game constantly introduces new mechanics and challenges that force you to think critically and adapt your approach. The puzzles range from simple physics-based conundrums to intricate, multi-layered challenges that require patience and a keen eye for detail. The game is never too easy, but it also never feels unfair, striking the perfect balance of difficulty.\n\nPlaying Limbo on Ubuntu was a smooth experience. The game runs flawlessly, and the controls are responsive and intuitive. It's clear that the developers put thought into making the game accessible to Linux users, which is much appreciated.\n\nIt's hard to find any drawbacks in Limbo. While some players might argue that the game's relatively short length is a downside, I see completing it in under six hours as a significant advantage. In an era where many games and series tend to drag on and eventually lose their charm or deliver unsatisfying endings, Limbo's concise nature is a breath of fresh air. Furthermore, for those with limited gaming time, Limbo serves as the perfect escape, offering a rich and satisfying experience without demanding an excessive time investment.", "timestamp_created": 1683397915, "timestamp_updated": 1683397915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137896974": {"recommendationid": "137896974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088817092", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1683395467}, "language": "english", "review": "LIMBO is a short but fun 2D Puzzle platformer that despite its age still looks really good to this day and very smooth to control,the game may seem simple on the surface but id say the puzzles do require some brain power to solve and with the platforming sections being  reasonably challenging.       \n\nOverall a fun 2D platformer that has a unique look to it, feels smooth to control,difficult puzzles and decent platforming and decent run time for a game of its type, ideally buy on sale abit steep on price.", "timestamp_created": 1683396413, "timestamp_updated": 1683396413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137895763": {"recommendationid": "137895763", "author": {"steamid": "76561199447397589", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1683394121}, "language": "spanish", "review": "LO BUENO:\nMuy buen dise\u00f1o de niveles.

Basically, Limbo is a masterpiece that deserves more recognition.\n\n I'll talk about the gameplay further in the review, but I recommend that you play Limbo before you read the next part of my review. Just know that I give this game a 9.5/10.\n\n[spoiler] This game is an amazing puzzle platformer. It has incredibly stressfull moments that are followed by calm and stressless puzzles. Of course, when the game knows that you know how some mechanics work, it'll make sure to test your skills with a difficult to beat mix of platforms and puzzles that you will eventually be able to surpass. Basically, the gameplay is very well designed.\n\nNow let's talk about the ost. The ost of this game is beyond awesome, it fits so well with the game that if you would get rid of it, the game would feel empty, as if the game was missing a limb. The ost is dark, ominous and made to make you feel like the world that you're in doesn't want you to live in it. You should listen to it, you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nFinally, the visuals. I feel like Limbo is only know for it's visuals and not for anything else. I can see why that would be the case, Limbo has a PERFECT artstyle that I love so much. It's as if my eyes just witnessed the peak of art. Thsi game just looks so fucking Good.

You will cross forests, caves, and industrial areas to get to her. This game is fairly known for having a unique style, everything is in shadowy black and white. Despite its style, I wouldn't really call it a horror game, as it is not scary and has no scary moments whatsoever. It just has a dark atmosphere and shadow-looking characters.\n\nGameplay is linear, basically your objective is to go right as far as you can. But there are obstacles along the way, from simple ones such as jumping gaps, to more complex ones such as outsmarting enemies, avoiding traps, and solving puzzles. Some puzzles are physics-based, and they start out easy, but later on it gets more complicated and relies on timing and precision. There's also collectibles, in the form of glowing eggs, If you collect all of them (you can use chapter select) you'll be able to enter a secret area. It's pretty difficult, since the whole area is dark and you're unable to see anything. You'll have to rely on audio cues to predict the level.\n\nI know it may feel like heresy, but to be honest I am not really a fan of this game. It's quite difficult (though never impossible) in some areas in the later chapters, and starts to feel like a chore. My favorite parts of the game are the ones where you fight the giant spider with traps and environmental hazards, but sadly there are not many levels like that, most of the time it just feels like one puzzle after another. The story is also almost nonexistent besides \"boy must find sister\" as there are no dialogues or anything. Oh and the secret area? Trial-and-error-fest, even more than the whole game.\n\nLimbo is an important indie game, even more when you realize it's released in 2011 where stylized indie games are probably still very few. It's still a pretty unique game, just don't expect a relaxing time when playing through. Their next game Inside seems to improve upon many things, like being more story-based, colorful, and most importantly easier. But it is very cheap on sale, so it might be worth checking out if you're into platformers and can handle frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1683018936, "timestamp_updated": 1683018936, "voted_up":

The game's black-and-white art style creates a dark and eerie atmosphere that perfectly matches the game's themes of death, danger, and exploration.\n\nThe game's puzzles are challenging yet fair, requiring players to use their wits and problem-solving skills to progress through the game's levels. Each puzzle is expertly designed and offers a unique challenge that will keep players engaged and motivated.\n\nThe game's platforming mechanics are also exceptional, with precise controls and physics that make movement feel satisfying and responsive. The game's levels are cleverly designed, offering a mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat that never feels repetitive or dull.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its narrative, which is told without any dialogue or text. Instead, players must piece together the story through the environment, the actions of the characters, and the events that unfold. The result is a deeply immersive and engaging experience that rewards careful observation and attention to detail.\n\nThe game's sound design is also exceptional, with a haunting and atmospheric score that perfectly matches the game's visuals and themes. Every sound in the game is expertly crafted to create an immersive and engaging experience that draws players into the world of Limbo.\n\nOverall, Limbo is a masterpiece of game design that has stood the test of time.

I don't think I can, in good faith, recommend this to most people. the atmosphere is great, the world is intriguing and horrifying, but the game plays awful. There are sections that are extremely slow and require waiting for a pretty long time, but if you die you go straight back to the beginning of them and have to wait through the slow moment again. If you die again, guess what you have to do again: wait through the slow moment. I probably wasted a good 5 or 10 minutes in a couple chapters of this game just because I had to wait before I could do anything, and then died either because of my own incompetence or because of the floaty and hard to predict controls.\n\nNot only that, but this game also has very little to do for options. The ingame options only allow you to change the brightness. The rest of the options aren't in the game, but in an options text file that is in the game's folder. Those options don't even allow you to change that much. The two most prominent options in there are turning off controller vibrations (more on that shortly) and changing the game to windowed mode.\n\nFor some reason, the game is also terribly optimized. Once you reach a certain point in the game (probably about half an hour in), it randomly begins to drop frames to as low as like 5 fps, and thats on my PC with a 3070 TI. The way to fix it? turning off controller vibration. How do you make a game where controller vibration affects the graphical output of the game. \n\nBasically, the game is clunky, aggravating, and not user friendly. If you can pick it up cheap (like the $0.99 that it's on sale for at the time of writing the review), it's probably worth it to play a classic game.

The visuals are smushed, as if the resolution is low, and I found no video options to change it. The contrast of raw white and black was jarring even when I wasn't playing at night. Left-CTRL is used to grab objects, but this isn't explained. If you touch water you die, yet you can sometimes throw yourself off the map and survive.\n\nLimbo often plays like a 2D physics game, but the puzzle solutions are either basic or make no sense, which is surprising because the lack of video settings as a platformer makes it feel like one of those platformer shovelware games. I'd say it was surprising in a bad way, as the design feels incoherent, where the focus should have been on making the gameplay flow - if you can drag things that are probably too heavy to be dragged or would snap your hands off, then why can't you climb a few feet or stand in shallow water?\n\nThe theme is edgy, and a lot of the puzzles are totally nonsensical. Why couldn't they add some hint of intuition? How are you supposed to feel immersed if you keep tabbing out to check a walkthrough? I feel like platformers should be engaging, not confusing. Is this worth \u00a38.99? I don't think so. Why would I recommend a game to friends if I had to relay the hints for the most basic things like controls when the game should do it itself?

Congratulations! Now, let's talk about this hauntingly beautiful game.\n\nFirst of all, can we talk about the art style? It's like Tim Burton and Salvador Dali had a baby and it grew up to make video games. The black and white aesthetic is simple yet stunning, and the use of lighting and shadows is nothing short of masterful.\n\nBut let's get to the real heart of the game: the puzzles. Limbo is like a Rubik's Cube that wants to kill you. Every level presents a new challenge, and just when you think you've got it figured out, the game throws a curveball at you. And let's not forget about the traps. If you're not careful, you'll end up impaled on spikes, sliced in half by a saw, or drowned in a pool of water. Fun times.\n\nBut despite all the challenges, the feeling of satisfaction when you finally solve a puzzle is unbeatable. It's like you're a genius, even though you probably just got lucky. And with all the achievements under your belt, you can finally say that you've truly conquered Limbo.\n\nOverall, Limbo is a stunning and challenging game that will keep you on your toes...or on your back, bleeding out. If you're a fan of puzzle games, artistic masterpieces, and the occasional death trap, then this game is a must-play.

The open ending of the game allows for interpretation, with two theories standing out.\n\nOne theory presents a religious vision of Catholic limbo, where virtuous people who have not accepted Christianity for various reasons are sent to limbo. By the time the game begins, the protagonist and his sister are already dead, and the puzzles lead them to their final meeting that will help them move into the afterlife.\n\nThe second theory suggests that the protagonist killed his sister and is now trapped in a cycle of reliving this path. Evidence supporting this theory is the staircase from the end of the game, which appears in the main menu and is rotten with two corpses at the bottom.\n\nSolving puzzles is the main mechanic of the game, and while some puzzles may not seem logical, they are always intriguing. The game's design and atmosphere will keep players engaged for 1-2 hours, or around 6-10 hours if they aim to unlock all possible achievements.\n\nIt's important to note that the game is not recommended for those with arachnophobia or discomfort with the game's themes.

Hay claramente mucho que destacar como por ejemplo: La buena banda sonora acompa\u00f1ada de los buenos efectos de sonido, una buena ambientaci\u00f3n, una historia aunque corta pero destacable y muy bien ambientada con lo anterior ya mencionado, y lo m\u00e1s sobresaliente en mi opini\u00f3n; los puzzles.

You may even find the right solution early, but slightly missing a jump could put you off that solution as the game doesn't provide any feedback. Once you finally get through that section, it feels like lucking into the right solution instead of the result of smart play.\n\nThe early chapters were pretty good so its not a terrible game in the least, but I felt pot-committed to finish the game in the second half.

Evidence of the theory is the staircase from the final of the game, which appears in the main menu, but there it is rotten and with two corpses at the bottom. [/olist]\n\nSolving puzzles is the core mechanic of the game, and while some puzzles may not seem logical, they are always interesting. The game's atmosphere and design will keep you engaged for about 1-2 hours, or around 6-10 hours if you aim to unlock all possible achievements.\n\nIt's worth noting that the game is not suitable for those with arachnophobia or a discomfort with the game's themes.

It is a decently challenging puzzle game and not much else. But it doesn't need to be anything more than that, because the game executes the puzzles very well. The game starts off with introductory puzzles that aren't too hard and introduce the player to the game and slowly build up in difficulty over-time.

Truly art in a videogame.\n\nThere is no story (more or less), but the closest thing we have is that the boy (protagonist) is in search of his sister. In this way  he proposes to cross a misterious and dark world. \n\nIt's easy to understand how to play: arrows for movements, CTRL for actions. The game progresses with puzzles, where you need to time in most of them and use logic. Many times can be frustrating to miss an obstacle because a second.\n\nBut the cherry on the top of Limbo is the graphics and art. Despite using from white, black and tones of gray, is impressive how beautiful and misterious can the scenario be, and with the lack of colors, the game feels better. The scenario changes from a forest to a factory and the roofs of a town. Definitely Playdead made a good job with this. \n\nIncluded with the art, the soundtrack and sound effects are like a ring to the finger. There is barely music, but it makes you feel in other world. A world that you are the outlander, where you don't know if you are alone or someone is watching you... The sound effects are truly good too, feeling natural. \n\nThe game includes 13 archiements, where 10 are related to finding eggs (collectibles), one is about finishing the game, one is related to a secret after finding the eggs and the last one is a pain in the ass: NO POINT IN DYING. Basically, completing the game dying no more than 5 times. Despite being short and with most of the puzzles being easy to memorize, many times you will rage after almost finishing the game and flopping, making it the 6th death. Oh, also includes badges.\n\nFrom my point of view, it's truly overpriced. For a game from 2010, which you can finish in 1h and is too simple, I wouldn't spend the 10\u20ac it costs. Instead, buy it on sales when it's 1\u20ac, the price that deserves.\n\nJust like I mentioned, Limbo is a truly unique gaming experience which you can live in the first playthrough, and something every gamer should experience at least once", "timestamp_created": 1679230573, "timestamp_updated": 1679230573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520201981067657471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134963845": {"recommendationid": "134963845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198972688145", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1679228816}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego.

The protagonist of the game, a young boy searching for his missing sister, can be seen as a representation of humanity as a whole, seeking to understand its place in the world.\n\nThe dark, monochromatic setting of the game can be seen as a symbol for the existential void that many people feel when confronted with the fundamental questions of life, such as the meaning of existence and the nature of reality. The puzzles that the player must solve in order to progress through the game can be seen as representations of the obstacles and challenges that we face in our own lives as we try to find meaning and purpose.\n\nUltimately, the game's open-ended narrative and ambiguous ending can be seen as a reflection of the fact that there are no easy answers to the big questions of life. Instead, the game encourages us to think deeply about these questions and to come to our own conclusions about what it means to be human.\n\nOverall, Limbo is a thought-provoking and deeply philosophical game that invites players to explore some of the most fundamental questions of human existence.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1678770169, "timestamp_updated": 1678770169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134632955": {"recommendationid": "134632955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834802952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1679010407}, "language": "english", "review": "no WASD? on a keyboard? why? idk\nstory is lacking / barely there\ngameplay is mostly just a test of patience\nart is decent enough\nwouldnt play a 2nd time but the price is cheap and you can see the devs progress from LIMBO to INSIDE.\ndont expect this to be INSIDE and youll be alright", "timestamp_created": 1678767386, "timestamp_updated": 1679011198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015263080596924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134632732": {"recommendationid": "134632732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198824902128", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1695921030}, "language": "spanish", "review": "God con todo el afan de halagar", "timestamp_created": 1678766865, "timestamp_updated": 1678766865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134632438": {"recommendationid": "134632438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040668794", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1679430585}, "language": "english", "review": "Very immersive story for a game with no dialogue.

It's loved because it made people succumb to it. Step by step, you get absorbed in the chirping of critters, buzzing of flies, and echoes of dripping water. The droning soundscape pertains to immersion and feels like having high blood pressure. Coated in layers of milky dead light and shadowy mist, you enter a spiralling world of dampened madness that deals in last-ditch efforts and split-second saves. There's always a sense of threat in its stuffy air, and barely any breathing room between instances when your boy becomes prey to another predatory menace. This is only appropriate, for the stakes are high - he submerged to break out his sister.\n\nI only know it because it's written on the store page, don't expect a plot. But expect to see kids nonchalantly squashed by industrial presses. The game's world brings upon a foreboding sensation of uncaring cruelty, pitched again the boy's vulnerability, firmly tapping into the realms of morbid existential horror. Purgatory tortures you with things you don't want to see, beings you'd rather stay away from, and places you desire to be inside the least. It doesn't fancy you being there either, returning violation for violation. Although, violence is applied purposefully, transforming your mutual revulsion into the main attraction. That place doesn't hate you, doesn't want you, it doesn't think of you at all. This is one uncanny property, which makes our generally self-centred worldview shrink and tremble.\n\n[h3]Substance[/h3]\nSurprisingly, the game is mechanically sound, it's not just about going right. But it's mostly about going down the drain of doom and facing creepy, slimy, miserable abominations lurking within its premises. The boy can't swim, but he can jump, pull up, swing, climb, push, and pull. LIMBO teaches you all that without saying a word. I'd say the controls are a bit wonky, aimed at showing off smooth animations rather than immediately reacting to your presses, but it's not a big deal due to relatively slow pace and frequent autosaves. You'll need them in that cursed place where every jump is impossible, every boulder or spike misses you by a hair, every living and non-living thing is death.\n\nIn LIMBO, you'll see no reverence for the dead and nothing but disdain for life itself. Corpses to climb, corpses to solve puzzles with, corpses to use as snowboards. There's enough fun to be had without making your own, though. A few thrilling chases make way for decently varied puzzles, the crux of it all. Those are uncomplicated, yet clever and elegant. A couple of them were able to stump me for quite a while, this game isn't that easy. I've heard an opinion that it's somehow boring or tedious. How tedious can it be if barely any challenge lasts a minute? And how can it be boring if there's no downtime? Although, I understand why some may have disliked it when the setting switched from the gloomy woods to an industrial area. I also thought it was bland in comparison.\n\n[h3]Closure[/h3]\nLIMBO was out before the puzzle platformer formula was refined by Inside and Little Nightmares, hence, I didn't expect the same level of panache initially. But it struck a chord with me, then two, three, all of them at once! It didn't feel as if I was dealing with some inanimate relic like a useless old sock without a pair. I saw that this game couldn't be anything but a child of love whose soaring to fame wasn't a fluke. It holds up in the present, it will always hold up, and its past success wasn't about coming out at the right time and place. It's about every trick in its book coming from genuine artistic integrity. I firmly believe that LIMBO deserves the praise received and a place in the pantheon of semi-modern classics.

As progress is made throughout the game's challenges continue to grow more difficult forcing players to solve increasingly complex puzzles while overcoming obstacles before moving forward towards uncovering answers about their haunting surroundings.\n\nLIMBO possesses a particular talent for inducing apprehension and unease by means that do not involve jarring surprises or graphic violence. By weaving subtle suggestions and indications, the game manages to sustain interest in its narrative while also presenting cerebral quandaries whose resolution delivers deep gratification.\n\nOne remarkable feature of LIMBO is its implementation of gameplay based on trial and error. Frequently, the gamer must try new approaches and solutions to advance in the game, which occasionally leads to irritation but ultimately grants a satisfying experience.\n\nLIMBO is an exceptional and captivating adventure that demands to be played. Its haunting ambiance, perplexing enigmas, and skillful narrative come together harmoniously to produce a genuinely memorable game encounter.\n\nOverall, LIMBO is a unique and immersive experience that is well worth playing.

The atmosphere is also a key selling point, and some of the deaths are so grisly and gruesome you can't help but laugh.", "timestamp_created": 1675463397, "timestamp_updated": 1675463397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132133288": {"recommendationid": "132133288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035735717", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1675440713}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game back in 2011 (pirated) and never finished it I was few chapters behind almost to the finish but completely forgot abt it, Bought the game on steam 5 or 6 years ago on sale,\nAgain did the same thing didn't play it at all. \ngame is sitting in the library \nfinally I decided to give it a go\nplayed it for a few hours reached the last few chapters got stuck, Then I went on Youtube \nhad no choice those last few levels are a bit impossible to figure out without a guide trust me there is no hint in this game. \nFinally finished the Game felt good end of story \nI give it 4 stars out of 5 anyways.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1675441741, "timestamp_updated": 1675442945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132109835": {"recommendationid": "132109835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060188700", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1485456227}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores INDIES que he jugado, me encanta la ambientaci\u00f3n, el estilo, que sea a blanco y negro, etc.", "timestamp_created": 1675409260, "timestamp_updated": 1675409260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132069395": {"recommendationid": "132069395", "author": {"steamid": "76561199139230394", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 186, "last_played": 1675352756}, "language": "english", "review": "short but good. a classic", "timestamp_created": 1675352771, "timestamp_updated": 1675352771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132041316": {"recommendationid": "132041316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198805496446", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 385, "last_played": 1675308744}, "language": "english", "review": "It wasn't frustrating at all to die 100 times, until my last achievement.

juego que originalmente sali\u00f3 para PS3 y en su momento estaba catalogado como uno de los m\u00e1s recomendados del sistema.\nA mi juicio casi podr\u00eda asegurar que el juego fu\u00e9 hecho en Flash, pero para que gr\u00e1ficamente se diferenciara del resto decidieron hacerlo sumamente oscuro y atmosf\u00e9rico, jugada que les sali\u00f3 redond\u00edsima porque lograron crear algo atrapante y misteriosamente envolvente, creo que a partir de aqu\u00ed se crea el g\u00e9nero de plataforma de terror/noir sin ser necesariamente un survival.\n\nHay muchas cosas a resaltar de Limbo, como su jugabilidad simple de correr/saltar/agarrar y con esos 3 elementos ya est\u00e1s listo para resolver puzzles que pueden ir desde lo sencillo hasta lo un tanto complicado, eso s\u00ed, como todo en este juego es impl\u00edcito no se siente que se est\u00e9 relatando una historia como s\u00ed suced\u00eda con Inside, hay piezas que no encajan del todo, por lo que podr\u00edamos decir que aqu\u00ed experimentaron con diversas formas de divertir y perturbar al mismo tiempo, por ende la historia aqu\u00ed la mantuvieron sumamente sencilla para poder implementar cualquier cosa que no pudiese tener una explicaci\u00f3n l\u00f3gica, una forma bastante ingeniosa para ahorrarse al guionista.\n\nEn esta atm\u00f3sfera todo es inexpresivo, el \u00fanico atisbo de humanidad que podemos ver est\u00e1 en los ojos blancos de nuestro protagonista, que dicho sea de paso tambi\u00e9n es un ni\u00f1o, pero sus dos globos oculares hacen presencia ah\u00ed solo para decirnos que manejamos a un ser humano y es todo lo que vamos a ver hasta no llegar al final.\n\nLos enemigos a veces son inexistentes, parece que solo somos nosotros en una naturaleza de formas exageradas donde son los insectos sin definir los que generan este escenario, mientras la mayor parte del tiempo hay escaleras, cajas, plataformas colgantes y algunas m\u00e1quinarias tanto rurales como cient\u00edficas.\n\nEso s\u00ed, todos estos elementos conforman varios puzzles a resolver, y es tal la cantidad de creatividad que le metieron aqu\u00ed que con solo dos cajas son capaces de dejarte atascado durante horas antes de que te des cuenta que la soluci\u00f3n necesitaba de un buen momento de reflexi\u00f3n y l\u00f3gica.\n\nHay ocasiones en que aparecer\u00e1n insectos par\u00e1sitos que definen nuestra jugabilidad y donde somo podemos ir en una sola direcci\u00f3n sin ninguna otra decisi\u00f3n m\u00e1s que saltar y avanzar, pero siempre procurando hallar una fuente de luz natural que pueda derretirlos como si fueran \u00e1cido.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n del juego es muy relativo, se disfruta tanto que en un d\u00eda podr\u00edas terminarlo, o por el contrario te puedes llegar a atascar tanto, que preferir\u00e1s hacer otras cosas y dejarlo para otro d\u00eda.\n\nLa parte final es una aut\u00e9ntica voladera de cabeza, no solo por estar bien ambientado sino porque supieron complementarse con los puzzles (que dicho sea de paso dejaron los m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles para el final), es sorprendente que el ultimo de ellos sea uno de los desaf\u00edos mas dif\u00edciles que se puedan llegar a resolver porque requiere coordinaci\u00f3n, ritmo y precisi\u00f3n.\n\nPara ser el primer juego con el que debuta Playdead debo decir que el trabajo es muy sobresaliente y recomendado sin lugar a dudas, lo que no deja de sorprenderme (aparte del hecho de que a pesar de haber cumplido 12 a\u00f1os en los que se sigue sosteniendo bien como todo buen cl\u00e1sico) es que no dejan de salir parches para arreglar problemas menores mientras siguen trabajando en su misterioso tercer juego del que espero tengamos cuando menos un trailer.\n",

It would be good to say that I dont have anything against this particular game, but this genre more generally (hence the positive review despite the subsequent complaining). Second, I clearly lack some creative-thinking component of my brain, because the puzzles seem so obvious in hindsight but I didnt have a hope in hell in solving them, and that absolutely influenced my experience of the game.\n\nThe atmosphere was quite nice though. The game has such a lonely feel to it, in a tranquil, peaceful sense (except for all the things trying to kill you). The game does a great job at making you feel small, and feel fairly helpless in the face of such ominous, imposing situations. The visuals are also striking and still unique to this day. I think the gore, and especially the fact that these were the violent deaths of a child, which are usually not depicted in media, helped this game get attention. The grey-scale means that things can stick out quite easily when the devs want it to (like sparks or brain-worms) which helps when recognizing affordances or pertinent points of information. Even when not white, important objects usually stick out very clearly against the background. I never had issues figuring out WHAT I should use to solve the puzzles, only HOW I should be solving them.\n\nIn my experience, this game had a healthy bit of \u2018just blindly try stuff and see what happens\u2019. The game has you replay the same section countless times (dying countless times) to learn slightly more about the puzzle each time, until you eventually figure it out.\n\nAnd with all of this trial and error, I find it especially frustrating that when I know my fate is sealed (I know I am screwed and am going to die) the game really takes it sweet time delivering it. I die, slow animation, pause, slow fade to black, slow respawn. It feels like a lot of unnecessary waiting in between attempts, especially for a game that asks you to try the game jump 20 times to make it. I get that they are trying to produce an atmosphere and mood for the game, but it wasn't for me.\n\nI found that the vagueness of the controls and the sometimes cryptic nature of the clues caused quite a frustrating experience. Because the movements (jumps specifically) require exquisite timing, the game often has you doubting yourself, and wondering if the solution you have found is really a solution at all (\u201dDid I miss this jump because of my mistake, or is there something I am not considering that is needed to make this jump?\u201d). It feels really frustrating to think that progress towards the whole game is impeded by a stupid jump that you feel like you should make but cant for variables that you cant account for, and cant influence. There were plenty of moments I felt like I was going to have an aneurysm because you are cm away from your goal but you miss the jump or something else goes wrong. Wait for the painfully slow fade to black and respawn, try again x50.\n\nExample of some of the annoying quirks:\nYou have to hit a switch and then jump onto this rope before the platform that holds the rope moves too far out of your reach. First you try hitting the switch and then running to the rope to grab on before it moves away. That doesnt work. Okay, was it your timing? Was it something else? You don't know, no feedback.  Try ten more times to be sure. Go on YouTube, turns out you have to get the rope swinging before you jump. Okay, start swinging, try to jump off, no bitch, turns out you cant swing on the rope and jump down at the same time, that just stops the rope. Try again. Try to jump off. No bitch, because you have to shimmy down the rope now to get off, which stops the rope. Try again. Finally you figure it out. You get it swinging, jump off, turn on the switch, and after the 100th attempt you manage to land on the rope as its swinging in the correct position WHILE the platform is moving away from you. You try to jump off, no bitch, remember you have to shimmy down the rope. Because there is no jump, you kinda fall off the rope, right onto the obstacle you were trying to avoid in the first place, now time to repeat this all over again.\n\nAnd my last though: the clues are extremely subtle, sometimes you cant be sure if it was just an animation or a clue. So you begin to interpret everything as potentially meaningful, which is probably the right move. Example: an insect\u2019s slightest movement turned out to be a clue that he reacts to quick movement and that you should move slowly and gently. But you have to jump from exactly the right place to make it, which requires a bunch of attempts to find that magic spot to jump from. \n\nThe game is frustrating because you feel like you have tried everything, then the answer is so obvious you feel stupid and that you wasted your time. I really don't think I would have gotten half as far as I did if it weren't for YouTube. 3/4 through the game I just gave up and watched the rest on YouTube play through to see if I missed anything\n\nTurns out the story was also very vague and (deliberately) left open to interpretation.\n\nObviously this is a classic for some, but I just couldn't get into it", "timestamp_created": 1672997071, "timestamp_updated": 1672997071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130253952": {"recommendationid": "130253952", "author": {"steamid": "76561199247128856", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1672914374}, "language": "english", "review": "Very chill at first, then it starts to hit", "timestamp_created": 1672994738, "timestamp_updated": 1672994738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559050261974334717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130251092": {"recommendationid": "130251092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135669294", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1676361526}, "language": "english", "review": "goosebumps.", "timestamp_created": 1672990810, "timestamp_updated": 1672990810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130249609": {"recommendationid": "130249609", "author": {"steamid": "76561199383504448", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1674447424}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Although i have a respect for how LIMBO encourages you to both think outside the box and observe your environment, the \"puzzles\" too often end up as Meatboy-esque ripoffs of superior platformers which require overly precise timing and movement in a game that isn't built for such things. This comes to an absolute peak in the [spoiler]secret level[/spoiler] which isn't even puzzles anymore, just obnoxious platforming.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I worded that first sentence very carefully. So why am I giving it a negative rating? It's been in my library for literally years, probably from a Humble Bundle a decade ago, and I played it on my Deck because I can't imagine playing it on a big screen.\n\nSimply put, they don't make platformers like they used to, which is why it went untouched. This is a fantastic art piece, often characteristic of a lot of very indie games, but as a game it's exceptionally shallow and gimmicky, also like a lot of indies. It's essentially a 2D walking simulator. The mood, the sound effects, the graphics, the animations, all on point. But as someone who is used to platformers of old from the likes of Apogee and Epic, it's a step backwards. Your mind wanders as you hold the (in my case) analog stick right for about half a minute until you get to the next puzzle/enemy, and it runs out of ideas pretty quickly.\n\nI enjoy looking at it and hearing it, but it doesn't *do* anything of serious note with that mood.\n\nI hear that Inside has a bit more going on.
