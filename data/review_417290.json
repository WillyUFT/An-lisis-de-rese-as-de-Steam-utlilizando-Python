That said, the steam reviews for this game are 70%+ positive as of writing, so maybe I'm completely wrong here. Here are a few more positives to help you make that decision for yourself:\n- The animations are spectacular. My understanding is this game was mostly created by a solo dev, an accomplished 3D animator, so that makes sense, but also the amount of work put into this game in most respects is seriously impressive.\n- The characters are diverse and complex, especially for such a short experience. They're easily my favorite part of this game, along with...\n- The world-building. There's an enormous sense of history and context outside of the small story told here. I'm usually bored by lore dumps, but I read every single highlighted text entry in this game (sometimes multiple times which gave me additional insight) and enjoyed all of them. I wish the developer and story writer had been given a larger team to work with to really build out the world and the mechanics, they're both frighteningly talented\n- The music is gorgeous and adds greatly to the emotional impact of exploring each area\n\nSo, unfortunately that leaves the rest of the game as a bit of a mess. Your character, a mouse, coexists in a world with numerous other species who are nearly all significantly larger and more powerful than you. You're therefore encouraged (forced?) to rely on stealth and cunning to survive. If this story and world were paired with a thief style stealth system, it could be perfect. As is though, most of the stealth mechanics quickly become a chore to engage with. Enemies are on simple fixed patrols and the limited methods of incapacitating them are severely time limited. Certain disguises later on give you the ability to ignore stealth entirely, and at that point the only remaining gameplay mechanics are managing resources like fuel for your lantern (not difficult or strictly necessary) and some abysmally finicky 3rd person platforming. All of your deaths in this game will likely be from failed jumps or accidentally slipping off a piece of awkward geometry. Without those, it's practically a walking simulator with a sprint button.\n\nEvery single quest in this game is a fetch quest. Contextually, from a story perspective, practically all of these quests are meaningful, which is great in theory. Mechanically, however, they're a chore, and seriously bog the game down very early. There are no objective markers, no fast travel, and you only unlock a limited 'thief-o-vision' partway through, so without a guide you're basically scrambling all over the map trying to interact with everything multiple times like the most tedious point and click adventure game you could imagine. What's worse, it's very easy to miss out on optional quests and dialog if you're not constantly going back through old areas and repeatedly checking in with numerous NPCs, some of which add crucial details to the overall story. I bounced off this game multiple times and eventually completed it using a 100% guide which ended up being a far more enjoyable experience, though not without frustration at the platforming sections. So much of what this game could be from a gameplay standpoint is clearly limited by the resources of a one-dev team, but that doesn't change how unpleasant it feels to play without an omniscient knowledge of where and when all of the key items appear.\n\nA note about the story (spoilers ahead):\n[spoiler] As well written as the story is, it also just ends almost without warning. It feels like watching the first and only season of a cancelled TV show. You find the path to your missing wife, assemble your resources, and then get into a boat to find her and... the credits roll. It's not the kind of ambiguous ending which leaves you satisfied, but with more questions. It just feels like there wasn't enough time or money to finish the game. I would love to see a sequel done by a larger team but with the same quality of writing and characterization. [/spoiler]\n\nSo, that all sucks, especially when it's hard to do justice to how good the writing is in this game. All of the dialog is delivered through text boxes with the game paused in the background, and yet certain moments made me laugh out loud while others had me almost in tears. You'd just have to wade through 10-15 hours of multiplying fetch quests and trivial stealth to experience them.", "timestamp_created": 1697856165, "timestamp_updated": 1697856165, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599919676780700684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148562555": {"recommendationid": "148562555", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233060095", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 123, "playtime_at_review": 1077, "last_played": 1700584797}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't expect this game to be so addicting. \nThe cute design and interesting story kept me playing for hours.\nI'm not done yet, but wanted to do a review.\n\nThe riddles are good and if you are stuck you can try to find some help in-game.

The game definitely isn't horrible and there were definitely some redeeming qualities. However, the core game-play loop just isn't fun. The game basically is just a series of fetch quests with the occasional, relatively easy puzzle sprinkled in. Do I regret playing the game, no. But I can't \"recommend\" the game when there are plenty of others that cost the same or less, are more fun to play, and hit the same notes that this game is going for. \n\nThe stealth elements are relatively easy and are pretty much optional apart from the very early game. Getting caught is hardly a nuisance because you can easily just sprint past the gaurds. Additionally you get a suit of armor disguise relatively early in the game that negates the need for sneaking entirely. So ultimately this game pretty much turns into a walking simulator. This isn't improved upon by the fact that it can take a while to get from A to B because the map is both large and tricky to navigate at first.  The game attempts to get around this by littering the map with shortcuts that reward you for learning the layout of the map.

I wish, however, that the gameplay matched the game's visual brilliance.\n\nPositioned as a stealth game, it quickly undermines its own foundation right from the start, allowing players to wear enemy armor and completely forget about stealth. Even if you choose to forego the armor, you'll soon realize that running past enemies is faster than sneaking from cover to cover. Moreover, if you are spotted, the punishment is minimal - you may get hit once or twice, but once you hide from the enemy, you can continue running past their comrades with ease.\n\nThe quests in the game are quite dreadful. About half of them involve either waiting for a specific time of day or going to bed to skip time. Approximately 75% of the quests require collecting unnecessary trinkets like mushrooms, maps, clothing, flags, and other items, turning the game into a monotonous fetch-quest ordeal.\n\nThe primary mode of transportation seems to be sprinting from one short path to another to minimize the time spent on quests. In an apparent attempt to lengthen the game's duration further, the developers severely restrict stamina regeneration required for running during walking - stamina regenerates only to a \"normal\" extent when completely stopped. Even with the stamina regeneration upgrade (though there are ability, health, and stamina upgrades available, stamina being the most useful), players still have to come to a complete halt and wait for 10 seconds to regain enough stamina to sprint for 5 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay remains stagnant even after obtaining upgrades and the infamous armor - enemies continue to patrol the same routes, and they don't recognize you when you're in disguise. Neither the opening of new passageways nor the narrative reveals about your disguise changes the guards' perception of you. You can leisurely move through empty locations where there were never any enemies and steal from patrol pockets while remaining undetected - there are no consequences for these actions.\n\nThe only real development here is in the narrative: characters' opinions about the protagonist change, they move from one place to another, and even the final location undergoes a transformation due to malevolent forces, which were hinted at early on and easily forgotten. The secondary characters are interesting, and interacting with them is enjoyable, but the quests they offer often ruin the overall experience. Adding to this frustration is the fact that players are denied the chance to conclude the story they were promised at the outset; it abruptly ends only midway through, dampening the enjoyment.\n\nI recommend getting this game on sale if you want to experience a charming tale, but keep the following tips in mind:\n- Don't attempt to complete all quests immediately; many are locked behind story progression and cannot be finished until the final act.\n- As soon as you get the chance to speak with the prison commander, equip the armor and complete his quests to level it up and move faster in enemy-infested locations.\n- Pay attention to button prompts for term explanations, steal handkerchiefs, open shutters, and learn the names of rats - they all reward achievements.\n- If you don't mind the extra content, try to find the Rangr costume that increases stamina regeneration and complete at least one quest for the two thieving mice - they provide an opportunity to boost stamina regeneration.\n- Spend money at the blacksmith to find quest items, as money won't serve any other meaningful purpose.\n\nGood luck, scrunts!", "timestamp_created": 1690757399, "timestamp_updated": 1690757399, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634184956550598145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143039595": {"recommendationid": "143039595", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987406958", "num_games_owned": 846, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1690120528}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is oddly unpleasant, like a medieval fairy tale where everything is grim and disgusting.

The enemy AI is incredibly dense, Although it's funny how the game justifies this by making how stupid the guards are part of the world building, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe movement is quite good for what it is. It took me a bit to figure out jumps don't carry your momentum from the ground but instead are affected by whether you're holding sprint while airborn or not. But once I did, I never had issues missing any jumps. The running animation is absolutely fantastic and everything except climbing feels really responsive. Climbing is a little fiddly but not really used or needed often.\n\n The gameplay loop of stealthing around and exploring to find the items you need to progress is not going to be to everyone's tastes but it's not awful in concept... in execution however it has some serious issues. The game is very, VERY bad at conveying where you're suppose to go, and in some cases even what you're suppose to be looking for, leading you to just constantly aimlessly wander around the map for hours until you get so frustrated you have to look up what you're suppose to do... only to realize you walked past the thing you needed 17 times and didn't notice cus it just looked like a bit of decoration or was hidden in some dark shadows. \n\n This game's limitations on light are pretty frustrating. You're rarely given a means to restock on oil or candles where it matters, including locations where enemies carry around lanterns which is really odd both from a level design and world building perspective. This creates a feeling of scarcity that makes it feel like you shouldn't use it just because you don't wanna run back through half that section, or even to an entirely different section, just to restock your light sources. And this can lead you to missing quite a lot of stuff because it was crammed in a dark corner somewhere and you didn't wanna waste fuel checking it or spend too much time exploring a dark space you can barely see anything even with a light source out. You have two sources of infinite light you can obtain through side quests but one is significantly dimmer than the lantern and candle, and the other replaces your headwear meaning you can't wear it with a disguise and drains your stamina to use which....\n\n Stamina management is endlessly frustrating. Stamina drains quickly while sprinting and barely replenishes at all while walking. It goes up fairly quick while standing still but it takes about as long to fill up as it does to drain so you ether deal with the minimal stamina regen while walking, or spend half of the game standing still waiting for your stamina to refill. Yes if you walk \"really\" slowly with an analogue stick you can get it to replenish at max speed while still moving but this is it's own kind of frustrating and requires a controller. On top of this you later get a much needed ability to highlight intractable objects, and using this ability also consumes stamina. On a second playthough of the game when you know where everything is, the stamina issues are barely noticeable. In fact I think the game makers specifically balanced it around this experience because, as the game makers, they knew where everything was. But in a blind playthough, given the earlier issue of how unhelpful the game is at telling you where to go and what you're looking for, you end up spending hours running around in circles through the whole map at several points in the game, and this is when the stamina limitations are really egregious. It really feels like there should've been some secret outfit in the game that just gives you infinite stamina to make exploring the map and cleaning up unfinished tasks before ending the story much more manageable...\n\n Which should have been the gilded armor. This is effectively the secret best outfit in the game, obtainable just after you get locked out of a few side quests unfortunately, but they're all fairly easy ones you'll probably have done by then. It does still make completing unfinished tasks fairly trivial, but having it also eliminate the stamina issue would've been grand... Until you do a second playthrough to get the ghost, untouched, crash diet, and/or scholar achievements, where it suddenly becomes unobtainable for some reason. A bug that's been in the game since it's release as far as I can tell and been reported several times.\n\nDespite that egregious bug, the game's actually surprisingly replayable if you really enjoy the story. There's a lot of dialogue trees that reveal different lore depending on what you say to who, and the order you do some quests in can lead to you having different knowledge at different points in the game leading to dialogue you wouldn't otherwise get. Through a second play through I learned a lot more lore, clues to certain mysteries, and the direction the currently-in-production sequel will likely take, that I hadn't gotten in my first play through due to different dialogue paths. And I found navigating the game much more enjoyable once I actually knew where I was going.\n\nOverall, despite it's flaws, it's a pretty lovely game. I just wish the development team put a bit more long term support into ironing out some if it's issues.", "timestamp_created": 1689657948, "timestamp_updated": 1690525936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625092029571533203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142288817": {"recommendationid": "142288817", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994883221", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 839, "last_played": 1534896147}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible game, I love this one !\n\nFirst in my heart !", "timestamp_created": 1689625009, "timestamp_updated": 1689625009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519882321357727051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142257758": {"recommendationid": "142257758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015661607", "num_games_owned": 910, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1362, "last_played": 1689587706}, "language": "english", "review": "the art style is beautiful and the story is really captivating. \nthe hope that part 2 comes out soon will not leave my mind.\nthank you for this awesome experience", "timestamp_created": 1689588337, "timestamp_updated": 1689588337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141661276": {"recommendationid": "141661276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071796780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1045, "last_played": 1688888312}, "language": "english", "review": "Certified cult classic, It's has a lot charm and lot character too it, flawed in a few ways but definitely something that you will remember by the end of it", "timestamp_created": 1688888288, "timestamp_updated": 1688888288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141562578": {"recommendationid": "141562578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993489733", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1688776212}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a really fun Redwall-esque adventure and I'm really looking forward to the sequel", "timestamp_created": 1688776612, "timestamp_updated": 1688776612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503512859344482422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141559331": {"recommendationid": "141559331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150380751", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1479, "last_played": 1688771968}, "language": "english", "review": "This is kinda similar to \"Stray\" (tho not as good as it), great game, full of puzzles, good scenario and a nice story.

Stealth focus & saving your energy is crucial in this game, making it a great challenge, because you are forced to think when is a good time to do what at given situation. There is plenty of disguise with outfits here that each gives you certain perks like higher poison resistance or walking among guards. Lore is both rich & interesting. Main and side quests were all really fun to do and they weren't that easy to finish. Visuals were really cute & the characters were great to interact with.\n\nCONS: Poor PC optimisation. I who have a really great gaming laptop, had issues with overheating which is uncommon with other games, including the ones that are modern and way more demanding in specs compared to this one. I have encountered many bugs connected with environment like walking inside a rock and out, but at least they were not game crashing.\n\nCONCLUSION: It's a really cute crowdfunded indie game that is well deserved of praise.

It's kind of a medieval stealth game in a tiny world (literally, you'll have to play the game to know what i mean lol), which is actually kind of immersive. There's some RPG elements but not too much to make you feel overwhelmed with stuff. \n\nFirst, let's talk about the positives. Like, I said, the game is very immersive considering it's only ~20 hours long (including beating all side quests). Characters are well designed. They sometimes react differently to different things you say, and you might not get some of the side quests if you don't offer help. Your choices don't matter all that much compared to games like Life Is Strange, but I didn't mind it. The story was well written. It's the strongest aspect of the game in my opinion. The plot advances smoothly and there are some really interesting twists. There is no real combat in the game, aside from the spiders in the catacombs. If you get spotted by an enemy, you'll have to run away which makes sense since you're a prisoner escaping. Navigating the maps was pretty annoying at first but after you get used to it [spoiler] and unlock some secret passages [/spoiler] , it becomes more fun. I really wanna see a fast travel option tho, in the sequel (if they ever make one).\n\nNow the negatives. Escaping from the guards is fun, but they're REAAAALLY stupid lol. Rats are your enemies, and as long as you're wearing their armor, they won't care at all. Even when you're not wearing the armor, when they come after you, losing them is way too easy. Hide in the nearest cupboard while they watch you do it and they'll come and be like \"what? where'd he go?\". Game performance is not good at all. Frequent stutters and fps drops, and overall a bit clunky. The real issue with the game I had, tho, was this. The first time you run it, using the mouse in the main menu is a nightmare. The cursor won't click where you want. And you can't navigate using the keyboard. Why? I don't know. You can fix this by Going into Options>Video, scrolling all the way to the bottom, and turning on Vsync. Then, scroll back up and select the proper resolution for your screen. It was fine for the period i had the game open. BUT, the next time i launched the game, guess what? It crashed on launch. Verifying integrity of game files did nothing, neither did reinstalling the game. What i had to do was to go to the \"cog\" on the game in my library > Manage > Browse Local Files, and run the file called \"GoaT_ClearPreferences.cmd\". That opens up a command prompt. Press Enter and after it's done close it, then you should be able to run the game again. This resets everything (except your save data) so you'll need to turn on Vsync, fix your resolution, all over again. This will reset your key bindings too so you'll need to modify them again if you don't like the defaults. You essentially need to do this every time want to play the game. Very annoying.\n\nOverall score: a very generous 7/10.

The writing and animations are full of character. The story is really fun. The game play mechanics are also really solid. Overall I think this is a really well put together game, but I don't think it's for everyone.\n\nThe game takes place in and around a labyrinth of a fort and you will spend a lot of time sneaking around trying to avoid guards and unlocking new areas. There are maps, but you will need to learn your way around and you will spend quite a lot of the early game feeling quite lost so, if you don't have the patience for that, this could end up being a frustrating experience. Up until you are able to blend in with the guards, it can also feel like you are just constantly alerting and trying to run away from them, which can also feel frustrating. It does calm down a lot once you are no longer forced to sneak everywhere but that doesn't happen until you are a chunk into the game.\n\nI only really have one gripe with the game. You need to steal keys from some guards and the pickpocket ability is really fiddly. Firstly, because of lighting it's sometimes impossible to see when a guard has something of value, and secondly, even if you know they do, you need to be in just the right position related to them in order to grab it. After trying to pickpocket one rat multiple times and giving up (assuming I must have been wrong), then checking a walk through to work out where to go next, I did just end up knocking them out and standing directly on top of them before it would show me the item I needed. This happened to me on two separate occasions whilst playing. Seriously, do not be afraid to use a walk through if you feel like you are getting stuck. Aside from the pick pocketing, the game is sometimes really light on signposting and without help it does sometimes feel like you are just trying everything with everything until something happens.\n\nI held off on this for a long time because of other reviews saying this was full of bugs but I only experienced one serious problem where I accidentally accessed a part of the fort that I hadn't unlocked yet and I got stuck there. Fortunately I wasn't just using one save slot and once I realised I was stuck, I could go back to an earlier save. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed this one and went out of my way to do all of the side-quests, just because I didn't want the game to end yet!", "timestamp_created": 1676226022, "timestamp_updated": 1676226648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132559217": {"recommendationid": "132559217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120047258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1676065187}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazingly good storyline.

What really stood out to me was the interconnectedness of the areas. Lots of hidden doors and entrances that bring you back to areas you are familiar with. Really reminded me of the level design in Dark Souls 1. I kinda feel like this game could be vaguely described as a mini Skyrim - both the good and bad.\n\nI loved the characters in this, from Tilo - the protagonist - to Kerold the frog and Ravik the magpie. I liked that there were many side quests which made you get to know the world and characters better. Plus, these side quests can grant you some \"upgrades\" to your tools and clothes. \n\nThere is no fighting system, which doesn't need to be a negative. You've got sticks and bottles to use as a distraction and throwing weapon. You can set certain things on fire, though as I remember, not in combat - which I believe - was kind of a missed opportunity. The overall controls felt both very adequate but also clunky at times. The menu, specifically, was buggy and frustrating to navigate. Scrolling through dialogue options is way too slow. Sometimes there was a menu box over another and you clicked on something in your inventory but at the same time confirmed a dialogue choice. Or there were dialogue options only to find out that you can't say anything besides \"nevermind\". I'm paraphrasing here. But the menu could need a proper clean up. The stamina was drained way too fast and regenerated very slowly, even after the perk that you can unlock. \n\nHowever, the world which they created, along with the lighting is absolutely gorgeous. I say it again: G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S. This game looks so beautiful. You can tell how much love went into this. For such a small studio, this had some triple-A-grade graphics and animations. There were a lot of lighting glitches, however, along with lots of popups from bonfires to rock walls.\n\nSpeaking of animations: I wish there were more cinematics. The same goes for voice acting. I wish the game would've had it. I know, games can have their own charm by relying on text boxes but I wished the dialogue was voiced. The same goes for a couple scenes that should've had animations but were instead narrated by a simple text box.\n\nUltimately, with all its flaws I perceived, I hope there's more to come. With improvements to various aspects from gameplay variation, to controls and overall quality of life improvements, a second game from those devs would be a delight. Whether it would be a sequel or a whole other story. I still would gladly recommend Ghost of a Tale.\n\n[spoiler]The final fight can suck a duck, though.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1671211343, "timestamp_updated": 1671212131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541666686534881592", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128663868": {"recommendationid": "128663868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803378724", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1004, "last_played": 1580566687}, "language": "english", "review": "absolutely loved being a mouse\n\n\nseriously, amazing game, one of the best i've played so far????\n\n(but still i wanna be a mouse forever)", "timestamp_created": 1671199689, "timestamp_updated": 1671199689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128633020": {"recommendationid": "128633020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158621762", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1027, "last_played": 1671194341}, "language": "english", "review": "Pas mal non?

Ghost of a Tale is a narrative driven adventure game set in a quirky castle populated with talking anthropomorphic rodents sprung from a grim yet heroic fairytale, visualizing a clan of Skavens in a Redwall setting gets you pretty much spot on. In this fabulous fable you play as Tilo, a minstrel mouse of the highest order with a sneaky nature and an uncanny ability to hide in cupboards. After a rather unsuccessful performance due to his Wife Merra refusing to perform for a local Rat-baron, Tilo is knocked unconscious and thrown into the dungeons of a nearby keep. It is up to Tilo to find out what happened to his wife and save the day!\n\nOverall I truly enjoyed this game, the atmosphere is spot on, the setting and storytelling sublime and overall the gameplay is decent enough. At its core this is a stealthy adventure game with a bunch of side quests tied on mostly circling around fetching this or that for the local retainers at the castle. Overall the gameplay and inventory management is fine even though the stealth parts might feel a bit unintuitive to followers of the Thief-style of stealth action. The fetching of items for quests is slightly obtuse at times but that's not the biggest problem. Sometimes quests that you think about completing might be softlocked until you progress far enough in the main storyline, a bit of a nitpick but quite annoying after you searched every nook and cranny the 5th time looking for the last piece of a puzzle you can't complete. \n\nConsidering this is a project with a few dedicated souls behind it I can see past a few of the more glaring design decisions and overall I really enjoyed this cute and charming tale of a mouse desperately searching for his loved one. The story is by far the most endearing part and for that alone it gets a stamp of approval.

The game has a good variety of quests and most feel impactful to the story in some way, really made me want to finish all the quests.

As of late 2022, [b]it looks like that sequel may be coming[/b], though it\u2019s probably years off still. But I\u2019m gonna be honest: Even if the sequel never materialises, I\u2019ll still be glad to have experienced this story, incomplete or not. I\u2019ll just occasionally be reminded of this wonderful little game, look to the sky and wonder what became of Tilo, Merra and the others\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1665954044, "timestamp_updated": 1685471439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794316768646240234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123723637": {"recommendationid": "123723637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019733936", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1152, "last_played": 1665959778}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenido, muy jugable.

That said, it kind of makes sense story wise since you're playing as Tilo - who would already know some of these things. It can kind of be a hassle if you're going for the scholar achievement as some of the footnotes are only available during very specific dialogue options. I'd recommend being very thorough with this one. Achievement hunting isn't too bad, due to a lot of them being kind of linked together.\n\nTIlo as the MC is absolutely adorable, and I had a lot of fun collecting the various armor sets throughout the game just to see how he'd look in them. There is a downside with this, however. If you're going for two specific achievements; Like a Ghost and Dodgy Mouse, you're likely to be wearing the guard set most of the time. It makes sense that it would be heavy since Tilo is much smaller than the rats, but even fully upgraded the fastest you'll go is a jog. The ranger set also works, but unless you're running around the map I wouldn't recommend using it over the guard set. Even if you're standing near the same guard you've talked with, if the bar fills they'll talk to you again. It's easily avoidable, but it *is* a little bit of a hindrance.

I'm certain some of this is on me and I can't say what would need to change to improve most of the issue, but the maps lacking any connecting lines between each other made it impossible to know how or if they connected at all even if I'd been through it a hundred times such as with the courtyard. The use of shortcuts was fairly well done and allowed the game to be more vertical than most would attempt I think so I was glad to see that.\nI suppose I could add due to the whole game being set within a single place, sneaking quickly turns from a mechanic to an excuse for other mechanics to function such as the quick save hideaways.

Despite giving this game a recommendation i have to admit that there is a major flaw within, that might make your whole expirience with the game into an exhausting one.\n\n Let's start with the good things - the game is adorable. And I mean it. Finding a protagonist more cute than Tilo is not an easy task. Also the devs managed to create a truly fairy tale-like world, full of charm, lore and amusing characters (Gusto and Fatale <3 ). Playing Ghost of a Tale feels like being whispered away into a world of a childrens's books - soft light, colourful palette and cartoonish architecture. Very, very nice.\n\n There are a few  insignificant technical hiccups, like the sunlight shining through a solid rock sometimes, but that's about it. I did not encounter any other bugs (aside from stucking in a tight place once) and the framerate has been very stable, so i'd say that there are no serious issues with the technical side of the game.\n\n The thing that weights down this game, is the main gameplay loop, which consists of a constant running inside of a complex and intertwining, but at the same time rather small location (since there are no loading screens, i count the whole game as a single map). Go fetch some flowers/mushrooms/hoods/documents/obols/keys/costumes, etc. etc. - this is the thing that you will do about 90% of your total game time in this game. You will run in circles constantly revisiting and revisiting the same rooms, corridors, characters and places in the neverending \"fetch me something\" megaquest. \n\n If only devs could have thought  of some other activities, or at least minimise the amount of time player spends runnig in circles - this would have been a truly wonderful game, but with the things being as is - i got quite tired and exausted by the end of the game. If not for the story and charming characters - chanses are high that i would have abandoned it half way through.\n\n So when you will decide if you want to get this game or not you will have to decide for yourself if the game's aesthetics are compelling enough for you to plow through the outright exhausting fetch-gameplay. As for me - I can only hope that the sequel will be more diverse gameplay-wise, because i want to know what will become of Tilo and Merra and will [strike]Aragorn[/strike] Silas become a king?\n", "timestamp_created": 1653693243, "timestamp_updated": 1653693243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611973404884338379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116052521": {"recommendationid": "116052521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132503739", "num_games_owned": 577, "num_reviews": 520, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1043, "last_played": 1653576199}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]My Playtime:[/b] 17.3h (100% achievement, finished the game)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (16 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\n[b]Ghost of a Tale[/b] is a mix of stealth and collectathon where you play as a mouse in a place full of rats.

Despite being an indie game, the visuals are on par with high-budget games, offering realistic-looking backgrounds and models. The main character looks similar to how mice looked in real life while still being cute with his big eye. The backgrounds are so beautiful, to the point that you might have to resist pressing that screenshot button all the time.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story isn't interesting at the beginning. You'll be playing as Tilo, a mouse that has just escaped from his cell. The game will then info dump you with a lot of new terms that you are not familiar with. Sadly, they don't seem to matter at the time, and I don't think that I would be playing long enough until it mattered. It turns out that I was right. There might be some moments when you need to know some terms to understand the story, but most can be safely ignored.\n\nThe worldbuilding doesn't seem to matter until you reach the middle half. It will then try to correlate some of the in-game terms to the escape plan, although sadly, it doesn't seem to finish what it tries to tell. Most mysteries are left unsolved, and the world that you will explore is only limited to the island where you were being jailed. All those talks about the other regions seem to be a waste since you won't be exploring it - it's as if the developer decides to cut the game short and planned to tell it in the sequel. That being said, I enjoyed some parts of the story, especially the backstory of each character.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1338399579\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Stealth[/b]\nThe game will introduce a stealth mechanic at the beginning, forcing you to avoid enemies while traversing the area. Sleeping enemies can be avoided by walking and stopping from time to time, although others need to be avoided by walking whenever they are not looking. Since the camera is close to your character, you need to move the screen while moving to scout ahead. Objects like barrels and chests will also be available in some spots, allowing you to save and hide from the enemies. However, loading a save from that point will force you to exit your hiding spot, and you might be seen by the enemy if you are not careful.\n\nThere is no penalty for being seen if you don't care about an achievement. Enemies walk very slowly, and there is no way you will be caught if you don't foolishly approach them. However, trying to finish the game without being seen can be problematic, especially since one map is very vast and you need to distract or knock out some enemies to progress. The thing is, the throwing mechanic is bugged - it won't allow you to throw an object despite being in the right range sometimes; it's as if the game wants you to be seen at least once. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169672030\n\nInstead of making the stealth mechanic more accessible, it tries to adjust what happened after you are being seen instead. This was made more obvious after the game introduces an armor set in the main quest to eliminate the stealth section. Since the game is also a collecthaton, the set is helpful to explore the area while avoiding being seen. However, wearing the armor will reduce your walking speed, dragging out the playtime.\n\n[b]Collecthaton[/b]\nThe latter half of the game mostly consists of fetch quests. You need to explore the same areas several times to find items. Areas might be easily accessible because of the numerous shortcuts, but it can take time to remember where everything is, even with a map. The in-game map doesn't separate between upper and lower floors, and area exits aren't written there. Those who have a short memory term and/or play the game in short bursts might spend most of their time running in circles to figure out where they have to go next.\n\nThe quest descriptions aren't helpful either. Some areas will require you to go to a certain place, but instead of marking the location on the map, the NPCs will only say the place with some vague direction at best. It can be hard to figure out where they are if you don't know about it beforehand, especially if there is no clue of the location except the word.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733133892\n\nCollecting objects can be hard to do. You need to figure out hidden paths or even jump to unexpected places to find them. There is an NPC that can mark the objects in your map if you pay them, but as I said before, the maps tend to be not helpful. Since most of them are required for clearing quests, it can be hard to finish them because of this.\n\n[b]Enemies[/b]\nThe game might eliminate the stealth section from the middle half, but other enemies will show up later on, forcing you to kill them by throwing objects. However, throwables are limited, and you will be forced to run very far to restock them. Although some objects can be restocked in some places, others have no such thing. It's easy to run out of them if you're not careful.\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the game in 17.3h. The game isn't difficult if you don't mind achievements, although trying to finish the game without being noticed by the enemies might be annoying since you need to reload your save a lot. The thing is, the game tends to be bugged if you do it. I even had to restart my laptop several times for it.\n\n[b]Others[/b]\nThe game has a lot of bugs, especially when played on full screen. The screen will tear from time to time, making it hard to navigate the area. Moreover, there are also a lot of times when you can't target an enemy without using pine cones. Several intermittent bugs that force me to restart the game or laptop also exist, which I assumed to be triggered from reloading a save several times. Lastly, the game hardly has any sounds - the sounds are so low even after I turned my speaker to the max.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's hard for me to say this, but I couldn't seem to enjoy [b]Ghost of a Tale[/b]. The first half was terrible because of the stealth mechanic - I had to restart the game several times after I was caught for an achievement since I wasn't familiar with the mechanics. The second area also gave me trouble since it was difficult to hide in such a vast area. Clearing areas without being seen become frustrating because of the difficulty and the bugs.\n\nI started to enjoy the game more in the latter half, but I did it by using the guard set that made my walking speed very slow. The unclear map and collection-based gameplay forces me to run around the same place several times to fulfill the quests, including the time when I got lost. I felt like wasting my time running around.\n\nI admit that the game has a good quality considering the budget, though. Despite the issues, the visuals are good enough to keep me playing until I got interested in the story. However, with the gameplay being as it is, I don't think it's right to recommend this game, especially with the weak ending and the fact that I spent most of my playtime getting lost.", "timestamp_created": 1653591940, "timestamp_updated": 1653672831, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563214719295501709", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116005602": {"recommendationid": "116005602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088703707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1653444501}, "language": "english", "review": "Waiting on a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1653508664, "timestamp_updated": 1653508664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466666668653488159", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115997564": {"recommendationid": "115997564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012374319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 395, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1653497380}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm really impressed by how the game is immediately unfun, uninviting, with botched stealth and botched controls, including a crosshair that seems to be there just for show, since pointing at an object doesn't necessarily help interacting with it, but sometimes you have to do a bit of a jiggle and point to the side before you can interact with it.", "timestamp_created": 1653497543, "timestamp_updated": 1653497543, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448653936386108398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115658379": {"recommendationid": "115658379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126016824", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1770, "last_played": 1691292075}, "language": "english", "review": "if you read the redwall books when you were a kid then youre going to love this game", "timestamp_created": 1652907315, "timestamp_updated": 1652907315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666111528873443604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115621628": {"recommendationid": "115621628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039315915", "num_games_owned": 1391, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1649, "last_played": 1652838382}, "language": "english", "review": "Very rich and rewarding stealth/collectathon RPG.

From the dark prison corridors and  the calm shores right to moist deadly catacombs or lush forests, the care that was put into designing the environment is exceptional and it's always a bliss to discover a new shortcut that makes the entire island an interconnected - almost metroidvania - affair.\n\n  Gameplay consists mostly of stealth , with Tilo trying to remain hidden from his pursuers (but sometimes you can aid him with the use of various items that can be even used as weapons that will knock out enemies temporarily - or with the use of various skills that are learned throughout the quest) and although the A.I. is far more simpler and basic than what I'd like to, it serves the game well in the way it's designed. Perhap smy only big gripe is that the enemies' vision doesn't seem to be affected by night or day and they seem to be able to detect you easily no matter what.\nBut later down the line - without spoiling too much - stealth can also become optional through the use of other means of navigation that trade safety for more restricted movement.\n \nThere is no combat involved!\n\n  Keep in mind though that another big aspect of the gameplay and how you handle the quests and navigation through the map is having many fetch-quests and backtracking. A lot of backtracking, (admittedly things improve tremendously once you unlock more shortcuts) but with very little handholding - which I initially disliked and then appreciated and ended up being thankful for it - making you work a bit and having a great feeling of satisfaction every time you suceed.\n  Of course if you still want a little help and handholding, the game is very generous and offers help through a specific NPC who offers maps, hints and solutions, so don't be afraid to use this.\n\n  The game is also far longer than what I expected with tons of sidequests that complement the main story and let you discover much more of the deep lore and character motivations in a fairly nuanced way with all the different plot threads advancng naturally over the course of the game. Unfortunately there's no speech in the game but that doesn't stop you from imagining it while reading the dialogue, to add more personality to the already colorful cast!\n\n  The music while not as prominent (strange when you think about it, you control a minstrel after all, so I thought music would play an even bigger role) is equally well done and enhances that \"epic quest in a strange land\" feeling whenever it plays as you navigate and discover a new area.\n\n  The story was pretty engaging and once things started coming together I was fully immersed in the world and characters. Unfortunately, [spoiler] while the story reaches a satisfying ending point - it is not a proper ending but more of a \"to be continued\" one, a sort of \"Chapter 1 end\" to a much bigger story that opens up , leaving some important aspect inconclusive and I hope one day the story will continue. It's not a complete cliffhanger, but not a clean tidy ending either. But it was a good ending for the part of the story this game wanted to tell. Let's hope for a sequel so we can see what happens next! [/spoiler]\n\n  Sometimes there were a few janky moments and some bugs that thankfully didn't really break the game. Could have used perhaps a tiny bit more polish in some parts but overall, it wasn't anything gamebreaking for me.\n\n  Ghost of a Tale is a very impressive little indie game (and even more impressive being almost a one-man-project/work of love) with marvelous art direction and atmosphere, with a very focused and engaging small open world filled with monsters, stealthy action and a heartwarming story. What it tries to do, it does it well and it is a very promising start from a new studio that manages to produce an inspired and high quality experience with only a fraction of the budget others use.", "timestamp_created": 1649279214, "timestamp_updated": 1649279214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596465826034545898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113386871": {"recommendationid": "113386871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134455418", "num_games_owned": 3735, "num_reviews": 285, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 977, "last_played": 1649163707}, "language": "english", "review": "Being heavy and unable to jump around is better than sneaking around.", "timestamp_created": 1649177003, "timestamp_updated": 1649177003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "113355330": {"recommendationid": "113355330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198854621841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1530, "last_played": 1695057291}, "language": "english", "review": "It's incredible.

The platforming I absolutely adored, Tilo controls wonderfully, very snappy and fast. The open outdoor areas are beautiful and fun to just run and climb around in. I enjoyed the stealth quite a bit but felt it was a little primitive. Not terrible, just could use some AI improvements. Sadly as the game goes on you experience less and less of Tilo's mousy agility and sneakiness.\n\n- The stealth aspect of the game is all but discarded after assembling a costume that is required to complete the game. While wearing this costume you are 100% safe from any guards in the keep. To balance this you are also EXTREMELY slow, leaving you to hobble around the map at a snail's pace lest you risk being killed. You can still play around stealth to an extent but it's much easier, and ironically probably faster, to just be slow. \n\n- I personally don't despise fetch quests, but good lord this game is filled to the brim with them. Combined with the slow chunky outfit it can become an absolute SLOG to figure out where to go, especially if you aren't already familiar with the map. There is a helpful NPC that can help you find certain items by marking them on your map and give quest hints (all for a modest fee!!) but he can't help with everything.\n\nOverall I found myself much more invested with each of the characters and the lore rather than the gameplay as time went on.

You play stealthily for perhaps the first 30 minutes, before finding a suit of armour that magically dupes [i]all[/i] guards into thinking you are also a guard, despite being less than half their size and being the only one wearing a chainmail facemask. You move extra slowly while wearing this suit, so you get to gut the stealth aspect of the game entirely while waddling around. It's farcical. And before you think this is a concession to more casual players and the intended way to play is by stealth, you actually do have to interact with guards quite frequently and thus have to switch armours back and forth. Honestly, it's a pain.\n- The game is too slow paced. You'll have to go from one end of the sizable map to another, and even wearing the stamina-boosting armor this takes an absolute age. I know exactly where to go and there aren't even any enemies in my way, let me hurry up please.\n- Quite possibly the worst final quest I have ever experienced in a videogame. You're trapped in a small area with infinitely respawning skeletons you cannot damage, and have to carry explosive barrels to a chest and light them. Said enemies also have a permanent drain effect on your stamina, so you walk at a snail's pace. You also have to do this 3 separate times, [i]and[/i] there is a time limit. You have two allies who help out but you're at the mercy of RNG as to whether they'll actually take the heat off you or get stuck fighting skeletons half the area away. To add insult to injury, the latest automatic save point is half the map away. I would genuinely be interested in asking the developer what the hell were they thinking adding this as an ending segment.\n- Ending is rather disappointing, and [i]very[/i] sequel-baity. The whole driving force behind the plot is to find your wife, and at the end, you don't find your wife but instead sail off towards a mystery island to find her. The calamity which causes the above-mentioned infinitely respawning skeletons is also still out there. A more satisfying conclusion to at least some of the main plotlines would have been nice.\n\nIn summary, I don't think this is worth the asking price. The premise, artstyle and ideas are all there but the execution falls short in several respects. I hear this game is getting a sequel, and I hope the developer learns from the current issues, as there is potential here.

I waited until finishing the game to write my review, and will keep it spoiler free:\n\nPros:\n1. This game is adorable. Plain and simple. If you love the Redwall series (I think I read nearly all of them as a kid) and love the idea of collecting little costumes for a mouse, this game is 100% for you.\n2. Story: It has a compelling story that gets more fleshed out as the game progresses, leaving room for a sequel as well as opportunity to see some characters return for the second game.\n3. Character development: the NPCs who become integral to the game have fairly rich backstories you learn over time, many of which could become relevant to the overall world the game is set in.\n4. Music as a game mechanic: I can't say more without spoiling parts of the game; I just thought this was a unique way to advance the game and your level.\n5. No combat! Okay, I do not shy away from combat in games where it makes sense. In this game though, being able to hack and slash your way through would not fit, and so finding limited ways to defend yourself and otherwise rely on stealth makes the gameplay similar to only a few others (Thief, Deus Ex depending on how you play it...)\n\nCons:\n1. Movement Speed: Okay, I like when games have different traits for classes and armor types, but even with full upgrade the armor makes you move agonizingly slow. There is something to be said for choosing to keep playing the game with stealth to avoid this.\n2. Quest progression: Quests in this games are not intuitive at all, and for some you will be left guessing at what you need to do next. You're not alone, and this is something for the developer to improve for the sequel.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing the game once I settled into how you're supposed to play it. If you don't like games where you have to figure things out and prefer combat, don't play it. If you like stealth and mild frustration with the reward that comes with progressing the game (plus adorable mice), I suggest giving it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1641687565, "timestamp_updated": 1641687565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107555264": {"recommendationid": "107555264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073917235", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1574, "last_played": 1641558654}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little action-RPG with not-annoying stealth and touching story. \n\nJust need to be careful about how you approach the game:\n1) Don't rush quests\nSome quests span through multiple locations and no need to spend excessive time searching for that last item now.

If you want to kill and fight things, this game is not for you. The story and lore were amazing. The levels not too big. The game not too long (30 hours). Note however that you will be going over the same areas over and over on your many quests. But the levels were so maze like, and organic, that they never seemed stale and boring. The levels and missions were designed in such a way that it almost forces you to see everything. There were just a few missions that I never completed. There is not much in the way of AI. The rat guards have their standard posts and walk paths. But this did not detract from the fun of trying to figure out how to best elude them. The graphics were wonderful (occasional glitch near walls), the interface slick and easy to use and follow. The characters charming and well thought out. A game well worth the price.

Indeed, the playspace is only a fortification and some of its immediate surroundings, and the game's runtime is padded a bit by backtracking and find-the-thing sidequests.  That said, the small game world is pleasant to look at and, over the course of playthrough, becomes familiar and home-y - even though some places will remain mildly dangerous to the end.  \n\nLight spoilers for the game's flow ahead:\n\nWhile the trailer tends to play up the stealth gameplay, this isn't a stealth game - the stealth components will fade more and more into the background as the plot opens up and the game becomes less about survival and more about the character quests.  I cannot say this is a bad thing, as it is these character elements that give the game most of its charm.  Indeed, it is quite the statement this game makes where you go from cowering in boxes and around corners from guards to chatting them up, joking with them, and even gambling with some of their ilk.  And to be sure, it is not a case of simple enemies-to-friends, no; it is more nuanced than that.  Still, this does mean that the endgame is far, far less challenging than the earlygame.  This is not a game to play if you are seeking merely a challenge of skill.\n\nIf the core gameplay loop is not particularly game-y, then what does this bring to the table?  As said before, charm.  The writing is good.  The core plot is good.  The game introduces its lore through several avenues: topical explanations the player can click on during dialogue to know what the protagonist knows, snippets of literature and weathered inscriptions throughout the game world, and most notably the protagonist's songbook which he will break out at points throughout the plot - and which the player can peruse from his inventory whenever they wish.  Attentive and trope-savvy players will figure out some, if not most, of the game's mysteries as or even before they approach their reveal, as almost all of the game's lore ties back into the plot.  It is a very efficient story, and by my measure very well-told, while still being robust enough to twist about itself with grace of depth and timing.  Characters are fleshed out, dialogue is well-crafted and, at points, clever.\n\nThat said, the game is not perfect.  While it looks beautiful in stills and snippets, there are rough edges to the world.  There are some persistent portaling issues which can create odd behavior with the lighting engine and hostile NPC AI.  Also, parts of the game's questing structure are a bit of a mess.  This, point requires more detail: \n\nThe front half of the game loads the player down with quests that they cannot complete until well into the back-half of the game.  In most cases, the player can begin work on the quest and complete several of their objectives, only to be unable to find the rest, or run upon an obstacle with no indication how or when they can surmount it.  Only unrelated events farther down the main plot will grant the player the means to continue down these side paths.  This, perhaps, would not be such a hiccup if the player could trust that they could come back and complete those quests, but there -are- sidequest lockout points if you progress too far (albeit not many, and they are fairly late in the game).  For players determined to experience the whole game, this may frustrate your experience.  \n\nAlso, the game ends on a (mild) cliffhanger/sequel hook.   I will not call it an unsatisfying ending, as the hero's trajectory is clear, and for a game that trades in discovery, leaving a little bit of mystery on the table at the end manages to feel right.  \n\nDespite my talk of its flaws, this game rates highly for me.  This is a great little world to spend a few hours in, memorable and - I cannot stress this enough - charming all the way down.

The nasty part was that you do get a skill to help you find stuff, however it lasts very little, the range is limited, i could barely squeeze a 360 spin to see what items are around me with the skill on and most of all, during night (might be some trick to it, it seems to last longer if you do not move), it highlights items in a red dim glow, coupled up with the red-ish lighting of the night and you will barely be able to see the items; this skill was not all that useful to say the least, and even less useful was the trap one, which i didn't used at all, since by the time i got, from a side task, i killed everything i could (yes you can kill certain things) so had no reason to use it.\n\nThe game has its charm and flaws but i recommend it as long as you do not expect a level of stealth mechanics and gameplay to the likes of Dishonored from it.", "timestamp_created": 1638209417, "timestamp_updated": 1641159137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104447979": {"recommendationid": "104447979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080417511", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 832, "last_played": 1638058937}, "language": "english", "review": "AAA: \u0420\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443-\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0441 \u0437\u0430 $60\nSeithCG: \u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0435 1190 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\n\n85 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 78", "timestamp_created": 1638059054, "timestamp_updated": 1638059990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512820541858673096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104431257": {"recommendationid": "104431257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067475771", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1235, "last_played": 1638050150}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic adventure.

There are maps you can acquire/purchase in the game but you will eventually learn the layout as the game points you to each area quite often.\n\nThe game itself is quite beautiful.

Some solutions to quests you will bump into quite randomly, but if you dont have any luck then google is your best friend. I would have preferred more hints, especially when the solution to the next objective is so random that you would never think of it.\n2. There are some visual glitches every now and then when your character gets stuck or wedged between two surfaces and your screen will flash repeatedly until you get out.\n3. When I began the very last quest, I felt I missed something. The plot quickened and characters started to say things I had no idea about and the story probably would have required that I visit some of the characters before starting the last quest but the plot itself hurried me, causing me to follow it instead of interacting with the characters in different areas. There was a pacing issue or hint issue. I would recommend not taking the very last quest until you seriously finished everything, collected all the collectibles and costumes, and visited all the characters. But sadly, I cannot tell you when you have to do all this because I would spoil the plot for you so... You might meet the same problem I have.\n\nAnyway, it is a neat little game in between the more action-packed games you would usually play.", "timestamp_created": 1636145436, "timestamp_updated": 1636145436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102248442": {"recommendationid": "102248442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219118292", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1164, "last_played": 1642824139}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful amazing game.

You have to keep travelling back and forth between the same maps trying to finish quests but what you don't know is that a lot of the side quests require you to move the main quest forward and you just waste tons of time looking for stuff that isn't there.  There are no fast travel options and I found the way the maps connect to each other confusing and frequently found myself going in the wrong direction.

The overwhelming majority of the game is based around fetch quests as you team up with other mice and rats to escape Dwindling Heights Keep. With captivating dialogue (text only), wonderful visuals (including animations) and an appropriately sweet soundtrack, Ghost of a Tale is a charming and characterful game that\u2019s well worth a play through.\n\nStory:\nPlaying as Tilo the mouse, a Minstrel who has been separated from his wife and is now imprisoned in Dwindling Heights Keep. You awaken in a prison cell with a small note and a key to door, and here\u2019s where your adventure to find your wife Merra begins. Using stealth and disguises, you\u2019ll sneak, thief and cheat your way past the rat guards that control the keep. Throughout the game, you\u2019ll meet a number of characters who will assist you \u2013 Each of whom is well written and likeable in their own way. Some are funny, others are mysterious and most of them will harbour surprising secrets.\nThere is a great deal of lore and history that you can read too. Whilst conversing with any character, if a word appears highlighted in yellow, you can click the \u201cread footnote\u201d button to get an in-depth background of the subject in question.\nThe overwhelming majority of the dialogue is well written gives each character personality. There are two moments in particular that stand out to me as surprising and funny as they are. One involved asking a character for some money, to which they offer you five Florens. If you respond with \u201cYou\u2019re too kind\u201d, the character will respond with \u201cokay then, here\u2019s three Florens instead\u201d. It\u2019s little details like this that catch you by surprise and add to Ghost of a Tale\u2019s charm.\n\nGameplay:\nAt its core, Ghost of a Tale is a game structured around mild-platforming, stealth and fetch-quests, with a healthy dose of dialogue options thrown in for good measure. Controlling Tilo is rather straight forward, with WASD+LShift for movement, right-click to sneak, left click to interact and the E key to throw (MMB is needed for actions later in the game, but it can be rebound).\nThe game plays like an old-school platformer, but with a bit more freedom. There are many areas of the game where you see a rocks, rooftops or ledges and think \u201cis there a secret up there?\u201d \u2013 only to find your going out of bounds.\nThere\u2019s no real combat in Ghost of a Tale, although you can distract and temporarily knock out guards and critters with throwable items. The gameplay is rather simplistic, with stealth being very forgiving and, in many cases with speed and some well-placed jumps, avoided altogether.\nThe game includes quick-saves and quick-loads, playing like a mash-up between Dark Souls and Dishonoured. Its handy to drop down quick saves, just in case you die, but I didn\u2019t find any point in the game where I needed to reload manually myself.\nThere are some simple puzzles in the game too; nothing too complex, and some are rather creative in ways I haven\u2019t seen utilized before. One example being a wooden post that you can push through the wall to create a platform outside.\n\nVisuals:\nThe characters are wonderfully designed, with animations to match. Rat guards will stomp around heavily with their armour rattling. Their large weapons, heavy breath and intimidating presence make chases in the early game rather thrilling.\nTilo himself is wonderfully cute, with a sweet and traditional-looking design. His tail and ears bounce as you walk and sprint around the keep, with a myriad of costumes you can mix and match to change his appearance (bonus points for the [spoiler]Jack O\u2019 Lantern[/spoiler] Mask).\nBut it\u2019s not just the characters that steal the show. Dwindling Heights Keep is a masterclass in level design, with secrets in just about every nook and cranny you can find. The combination of highly detailed environments, lighting placements and swaying foliage create a wonderfully immersive world.\n\nAudio:\nWith a wonderfully playful and adventurous soundtrack, none of the music felt out of place during my entire playthrough. It invokes a sense of mystery and danger, whilst remaining playful and light-hearted.\nAs for the sound effects, there were some interactions that felt a little flat. Mechanisms moving, impacts and occasionally some of the environments would have benefitted from more sound effects. But, on the whole, what\u2019s there is good and works very well, with the majority of the enemies and Tilo have great motion sound effects. A certain tune sung by a certain moustachioed rat was especially funny with the offkey musical notes at the end of each line. \n\nIssues:\nUnfortunately, my playthrough wasn\u2019t smooth sailing the entire way through. There are a few mostly-minor issues that need addressing:\n\u2022 Getting stuck \u2013 There were a couple of instances where Tilo would get stuck in cramped spaces. However, jumping repeatedly resulted in Tilo eventually \u2018un-sticking\u2019 himself and I was able to continue on.\n\u2022 The AI \u2013 Whilst I would put this down to being a more casual experience, the AI still has some issues. Sound doesn\u2019t have any bearing on the guards at all, and they\u2019ll quite happily ignore a creaking door right behind them. They\u2019re also incredibly easy to pass by. Simply walking up the rear of the guard and standing slightly off to the left-hand side of them allows you to pass by completely unseen.\n\u2022 Guard stuck in an alert status \u2013 At one point, one of the rat guards was stuck in an alert status, regardless of me leaving the area. This made in impossible for me to speak to a certain character until I went back and knocked the guard out with a bottle.\n\u2022 Gaps in the terrain \u2013 Quite often it\u2019s possible to find cracks between the static-meshes and see into the abyss.\n\u2022 Climbing ladders \u2013 Unfortunately, in most cases, Tilo will not grab the ladder at the height at which they\u2019re jumped at. Combined with the slow climbing speed, this can make ladders feel unnecessarily slow to traverse.\n\u2022 Honey Bees are Wasps? \u2013 I never received any honey from the bees throughout my entire playthrough \u2013 Not sure if I missed something or if it was a bug (\u2026sorry).\nIn total, these issues are minor and, in most cases, don\u2019t affect the experience all that much.\n\nTips:\n\u2022 Check every storage container. Chests, cabinets, chamber pots \u2013 Check them all. \n\u2022 Make sure to also check around every corner and behind each door/archway you walk through (especially in the [spoiler]catacombs[/spoiler]) as there are many items hidden around the place.\n\u2022 Use a candlestick to burn the purple \u201cRed Paw\u201d banners as you go along.\n\u2022 The dying light [spoiler]requires a wooden stick thrown at it.[/spoiler]\n\u2022 Collect all the Urns as soon as you can.\n\u2022 Read conversations and your song lyrics carefully.\n\nOverall:\nI felt compelled to write this review as this game pleasantly surprised me. It had been on my wish list for a great deal of time and I finally picked it up in the Humble Bundle with Hitman 2. I now regret holding off for so long as I can honestly say I enjoyed Ghost of a Tale far more than the game I\u2019d originally purchased the bundle for. The game isn\u2019t necessarily challenging or difficult, and you will re-visit the same areas frequently as you complete your quests.\n\nEnding (mild spoiler):\n[spoiler]Unfortunately, Ghost of a Tale isn\u2019t complete. The main story leaves you on a cliff-hanger, and I can only hope that there\u2019s a \u2018squeequel\u2019 in works.[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1635467116, "timestamp_updated": 1635467116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101729741": {"recommendationid": "101729741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323144914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1635427493}, "language": "spanish", "review": ".Recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1635373864, "timestamp_updated": 1635373864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101653241": {"recommendationid": "101653241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213571224", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1505, "last_played": 1635237607}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovely experience with far more gameplay to it than you first expect.

This game does have a lot of strange bugs, and it seems like everyone experiences different ones, so some people may complain about a bug you'll never encounter. I'm going to review the game from my experiences, after playing through the game three times.\n\n*The stealth in this game can seem difficult at first but the guards are actually stupid easy to manipulate and dance around, and even if you're having a hard time with them the game has you acquire a set of armor and the guards think you're one of them, taking away all need for stealth in exchange for most of your movement speed. Using sticks and bottles, in or out of your guard costume, makes stealth a breeze. Bottles and sticks are everywhere so you'll never run out, might as well use them.\n\n*The story is wonderful. It's clear the writers were very passionate about this world they created. The characters are made with care and the world is beyond detailed. HOWEVER- This story ends on a cliffhanger and I don't know if there will be any sequels to this game.\n\n*The quests all consist of collecting things you find exploring the world and avoiding danger while doing so. The world can seem maze like, and finding key items may take some patience but I think patience is something that comes with a stealth based game anyway. If you don't like running around finding objects this isn't the game for you.\n\n*There are many bugs, and everyone seems to experience different ones when they play. Mine include:\n- Large distracting light shafts in the nighttime, coming out of no where, like the floor or the walls.\n- Getting stuck on doorways while trying to evade guards, complete with camera stuck in the walls. Didn't happen super often but it was annoying when it did. Just save your game often.\n- Opening an important door but still not being able to pass through, invisible barrier. \n- V-sync and fullscreen both messed with mouse sensitivity, making it stupid high and unplayable. Turning off V-sync fixed the issue but it sometimes came back when I restarted the game in full screen.\n- Not being able to climb over/grab into obstacles you're obviously meant to.\n- Collectibles or key items spawning out of reach, like in the air or in the wall/floor. Restarting the game always fixed it.\n- Not being able to talk to NPCs while they're moving or just not on a very flat surface.\n\nDespite the bugs and the cliffhanger ending I very much enjoyed this gem of a game, it was so worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1634675231, "timestamp_updated": 1634675231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100996056": {"recommendationid": "100996056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961722106", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1634139785}, "language": "english", "review": "Please be advised this game appears to be controller MANDATORY. \n\nWhen using a mouse and keyboard, the cursor position in the game does not correspond to where it actually registers its location.

Totally worth it at full price, and definitely a [b]must[/b] if on sale!\n[hr][/hr] \nThe game has an unique, fulfilling lore. A good mix of dark/sad with wholesome and fun. I enjoyed every bit of it and can only hope for a sequel!\n\nGraphics are really beautiful - from character and costume design to lightning. The game appearance changes a lot on the day/night cycle and that's well made. While torches' lights could use a few improvements, make sure to catch some sunsets or sunrises outside - they're absolutely worth it! Whenever I there was a sunset I just had to stop moving a bit and appreciate the scenery. It was really strange how coincidentally every single time I was enjoying a sunset in the game something would fall into my eyes and make me drop a few tears. :')\n\nGameplay is also really fun! The camera controls can be a bit wonky, but it's not bad. The game does not hand in all the answers to you, there's quite a lot of mystery and investigation required from your side. The puzzles are simple yet fun to solve, especially if you're going for all the achievements.\n\nThe \"world\" isn't huge (although fairly large), but it does feel immense as there are many hidden paths and passages back and forth between areas. It takes your brain a bit of time to learn your way around, and maps are not handed out easily - you have to find them! There's a lot to explore, many (many!) hidden things to uncover and fun to be had.\n\nOn top of all that, while the game doesn't seem to be maintained anymore (it was released 3 years ago), the developers did push [b]a lot[/b] of bugfixes and improvements to the game in the first couple of years, meaning they were really paying attention and listening to the community. I couldn't find anything other than minor, unimportant bugs during my first playthrough.\n\nI'm at 17 hours now and just finished the game. Now it's time for a second playthrough to unlock the remaining achievements and I'm so looking forward to it! \n\nI hope you will not reach this part of the review as you were already convinced by it, so why keep reading if you can simply start playing, right?

Not like turn-based ones but you literally take the role of the mouse guy, Tilo. And that's the whole game. The first quarter of the game I was sneaking past guards but when you realize there's no repercussion for getting caught by guards (you outrun them and they suddenly stop following when you hide), it really breaks the immersion.\n\nI left a thumbs up cuz I overall enjoyed my time with the game. If I could I'd put a half thumb. At first I was entranced with avoiding enemies and collecting food to survive but eventually the game sort of forgets it has stealth mechanics and suddenly you go back and forth doing quests throughout the first 2 areas of the game. A LOT. I was really tempted to drop the game mid-way but I just had to see it end. It's not a difficult game, but it can be very frustrating when someone tells to you go somewhere and it's a ye ol English term (like \"ramparts\"). Some terms are defined which was appreciative, while others weren't when it mattered most. \n\nHonestly that's my biggest complaint: characters tell you to go to an area and you have to find it yourself. That would be fine if the map said anything on it. You have a 2D map in a 3D game and you can't mark it or anything. I think if there were some writing on it when you got told a quest it would help. The blacksmith can put a mark on your map if you pay him but stuff like \"kitchen\" or where the exits are would have been really nice (especially all the harbor areas). The worst part is when you enter a new area and you don't have a map. You can buy them but what's the point if you get one anyway? It's not really a challenge when I have no idea where anything was. Eventually I just bought the maps cuz I didn't want to put up with being lost.\n\nFinding the collectibles is like a needle in a haystack sometimes. You really got to keep your eyes out for keys hanging and mushrooms along walls (although you get a power up that helps with this but only for a few seconds).\n\nI can only recommend this if you like story in games and you're more of a casual gamer. Lots of story suddenly happens near the end with some twists throughout the game and lots of lore (which was intriguing). Characters are pretty great including the main character as he has his moments, isn't a silent protag, and lots of dialogue options to choose from (which all amount to the same thing from what I can tell). Gameplay was honestly nonexistent; you just run and sometimes sneak to get stamina back but a lot of the time you're going to be swapping outfits and walking slowly. It controls perfectly but a lot of the level design can feel weird to traverse. Also it is really easy to go out-of-bounds.", "timestamp_created": 1632695908, "timestamp_updated": 1632695908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99990965": {"recommendationid": "99990965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290238998", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 871, "last_played": 1673187874}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Feels like a good homebrew DnD campaign where the DM is clearly way more into character and world building than dice rolls.\n\nGameplay: If you go into this expecting a stealth game, don't.

Took me roughly 11 hours to complete and get all achievements besides the three most difficult (don't alert guards, get hit, or replenish health).\n\nThe Good\n++ Really interesting fantasy world and backstory that was explored through dialogue, books, and lore descriptions.\n++ This is definitely a stealth-focused game, and it does it well. Enemies are able to see/hear you the closer you are, but sneaking helps in that regard, and hiding in the many chests/cabinets/etc can give you an easy out if you're out of line-of-sight. If you're cornered, however, tools such as bottles and pinecone bombs allow you to knock out enemies.\n++ The story is captivating and the characters quite charming, considering the relatively short length of the game.\n++ Graphics were pretty fantastic, especially the sun rays and vegetation.\n++ You're able to collect and wear a guard armor disguise in the early/mid-game that allows you to move about without worry of alerting guards at the cost of movement speed.\n\nThe Neutral\n== The whole game takes place on one map that's pretty decent-sized, but it's small enough that you're doing a lot of backtracking and retreading the same ground. Luckily, the multiple areas of the map connect to each other at several points, but it can still get pretty maze-like.\n\nThe Bad\n-- A couple quests gave very little direction in where to go/what to do, but luckily I easily found the answers online.\n-- Very minor glitches (stuck camera in tight hallways, camera clips into void, sunlight clips through walls, etc)\n\n\nI can definitely see myself coming back to this game for another playthrough to grab those achievements I missed and relive this world and story. Really hope there's a sequel to the game, considering the ending.

El sistema de moverse con sigilo y esconderse es divertido. El apartado musical no es su fuerte. Aunque la profesi\u00f3n del rat\u00f3n es la de \"juglar\" las melod\u00edas son escasas y de una calidad correcta sin m\u00e1s. La banda sonora se limita a algunos acordes en los cambios de zona y durante las conversaciones. El sonido de ambientaci\u00f3n quiz\u00e1s est\u00e9 un poco m\u00e1s logrado (sonidos de mazmorras) y te permite ubicar por donde se mueven los enemigos con facilidad.\n\nCreo que a la hora de abrir las diferentes localizaciones del juego se tendr\u00eda que haber realizado por partes y no todas de golpe como sucede a partir de un momento determinado de la aventura. Da la sensaci\u00f3n que se empez\u00f3 muy bien pero las partes del final son \"demasiado\" extensas sin saber muy bien a donde tienes que ir.\n\nEn relaci\u00f3n con las \"misiones\" son un poco ca\u00f3ticas en el sentido que se asignan demasiadas a los mismos personajes (PNJ) y a veces, si no encuentras los objetos determinados que te van pidiendo, se van acumulando hasta que llega el desenlace y se \"pierden\".\n\nLas habilidades del rat\u00f3n apenas se pueden usar ya que las consigues cuando casi todo est\u00e1 hecho, o por lo menos, ese fue mi caso. Se pod\u00eda haber potenciado su aprendizaje y uso durante las fases iniciales de sigilo.\n\nOjo si vas a por los logros de steam porque el juego es un poco \"ca\u00f3tico\" a la hora de seguir la secuencia de las quests que te van encargando los personajes. Puede pasar que vayas avanzando en la historia y alguna misi\u00f3n secundaria la pierdas por el camino (las \"quests\" de los dos ratones en la prisi\u00f3n por ejemplo). Tampoco te ofusques con los diferentes logros ya que el protagonista va adquiriendo habilidades y objetos que te facilitaran la obtenci\u00f3n de algunos de los mismos seg\u00fan vayas avanzando en la aventura.\n\nEn resumen, s\u00ed lo recomiendo si lo encuentras de oferta en steam y te gustan este tipo de juegos. Pod\u00eda haber sido mucho mejor con algunos ligeros retoques en la asignaci\u00f3n y resoluci\u00f3n de las misiones. A su favor tiene que est\u00e1 traducido al castellano y el esmero en la realizaci\u00f3n de los escenarios. Da gusto ver correr a \"Tilo\", nuestro protagonista, por los pasillos de las diferentes partes del castillo. Se trata de un juego \"amateur\" realizado, eso hay que reconocerlo, con much\u00edsimo cari\u00f1o.

Unlocking new shortcuts makes navigating the world easier and discovering new areas and how everything interconnects with each other. Exploration feels very rewarding often giving you new pieces of gear or items. \n\n+ The game has interesting lore. When you talk to NPC\u2019s you are given the choice of pressing a button to learn more about the characters and locations. I thought this was a straightforward way for those looking for more in-depth story rather than the traditional way of scattering audio/text logs around.  \n\nTHE AVERAGE:\n+/- The first half of the game, specifically the very first two locations are frustrating if not terrible. The guards are very sensitive to sight and sound so you get caught very easily. The second half of the game is incredibly easy, once you find the armor suit, guards no longer notice you at the cost of reduced walking speeds, and the game essentially becomes a walking simulator. The first two areas of the game have tight corridors and tons of guards while every other subsequent area is more open and a lot less guards.  \n\n+/- Almost every side quest is about collecting a certain number of items. You are given very little information as to how to find these items so a walkthrough becomes necessary to complete them.  \n\n+/- A variety of different gear with different stats but most of them don\u2019t seem to make any significant difference. Guards will still see/hear you just as easily regardless of what you are wearing. Almost all other gear becomes pointless once you have the armor gear with upgrades.  \n\nTHE BAD:\n- This game has some really odd bugs; Every time I start the game my video settings are not saved, forcing me to go into my video settings to correct the issue.  Certain side quests are bugged as well. \n\n- I\u2019m not sure if this is a bug or just terrible design choice, but when you save your game, enemy guard location/placement is not saved, so you could save your game with no guards around only to reload your save and an enemy guard is standing right next to you. This is somewhat alleviated by the fact that you can only save when you enter a hiding spot like barrels or cupboards.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\nI was going to give this game a thumbs down because of how awful the first half of the game is but it does manage to redeem itself somewhat as the game progresses. The foundations of an amazing game are here but some frustrating stealth elements bring the game down.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1632001285, "timestamp_updated": 1632001285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683347046375274658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99493446": {"recommendationid": "99493446", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997144842", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1579, "last_played": 1631874371}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game on offer a little late after release but still... sooo worth it...

In the middle the game suddenly becomes a typical adventure game - and, I must say, a boring one. \n\nAlmost all quests are of the same type - find something scattered around several locations and/or bring it to someone. So the player is forced to move between the same locations over and over again. At some point, you realize that you're moving through the same location for the 5th time already during the last 10 minutes. I write 'move' instead of 'run' because at the same time player is forced to wear heavy armor which makes the speed of movement equal to the speed of a pregnant one-legged snail. I finished the game just to see if the story ends somehow in a meaningful way (spoiler: of course, it's not), but the further it was, the more boring it became. And I was disappointed by the 'final boss fight', this is definitely not the sort of mechanics that I like and I expected.\n\nActually, all I got after the end of the game was a headache and no fun.\n\nSummary:\n - THIS IS NOT A STEALTH GAME.\n - In case you like old-school adventure games or for some reason want to give a try for one of them - do it.

I finished the game, but apparently Steam doesn't log play time in offline mode.\n\nAs for the game... It's definitely a hard game to recommend, but bear with me. Yes, it's riddled with bugs. Yes, the primary gameplay is running around aimlessly searching for items and almost every quest is a fetch quest. Yes, you'll have to sneak past the same guard like 20 times as you keep having to go back to the same place and it gets frustrating (pro tip - just run past them and then hide. It's faster). And yes, had I known this is what the gameplay is like, I probably would not have bought the game.\nBut I'm glad I did - Because the story is worth it, if you can tolerate everything else.\n\nMore in depth:\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+ Dwidling Heights Keep is a really well designed place which feels like a confusing maze at first but gets more familiar and easy to move around in as you unlock all of the secret pathways. The play area is really well designed and fun to explore.\n+ That's genuinely it. I didn't like anything else about the gameplay.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- Extremely shallow stealth mechanics for a game that mainly relies on stealth.\n- Guard AI is stupid, they never even alert other guards if they see you and they forget about you in about 3 seconds.\n- Too many fetch quests, very few actually engaging quests\n- Too many times you aren't told explicitly what you need to do next, leaving you to wonder if you're missing something or the game's bugged. I had to google things way too often to keep myself from being overly frustrated.\n- Too many bugs. Even had 1 game breaking bug where a dialogue that was supposed to start on its own didn't start, in a main quest. That nearly made me abandon the game, before I found a thread somewhere online where someone suggested to reset the game's settings file manually, from the game's installation folder, and that fixed it.\n- Only being able to save in hiding spots is pretty annoying, because when you progress enough you'll reach a point where you hardly ever need to hide, which makes it easy to forget to save.\n- Many side quests require you to progress with the story before they can be completed - but many other sidequests require some kind of hidden item that can be found somewhere. It's impossible to know when you've missed something and when you just need to keep playing.\n\n[h2]Graphics & Audio[/h2]\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+ Beautiful art style and design\n+ Pretty minor hud leaves most of the screen free\n+ Really great soundtrack\n+ Sound design in general is very good, the little tippy-tappy of Tilo's feet when running is very cute.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- Very short draw distance causes annoying pop-in of distant models. No way to improve this in the game's settings\n- Objects start looking blurry and pixelated when they're a little bit far from the camera\n- Music seems to swell up and die down at random intervals, regardless of what's happening\n- No voice acting\n- Disappointing photo mode\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+ Extremely rich and inventive lore, much more so than expected\n+ The world feels realistic and grounded yet pretty magical. Draws you in very quickly\n+ Many really fun, well-rounded characters\n+ Good writing overall\n+ Story is told really well\n+ Mix of children's-story vibes with painful reality\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- The ending gives no closure, but instead focuses on building up to a sequel (that will probably never happen)\n\n[h2]Bottom Line[/h2]\nThe gameplay really gets in the way of a very good story, but overall I think the game does deliver a satisfying enough experience to be worth your time and money (though probably on sale). \nI do hope a sequel will come some day (preferably one that improves on the many flawed mechanics), but with no words from the devs after 3 years, I kinda doubt it.

Many reviewers have already commented on the unfinished feel of the 2nd half. A compelling, well-written, and beautifully animated beginning drags a bit after the first 5 or so hours, giving way to bug-ridden environments, collect-a-thons, a complete shift in mechanical focus, and a sloppy ending leading to a cliffhanger that may never get a resolution.\n\n[b]HOWEVER[/b]\n\nThere are a few [b]very[/b] important points to consider:\n[olist]\n[*] When I say the beginning of the game is compelling, well-written, and beautifully animated I am committing an [b]enormous[/b] understatement. It only takes the game 1 minute to establish the defining lore and tone of the in-game world. It takes another 40 seconds to introduce the main character, his background, motivation, and character. Every item has a delightful piece of lore attached to it. Each character is lovingly designed and written. The environments are grounded yet fantastical. The lighting and textures are pure eye candy.\n[*] The gameplay is a very clever use of stealth mechanics. I read how the developer initially tried to make it a 3rd-person combat game. Demo testers informed him his combat was clunky and unpolished (i.e. it \"kinda sucked\"). So instead he focused on the strengths of his protagonist both as a mouse (speed, agility, stealth) and a minstrel (performance, deception, music). I'm very fond of stealth games and this scratched that itch very well (that is until the point where you get a particular disguise that negates the need for stealth anywhere).\n[*] This game was built almost entirely by one guy, Lionel Gallat. And he wasn't even a developer by trade. His story is very interesting and I would recommend giving it a read online (I referenced [url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-an-ex-dreamworks-animator-imbued-i-ghost-of-a-tale-i-with-character]this article[/url]). It's a testament to how anyone can try their hand at game development these days, bringing a unique take on the medium every time. I'm honestly staggered by how much he managed to accomplish. It far outweighs (and explains) the issues in the late game.\n[*] Gallat is a film animator. I think this actually explains some of the issues seen in the game, most obviously the wealth of environmental and dialog bugs in the latter half. More broadly, though, I believe it has to do with the differences between film production and game development workflows. Films have clearly defined pre-production, production, and post-production phases. Game development, especially when done by very small teams, doesn't always have that same predefined schedule (though it probably should). Ghost of a Tale demonstrates how easy it is to begin making a game from the beginning, get to the middle, realize you don't have as much time/money as you thought, and rush the final chapters. Why game devs don't give themselves more of a post-prod editing phase, I couldn't say. I guess that's why so many games are \"early access\" these days.\n[/olist]\n\nAll that to say, this game is an extremely well-done passion project that suffers from the same issues as pretty much all passion projects. In my opinion, the developer, despite his mistakes, has more than earned my respect and support.

Considering they actually have the balls to recommend you play the game with a controller, its absolutely inexcusable that it just does not work at all. I tried every fix i could find online such as validating the games local files or customizing the button mapping in steam itself, but to no avail.

[spoiler](altho left on a bit of a cliffhanger)[/spoiler]\n\nI have spent over 15 hours in this game, and I can say I really enjoyed the story, the missions and puzzles even though some were quite challenging! It honestly just added to the fun and playability!\n\nI also absolutely love the character designs, being a big fan of rodents such as mice and rats. \nThe atmosphere and the look of everything were really lovely, I found myself enjoying it and being captivated by the world a lot. The different areas are always fun to explore when you can finally get to them, and I personally never really got bored of them, no matter how often I may have had to go back to certain areas lol. The aspect of \"stealth\" in this game is also quite fun, though it can get a little annoying when you have to go back and forth between places a lot, but you get items that help you with that eventually so it isn't too bad.\n\nYou can tell that a lot of love and time has went into this project, and I would absolutely love playing a \"second\" one of this game!\nOverall I would recommend this game if you are someone who enjoys the kind of games where you solve some puzzles, explore a lot and fullfill quests! Oh and if you love cute mice characters, this is also for you! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1626323073, "timestamp_updated": 1626323073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751093447208404541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95620738": {"recommendationid": "95620738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088312136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 847, "last_played": 1662896893}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game", "timestamp_created": 1626117994, "timestamp_updated": 1626117994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95572554": {"recommendationid": "95572554", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961176663", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1625693126}, "language": "english", "review": "Great graphics, animations and cutest protagonist ever.", "timestamp_created": 1626052654, "timestamp_updated": 1626052654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95420901": {"recommendationid": "95420901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400471768", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1604, "last_played": 1627708281}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Good graphics everything is beautiful!

There's scarcely a better way to describe it. I quite enjoyed it, and once I finished it, I was kind of sad that there wasn't more. It's mostly because of that feeling that I have to recommend it; I figure they did a good job if I am left wanting more.\n\nIt doesn't really do anything new or revolutionary. Instead, it focuses heavily on telling a narrative. You don't really play the main character, you guide him, and along the way you learn his story and come to care about him. The writing is quite good, from the actual text/dialogue to the lore it represents. It is consistent and clever, and quite enjoyable. It's easy to get into and I found myself caring about the world and the characters very naturally. That's the focus of the game, I think. It's simple and fairly easy; just a conduit for the lore and the story, and I think as such they succeeded quite well.\n\nThat said, the game does have some flaws that can't be overlooked. There are a few bugs in the game (and not just the creepy-crawly kind). The biggest flaw, I think, is the integrity of the physical world. The levels are beautiful, but quite poorly constructed. Terrain holes abound, through which you can see the void beyond the world. Almost everywhere you look, there are holes into the void or objects misaligned, exposing their invisible inner sides. I never found any that I could fit through, but it's a pretty glaring problem. You get used to it a bit, but it definitely detracts from the immersion.\n\nThere was also one particular floor that I actually just fell right through once, dropping through the world and actually landing below in an area I shouldn't have been able to access yet. It only happened once, but every subsequent time I crossed that floor I could see the character sink in a little and/or bob up and down a bit through the floor as I moved on it. I was never sure if it was going to happen again, which was a bit nerve wracking.\n\n I also ended up getting to a couple of areas by cheesing my way across areas of the level that I was never meant to see, much less traverse (one of which led me to a further part of the level that I wasn't ready for and from which I couldn't return). The ability to guide/restrict player movement to ensure valid gameplay progression is important, and they missed the mark there a bit.\n\nStill, overall, it was very enjoyable and I do highly recommend it. One of the most charming games I've played and I hope they'll do a sequel.

Where is he, where is wife, why, what and so on. This means quite a few fellows to be talked and friend with in story line and having around 57 quests to deal with, keening on if one does every other quest beside main ones.\n\nThere is no voice acting, but some sound are included for characters like scratching, farting and so on. Main pool of characters comes from jail's rat guards who are ready to slap the whiskers outta from Tilo's face every given opportunity, so at first hiding and being stealthy is required until getting full guard armor set piece by piece. And this is one of the big issues in Ghost of a Tale, Tilo's speed/stealthiness/stamina give so much trouble in going around, as stamina diminishes almost instantly at start and so does speed, though rat guards aren't too fast and you can easily hide in several pots/cupboard and likewise places. Still after initial cell section this become quite tedious indeed. With guard armor you can go around without hassle, but since it's armor made for rats, it's very slow to go around, even with upgrades, but it's way better with them. Though it takes a while to get whole guard set and on top of that you have basically gone through whole game at point of getting fully upgraded guard armor at which point the golden hero armor is open.\n\nTo make matters worse for going around is the quests, that basically wind up being almost all fetch quests... which are fine usually, but here it's just basically everything you get. Tilo gets all kind of request either steal, scavenge (close to 100 mushrooms or so), pick up all kinds of items around several maps that are interconnected and opened up little by little. This means running around becomes main thing in the game and makes it at point quite annoying experience. Start felt good, but after that had hard time to come back until picked it up again and scored for the finish. Shame in sense as found more enjoyment in it due story and build up at the end and having gold armor helped a ton.\n\nThere is inventory system for food to fill combined health/stamina bar, books/lore, quests, different armors and so on. Quick inventory offers option to use light sources or throwable items to deal with guard. Sticks to make noise, bottles to stun them (if no helmets), pinecones for critters to explode and so on. Also could mention there being maps which are pretty solid to show layouts and blacksmith who is potentially quite important npc for completing quests or finding items around the place.\n\nIt's sure nice looking game and start promising, but honestly even if it did pick up towards the end again, feel like it's not worth a recommendation.

The stealth is also fun, and not too difficult, providing a more casual challenge for those who don't play tons of Metal Gear.\n\n However, the tense stealth mechanics of the first half of the game just cease to exist later on, and the latter half of the game feels empty and unfinished. The final \"battle\" is also a confusing mess, and lacks a good deal of the animation and flair present in similar events leading up to it. \n\nIn summation, Ghost of At Tale feels like a spectacular game where the devs ran out of money, time, or both. An ambitious project, with an ambitious story, but not enough resources to see it through. The cliffhanger ending also left a bad taste in my mouth, but if it actually leads to a sequel, I won't mind so much.

I heard it was DS, but not brutal, and your character was an adorable mouse, plus stealth, SOLD! Unfortunately, that is not what this game is. Initially I was disappointed, but for what the game actually is, I started to enjoy it after the first 2hrs. The world and art was all amazing, kudos to the small team who gave this game life. The story/lore is very rich, and a good chunk of the lore plays a part in some of the dialogue choices and conceal clues to quests. \n\nPros:\n-Art style\n- animation \n- story\n- music/sound design\n-humor\n-dark souls-like level design,  like how it's all connected but you can't get certain places yet or get their quickly until later.\n\nCons:\n-aspects of the game clearly at one point, use to have significance, but in the final product proved to be things that should have been cut, like the Rotgut bottles you find for instance, or the flint and steel, certain costume parts, etc.\n-It pretends to have story affecting choices for dialogue and quest, but really it's just multiple choice situations that either progress the game or don't.  So replayability to see how the different choices affect the game is thrown out. \n-there is no real threat, stealth is optional.\n- useless items/mechanics. For instance, there is a stat for Fire Resistance, but there is no fire threat...at all.\n\nOverall it is worth thr play, it's fun, but the cons are just a bummer.

How can such a small team make such a great game?\n\nAt first I wasn't completely convinced. It took some getting used to the game mechanics, and also I didn't know much about the story and its background. I started getting worried when I realized I couldn't kill any guards, only get pass them undetected (or eventually knock them over for a few seconds by throwing a bottle to their head).\n\nThen I realized it made sense: I play the mouse Tilo, a minstrel thrown in prison without understanding why. I'm a weak, peace-loving mouse, why would I start killing giant rat guards armed with military equipment and lances?\n\nThe game follows some RPG principles but only vaguely: you get more HP as you climb levels, and you gain levels only by obtaining \"fame\" while doing some actions. You can also learn a few skills, but they are not vital and will only slightly help along the way. So this is not really a classic RPG, instead it focuses really on the story, and as you complete new quests, you will learn more about the entire story. And just like in any good stories, there are more and more revelations the closer you get to the end. So, what didn't really feel like a tale at first suddenly becomes an epic tale.\n\nGameplay is simple and effective, and there is little to no fighting in this game. Instead it relies more on a sense of adventure, exploring areas and completing quest so you can finally get out of this place and find your wife again. Simple but effective, yes, it's a good feeling for the game overall. Also you'll get around 25 hours of gameplay so it's really not bad! The game never felt redundant despite all that, the developers found a good balance of different game tactics to keep the game interesting.\n\nThe only big problem for me was that I played the game on LINUX, and there are a few problems with it: it's quite heavy on the graphic card and it was a bit laggy (or very laggy in a couple places: the catacombs and the harbor), even though i lowered settings. Also one quest didn't complete and I had some problems with the controller settings. There's even a bug that crashes the game every 20 minutes or so, but you can go around that by adding a few commands in the game properties [i] (for linux players: go to your STEAM library, find your game \"Ghost of a tale\" then click the \"manage\" button on the right --> select \"properties\" --> go the general tab (you should be on it by default) --> at the bottom you'll see the \"launch options\" where you should type: [b] PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 gamemoderun %command% [/b] . That's it, your game won't crash every 20 minutes now) [/i]\n\nSo I had a great time defending my little heroe \"Tilo\" the minstrel mouse, and I loved the fact that you get attached to the characters (the heroes, but also a few of his allies). The story clearly has an open ending that will let you think \"what's gonna happen next?\". So I'll say it now: When is the \"Ghost of a Tale : Volume 2\" coming? Shut up and take my money!!!

It's a little worrying at the beginning because you're not quite sure what the tolerance of the Rat Guards' attention is but after a few hours of play, as well as getting noticed a few times, you'll discover what you can and can't do around them and use the weakness of their attention range to your advantage to go places you didn't think you could go. This, after 3 hrs of play and exploring what I felt safe to explore of the Prison, is how I finally ran into the first main story checkpoint I was directed to find after escaping the Jail section of the Prison. This could be seen as a negative, but the game's lore, level design and MANY subquests such kept me interested to keep looking around till I bumped into it. It came off as organic gameplay instead of being directly lead to where I needed to go as a lot of games like to do.\n\nThe lore bits scattered around the world is interesting and helps to build up what kind of world you are in as well as provides context for what you see in certain areas of the Prison.\n\nIt is a bit disappointing that it seems the Prison is the only level in this game, but they seem to have taken full advantage of everything they could do with the castle so the single location isn't boring at all.\n\nIt also seems very much possible to choose to get a bad ending in the game based on an option given to you sort of close to the start of the game, but by the time you run into it it's 100% your choice to take it and ignore the main quest, so I don't see this as an issue.\n\nIf you're a fan of exploration games, especially stealth based exploration games with lore, give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1614653449, "timestamp_updated": 1614653449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87701777": {"recommendationid": "87701777", "author": {"steamid": "76561199032108092", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1616017553}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so unique and fun.

As Milo escapes from his cell, he must explore the prison and the surrounding areas in search of his wife Merra, all while avoiding the rat guards, as Milo can't fight.\n\nRight from the start, the game impresses with the quality of its presentation: its medieval world looks absolutely gorgeous and feels full of life, especially with how well-animated and well-written all characters are. Even the guards, who might seem like random emotionless lackeys in the beginning, eventually show their personality, adding to how rich the game's world feels. The soundtrack is also great at immersing you in this world, with music that's reminiscent of fantasy animated movies, awakening a certain feeling of magical wonder.\n\nGameplay-wise, you will spend most of the game exploring every nook and cranny of the map as you complete main story quests and sidequests alike. It's an indie game made mostly by a single person, so don't go in expecting a map on the scale of Witcher 3 or something of the like, but the work that has been done in Ghost of a Tale is impressive on its own right. Not only is the map quite large for an indie title, but it's also rich with content, which's much more important than the size itself.\n\nThe game has no combat, so there's a big focus on avoiding guards through the adventure. The stealth mechanics are very simple to grasp; to stay undetected, walk slowly near enemies and use cover and hiding spots wisely. Every area is cleverly designed in a way that you usually won't have to spend too much time waiting for enemies to walk past you, especially in the mid to late game.\n\nOne negative aspect of the game is that sometimes the guards can feel rather stupid; if they spot you, it's fairly easy to outrun them, and they often won't go after you for long distances. I've played through the entire game without ever receiving damage from a guard's attack. However, being spotted does mean you won't be able to properly explore the area until you're in the clear, so it's something you'll want to avoid either way. And the stealth mechanics are simple enough that it never really feels like a chore or more effort than it's worth.\n\nAll in all, Ghost of a Tale is a beautiful game with a very rich, immersive world that is a joy to explore. Even if it's not a terribly long adventure, what's there is very much worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1613950985, "timestamp_updated": 1613950985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87186322": {"recommendationid": "87186322", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963430881", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 363, "last_played": 1618177207}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is great", "timestamp_created": 1613939341, "timestamp_updated": 1613939341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86901239": {"recommendationid": "86901239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050903798", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1674629051}, "language": "english", "review": "With great characters, a solid story, and an impeccably designed world with tons of secrets to find, this is a definite indie gem that's actually worth full price.", "timestamp_created": 1613588269, "timestamp_updated": 1613588269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86876492": {"recommendationid": "86876492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013667153", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1612919174}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite an experience.

All of the areas are interconnected with one another, giving the sense that these are real lived in spaces you're traversing. A Dark Souls like world design as the setting for a stealth game is a wonderful idea. \n\nThere are only a couple of black marks on the experience as a whole, and most of them are small. If you intend on one hundred percenting the game you will be backtracking... a lot. Once you know the map this won't be particularly difficult, but the sense of exploration and danger will be replaced with tedium as you complete some less than stellar side quests to collect costume pieces, burn banners, or play fetch for various NPCs. A hearthstone like item in the late game would've been nice, but I can understand it may have compromised the immersive integrity of the world. \n\nThis brings me to the only negative thing I have to say about the game, the final encounter:\n\n[spoiler] Designing a combat focused final boss in a stealth oriented game largely based on solving puzzles and exploration is a truly bad way to present a final challenge to the player. It felt rushed, bizarre, and awkward. The fact there was no auto save past the point of no return is disrespectful to the players time, especially with the amount of trial and error involved. Seeing the end was worth it, but not justified.

Maybe once or twice, some guards kept looking for me, never giving up, even though I had escaped and I was quite far away.

If they wanted the ancient hero to be Boudica, they should have just said it was Boudica from the beginning. [/spoiler] No complaints about the gameplay until the very end. [spoiler] I would have liked a dodge or duck ability when carrying the explosives to the emerald chest. Something to do other than walking and hoping the companions would come to your rescue.

I love the environments, and the characters are well animated and expressive. Even early on, there are a number of memorable encounters (the big frog stands out to me for some reason). The inventory system is well-designed, the protagonist seems relatable, and there is a unique balance that I don't see often in that the combat works well despite the game generally discouraging trying to fight one's way out of danger. There's lots to like here.\n\nI gave it a 6/10 in that it's very much a \"know what you're getting yourself into\" kind of a game. The game is very heavily stealth-based. I understand the game design isn't intended to be able to be won based on bigger gun diplomacy, but between the maps being a bit confusing to navigate and the fact that being spotted by a guard can very easily put you in a situation where you have to fight an enemy that only needs to get one or two hits in before you're dead, I found myself dying *a lot*, and replaying the same stealth-past-those-eleven-guards section for a while, to the point where it stopped being fun and I basically gave up. I understand that that's part of the point of the story - the protagonist /is/ weak compared to the guards, but when it's easy to get spotted by a guard across the map and stealth mechanics mean that it's possible to spend ten minutes trying to make it through a room and then get killed in the last 30 seconds, again, it does tend to suck the enjoyment out of playing the game. Then again, stealth mechanics were never my forte.\n\nSo, if you have any skill with stealth games, this one is well worth it. It's a solid indie title that most definitely swings above its weight class. If you aren't a fan of the genre, you're going to find yourself a bit less-than-thrilled at the amount of work some sections take to progress.", "timestamp_created": 1607152751, "timestamp_updated": 1607152751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81547944": {"recommendationid": "81547944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087487154", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3153, "last_played": 1607028098}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely beautiful and the story is sooooo engaging.

It makes the game a lot slower and it kills a lot of the tension. Its very easy to give up sneaking too early and fall into over using it bc it seems like the most direct solution. There are other solutions. Outside needing to physically speak to a guard, I would not bother with it. It takes away more than it adds.\n2) Think creatively. There is 3 or 4 ways to hit every challenge, lots of hidden secrets, and plenty of tools to use. through is not the only way. Try around, above, or using the objects around you.\n3) dont try to reload a save file. The game makes a big deal of autosaving right after conversations so you cant go back and pick a new answer.

The environments and character models are well detailed and the character model idle animation loops are surprisingly fluid and intricate, especially from the indie scene. The environments themselves are varied and atmospheric when they need to be. The puzzles aren't very difficult and the stealth moments are quite cheeseable but I put that as a good thing because you quickly learn how best to end an encounter as fast as possible so you can progress and not worry so much about traversing the world.\n\nI mentioned early how the game design was simple. well.....\nMostly every objective in the game is a fetch quest or some variant there of. You don't actually fight enemies; the stealth is either run past a patrolling guard and turn a corner before their chase protocol can kick in or you duck into a hide-y hole and wait for them to go away. The set pieces are very scripted and the character models act more as triggers for a text dialogue system rather than an organic part of the world (though the artwork in the dialogue is very nice and varied) and when it's time for characters to not be in the locations their in or in a different position, there is no movement or transition.\n*pop*\nThe game uses the same character model for all the mice characters and rat model for the rat characters but change the movements, clothing and accessories in order to tell them apart. While this does work for a little while, it becomes jarring pretty quick.

Lots of ambiance.\n\nGame mechanics and controls are pretty decent using an x box controller. There are a lot of side quests to do and many are interwoven with each other. I really like how they did the quests and it is fun discovering secret passages that form nice short cuts. You can save the game only when you find a place to hide. At first you must use stealth, but later on you get armor which allows you to walk among the rat soldiers. \n\nThe thing I dont like is getting lost, there isnt a minimap on the screen and you have to find the maps for the game otherwise you have none. I found myself getting lost a lot in the game. Many of the quests can be hard to figure out what to do next because there are no quest markers on the map. You just get a general comment in the quest on what to do next and some can be pretty open. Youtube became my friend in the game more than just a few times when i got stuck on what to do next. Some items you need are really hidden well and you have much trouble finding them. I wish the game held your hand a bit more on quests!\n\nOverall the good outweighs the bad.

I spent 12 hours straight the first day just absolutely absorbed by this world.\n\nThe level design is top notch. Some of the best level design I've ever seen. The only other games I can think of that have worlds like this are soulsborne games. The areas aren't huge but they are dense. You will get lost but if you stick with it, you will eventually figure out the layout of things and where all the shortcuts are.\n\nExploration is fun and rewarding. You will often find new armor sets and shortcuts if you go off the obvious path and look around more. The game encourages you to take your time and really look around.\n\nThe story is interesting and wasn't too hard to keep up with. That said, there is no spoken dialogue, so be prepared to read a lot of lore if you want to know what's going on. The game helps you constantly with that though. Any time a character mentions something lore related to the world, a button pops up allowing you to learn more about that subject. It's a great way to learn about this world's story and is totally optional if you don't want to bother. I would suggest you do though because you might not know what's going on a lot of the time if you don't.\n\nThe graphics are amazing as well. The lighting is great and the environments look awesome. The character designs are good too. There are a lot of the same looking rats, but that is honestly not that big a deal and totally understandable considering one person did basically all the art for the game.

It is the first game in a long time I found myself completely invested in to the world the makers envisioned, and can only hope for future installments.\n\nYou play as Tilo, a mouse minstrel who is trying to find his Wife. The game takes place within a rat garrison and the surrounding land, which is bursting with character and a loving attention to detail. Navigating about the keep starts off as tedious, but the inclusion of passages and shortcuts that become unlocked means it gets easier. As you progress throughout the story, you'll quickly realize that the area the game takes place in is only a tiny part of a much more grand world the makers realized. \n\nProgression comes in a simple quest system. Over the course of completing the main storyline, you'll be given the chance to complete additional side missions for the various NPCs scattered about, with many coming by way of simply revisiting them frequently. Each and every character is fleshed out to an almost obsessive level; you could learn the names of every single NPC you see, including the guards! While the majority of these quests are optional, the benefit comes in learning skills that make the game slightly easier, and in earning experience.\n\nExp gains are the most minimalist I have ever experienced, and yet crafted skillfully into the game. Raising a level gives you a bit more health, and nothing else. The kicker is, that your Stamina is tied directly to health. So being able to take a hit and still scamper far enough away without needing to recover is a worthwhile boon\n\nspeaking of taking a hit, combat is near non-existent in the game. As a small mouse in a Keep controlled by Rats, any single guard can easily take you out if you let them. It falls to stealth and guile for navigating past them. You can knock out a guard a couple of ways for a brief moment to get past them, but the items needed are scarce and do not replenish. Learning to utilize blind spots and the guards patrol routes is key.\n\nMy only gripe comes in the quest tracking. Early in the game, you'll be loaded with side quests without a single hint that they can't be finished until you proceed further in the main story. Proceeding further may complete one or two quests, give progress on others, as well as toss a few more your way. Thankfully, the game was written in such a way that you cannot unintentionally lock yourself out of a quest, but my desire to complete every side quest before moving on brought about some frustration. Combined with the quest help in game coming in the form of dialogue that is not logged after the conversation, I found myself frequently stuck trying to find the one thing I needed to progress. And unlike the 2D games of yore, where you could just click randomly around the room, navigating a 3D space with little to no sign that you're near what you're hunting for, can be maddening.\n\nMy runthrough, completing all discovered sidequests, took me just over 14 hours, which I could shave down considerably now that I won't be running around in circles. I still highly recommend this game, especially to those who enjoy a strong narrative, a well made game world, and most importantly, who are not swiftly frustrated.", "timestamp_created": 1600608185, "timestamp_updated": 1600608185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76147721": {"recommendationid": "76147721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256878394", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1634089936}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly amazing game it was fun, cute, good story, good characters and it was very calming.

There's not a toggle sneak button, so you're stuck holding down the sneak key in a lot of parts, which gets old fast.  When you sneak, you have to sneak and pause, sneak and pause, to get past guards but you also have to be fast enough before they path back toward you.  You can sprint for a brief second, but it's hardly enough time to get away from the guards once they spot you.  The guards can box you in and there's nothing you can do but die.  The guards see/get aggro easily and are bunched together in places.   You can distract them with thrown objects, but that only works if you can throw far enough and there's somewhere you can hide to get past them.

The glitches can include the inability to talk to npc or click on chests, but can be easily fixed by restarting the game.\n\nWithout spoiling, the ending left me \":(((((\" and I hope there will be a DLC so I can find _____.", "timestamp_created": 1596952432, "timestamp_updated": 1596952432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74005525": {"recommendationid": "74005525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178909474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1266, "last_played": 1597626047}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Bastante recomendable, enternecedor, con grandes personajes y una gran historia en todos los rincones del juego.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1596940629, "timestamp_updated": 1596940629, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73727923": {"recommendationid": "73727923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030652892", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 285, "last_played": 1596676804}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of the movie Secret of Nymh growing up the characters resonate with me.

As beautiful as it is aesthetically, with great animation and music (which is used to sparingly in my opinion)this games glaring faults become readily apparent. First and foremost, this game should be called Fetchquest: The Game. Literally all you do is move from one end of the map to other collecting items and returning them. It is EXTRAORDINARILY tedious and time-consuming. Often times the items location isn't even properly explained or is hidden in obscure places. I had enough patience to get through 8 hours of this game only to finally quit about 3/4 of the way through the main quest line. This game is fun to explore, but due to the fact that a majority of the time is spent simply running around without any other activities, I have to recommend against buying it. I think this game would have been a lot more successful if it had done at least two things:\n\n1. Offered fast travel -- there is no excuse for this\n\n2.

The plot is fun and intriguing, the characters are charming, and the world is gorgeous. TL;DR: this game is well worth the money and I highly recommend it, especially if you like stealth games, story, and atmosphere. \n\n[b] The good stuff: [/b]\n- Beautiful graphics, lighting, and environments\n- Game world is gorgeous and very well fleshed out with lots of detail\n- No load screens!\n- Controls are simple and easy to get used to\n- Amazingly complex and interesting lore, integrated smoothly without info-dumping (but there's plenty to read if you want to get deep into it)\n- Gameplay is balanced and flows well\n- Actually worth it to listen to characters' advice and read all dialogue\n- Dialogue is all text-based and not voice acted (I know this is probably a negative for some, but I thought it really fit well with this game)\n- Your dialogue choices and actions actually affect future events and relationships\n- Really nice art to accompany the dialogue\n- You can actually traverse obstacles and terrain easily! Y'know, like a mouse!\n- Beautiful soundtrack and rich sound effects\n- Honestly, the mouse characters are just downright adorable\n\n[b] The negatives: [/b]\n- Traveling back and forth across the map gets slightly tedious at times (you do find shortcuts, but not quite enough in later-game locations IMO)\n- Maps aren't labeled at all, so you end up backtracking and going in circles a lot until you get familiar with what's where\n- It's a bit unclear what exactly some of the items do (i.e. I never used the flint in my playthrough and still don't know what it does)\n- Plot is a bit of a cliffhanger, but does conclude most plot/character arcs in a satisfying way (SPOILER: [spoiler] You don't find Merra - the story ends with you leaving Dwindling Heights to search elsewhere [/spoiler] )\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by this game and I desperately hope they release a sequel.

Even though I found myself going in circles at times trying to find some things, I never got bored of all the details. A small team made this game (if I recall the info on the page, 5 people?) which blows my mind. The only bug I came across was during the Skappbeetle quest. Thankfully I had a previous save file and sure enough the bug I needed was visible. It doesn\u2019t seem like a common bug, as I found no posts anywhere on the net. The game can be too dark for my eyes so I upped the brightness. Sounds were good, some repetitive but I didn't mind. I wish the songs were longer, they really hyped a scene, letting me know I was advancing in the story or something was about to happen to keep me on my toes. Make no mistake this is a fetch and stealth game, but oh boy was I worried for lil' Tilo! I really appreciate the care that went into the way Tilo moves. On rare occasion some funny mishap with the models came up but it only happened a couple times after the AI turned its hostile mode off. I think the game is 18-20 hours gameplay wise but if you want perfect collection of achievement, I suspect you'll add more. The only thing I'd have liked added is an easier access to the maps and be able to use markers. It was a hassle to open the menu and tab through it all. Some things were difficult to find from the hints or lack thereof, and I did end up searching for videos or forums to help. \n\nI think there is more to the story than was possible to fit in this game, so I wonder if a follow up will be made and released for the gaming community. I\u2019d love to play that too.\n\nThis is a game I'll definitely replay and recommend.

They're well above average.  You'll like the characters and the world is fairly fleshed out if you care to dive into it.  Cute mousey portraits give life to the characters.  A number of tomes and side notes are there for the consuming\n\nWhere the game lacks is level design and mechanics.   This game is all about exploration and finding every little nook and cranny.  I love that.  Normally, finding well hidden items is just to get a bonus, maybe a secret ending.  In Ghost of a Tale, finding everything often is required for progressing the main story.  Without any visual cues as to what's important in a room, you'll often be fighting the camera to look around just in case there's another key hidden well above your head, or some passage you've just never noticed after passing it a dozen times.  Eventually, I just gave up on stealth and started sprinting past the guards.  The rat patrol guards easily forget your presence, and hiding spots are ample.   There appears to be no punishment for regularly getting caught\n\nThese very simple, forgiving stealth mechanics don't make the game bad on their own.  This game isn't trying to empower your sneak-thief mouse with the sword or make itself into a roguelike.   It has a story to tell and it wants you to experiment and be daring, knowing forgiveness is around the corner (but you better have enough stamina to sprint to it!).   The constant revisiting of the same guards, patterns, and areas though just burns out any passion for moving the game forward\n\nI still intend to finish out the game and see how the characters' stories play out.

Exploration is excellent thanks in large part to the strong level design. Backtracking is hardly an issue with the map offering countless shortcuts and avenues to get from A to Z. This reminds me of  those Styx stealth games but a more focused and leaner title. You won't be knocking out guards or engaging in fights, the name of the game is dampening your footsteps and creating distractions. The world is surprisingly fleshed out and a lot of work went to giving the NPCs a lot of character and charm. The lighting, animations, and art design is gorgeous and cute. I'm really smitten by this title. I didn't expect to love/enjoy this as much as I did.\n\nAnother positive: you don't need voice acting for strong characterisation. \n\nWeaknesses:\nTHe game features a lot of backtracking, especially toward the end.

I say little because I do feel it's a bit short especially for the price, however the game itself is worth every penny as I throughly enjoyed it and was so sad when it came to such a cliff hanger ending! I really do hope there is a second game in the making. The feel and game play gave me such strong nostalgia of games from the late 90s, a strong story with very emmersive settings. It's tough to find a game like this these days that has such a great balance. At first I found it a little slow as the game really does throw you right in with little help (which to be honest I really appreciate these days as I'm sick of the hand holding in many modern games) and got frustrated with being stuck at some points, as at first it feels like one big fetch quest for many items, keys, clothing, food etc. But once you get through that the game really does become very enjoyable, in fact I had to pace myself so that I didn't finish the game too quick! The music was also a nice touch, nothing to rave about but catchy in it's own subtle way. I liked that although the game is linear you do get some dialog choices and side quests. The only negative I have is that there is a lot of back and fourth between the map, which at first feels like a very daunting maze. So I found myself getting lost very often which added to the frustrations at the start. With no quick travel of any sorts and Tilo the mouse only being able to run for about 15 seconds before loosing stamina, it can get a little tedious. However, this really is overshadowed by everything good in this game, and there is a lot! Not to mention it's also beautiful to look at!

The ending irritated me just because you go 99% of the game without any major challenge and then suddenly... well, you can look it up, I'm not spoiling anything.\n\nThe BEST part of this game was the story. Absolutely amazing A++ story. Characters that you fall in love with, that you want to know, that you want to help. The atmosphere was great. I definitely think that this game has a steep learning curve but once you get past that it's much easier. I recommend just using guides when you need to. I put down this game and didn't come back to it for a long time because of frustration with just not knowing where the hell I needed to go or what I needed to do.\n\nOverall, this was a good game, like I said, the story was FANTASTIC!! But I hope any future projects from this team will be a little more polished in terms of quests (to avoid future glitches) because nothing kills a game for me like doing everything I can but having the programming fail.", "timestamp_created": 1590853670, "timestamp_updated": 1590853670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69698115": {"recommendationid": "69698115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174400743", "num_games_owned": 615, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1589621123}, "language": "english", "review": "[quote][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SirAlexandersReviewClub]Follow our curator page[b] Alexander's Club Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]\n[h1]OVERVIEW[/h1]\n[i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] is a 3rd-person stealth adventure game released in 2018. Play as a mouse named Tilo as he embarks in an adventure set in a well-crafted open world full of secrets and inhabited by many interesting characters. Some minor lack of polish does not hamper the fun and sense of discovery this game has to offer.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Superbly made, small, but dense open world to discover and explore.\n[*] Strong art direction with excellent animation bringing the world and characters alive.\n[*] Surprisingly deep and interesting world full of lore to be learned.\n[*] Likeable cast of characters filling the world\n[*] Excellent soundtrack\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n[list]\n\n[*] Can be unpolished especially the terrain hit detection, where in some areas you are prone to fall off the world.\n[*] Over-reliant on collectibles/fetch quests.\n[*] Enemy's AI is too forgiving and too easy to exploit.\n[*] No voice acting\n[*] The story ended in a cliffhanger and the main plot doesn\u2019t get resolved.\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere aren\u2019t any complex mechanics in the game. The gameplay mostly involves finding a way to certain locations in the world or finding items. There are several tools given to you to navigate the world, and I will elaborate on them in detail.\n\n[b]Stealth[/b]\n\nThe stealth element is simple. Enemies have a basic vision cone and hearing range. When Tilo is inside their vision cone, or walk inside their hearing range the awareness meter rises and they will chase him if it fills up. Guards will chase you until you find a hiding place or run outside their search perimeter.\n\nStealth is also affected by other mechanics like what armor you wear. Some armor is quiet and raise your sneak stat, while heavier armor will attract guards easier as they make a lot of noise. You can also throw items to distract guards and slip while they are searching. Some items give you the ability to knock them out temporarily.\n\nOverall the stealth system isn\u2019t really that deep or engaging. The enemy AI are far too dumb and they are slow that you can mostly outrun them making it trivial.\n\n[b]Navigation and Level[/b]\n\nIn [i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] the players are thrown into an open world where you unlock more areas as you progress. The level design is reminiscent of [i]Dark Souls[/i] where shortcuts and secret routes are unlocked as you explore. The world itself is really well-designed. It\u2019s memorable that players can navigate without maps and there are tons of worthwhile secrets they can find. \n\nEvery time a new area is unlocked, you are basically blind as the game doesn't immediately provide the map. You have to find a map hidden in that area, or buy them from a merchant in the central area that Tilo will often visit. The game also doesn't give marker for quest objectives. it gives a general direction of the objectives, but if you get stuck you also can buy hints from the merchant who will put objective markers on your map.\n\n[b]Armor and Disguise System[/b]\n\nThe biggest reward in the game for exploration are the armor and clothing sets. Each armor set provides Tilo with stat bonuses that makes him tougher or less detectable. A complete set give special effects, like being undetectable or giving Tilo immunity to poisonous gas. This can open up previously inaccessible areas.\n\nThe disguise system is one of the biggest mechanics in the game. In the story, the player are given a guard\u2019s armor set. When you wear it, every turns guards into talkable NPCs. They can give quests, minigames or give hints instead of automatically being hostile.\n\nThe drawback of the armor is it is heavy and restricts your movement. Tilo can\u2019t run or jump with the armor on. Later, he can obtain upgrades to his guard\u2019s armor by completing quests until finally it gives him full options of mobility. Most of these quests are optional, but being able to jump or run in full armor set is worth it.\n\n[b]Quests[/b]\n\nMost of the quests are actually fetch quests, but due the hand-crafted level and item locations, most of them feel more like a puzzle or treasure hunt. they are usually placed in locations where it makes sense, that fetch quests feels like organic process of discovery. In my opinion it is fundamentally different than typical RPG fetch quests like \u201cbring 10 of certain random items\u201d and similar lazy design.\n\nThere are also quests with interesting storyline like exposing a smuggler organization or solving a murder. The rewards of quests are usually very useful items like armor sets and new skills Tilo can use in his adventure.\n\n[b] Progression[/b]\n\nThe progression is simple. When an objective is achieved, you get experience to level up. Each level up gives you increased stamina and HP, which allow you to run longer and survive longer. Obtaining skills however is separate mechanics as skills are rewards from NPC for completing their quest. In my opinion the levelling system is kinda redundant because of how shallow it is.\n\n[h1]Technical Issues and Performance[/h1]\n[u]Specs: Ryzen 3700x, GTX 1080, 16 GB RAM, 1440p 60Hz[/u]\n\nThe game mostly runs at full 60 FPS, but it would dip into mid 40's when there are big particle effects on the screen.\n\nThe biggest problem in the game is its lack of polish, especially in terrain detection and general enemy hitboxes. There are 2 areas where you are really prone to fall off the world. The game provides a brute-force solution that it detects if you are falling off the world, then a prompt appears if you want to teleport above. It sometimes works, however one time it just teleports me to a blank ground that it makes me fall over again.\n\nThe other issue is the enemy hitbox. Throwing is a big mechanic in the game. Tilo can throw various items to distract enemies or make them unconscious. In narrow hallways, it often happens that the items he throws don\u2019t hit the target even when the auto-lock is on.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nHaving been imprisoned and separated with his wife, Tilo must find a way out of prison and find information about his wife's whereabouts. As he makes his way out of the prison, he learns secrets and forgotten truth about the history of the world he lives in. In my opinion the story is pretty good, and there are good amount of interesting lore that ties directly to the plot. The characters have believable motivations and goals and their dialogues are generally well written. The only problem with the story is it ended in a cliffhanger with the main plot point goes unresolved. \n\n[h1]Graphics and Visuals[/h1]\nLionel Gallat, the mind behind the game is an animator worked on famous titles like [i]Despicable Me[/i]. His skills resulted in a radiant world that makes the locations look like sceneries. The characters are also well animated, from Tilo\u2019s tail waves as he runs, to the intricate details of the guard patrol routines. Visually, it is one of the best looking indie games I have ever played.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2106990258\n\n[h1]Music and Sound[/h1]\nThe sound effects are well designed. you can hear armors clinking, or ambient sounds in the various areas of the game. With headphones, you can hear guards slowly approaching and that information can be used to evade them. Soundtrack rarely plays, but when it plays it\u2019s usually powerful and sucks you into the mood they are trying to convey. Overall the game has an excellent sound design but none of the lines in the game are voice-acted. This can be a turn off for some people, but it\u2019s an understandable compromise for a team this size.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] is a flawed, yet still a highly charming and captivating game.

I would Kickstarter the s*** out of a sequel.\n\nPros:\n-An all-around lovable cast, partly because they're ridiculously adorable animals but they also have a surprising amount of depth as you get to know them.\n-The writing is genius. Everyone's personal stories tie together in such surprising and satisfying ways, and the broader universe they hint at has incredible potential for exploration.\n-Everything's just so pretty. I've never been this content to just dally through the forest picking sidequest mushrooms.\n-Satisfying stealth--I love having a good sneak, and this plays pretty intuitively. The lack of direct combat is a unique twist which forces you to keep creative, and a few quirky little mechanics like your disguises and songwriting keep it diverse.\n-The game handles collectables well, which isn't something I thought I'd ever care about. There are plenty of goodies scattered around the landscape to keep you exploring, but everything either has practical value or plot relevance--even mushroom picking never felt like grinding just for the sake of completion.\n\nCons:\n-Pretty poor signage for such an intricate world. Definitely wasted a lot of time poking through the fortress because I had no idea what a certain room was called until I was told to go there, or sprinting on needlessly circuitous paths through several environments because I knew exactly where I needed to be but couldn't remember which bloody cave led to which exit.\n-Enemy AI a bit predictable. Felt nicely balanced in the beginning, but as you start levelling up the giant fearsome rat guards become more of a mild inconvenience than a challenge. To be fair, the game's much more story-driven than brutal-skill-testing-driven, so it hardly ruins the experience.\n\nTips:\n -Get the Red Mist skill as soon as you have the chance to minimise the time you spend backtracking for missed collectables later!\n-Anything the Blacksmith has to say is well worth your money--don't be stingy.\n-Honestly just make your own map.", "timestamp_created": 1589697415, "timestamp_updated": 1589697415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69247708": {"recommendationid": "69247708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116934331", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1619567782}, "language": "english", "review": "if you played dark souls, you will know this game is not like dark souls, BUT if you've played dark souls you will know this game is LIKE dark souls.

There is so much to appreciate here: Great art, great sound, great lore.\n\nThis is a game of exploration. A little stealth, no combat. The size of the castle you explore feels daunting at first, but you'll quickly come to know every nook and cranny. And then you'll find shortcuts! And new areas open up, keeping the game from getting stale.\n\nAs you explore, you'll uncover a few dozen quests to accomplish. These require you to interact with a variety of characters in the castle as you steer around guards who are looking for you. Over time, a book-worthy story emerges. No spoilers here, but I will say this - don't let yourself get frustrated by any one quest. If you're struggling to complete a particular quest, that's probably intentional. There are always other things you can be working on. Completing quests opens new avenues of exploration. Just keep focusing on things you CAN do instead of things you CAN'T. Progress will happen.\n\nThis may be the best-looking game I've played on my computer. The entire world is hand-crafted. Though clever design, draw distances are always kept fairly short, so you can really enjoy the beauty of this game, at the highest settings.\n\nAnyway, enjoy. I notice that a number of friends added this to their Wish List while I was playing. I hope you play some day and enjoy it as much as I have.

The level design is top-notch, an interconnected-hub-world, things open up slowly as you acquire more keys and abilities.\nThe charm and beauty of this game is well praised, so I will just summarize - the game had a very talented animator working on it, and the characters are just charming. Rotating the camera around your character may immediately reveal that.\nI guess that without exploring everything it's about a 8 hour game, but my playthrough was 14, very interesting and enjoyable hours.\nThe story is great and works with the concept of a \"small adventure\" for a small mouse, in a Rat's world. This concept leads every little bit of the story and world to make up for a really whole and coherent game / experience. That being said, the tone which fits this concept does lead to many-many fetch quests, befitting a mouse trying to advance in this \"I scratch your back you'll scratch mine\" world. Most of them make sense for the story but I know some people would not like that. I have t say though, that I'm stingy with my time and I did not feel like it's wasted in this game even though I was fetch-questing a lot.\n\nA unique game, so charming and immersive. Well worth the time, well worth the money.\nHave to admire this small team for realizing their vision perfectly.

First off I definitely recommend this game. Out of all the things in this game in particular, the writing was[b][u]spectacular[/u][/b]!! Even though there wasn't much action in terms of a character fighting, I was completely engrossed into the plot, I felt for the characters. I grew attached to characters. You could for sure imagine the tones of voice when talking to them. The next best thing as well, the art. The environment was beautiful!! I'm an aspiring 3D artist and I absolutely love how they made the game in this style without making it cartoony. I think this style of art + the 2D sprites of the characters in conversation, really allowed for immersion in my opinion.\n\nMy main criticism is some of the game play mechanics were a bit difficult to navigate, and this might be what turn people off from a purchase. At first I felt the way you are forced to save (go into hiding or relying on beds to sleep/autosave with) was a bit constricting. But once I figured out key locations of barrels and chest it was really easy to navigate. However if you are anxious about saves, this may be a deal breaker because sometimes you have to go all the way across a map just to save which can get tedious.\n\nThe next, and probably the biggest, deal breaker for someone to purchase might just be the game play overall. For me, it was frustrating, but I got over it because everything else about the game was fantastic. But a lot of side quests (pretty much all of them in fact) were only able to be completed upon a certain point along the main quest line. This isn't evident when going through them at first, and I would have definitely liked to have more hints or clues that it was OK to put off side quests. Or some kind of hint that said without spoilers, you don't have access to this location yet or these things are found in this area. It consisted of me going and looking up guides for some things because I couldn't figure it out or was totally lost.\n\nDespite the downfalls of some of the mechanics, I will definitely play this game again!! It will definitely be easier on more play throughs because I know what to expect and where things are this time. I've seen a lot of people hate on the game for being difficult, when really it isn't so much difficult, more just complex in what you can do and when.

Todas las misiones principales tienen el esquema siguiente: llega a la costa (perfecto, f\u00e1cil), primera puerta cerrada, encuentra la llave, para conseguir la llave llega a la catacumbas, para llegar a las catacumbas necesitas convencer al guardia, que te dar\u00e1 una pista para resolver el puzle que te permitir\u00e1 entrar, ....

The story is amazing and even the side quests are really fun! I like that you (kind of) have a choice on how easy you want to make the game, because of the rat armour. The armour makes you slow, but makes the game easier. But if you want to challenge yourself a bit, you can choose not to wear it that much. \nOne little downside of the game was, that I needed to look up quite a lot on the internet to finish some quests. It was easy to find it though, cuz quite some people made playthroughs and stuff.\n\nOverall, I really liked this game, and it has definiteley become one of my favourite games I have ever played.

I thought it was a dark souls clone at first, but then I realized it's not the case.\n\n[h3][i]Pros:[/i][/h3]\n- It is a stealth focused game, so you have to sneak your way into areas to avoid the guards until a certain point\n- The mice in this game are so freaking cute with their puppy eyes and all :D\n- The graphics look absolutely stunning, the way the grass and plants behave in this world is just incredible\n- The OST is beautiful\n- The animation in this game from guards patrolling the courtyard to you being idle and playing with your tail is so fluid and amazing to look at.\n- The story is very well done with plot twists that I did not expect\n- Lovely side characters, some of them are just hilarious\n- The sound design is amazing, from swaying trees in the wind to birds chirping in the morning\n- This game has a freaking day and night cycle\n- Multiple costumes to wear and they have an effect on how you play the game\n\n[h3][i]Cons:[/i][/h3]\n- The maps are basic and do not really help you, would have been better if notes can be written in them, silent hill-style (since a lot of quills are pretty much everywhere)\n- A few bugs and glitches here and there\n- The stamina regeneration in this game is super slow, I am a mouse dammit I should not worry about stamina\n\n[h3][i]Notes[/i][/h3]\n- Don't let that cuteness fool you, this game is hard; it doesn't hold your hand and pinpoint you the exact location of your objective in your map, you have to depend on clues and directions from what other characters in the game say and books/notes/charts. I had to use guides to help me finish some of the quests in the game.\n- The game ends with a cliffhanger, a sequel is definitely coming.\n- Since this is a stealth focused game you can't use a sword or fight. you throw empty bottles and sticks most of the time so you can progress or distract a guard or enemy\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nThis game took me 14 hours to complete and I loved every minute of it, it is a really good indie game and worth the asking price\n\n[h1]Verdict: 9/10[/h1]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/9204133/][quote]If you're looking for more quality reviews like this then check out my curator page.[/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1586035870, "timestamp_updated": 1591228874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735931992530822754", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66521459": {"recommendationid": "66521459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085598826", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1244, "last_played": 1585937861}, "language": "english", "review": "What a goddamn masterpiece.

I'm not a pro reviewer but i felt this game deserves to get some spotlight so ill explain some pros and cons.\nfirst off as i said this game is very pretty, but the detail comes at a cost of size, the game is quite packed and that's something i was not aware of when purchasing this but nevertheless I soon realized the small size is in fact a boon not bust. Most games think Bigger=Better but often make it barren and lifeless. so I've learned to appreciate the little things, like our protagonist Tilo. Tilo is and amazing protagonist, he fills as the vessel for the player to experience the world through, and as a compelling mouse with a interesting backstory. I very much rooted for him by the end and was exited to see his story conclude, which brings me to an unfortunate con... This game sorta ended in a cliffhanger. though in a way it felt satisfying, but it left me worried that that might the last we see of Tilo. I often check if they made any \"official\"  announcements that a sequel is in the works but, when its such a small team. I can only conclude that unless they hire more people it will be a long while before we get it, if at all. Overall if you like rich writing and great art this is good game to pick up even at full price, for me it was worth every penny .", "timestamp_created": 1582337516, "timestamp_updated": 1582337516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63769010": {"recommendationid": "63769010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087964769", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2088, "last_played": 1682953700}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the cutest game I have ever played. \nThis really does remind me of the old Disney movie\n\nThe Secret Of Nim\n\nIt is literally like being in that world but in a game.

I'm pleased to say that it was well worth the time - an engaging single-player stealth-focused adventure, and I'll be eager to replay to find some of the quests and secrets I missed.  \n\nThe game's atmosphere is excellent, fostering tension and feelings of oppression at every turn.  Most enemies are armored guards three times protagonist Tilo's size, and the heavy breathing and clunking footsteps are truly intimidating, helping to immerse the player in the daunting plight of the tiny mouse.  Combat options are minimal, leaving stealth and wit as the only means to survive.  The sense of danger is always tangible, whether in choosing the right moments to bolt past guards or trying to talk your way out of a sudden questioning; you are helpless against your foes, and you must tread lightly.  The risk is necessary, however, as Tilo fights not only to save himself, but to discover the whereabouts of his missing wife, lending a great sense of motivation while retaining the fear of being swallowed in the shady goings-on about the prison.  \n\nAlong your way, you meet a variety of colorful characters, each with distinct personalities and backstories which tie into the rich lore of the world.  The writing is excellent, evoking humor and sadness equally well, granting each new acquaintance their own depth.  Backstory elements and world-building are presented in lore entries, and though many are directly related to the plot, many are solely presented for flavor, adding to the immersiveness of the story.  The environments are beautifully crafted, with organic textures and colors and gorgeous lighting, and the maps are large enough to allow a sense of scope and variety without tiring the player too much with walking.  Each region and even many characters receive their own distinct musical themes, and your character being a minstrel, you can play various folk songs and ballads which tell stories of their own.  The character models look fantastic, lifelike in their detail and movements, but with a hint of whimsy that sells the fantasy setting perfectly.  \n\nRegarding mechanics, the game was pleasant, with smooth control, minimal fuss with camera angling and platforming, and most importantly, a consistent stealth system which strikes a good balance between forgiving and intimidating.  Occasionally, the character would become a bit wedged between objects, but I could always wiggle out just by fiddling with WASD - no need to reload a save.  Puzzles and hidden items were intriguing and generally fair, with perhaps only two or three instances that perhaps needed some adjustment.  The player can learn new skills by completing specific quests, but every quest completed helps to advance the player's level, increasing health and stamina.  \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game; it's an engrossing and exciting adventure in a fascinating world with delightful characters and admirable attention to detail.

The stealth aspects of the game are relatively forgiving but very effective and the enemies can at times feel absolutely terrifying. The game also has a great sense of humor and a lot of attention to little details, as well as many optional unlockables, including costume sets. I can wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially in 2020, the [b]Year of the Rat[/b].[/spoiler][/quote]\n\n[quote][h1]\u2755 Informational \u2755[/h1]\n[i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] has been developed and published by [i]SeithCG[/i], a French one-man studio with a focus on providing industry standard animation tools helmed by game designer and [b]DreamWorks[/b] and [b]Universal Pictures[/b] veteran Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat.[/quote]\n\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfae Gameplay[/h1]\nMuch like in any [i]The Elder Scrolls[/i] game, you start your adventure as a prisoner, so your first task is to escape your cell and subsequently the whole prison. There are quite a few pickups littered around your cell tutorializing effectively how to interact with the world and how to use your inventory. The game manages in general to very effectively tutorialize most of its systems within the first few minutes without excessively holding your hand which is very much appreciated.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989671120\nThe core aspects of gameplay are exploration, minor puzzle solving, dialogue and of course stealth but there are some side activities that mix up the formula effectively.\n\nWhat really surprised me is that the game even features dynamic day/night cycles, when the game could've easily gotten away with scripted transitions or none at all.\n\nAnother great thing is that you can actually see items that can be stolen on the enemies, meaning you have a realistic way of telling which guard might have the key you're looking for. Little details like that elevate the game in my eyes.\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udd25 Difficulty[/h1]\nFor a game with part of its focus on Stealth Mechanics, evading the enemies is fairly easy most of the time, once you learned how to handle them, and even if you do get spotted the game is pretty forgiving in letting you escape. The main difficulty here comes from spotting the gaps in the guards' patrol paths, especially when more than one is present. At some point in the story the sneaking effectively becomes an absolute non-issue, though.\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcd6 Story / Presentation[/h1]\n[i]Ghost of a Tale[/i], on a surface level, tells a story about the mouse minstrel [i]Tilo[/i], who is trying to escape a terrible prison and find and free his wife [i]Merra[/i]. However, if you pay attention to character interactions, footnotes and the bits and pieces of lore, as well as the more subtle aspects of the game, it becomes apparent that the game also tells a story about oppression and prejudice - in more ways than you'd suspect.\n\n[i]SeithCG[/i] succeeds in crafting a compelling story and believable characters each with their own flaws, strengths and motivations. It also manages to create drama but it knows how to effectively use humor.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989681234\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcbb Graphics / Art-style[/h1]\nThe game features anthropomorphic animals in an otherwise realistic world. You can easily see [i]SeithCG's[/i] expertise as I've rarely seen a game more realistically [b]adorable~\u2665[/b] than this. The game perfectly pulls off soft fur, shiny little eyes, pointy noses and curious round ears, as well as it does slippery stone, warm candlelight and cold, pitch-black shadows. Even more so it shows off the developer's skills when it comes to the animations, which all look very fluid and realistic but also extremely befitting of mice, rats, frogs and other animals. It may need some polish here or there, as climbing ladders for example would look even better if the little hands and feet actually attached to the rungs and guards would be more convincing if they didn't just repeat the same animation three times before moving on, but overall it's pretty amazing.\n\nAnother thing I very much appreciate is the [b]Photo Mode[/b], although it can be exploited to scout ahead. Perhaps the developer should've limited that function in some way.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1989664531\n\n\n[h1]\ud83c\udfbc Soundtrack / Sound[/h1]\nThe game offers both a beautiful soundtrack and a lack thereof, as it doesn't shy away from supporting its atmosphere with absolute silence at times, leaving you in a dank, cold, dark and dirty dungeon with just the sound of bare mouse feet on the hard, cold floor. Only very few games dare to leave the music off where it fits and it works extremely well here to make you feel isolated and lost. The sound design in general is amazingly believable in [i]Ghost of a Tale[/i], with the Rat Guards sounding especially menacing, giving the game just a hint of a horror game.\n\nAdditionally, you can occasionally sing one of the songs in your ever-growing book of songs and, while [i]Tilo[/i] isn't voiced, the melody that accompanies the lines on screen, makes it easy enough to hear the song being sung in your head. It's quite neatly done and I have no idea how they pulled it off that well.\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 Target audience[/h1]\nBoth friends of [b]Stealth games[/b] [i](Outlast, Thief, etc.)[/i] and epic [b]Action-RPGs[/b] [i](Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Oblivion, etc.)[/i] can sink some time into this gorgeous game. Of course, being a mouse aficionado also helps and friends of [b]An American Tale[/b] have something to look forward to in this game, too.\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udcb0 Business Model[/h1]\n[quote][u]Classic:[/u]\nBuy the game, play the game.\nNo paid DLCs, items, lootboxes.[/quote]\n\n\n[h1]\ud83d\udccb Conclusion[/h1]\nYou'd never guess that the developer behind [i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] wasn't a veteran in the business and the level of polish, wit and subtlety on display make this an easy recommendation. Couple all that with the gorgeous art-style, the more than decent graphics and the stellar animations and you've got yourself a winner. [i]Ghost of a Tale[/i] is one of the better games I've played in recent years and I can't wait to see more from [i]SeithCG[/i] - perhaps even a sequel and/or prequel to this beautiful piece.\n\n[quote]At the time of writing this, I haven't fully completed the game yet but I feel confident to judge what I've seen so far.

The game takes place in a medieval world populated only by animals, and puts an emphasis on immersion and exploration. It features stealth elements, disguises, conversations with allies and enemies, and quests. \nHeavy based on Stealth, so be cautious out there when avoiding those Rats while exploring the secrets of Dwindling Heights and navigate its dangers. \n\n[u]Includes[/u]\nHiding Locations are pretty much everywhere, you just need to be smart on how you move around. Side Quests + Main Story. Your Inventory contains the following > Tools: which you will unlock more of while progressing on quests and finding items. Clothes: (Cosmetic collectibles) required to be used in many parts of the game. Food: Overall easy to stack up on Food and will never leave you hungry considering on how much Food there are troughout the various locations. Books: Maps, Sigils, Emblems and Scrolls that shows Lore and Quest information. Misc: This is where all of your grabbed items and many Quest stuff will go into. There are much of it, so make sure you keep up with it. Keys: This is very important. Make sure you are not missing places because you can't risk to loose any of them. They are needed in order to progress with your quests. \n\nI don't feel like there's a need on explaining what's going on in this game. You're better off watching Guides, Walktroughs and Playtroughs on different Platforms to get a clearer picture and of course which can get you help if you ever get stuck on something.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n* Overall straight forward and easy game to play. Worth buying for full price considering the amount of time it offers + if you ever want to go for those hard achievements, you can replay the game. \n* Fantastic Movement and Jumping system. It actually feels like you're playing as a Mouse with the smooth Camera and visual game style. \n* Tilos is a adorable Mouse, well designed and interesting character. \n* You can tell that the developers have put a lot of effort and time into details, graphic improvements and visual style.\n* Perfect amount of interactable items, including Save Spots. \n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n* Excessive amount of Florins (coins) I wish they'd reduce the amount and make it more challenging to obtain.\n* Sometimes when running from a Rat and suposed to jump up on something it can be 'delayed' or just slow. \n* Almost too easy when you're going to Hide once spotted from one of the Guards. \n* Short Main Story and I wish they added more Side Quests. \n* Not much Action at all, apart from the endgame, which is pretty cool. There's no fight system, even though I wish there was more than just dazing the guards with Bottles etc.\n\nGhost of a Tale will leave you with sympathic feelings towards endgame. We're living in a big World, especially when it comes to Tilo. Make sure you take your time to enjoy this game and don't miss out exploring and discovering various locations, items etc. I feel like this is a underrated game and a hidden gem. Maybe there will never be a popular era where games like these take over because I absolutely love them and wish they would create more wonders like this!\nI hope they will release a Sequel to this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1580942101, "timestamp_updated": 1580944050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476570278406143188", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "63002836": {"recommendationid": "63002836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041528422", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1581676078}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun game.\nThe characters, the art style and the story are brilliant. there clearly more to this world that could lead to more games.

Easy and fun? Think again mate!

With some heavy lags, bugs and soft locks.\n\nTraditionally, let's analyze step-by-step.\nThis game starts not on a high note with some flashy cutscene, but with some standard nonsensical story of a magical plague that united the world against itself. Yup, like in Dark Souls or Dragon Age: Inquisition or some other story you could know. And like Dark Souls this game doesn't take your hand and walk you through its corridors but leaves you stranded in a jail cell. This one at least gives you a key to your cell door. Everything else you have got to get by yourself.\nDo you want to know where the hell you are right now? Find a map. No, you don't get to know there it is. What is it? You want to pick a fight with a big scary rat guard and win? Pfft! This is a stealth game sonny, you don't know how to attack! Also, you are a bard.\nAnd from here you begin to understand how AWESOME this game is. After you claw your way through the starting location you are greeted with one quality social sim. In breathtaking locations, with deep lore and interesting characters. With the story of noble scoundrels and pirate treasure, with a pinch of detective.

The scope of the game is smart and the writing keeps things interesting as you delve deeper into this particular universe. They show a poise that it is rarely seen in backed games, I know they have had technical issues since the game launched but the build I have played is solid, I have not found any problems during my time with the game.\n\nThe game begins with Tilo, a mouse, who has been jailed along with many others (including his wife) for unclear reasons. At first it seems like all it is going to take is escape but things are more complicated. The story starts to unfold and you will see that you are in front of a rich, detailed world where every character has a heart, even the imposing guards. The game is a clever mixture of stealth, exploration and rpg elements. The dialogues offer some witty interactions where choice matters (most of the time).\n\nI have only a couple of complaints. Firstly, the game should explain better from the start the importance of costumes, it is a bit frustrating trying to sneak by some guards because they don't move or they have very keen vision until you realise later that you were supposed to use a specific costume to overcame the obstacle. Secondly, this is a minor issue as well but keys in general should be more shiny, it can take some time until you realise there is a key hanging in the room you are in, or it is in the belt of a guard.\n\nI hope this is the first step in a series of games about this world, the story of Tilo and his friends shows so much promise, it is one of those games that leave wanting for more.

Looks amazing. Truly a great example of what the Unreal engine is capable of. Well written story and characters. Some small improvements needed. Definitely recommend, even at full price. Talent like this has to be rewarded.\n\nLong and detailed:\nThe story is interesting and managed to keep me engaged for the entire game with some good twists along the way. There is no voice acting, but the conversation card are a good replacement. Especially the addition of the characters expressions at the corner makes it a great read. There are several story lines that come together at several points which is interesting. Deep and well fleshed out characters with several layers to dig through. No of them felt dull or uninspired, which helped make up for the small amount of characters(6). \n\nGameplay is also really good. Of course not AAA game level, yet it never felt lacking. The idea of costumes to collect and use for different situations is novel. A neat little detail is the remarks the guards make when you are wearing your ranger costume. The skill and outfit progressions is packed neatly into the story. The detection system of the guards works adequate, although they could sometimes be mistake for teachers, because they have eyes on their back.\nThere are no quest markers, routes on maps of how to walk or explanations of where to find items. I like that, most quests are fetch quests or equivalent. Combined with the small size of the map, and great scenery it makes that the quests aren't boring or repetitive. \n\nAnd lastly some point of improvement.\n\nThe games sometimes rewards you or even requires you to jump and climb on and over things, but a lot of times it doesn't. Making you feel a bit disappointed you spent so much time trying to get up that ledge. A small Easter eggs or some florins would help overcome that feeling.\n\nThe quests do not log every bit of information given to you. And it is really hard to remember what the smith said to you about something three game sessions ago. If there was just a summary of all the information you are given during a quest, it will make a quick refresh.\n\nThe place is a complete maze. Even with the maps it is hard to find your way around the many tunnels. I spent many hours going in circles trying to get from one place to another. Here is what I think would help improve things. Once someone found the entrance to a new area for the first time, make it show on the map as such. Just a small arrow with the text \"to harbour\", \"catacombs\" or \"shore\" would have saved me so much time.\n\nI like how stamina is related to health. I do not like the fact that it does not regenerate while walking. There is a fair bit of distance to cover and no fast travel(if you exclude the guards throwing the ranger into jail). Meaning that it sometimes takes a long time to get somewhere, especially combined with the point mentioned above. If you make stamina regenerate while walking that would make getting around a lot better.\n\nIt is really original how the player can only save when the character is also in a save location(hidden somewhere). It is however a nightmare when you have to stop the gaming session now because real life is calling. Some area's have plenty of empty cupboards to hide in, others have maybe two barrels. With the maze it is to get around sometimes and stamina not regenerating while walking, it can take a good 5 to 10 minutes before I finally found a place to save. And then it becomes dark, and your lantern runs out, and so do your candles and you are just wandering around aimlessly desperately trying to find that one ****** barrel. Just marking one or two save spots on the map per area will help so much to avoid this problem. Again, I like not being able to save everywhere, but I do like to save within a minute.\n\nThe music is great. When you enter Fartower or Northern slopes at sun rise, the sun rays shining through the trees and the music swells, amazing. Chills down my spine everytime. Everytime it plays though, which is about 50% of the time. Most time there isn't any music at all. Making the wandering around aimlessly really boring.\n\nAnd lastly, small point I know but one that kept bothering me. Some of the noises the smith makes while striking the anvil are just to fake. It rings like a broken bell, but in an artificial way. And then it sounds like he hit a aluminium can. Just a dull thud is sufficient and much more accurate.\n\nHowever, all of the above didn't stop me enjoying the game a ton and finishing it 100%(I think.) Really great game, would definitively recommend, even at full price.

Still, it was worth it and I enjoyed my time with the game. It reminds me of a mix of The Thief Games, Skyrim and Dark Souls. At its core, the game is a stealth one - at least at first. Eventually there are methods of hiding in plain sight with disguises. I usually am not very good at stealth but it all worked out fine for how it works with this game, it's rather forgiving and if you blow your cover, can probably just run for it. There is no direct combat against the rats, but there are methods to stun them or distract them.\n\nThe game is also somewhat like a small scale Skyrim since it has loads of quests, many which intertwine together. If the story/world progresses too far, may lock self out of quests, so best to take the game slow, tackle as many side quests as possible before moving on in the story. Then when side quests seem stuck, probably need to progress the main questline.\n\nDark Souls feel comes from the presentation and the world mechanics. There are tons of passages and shortcuts to the point that there is multiple ways to get to each area. However, the design for some reason isn't always memorable and I still had a hard time remembering how to get to some places even at the end game. There is no fast travel. But the world is small so it's not that big of a deal. The game is also very hands-off and doesn't explain much on how to do things and doesn't spell things out. This can sometimes get frustrating, but it does help add to the mystery and adventure feel.\n\nI've heard reports of glitches although I didn't encounter any game breaking ones. Saving is easy so as long as keep multiple save slots, will be alright. The sort of bugs I did run into were fixed from reloading easy enough. The game seems a little claustrophobic at first - after all you start in a prison. But once the game opens up with more areas and the ability to roam around in disguises instead of having to sneak past everything, the game improved significantly and transformed from an alright game to one I really loved.\n\nOverall, really liked the game. While a little buggy, it was very charming and enjoyable enough to look past its flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1573459286, "timestamp_updated": 1573459286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812672138214111328", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56947315": {"recommendationid": "56947315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025072099", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 2535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2535, "last_played": 1573405610}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a wonderful game, with a few caveats.\n\nGood things:\n- Visuals are gorgeous, with mostly-compact, detailed environments (in contrast to nowhere-lands of many games).\n- Audio is very fell fit, I don't think there was a single sound that'd get repetitive by the time I completed the game. Music is also great, though used sparingly (perhaps for same reason) - when nothing important is happening, you are mostly in company of footsteps and various environmental ambience.\n- Writing is wonderful, with plenty of little jokes, lore side notes, and a couple impressive plot twists.\n- Average length (~10h to complete), longer than that if going for quest completion or getting lost (more on that in a bit)\n\nNot-so-good things:\n- The game has this tendency of giving you quests that you can't complete until you progress more in the main quest line, so you might just spend good 20 minutes wandering around an area before you look up hints and find that the last item is going to be given out to you as an aside on another quest.\n- Some quests are kind of just \"wander around this area until you find all the items\" [some of which might be out of plain sight]. Combined with above, the game left me lightly upset at the situation a few times.\n- The ending is slightly abrupt/cliffhanger-y, although was managed much better than in other games I've seen - a good job at summing up and giving you a farewell. Still, I would have preferred full-er closure of the story, as it rendered a few of the quests/lore notes/items ultimately meaningless.\n- Lack of conversation log for hints/important notes resulted in me doing 3 playthroughs total (~20%, ~70%, 100%), as I'd get back to the game after a few weeks and have no clue as to where I was supposed to look next / whether I missed something very important (ties to aforementioned #1/#2).\n\nAll in all, it is a worthwhile game to play, though I would recommend either not being too completionist around quests or looking up discussions about progression as soon as you start suspecting that something might not be doable at the time.", "timestamp_created": 1573415476, "timestamp_updated": 1573415476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741302430629730225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "56930921": {"recommendationid": "56930921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340680213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1573359624}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately, I had to get a refund for this game.

Make sure you take your time to explore details.\n\nPro's: Ghost of a Tale sports a really unique idea - a bard or minstrel that uses disguises, wit and charisma to work his way through problems. A lot of the quests help tie the story together, really encouraging you to explore the universe. I especially enjoyed learning about Gusto and Fatale, a witty thief duo that encourage you to look beyond the surface of each story.\n\nAlthough the game doesn't have the best of graphics, they aren't all that bad. The backgrounds are especially made well. I found myself staring out to the horizon on a couple of occasions. There weren't a whole lot of places to look out to, but where they were, it was great to see. I even found that you could travel to a couple of what I thought to be backgrounds.\n\nCombat is very limited, which helps you to think your moves through a little more, rather than just trying to run through crowds of guards. You also have a limited number of supplies for the most part. You can only use bottles and slime to knock out the guards a certain number of times, and some of them are armored to prevent them from being able to be knocked out at all. Other necessary supplies, like candles and sticks are unlimited, but still a little challenging to come across. \n\nThe controls felt pretty natural (I played on a wired switch controller) and not too confusing to pick up on. The game doesn't hold your hand, and the tutorial essentially tells you that you can hide, throw objects and sneak. It leaves things like climbing up edges, jumping, stealing, and inventory exploration out of the picture, which I would normally find as a problem, but they aren't too hard to figure out and it probably would have felt like you were a child being lectured if they had decided to write all that out.\n\nThe story line compels you on with a heart warming story about a courageous husband going to the ends of the earth to find his wife. I started to feel a little of the anxiety and despair that Tilo must be going through as the story went on. Of course, I'll leave you to find the details.\n\n\nCons: The world is very small - Tiny. There are more areas that open up as the story goes on, but they don't come quickly enough to make it a good thing. I got that feeling of relief when a new area finally opened up, but the feeling is quickly drown out as you realize that it isn't that big of an area to open. The only time I really felt like I got a new area was when the Shore and the Harbor opened up, but even then, there isn't much to see there. It's just that. Big, long to walk through, kind of feels railroaded through that area. Also, the quests will have you walking back and forth across the map. It would have been nice if they could have clumped some of the objectives together, but a lot of the time you will have to travel to the other end of the map to make any progress. I started to get that bored feeling you get, like when you've searched your fridge for the 5th time and you know there isn't anything you want to eat in there.\n\nSome of the quests are just busy work. You don't gain a lot from them either, so I didn't feel like they were really all that important. The Skapp beetle quest was especially bad. It has you search every corner of the keep, just so Sillias can say \"Good Boy.\" I'm not even kidding, that's exactly what he says. It's worth no more experience than any of the other quests, and there is no physical reward for it.\n\nDespite featuring 5 costumes and a few other cosmetics, there isn't a lasting purpose to a lot of them. You use the Thief, Pirate and King costume once through the whole game. The Thief costume can come in handy as it muffles your movement, but that is completely negated by the fact that you can literally walk past any guard by wearing the knight uniform, which slows you down to the pace of a snail. Even though you move so slowly, it's still faster to use this thing than it is to try and sneak past everyone because of the patrol patterns. You are going to be sitting, waiting for an opening far longer than you would if you just put the armor on and walked past them. They let you upgrade the armor 3 times, increasing your speed in it, but you still move very. very. slow. It felt like they were just trying to drag out the completion time.\n\nBy far the worst offender here was the ending though. You work through the story to the climax, where you row off to find your wife. There is no positive affirmation that you make it through the perilous waters, no final scene in which you finally get to see your wife, no confirmation that she actually survived on the god forsaken island she was thrown to, and no confirmation that you made it back alive. I sat through 20 minutes of credits, expecting some sort of Marvel like ending, where they show the clip afterwards, to no avail (you can totally skip the credits if you don't want to see 1093 backers usernames). In fact, the only picture you ever get to see of the family is in the credits as it scrolls up the screen for 3 seconds, and it is a picture of before any of this happened.\n\n\nConclusion: Again, this is a great game, I just had those couple of gripes about it. I don't feel like any of it was unwarranted either; they had a very limited budget to work with, and they did the best that they could with the world that they could create. I mostly voice my complaints because I don't want to see some of this again in a sequel, not because I felt it made it into a horrible game.\n\nI would strongly encourage a purchase, but wait for it to go on sale. I don't feel like it was quite worth $30, more like $20-$25.", "timestamp_created": 1570519377, "timestamp_updated": 1570519377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531646788120269775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55465327": {"recommendationid": "55465327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216439075", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 970, "last_played": 1684757956}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

Charming, and at times witty, I was taken aback as I dug deeper into the lore, explore the well built world, picking mushrooms, doing odd jobs, and appreciating the fine artistic choices of conveniently well placed stools where a hidden item is out of reach.\n\nThe characters of this game is well thought out, with motivations clearly mentioned and if one goes through reading all the various books, footnotes, and dialogue, the world seems real. There is no black and white Saturday cartoon villains in this game. No gender stereotypes, every character seems to be, like real life, living within the lines of their own motivations.\n\nThe world is built to be explored, and almost every decal seems to be there for a reason. The shortcuts are made not to reduce your travel time, but seems to be there because of the characters in the game. You're just hitchhiking on a world that existed before you and functions well without you. Its not big, and with the many side quests, you'll be moving along this small bubble quite a lot but it never felt tedious. More than a few times I find myself moving around the keep, remembering intricate landmarks of where's where, not unlike exploring a newly bought double storey.\n\nArtwork's splendid. The game is an impressive 3D spectacle considering how small the dev team is wtih an equally tiny budget. A small yet massive world was built on a tiny island that is far worthier of your time than a lot of AAA games nowadays.\n\nThere's more than a little criticism lingering.\n\nThere is no requirement to stealth despite this being a core mechanic; you can out run your enemies and since the AI clearly can't outwit a stick you can arrange a congo line of all your favorite halberd wielding rats all around the courtyard and hiding in a bucket in PLAIN SIGHT will baffle this well-trained army as they head back to their patrol route as though nothing happened. Spiders that can be kited and seemed more of an annoyance than a genuine threat. In fact, the stationary traps offers more of a threat than any enemy this game offers.\n\nBugs, yes, plenty, but mostly not game breaking. Many of the dialogue can be skipped by simply clicking the very obvious to progress the story, and hell, some of them don't even contribute to the lore. Kinda felt like it was there as filler . Plenty of items that have little to no use, food collected then forgotten, upgrades that you can easily do without, costumes that plays a role in the lore but in all honestly about only 3 from the available 7 is really required to progress the game.\n\nOverall, despite my criticism, I still finished the game having a good opinion of it. So why is my thumb staring straight down? Its not so much the game as much as my disappointment over how the story, or more specifically, the final moments of the game, has been handled. Let's be clear: if you do nothing but the main quest and avoiding the many, many side quests this games throws at you, all you'll get is an hour long of a pretentious sisyphean chase with no closure. In fact, I only manage to trigger the last part of the game through trial and error since the clues provided amounted to giving you a map, pointing vaguely and telling you somewhere around there's buried treasure and to progress you're gonna have to find it. The ending is atrocious; I reloaded my save and relived the embarassingly bad final quest because I was absolutely convinced that the game bugged out when the credit sequence appeared way, way, way too early. There's more than enough material in the game to double if not triple the actual length of the game. The tale of a commoner searching for his wife in midst of a chaotic world. A rat civilization, an Arthurian inspired story of a prince raised by commoners who eventually proves worthy of the throne. An impressive political struggle between mice and rats, rebellion, and war. An ancient evil defeated in the past but risen again in search of revenge. Tons written about other parts of the world. Yet none of the above made it to the end, grasping only the edges of what could have been. The game literally pulled a Monty Python and the Holy grail ending, dragging all the lore into the shed and pulling the trigger with tears in its eyes.\n\nI wanted this game to succeed and would easily fund any sequel the dev might be planning but the sad excuse of an ending was not able to overturn my unimpressed frown when I 'finished' the game. So, here's a few of choice words to the dev team, if any of them are reading;\n\n- Do not built a world you are not prepared to see through to the end. And like, for ****sake don't waste my day reading through your impressively written lore if you're not gonna make it count. Putting a boat in near shore, telling me to use it to get to an island, but then not really letting me use it and the island doesn't exist. That's how this game felt at the end. Sequel baiting.\n\n- Consider animating some parts of the dialogue. Or show us more impressive artwork of the scene. Anything would be better than a text dump.\n\n- The title of this game. Well, there's a ghost, there's a tale, and there's a pun made of it in game. But you gotta be taking quite a lot of p*** to say any part of the game has anything to do with the title.", "timestamp_created": 1566679294, "timestamp_updated": 1566711224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688585579395294189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54774660": {"recommendationid": "54774660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079595970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1331, "last_played": 1537736157}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb game.

Going around the places is fun, especially controlling a relatively small animal, everything becomes ridiculously big. The little mouse gets to climb on chairs and tables and sit in a blanket as an elevator, I keep thinking it would be better if without all the big scary guard mice around. Exploration is fun, not fun when I am stopped by a locked door or chased by a guard that knows wherever I turned and would chase me to the end of the world unless I find a chest and hide inside - then the guard shows up at the door, leaving after a few seconds.\n\nThe control gives a bit of a floating feeling, most of the time I do not get into trouble - I can get past them without a hit or just one hit. All I need is to stay calm, several times I panicked and jumped off the stairs, leading to an instant death (fall damage). A highlight is the clothes change - nothing like the disguise in Hitman games, but those clothes give you different boosts like more armor, quieter noise... and they look stunning on the little fellow. I have a long list of side missions, without a waypoint I am totally lost. I was able to explore most of the prison and courtyard area, collecting almost all the red roses, before giving up and knowing this is not a game for people with bad direction recognitions like me.\n\nfor 2 hours I enjoyed exploring, now stopped at the courtyard.

Enough is provided to understand the story, and the rest can be found across the map and read on your own time (However, I suggest playing all the lute tunes and reading the lyrics)\n+Besides the main questline, there are multiple side quests that branch out the lore of the world and provide some extra bonuses to help you through the main story\n+Beautiful environment and serene creatures in a dynamic world where time passes as you go about the game. Some stuff is only there at night, sometimes only during the day, some quests require timing even\n+The soundtrack has an intrepid feel to it while also remaining subtle and peaceful; some nice lute and small string pieces\n+The entire world seems small at first but slowly grows into a bigger and bigger map that is continuous and requires no loading screens to past between each region\n+Saving requires you to hide completely out of sight, and although save slots are everywhere there are a few times when it becomes difficult to adequately save without issue\n+Plenty of collectibles to find that provide lore, health, navigation, quest progression, restricted access or a nice little nose plug to complete your costume... no seriously there's a nose plug costume piece\n\n[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]\n=Stealth works fine in most aspects, but it can easily be bypassed by having some of the higher-end gear and simply sprinting past guards right in front of their eyes. I discovered this late game and although it's very useful for getting around, it completely disregards the core stealth mechanic\n=Sometimes items are hardly visible to you resulting in essentially pixel perfect placement of Tilo and sometimes items are right there in your face and you can't pick it up until you line it up perfectly. I've never had a problem with being unable to acquire something on the ground however\n=When saving, you have to scroll down on the save menu as the save slots don't appear initially when you hit F8\n=So many keys going to so many different doors. It's fairly hard to keep track of them but it's usually not hard to find the one you need to further the plot line in the moment\n\n[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]\n-Camera angle is abysmal when moving around in tighter spaces. It revolves on its own and bounces around aimlessly as you try to navigate the underground parts of the game. Also freaks out when you leave dialogue scenes\n-Quite a few parkour and platforming bugs where you can climb steep walls or have the inability to climb a simple step. Happens a lot in the latter regions of the game\n\n[h1]The Noteworthy Stuff[/h1]\n*Pay attention to the loading screens when you log into the game, they're quite useful\n*Plenty of guides online and in the Steam forums in case you get stuck\n\n[h1]The Truthful Hard Facts[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr][td]Acquirement Method[/td][th]Steam Store[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Price Paid[/td][th]Gifted from a Friend[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Rig Used[/td][th][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable/discussions/0/1473095331487872526/]Main Computer[/url][/th][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Check out my Steam group for more Reviews![/h1]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable]STEAM REVIEWS GROUP![/url]\n\n[h1]My YouTube Channel![/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BQSDGExl23rHcd9ML2mRw", "timestamp_created": 1557713492, "timestamp_updated": 1557713499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56886899471282959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50583321": {"recommendationid": "50583321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259864419", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1905, "last_played": 1557512427}, "language": "english", "review": "Rarely has a game that frustrated me so much in the beginning ended up being one of my favorites but this one broke the mold.

The pros and cons in short:\n\nPros:\n- Masterfully crafted story and character\n- Beautiful graphics and amazing atmosphere\n- Map design\n\nCons:\n- Technical issues\n- Bugs. Even game breaking ones.\n- Some of the design decisions (see below)\n\nThe longer version (with minor spoilers):\nThe game's strongest point is it's story and characters. I got immersed into the world and setting from the moment I clicked on the new game. The quality of dialog is something that should be standard for certain games that advertises themselves as story drives experience, yet they are no where near as good as Ghost of a Tale. Despite the game takes place on a single island, the way the game presents it's world totally achieves the goal: it made me feel there is a bigger world outside of this island I was given to explore and I would very much want to see those places that the story only mentions. Also, give a cookie to the developer who came up with an idea of footnotes in the dialog window, more games with unique world should do that (looking at you, Pillars of Eternity).\n\nThe visuals look absolutely stellar, even if I needed to turn a few things off, like the depth of field and the motion blur to fully enjoy the environment and the work that went into it - altho, the visuals weren't perfect a few reasons I'll mention in the negatives. The character design and the enviroment design was one of the best I saw in any game, it absolutely sold me the experience that the game aimed for.\n\nI also cheer for the map design, it's really well thought out. All the shortcuts, corridors and secrets are well-placed and executed and if you willing to pay attention of where you going, you can learn how to get from point A to point B pretty quickly and efficiently.\n\nNow let's get over on the biggest negatives:\nThe game has a few issues with it's lighting, especially when I see light comes through walls and other solid objects - which especially looked weird, because the game uses volumetric lighting really heavily and I constantly bumped into places where I saw light rays in an otherwise complitely dark area.\n\nThe more serious issue is the game - despite being in the 8.33 version when I played it - has game-breaking bugs. I encountered one in the very end, like right before the finale. I fortunately managed to fix it with resetting my presets, but it was still jarring to encounter such serious issue.\n\nNow the smaller problems:\nThe game is clearly not meant to be hard or too punishing - and I can overall say the gameplay is a bit bare-bones with a really little depth. It was enough to carry the story on it's back, but the game really lack variety of interesting things to do. Most of the fun comes from interacting with the NPCs and exploring, but otherwise, the mission design is really basic: fetch-quests and getting from point A to point B, which becomes even easier, once you aqiuired a certain outfit. If the story not immerses you, I can assure you, the gameplay won't keep you playing for even 2 hours, not even for 15-20. The day-night cycle while it was nice and boosted my immersion, wasn't really utilized, beyond certain NPCs spends their time at a different location at different parts of the day, which was really diasppointing, especially while the gameplay have stealth in it.\nThe one more negative I didn't like is the game sometimes really \"forgots\" to give you direction and you spend most of your time of figuring out where the hell you need to go to progress. This was especially frustrating at the end of the game where this problem got more and more apparent. It wasn't so terrible that I wanted to put down the game and never come back, but I admit I opened Google more than once to watch a video of where is the next place I need to go to avoid running around 2 hours aimlessly looking for something minor detail. I'm glad the game didn't have floating quest markers and stuff - just oh god please, a bit more direction for my lazy millenial ass would have been good.\n\nTied to this, one really serious issue is the game that it has a lot of side-quest completion tied to the main quest's progression - this becomes a really major issue when you have fetch quests or you need to find specific items. Here's an example: you found 5/10 required items to a side quest. After you find that 5 item, you spend an additional hour running around the already unlocked places to where are the rest of the items you need, maybe you missed a secret corridor or a door or something. You eventually going to give up and move to a different quest, only to find out that the rest of the 5 items you need for the side quest is in a complitely different area that gets unlocked if you progress the main quest. You just wasted one hour running around for nothing, because there is zero indicvation if you actually missed something, or the game wants you to do something the main quest and progress that. This is an issue of numerious side-quests and it's really frustrating.\n\nTL;DR: if you like story driven stuff and you don't mind bare-basic and repetitive gameplay, buy this, if not, don't touch it.", "timestamp_created": 1555715753, "timestamp_updated": 1562423382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601009905338287354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50192764": {"recommendationid": "50192764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170133062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1223, "last_played": 1554347104}, "language": "english", "review": "god i love this game. best single player game ive played in sooo long. the story, the mechanics, the graphics, all just perfect. even the music is litty", "timestamp_created": 1555553353, "timestamp_updated": 1555553353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432080894708633423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50180978": {"recommendationid": "50180978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030685766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1594, "last_played": 1555539209}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend this game.\nThis is a great quest/adventure game, hosting to some stunning views and gorgeous detail. \nThe characters are beautifully animated and designed, and the story is emotionally gripping.

I'm kind of at a loss for words regarding where to start this review. As someone who grew up with movies like The Secret of NIMH and reading the Redwall series, and now a fan of newer entries in the rodent-fantasy genre like Mouse Guard, this game was right up my alley. That aside, from a gamer perspective, this is an amazing game. The controls are simple but all impactful, there's no fluff or ability bloat whatsoever. The controls and movement feel very dialed in, no floatiness or lag or other issues. The art is fantastic, whether it be a character portrait on a chat block or the in-game graphics themselves, all is far above and beyond for an indie title. The game is atmospheric and deep both visually and in terms of lore. Characters feel realistic and incredibly well written. Many games fail to really connect the player to the characters within the game, but I found myself genuinely caring about the cast of characters and wanting to know more about the entire game world. The amount of lore and backstory really fleshed out the world I was playing in and succeeded in creating the sense of a living world beyond the boundaries of the play area. Ghost of a Tale in no way feels like a one off game, it feels like a book in an epic ongoing series. \n\nThe fortress in which the game takes place is a character itself. Most games have you clear out a fortress or ruins and move on to the next. GoaT however keeps you within the confines of Dwindling Heights and allows you the time to really get to know the place and all of it's inhabitants, learn it's every secret and fall in love with the keep and those dwelling within. The music is outstanding as well. I still can't wrap my head around a game this great being made by such a small team. Ghost of a Tale has achieved (in my mind) what many AAA studios fail to achieve time and time again. This game could very easily be the seed planted for an entire franchise. The only downside of GoaT is that there isn't more of it. I'm crossing my fingers for a sequel.\n\nEdit: Most downvotes I see for GoaT complain of not knowing what to do or where to go. This game has sort of an old school feel to it in that it isn't a game that holds your hand and gives you a quest marker to follow at every turn. You have to read, you have to think, you have to actually pay attention to the world around you and play as opposed to simply following glowing trail markers and patting yourself on the back afterward.", "timestamp_created": 1555164971, "timestamp_updated": 1555302979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50084665": {"recommendationid": "50084665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081711960", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1554985942}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is difficult and the lack of a difficulty setting means enemies have super 20/20 vision and can see you from miles away.

The game is quite beautiful in it's concept, but falters somewhat in its execution. When I first started playing, I really loved it, but as I got farther along, it's charm diminished somewhat.\n\nThis is a third-person adventure game with light stealth and RPG mechanics, and almost no combat. The visuals are quite lovely, and the medieval, fantasy setting with anthropomorphic characters is charming. The lore in the game is well-developed, and completely optional, if you don't want to take time to read it.\n\nHowever, the game overall is plagued by annoying bugs, some of which may seem game-breaking, until you press on through and realize that missing quest-givers and such might just be about the timing of when you encountered things in your play-through. The game design didn't assure me that everything was going to be OK, if I just kept playing and advancing the quests that I could still accomplish. The clipping bugs I experienced as well as one time falling into the void did not reassure me that I was going to actually be able to finish the game. I was able to complete the game, by the way, but then ending was not super satisfactory in terms of closure.\n\nThe game had me doing a lot of back-tracking and areas that I thought I had completely \"cleared\" ended up being repeat destinations for me when later quests activated new \"features\" in those areas. This is not necessarily a bad thing, I am just pointing it out because, it felt like I was making progress in the game only to find that I had a long ways to go. I felt like the middle part of the game had me bogged down as it seemed to drag on and left me wondering if I was going to finish the game or not. The wonky camera angles was another problem, especially when climbing or traversing tight tunnels.\n\nThis game really did have a lot going for it, and seemed like a labor of love, but I think it could have used a little more polishing as well as a tightening up of the story or at least some work on the pacing of the story.\n\nIf you are into Redwall, or Mouse Guard, you should give this game a shot, but get it on sale.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1554774202, "timestamp_updated": 1554774202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50025131": {"recommendationid": "50025131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069872909", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1404, "last_played": 1554700601}, "language": "english", "review": "Is good game", "timestamp_created": 1554700637, "timestamp_updated": 1554700637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390477508306503296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50020893": {"recommendationid": "50020893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998358006", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1554760513}, "language": "english", "review": "Ghost of a Tale has some great worldbuilding and gorgeous art direction, but navigating the maps is hell (everything blends together visually) and you'll spend a LOT of time wondering what the hell you're supposed to be doing because nothing is labelled or marked on your map.\n\nI want so badly to like this game, but I get lost every two minutes, the stamina meter refills at a miserable pace, and quests point me to places that I've never been to with no instruction on how to get there.\n\nIt's such a good concept and clearly had a lot of care put into it but all I feel when I play it is frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1554675139, "timestamp_updated": 1554677948, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488635003566741943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50014308": {"recommendationid": "50014308", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993650508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1678588379}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not going to lie, I like things easy.

It's all-around an impressive accomplishment when you know how much work and how few individuals contributed to this title. The game is quite lore heavy with excellent world building, and the space you play in becomes very intimate. You'll know every inch of the keep, the dungeon, the sewers, etc. It's all very well crafted. The game runs very well with beautiful design and animations to boot. It's all a very compelling package for the price, and I'd be impressed if we see something of this caliber again from the indie scene anytime soon.\n\nGame-play wise, I wouldn't say there is a whole lot to it. There's essentially zero combat, although a select few enemies can be damaged or killed with throwables. The main focus is on stealth, which is an interesting mechanic until it becomes negated by a costume. The trade-off being, loss of speed and the ability to jump in exchange for guards leaving you alone. This route does eliminate the strategy and challenge of moving about the keep, so take that as you will. Otherwise, the game consists of light puzzle solving and chatting to NPCs. Generally, if a game has a poor story, I hope the game-play will make up for it. Or vis versa. Ideally both a great, but in this case I would lean more towards the lore and story being the main factor that carries the game. As there isn't much of a game-play loop here that I would consider compelling or interesting, but that isn't to say the game play is bad. I'd say it's just satisfactory.\n\nStory-wise, the game has some very interesting fantasy elements, curious lore, and plenty of mysteries for the player to ponder, even post-game. The game unfortunately doesn't answer some of the primary plot threads it sets out on, but there's enough twists and surprises throughout the arc for this to be forgivable. I was left wanting for more, and I'd be very disappointed if the story never moves past this game-- it's definitely a great setup for something grander.

There will be some platforming and you can stun/kill enemies with consumables, but you will spend most of your time talking to NPCs, exploring the beautifully crafted world and finding collectables. What gameplay is there could most certainly be executed better, but it's by no means bad in its current iteration.\n\nThe game isn't voice-acted, but it manages to create more emotional and fleshed-out characters than not only the \"soulless\" AAA games, but the overwhelming majority of other indie darlings. It does so through well-written dialogue, environmental clues and gorgeous portraits in the dialogue menu. \n\nThis game has incredible worldbuilding. You are confined to a tiny fortress and its surrounding areas, but by the end of the game you will have a mostly-complete mental image of the larger world and its villains and heroes. Using footnotes in dialogue instead of simply adding pages to your lore book ensures that you are actually reading said lore. \n\nIf you like Mouse Guard or The Secret of NIMH, you are almost certainly going to like this game. It is, however, different in tone to those two. The tone is less dark and more hopeful, and all the hardships, losses and deaths have their edges dulled through incredible dialogue, which manages to lighten the mood without ruining it, and various cartoony shenanigans.\n\nOverall, it's hard to do the game justice without spoiling a ton of moments. I personally adored it.

That may sound like a joke, but it really isn\u2019t.\n\nGhost of a Tale stars Tilo, a mouse minstrel who has been unjustly imprisoned in the crumbling Dwindling Heights, a great fortress built over the tomb of the hero Dunlain, but which is today little more than a prison where rat soldiers who have screwed up one too many times are given jobs as punishment. One day, Tilo finds a key and a note hidden under a piece of bread delivered to his cell, entreating him to unlock his cell and sneak through the fortress meet with his anonymous benefactor on the top of the highest tower in the keep.\n\nBut Tilo is a tiny little mouse in a world full of rats, magpies, and other larger creatures. One of the first people he runs into, a frog, entreats him to murder a snoring guard, but Tilo refuses, on the grounds that he is no murderer \u2013 or indeed, a criminal at all.\n\nAnd so the stage is set for a stealth game, as our cute little mouse protagonist scampers and sneaks his way around the world. This is a world akin to Redwall, where all of the people are anthropomorphic animals \u2013 but only slightly anthropomorphized. They walk on two legs, but Tilo will scamper on all fours when he runs, and they\u2019re all designed to look rather like real animals.\n\nIt seems at first like the racism of Redwall is present as well \u2013 the rats are at first depicted as being rather mean, and the mice as good. But it quickly becomes clear that the rats are indeed the heroes of the setting, and that the mice betrayed them in ancient times to a terror known as the Green Flame. The mice you run into in the game are thieves, and it becomes clear when you read more about the world that a number of mice have been rebelling against the rats \u2013 and while their treatment as second-class citizens is perhaps unjust, a number of the rats seem to be sympathetic towards mice.\n\nThe game, thus, subverts the player\u2019s expectations about a setting like this, and the game keeps doing so throughout. The whole game takes place in a very small area \u2013 a single fortress and a bit of surrounding wilderness \u2013 and there\u2019s only about a dozen real characters in the game, but there is more to almost all of them than meets the eye. Thus, as you explore the keep and try to make your way to freedom and find your wife, you also learn more about the world and the people around you, and find that things are nowhere near as simple as they seemed. Everything you believed might be wrong, and your benefactor, Silas, warns you not to trust anyone \u2013 even him.\n\nBut Tilo is a kind creature, and the NPCs are so cute\u2026 how can you not want to help them out?\n\nThe weird thing about this game is that while it appears like it is a stealth game at first glance, it actually only is one for about the first quarter or third of the game \u2013 one of the first quests you get is a quest to sneak around the keep and gather pieces of guard armor to make yourself a disguise. Once you complete this disguise, weighed down in heavy, oversized rat armor, you pass yourself off as a runty new rat recruit who was supposed to be transferred in. At this point, it becomes possible to walk past and talk to every guard in the place, and the game goes from a stealth game to being focused on exploration and, ultimately, doing what amounts to fetch-quests for a number of NPCs.\n\nWhat you enjoy about this game is probably not going to be the gameplay \u2013 sure, the stealth bit is decent enough, but the mechanics never really evolve because instead it focuses around disguising yourself to pass as various people to get others to help you out. The game is really mostly fetchquests and exploration, trying to find things for people who might help you escape from the prison or help to find your wife.\n\nThe real draw of this game is the writing. The fact that the whole place is pretty small means that a lot of what you\u2019re doing is going back and forth, trying to find stuff or get people to give you stuff or convince them to do stuff, or just talking to people to learn more about the world. And the fact that the game world is so small means that, despite all of the backtracking, you don\u2019t actually spend all that long between plot points \u2013 the game is pretty dense, and you\u2019ll frequently complete tasks and go turn them in to get new fun bits of dialogue with people. The conversations are often funny, but can deliver emotionally powerful exposition; the hidden depths of characters are nice to see, and you end up caring about the core cast of characters because there are so few of them and you get fond of them by talking with them over time. From the rascally Gusto and Fatale, mouse thieves extraordinare who make you write a ballad for them, to Silas, your mysterious benefactor with ulterior motives, to the blacksmith Rolo, who seems to always be willing to sell you advice for a bit of coin, they\u2019re a pretty likeable bunch, and Tilo\u2019s own polite, kind character shines through and makes the player very much want to help him find his wife and escape from this place.\n\nThe game\u2019s overall presentation is also very nice \u2013 the UI is generally attractive, and the character models are high quality and very detailed. The way Tilo stomps around in armor that is too heavy for him, tiptoes around while sneaking, scampers around while running, or awkwardly clambers into hiding places (where you can not only hide out from guards, but also save your game), is all quite fun to see. The art is quite good overall, and the characters are very expressive in some ways. Alas, the game is very much an indie project, which means that some of the moments which would have been more difficult to animate are instead simply given out to the player via a brief bit of emoting text, which is a little bit of a letdown \u2013 some of those moments would have been really powerful to see, but unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t let you, leaving them to your imagination.\n\nThere is, I think, a certain sort of person who is apt to be very charmed by this game \u2013 they will find the characters fun, the art style nice to look at, the writing very engaging and witty, and the characters will grow on them and make them care about their well-being.\n\nBut at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of people who will simply not like this game \u2013 if you\u2019re looking for a stealth game, this game is only briefly that, and overall, most of the gameplay is very basic and consists of simple exploration and doing what amounts to fetchquests for people.\n\nFor me, personally, I fall into the former camp \u2013 the writing and characters made this game work for me, and I feel like this was an indie project which chose to use its small scope to its advantage, creating a tightly wound plot with a handful of characters that the game made you care about and want to succeed.", "timestamp_created": 1549786777, "timestamp_updated": 1549786777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633988082408905029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48862611": {"recommendationid": "48862611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109180130", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1549706416}, "language": "english", "review": "you must play this game, cuteness + adventure + awesome graphics / world design", "timestamp_created": 1549689248, "timestamp_updated": 1549689248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48857450": {"recommendationid": "48857450", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994897595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1088, "last_played": 1529976499}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1549665892, "timestamp_updated": 1549665892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48852761": {"recommendationid": "48852761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995581962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1138, "last_played": 1549639048}, "language": "english", "review": "a goode mouse game", "timestamp_created": 1549650015, "timestamp_updated": 1549650015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48845925": {"recommendationid": "48845925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236855234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1289, "last_played": 1665069802}, "language": "english", "review": "Is this a RPG?

My computer itself wasn't fit to run the game without choppy frames here and there. But I am very glad I pulled through even with my terrible hardware.\n\nI suppose the reason I stuck out the ride was mostly for the story, and the overall feel of the game. I went through this game feeling like a somewhat defenseless mouse who has to use his wits to bypass the enemies and challenges ahead.\n\nI liked that feeling, being this small yet nimble creature sneaking around. The animations of Tilo himself really add to this. The way his ears perk up when he looks around, the way he brings his arms closer to his chest as he tiptoes forward. It's both adorable and helps pull me more into his character. Even the little things such as how he perks up while looking at an item or NPC, or when he grabs his tail from time to time, its all just satisfying to watch in a way.\n\nThe story really pulled me in as well, being one of the main forces pushing me to finish the game. I don't want to spoil much, but I felt some of the punches this story gave. The desperation Tilo had to find his wife, the pains of old wounds he may feel is better left unspoken, and the shock of the things he had uncovered in his journey. I loved the characters, and I enjoyed going through this game while getting to know them.\n\nEven with all of this though, the game has flaws. Probably the most obvious being how the game becomes pretty easy after you get the guards outfit. Though I also feel the game is a bit too easy to begin with. I only died a couple times throughout it, and after a while I figured out the guards aren't much of a threat in general. This could be fixed by things such as: the guards being faster, the guards checking some of the hiding spots, or them pulling you out of a hiding spot if they see you entering it, and not just a prompt saying you can't hide there when the guard sees you. The armor problem could also perhaps be fixed if some of the guards saw past your disguise (which may be a bit of a problem story wise I know) or if there were more enemies which weren't guards that you have to sneak around.\n\nBut even with these problems, I would very much recommend this game. I know its not for everyone, but if you think you'll enjoy a game where you play a mouse who sneaks around using his wits instead of weaponry, a lover of a good old medieval story about a mouse in search of his wife, or you're just a guy who loves fetch quests.

It feels somewhere between an exploration-based game, a metroidvania, and one of those early CRPGs that's half adventure game...\n\nThe main gameplay consists of sneaking around an environment, that you gradually gain access to larger and larger amounts of as you gain access to items, in a way that's similar to the \"backtracking with new abilities\" gameplay of a metroidvania, but with sneaking in place of combat as the main \"spice\" to your traversal. I personally really enjoyed gradually getting more acquainted with the environment, and gaining more mastery over crisscrossing it, but personally I have a lot of trouble navigating in games so learning how to get around may have provided interest to me for longer than it would to someone with more spatial awareness.\n\nThroughout this, you have a number of plot threads and sidequests to follow (mostly optional, but also mostly beneficial, and all interesting), to pick up on in each area as you make your way around, giving it that satisfying (and addictive) \"let me just take care of this one other thing before I quit for the night\" feeling. It feels almost like an adventure game in places, but the sort where the puzzles are mostly perfunctory lock-and-keys, with the challenge being more about getting to each thing you need rather than any demanding leaps of logic\u2014like semi-open-ended PC RPGs often used to be, but again, with sneaking and navigation in place of the combat that they would have had as the spacing between story.\n\nI'm delighted by any game that does away with violence as its main way of interacting with the world, and this game generally fits the bill\u2014there is some killing of monstrous creatures, and occasional strategic knocking-out of guards, but it's fairly indirect, and happens rarely, as a punctuation rather than a monotony. There's still a fair amount of scary content\u2014occasional jumpscares, and fairly frequent depictions of long-dead rat skeletons\u2014but its whole vibe is firmly more on the side of \"very spooky\" rather than being \"horror\". It definitely bears mentioning that the protagonist is in near constant peril, but it's fairly manageable; this isn't a \"one slip-up and you're dead\" game, but rather a \"find a way to compensate for your slip-up\" game, which can keep your travels fresh and interesting even as you pass the same guard for the twentieth time\u2014the situations are juuuuust dynamic enough that you'll mostly be improvising the ways that you respond to scrapes, rather than it being totally rote. (Don't expect too much, it's not a VERY complex simulation\u2014the guards *are* as dumb as you'd expect in a sneaking game\u2014but there's just enough room for spontaneity that it kept my interest, personally.) The game does do away with what seemed like interesting mechanics sooner than I'd have liked\u2014a surprising amount of the game is spent not sneaking at all, actually\u2014but there's still enough going on that the missed opportunities aren't really the end of the world or anything.\n\nIt's a longer game than I expected\u2014it took me nearly 30 hours to 100% it, though I imagine one could sprint through much faster if you weren't interested in all the sidequests... It was extended a little by some crucial objects being frustratingly obscure (even with the help of the \"highlight objects\" ability you can acquire) but I still usually turned to a guide not too long after getting stuck, so that isn't a VERY inflated playtime.\n\nYou don't need me to tell you how gorgeous the atmosphere is, you can see the screenshots on the store page. If the look of that world is tempting you, it won't disappoint. The music is sparse but lovely when it's there; the writing is a little clich\u00e9 but the characters are charming and sympathetic (even if the writer's scat fetish is indulged distractingly often).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the game is still FAIRLY buggy at the moment, but this isn't too much of a concern, because 1) despite their frequency, the only bugs remaining seem to be minor (I hear there used to be some doozies, but I didn't hit any show-stoppers besides occasionally falling through the world), and 2) the devs seem to be still hard at work, cleaning up what bugs remain, so even these bugs will probably be gone before much longer.\n\nAlso, I *did* suffer from some motion sickness, in some portions of the game? The camera honestly is kind of clumsy and uncomfortable, and between the dim lighting and some of the vertiginous heights, I could feel my brain squirming to keep up as the camera lurched around, and I had to stop playing after a few hours in some of the worse spots. I'd say I'm slightly above-average in sensitivity to these things, but not *very* much so, so take that into consideration if it's something you struggle with.\n\nAlso, I feel obligated to say, this is one of those games that ends with its story half-finished\u2014it's a satisfying ending, that really does nicely tie up the events of the game, but suffice to say the game ends as the character is only beginning the next leg of their journey towards the primary motivation they've spent the game pursuing (and another motivation picked up right at the end)... I felt a little bit cheated by this, but honestly, it makes an excellent \"act one\" to the story\u2014I certainly wouldn't have wanted the game to be any longer, nor would I have expected it to be at a price this low\u2014and if you go in knowing that this is act one (and assuming the devs are able to finish the story in a sequel someday) then I've got no complaints about the portion of the story included here.\n\nAnyway\u2014lots to love, and the complaints are honestly minor and, in my opinion, worth putting up with for a very satisfying and charming experience; I can't think of the last time a game felt like it suited me so well, which is saying especially much considering that spooky games mostly aren't my thing at all.

There is almost no guidance at the beginning.  Even worse is that you MUST search every chest and cupboard you can search through, and unfortunately you wont find out about that later when someone tells you that something is stored in a random  chest in the first area.\n\nAnother problem is that they will tell you to go somewhere without any direction.  So you're pretty much either hoping the blacksmith will let  you buy the location on the map, or you go through every door you passed by to find the Commanders Office.  That is NOT fun.  Telling me to go to the \"West Gate\" and then me having to search the map for it is NOT FUN.  It's tedious and I shouldn't have to buy information like that to make the game less tedious.  \n\nThe game is also too unfair to the player.  I was just going along after you spent an entire day finally getting to \"The Far Tower\" after making no progress, you suddenly hear a metal \"thunk\" followed by death.  There was no warning that they had put bear traps in this area.  I didn't even know there was such a thing as a bear trap.  So I get punished, end up losing lots of progress simply because the designers didn't put any signs of \"Watch out for traps!\" or something to indicate that I should be looking out for something that could kill me.  \n\nThis game could have been easily fixed by adding more guidance for the player and adding more hints when invisible dangers are present.  Sign posts are the most basic thing that the developer left out.  Heck, even Zelda games have sign posts!  \"To West Gate\" with a sign pointing in a general direction would have been helpful.\n\nOnce you get through the first 1/4 of the game, you start to understand what the game is asking of you.

Yes, you'll be doing lots and lots of backtracking.  \n\nFortunately the presentation is nice.  The story is nice and kind of dark.

It is more like an adventure game, with some stealth and a lot of fetch quests. \nAlthough you do an enormous amount of backtracking and revisiting previous locations, the beautifully crafted world, the changing time of day with the moving sun ever changing the lighting keep the place fresh. I am noticing new details here and there while going back and forth, and it just shows how much love was poured into making the game. \n\nWhat stands out at the onset is that it is truly a gorgeous game, and beautifully animated. The movements look real, the steps when you walk and run sound real, when you put on the rat guards' armor, it creaks and you can barely move... Details like these abound everywhere. It was created mostly by a single person, Lionel \"Seith\" Gallat, a Dreamworks and Universal Picture veteran, and the game is definitely a showcase of his incredible talent and passion. And if you ever get tired looking at the cute main protagonist's whiskers and liquid eyes (I don't), the writing also is top notch, with engaging characters, funny situations and many background lore texts hinting at a fully fleshed out medieval world. And since you play as a mouse minstrel, Tilo, a handful of ingame songs were created to immerse you some more.\n\nI was stuck a couple of times with quests that I had to look up on the internet as the gameplay is somewhat difficult in a retro style of way: the majority of the hints come from your conversations and you have to pay attention to what the NPCs tell you.  Overall I think that playing without a radar adds to the immersion. Having a breadcrumb to the next NPC with a question mark then to the next quest item would have killed the exploration and sense of discovery.\n\nSo... It's a definitive thumbs up!

I loved almost every moment of it, and it's the first game in a while that has kept my attention and I was thinking about playing the game when I wasn't able to.\n\nGraphics:  Absolutely breathtaking!  The amazing attention to detail coupled with the wonderful setting was a joy to experience.  Some small gripes though... it would have been nice to see some animations of characters actually completing certain tasks instead of just showing a progress bar fill up until it's complete.  Sometimes, a character is supposed to move from one position to another and instead of showing an animation of that transition, the character just disappears and reappears where they're supposed to go.  Also, there is a good amount of slowdown immediately after you save the game.  Other than that, the game was beautiful.\n\nGameplay: Your character is very responsive and I only had a couple issues while platforming that I didn't feel that he controlled as well as I would've liked.  The stealth mechanics were great, but were honestly short-lived once you get a certain costume.  Also, there is some combat in the game, but it felt like it was only partially implemented.  Also, would've liked to see the enemy AI be a little more aggressive after you're spotted.  Normally, with stealth-based games, once I am noticed by an enemy, I am immediately stressed out with how I am going to deal with the situation.  That did not come up at all for me in this game because the alert situations were quickly and easily dealt with.  Even though it seems like I have a lot of gripes about the gameplay, I still have to go back to the fact that I was constantly wanting to come back for more.  \n\nStory: This, second to the graphics, is another standout aspect of this game.  The story and lore is rich and interesting.  There are twists and turns that take place that I didn't see coming at all.  The story and world is surely what kept drawing me back into this game.  The writers associated with this game should be commended on their job well done.  \n\nOverall:  Even though the gameplay wasn't its strong suit, the package as a whole was amazing.  I am very eager to see a sequel come out that expands and varies the gameplay and continue this amazing story in this fabulous and interesting world.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1549190233, "timestamp_updated": 1549190233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48730097": {"recommendationid": "48730097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033340053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 1911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1468, "last_played": 1522149466}, "language": "english", "review": "If theres one word to best describe Ghost of a Tale it'd be charming. Everything shows a loving attention to detail from the animation to the world building; Yet I'm still reluctant to fully reccomend the game to just anyone, for as much as there is to love theres plenty I'm sure that some people simply won't enjoy.\n\nYou'll be playing the role a mouse bard called Tilo, who has been arrested and locked in the prison of Dwindling Heights Keep, with the help of a mysterious stranger you escape the prison and begin to seek after your missing wife. \nOf course as mouse you are no match for any of the other creatures in the keep and so stealth will be your main tool, at least at first, thats no a mechanic that everyone will love, and the opening is slow paced as a result, the game makes up for this with its wonderful attention to detail, in dialogue, lore, animation and environment. But if you're not a fan of that pacing then this is not going to get better. \n\nOf course a major aspect of stealth gameplay is the AI, which is passable, the guards are lazy and easily avoided by running and eventually hiding, this is of course pretty standard in stealth gaming (it would be awful if guards were actually diligent) and actually gets explained in game, as the guards at the keep are all posted here as punishment (its just an example of the little details). When it come to failing stealth there is no combat at all, which is a pro for me as it encourages you to be stealthy, combat in stealth games is never great as its either bad(as a last ditch option when all else fails) or good which takes away from the stealth gameplay.\n\nBut the game isn't really a stealth game, after a certain point you'll come across disguises you can use to fool guards and NPCs into helping you or leaving you alone (on top of other bonuses). This of course changes the game, taking away the stealth. But this works quite well as you get the most of the stealth in new areas, and then gain the ability to switch it off once you get to grips with the area and start backtracking through the castle. You also open up new dialogue and story options as you impersonate different people and there are sections of working out ways to get the things you need from people using the tools you have, its not particularly hard but it is fun.\n\nBut none of these are the main draw of the game, the main draw is exploration and if you're not into that for its own sake you might be better off letting this one pass, but if you are into that then its a wonderful game world to dive into and discover, with its history and characters, its lore and story and of course its gorgeous visuals. If however you want something more gameplay focused then you'll be out of luck as the game is quite simple.

Character also plays music as a bard.\n-So many items to pick up, pleasing the collector player. One might say there's perhaps TOO MUCH items.\n-Good story, with plenty of lore to back it up, which you can read in menu. Easily sets up for sequels in this world.\n-Side-quests are all interesting, flesh out the world and have good dialogs, despite most being fetch-quests.\n-Cutest main character you've ever seen in a game, hands down, period.\n-Nostalgia factor : The Secret of Nimh, Redwall, The Dark Crystal... if you grew up with these, get ready to feel old.\n-Get ready for surprises, if you pay attention to the dialog. Characters aren't always who they seem to be.\n-Level seems huge (esp. considering you're a mouse), but is inter-connected and has plenty of shortcuts!\n-Costumes allow for different abilities.

The blacksmith helps out for this, for a cost, but even so I sometimes had to use Google.\n-Combat, when it happens, looks very bad. The final scene in particular, despite being very cool, feels rushed, unfinished and clunky. \n-Climbed down a cliff and fell out of world. Thankfully it only happened that one time.\n-Had to revisit passed areas a few times too many, often for little unimportant things. \n-Some rewards you get from very long and annoying quests give useless rewards. (oh great, big ears. TOTALLY WORTH IT)\n-The AI is incredibly stupid. However, the guards are all literally incredibly stupid, so I guess it makes sense?\n-Doesn't really have any replayability. The game is linear. You can speedrun, if you're into that.\n-Enemy variety is very limited, you can count them on your hand. \n-No voice acting. Then again, no voice acting is better than bad voice acting.\n\nAll in all, amazing game. Highly looking forwards to the sequel!!!

But there isn't much to this game besides its beautifl scenery, whimsical humor and design, and use of stealth mechanics. The whole premise of the game is just run through the keep, talk to some npc (which don't get me wrong they are very charming and enjoyable). It's just that thats it. You're in a keep, hiding from rats, talking to npc, and eating food when your health is low, solve puzzles. It's not exactly a full rpg. \n\n\nI think the game should be more open world besides just the keep's area. If it were have this the game wouldn't be as repetative. The tension that comes from hiding from the rats when they spot you was exhilarating, and it did make my hands sweat when I entered a cubboard. It was super cool...But this gets old, because you go in and out of the keep, and courtyard to the point that the enemies start to become chores to try and avoid. Humorously there were times that I just sped through them all, running until I got close, then straight away sneak then got past them. \n\n\nYou have no idea how funny af it is to just sprint then sneak, one guard (where the barrel room was) was broken I think in where you can go alongside him above where the balcony is, and just plop down and he doesn't react or anything. This brings me to another point, the guard's lack of AI intellegance leaves me with the ability to hide while my body was still being seen climbing into the barrel (It's like this: I'm being chased, I turn a corner and hide in a closet, the guard is in the room and sees the glimpse of my legs just slide into the cubboard; the guard goes hmm where did that he go? Then leaves) The clothing and ability to change outfits really does give me that RPG sense that I assume the game was going for? It works very well, and I totally love being a thief, pirate, or any costume get up I yearn to be! Character work is very humerous and light hearted. \n\n\nSo the point I'm saying is this: The game needs to be more open world, in order to keep it from being repetative and boring. I first thought the game was going to be that way, like a 'you start in the dungeons, but you must break out in order to experience the rest of the world' but it's not like that, the dungeons and area that makes up the castle are basically your game play. I can't give this much higher than a 7 or 8 (8 only for the Fable-inspired, awesome imagery and grpahics) but 7 because there really isn't much else to do in the game accept avoid rats and activate npc that leaves the game not only becoming repatative, but making it's gameplay leave a lot to be desired.\n\n\n ====PROS====\n -AWESOME IMAGERY! Good graphics (though some clipping was seen through outfits and objects, mainly the rat guards) -Npc humour is pretty enjoyable,\n -atomosphere and mood is inviting \n-fluent controls, movement feel smooth \n-collectables enable players to delve into game lore, encouraging exploration of the keep\n -Outfit change and style are enough to keep an interest, and encourage am rpg feel \n-Music is very immersive and relaxing (lol i guess until the giant armed rats chase XD)\n\n====CONS====\n -Game space is too small, making gameplay and exploration dwindle the more repetative it becomes\n -too much reading; as a writer myself, books are nice...But too much reading I felt my eyelids start to get heavy and droop like a travelizer.\n -RPG lacks in RPG concept; for example, my ingame responses don't make an impact and really doesn't matter: In example: \n(NPC: Are you a bard little \nmouse?! player choicees: 1: Y-yes \n2: Kinda \n3: I play but not that often\n 4: What of it? NPC: Can you play us a song? \n        =ALL CHOICES LEAD TO ME PLAYING A SONG.. -_- \n\n-Guard AI is dense (not clever) I can juke them without thought, sometimes even run right past them in plain view without an immediate response \n-Repetative gameplay thought enjoyable at first gets old the longer game is played. \n\nAlso tedious as I wind up depleting all my currency on a Blacksmith in order to learn info that should really be free.

This is top tier worldbuilding and lore. Like Redwall - I think most everyone who's read Redwall would compare the two - but with much more magic and mystery. In my opinion, Ghost of a Tale has the potential to take the top spot for my favorite medieval mouse-adventure story.\n\nStealth is fun. There are many ways to get around guards that wearing different costumes can help with. Stick to the shadows, sneak past quietly, run too quickly for them to see, or even just trudge along disguised as one of them. There are alternate routes everywhere that open up all the time as you progress. \n\nNo loading times. The entire world is connected, and uses all available space efficiently. You really feel like Duinlan Heights is a place, and you'll be exploring every nook and cranny of it. Thankfully this is never once hindered by a loading screen. This isn't unique among video games of course, but it's still going in the Pros column.\n\nAwesome writing. Not just the worldbuilding and storytelling, but the dialogue and the songs and the lore are all written in a fluid and believable way. Seith breathed life into the characters in Ghost of a Tale and you really feel that they could exist. Even the minor characters fit their roles well.\n\nAtmosphere. Beautiful lighting and an abundance of detail helps bring Duinlan Heights to life. Whether you're in a shady forest, atop a tall tower overlooking the world, exploring crumbling ruins, or lurking in a dank sewer or crypt, GoaT really wants you to believe that you're there. \n\nMusic. Your character is a minstrel, so of course there's going to be music. I've been humming \"The Gilded Warrior\" all afternoon, and I'm waiting for a cover band to actually put Tilo's songbook to words with vocals.\n\nI think that's enough gushing about this game (which if it isn't obvious I already wholly reccomend) let's move on to the\n\nCons:\n\nFramerate. All those lovely little details can slow down the action sometimes. Usually it behaved pretty well, but in more dense areas it was definitely noticeable. Not bad, but enough to make this list.\n\nCamera. When you're in a tight space - and let's face it, you're a mouse scampering through tunnels in this game so that's going to be the vast majority - the camera will get caught on things. It will snap to face directly down at Tilo from above. It will spin around him at light speed. It's just a little too slow (but admittedly I never checked to see if there was an option to change that.) I'm not a fan of the camera.\n\nFetch quests. There are a lot of fetch quests in this game. In fact, that's all you ever do besides one gambling minigame. I'll be honest, with the story Seith is telling here I'm not sure what could be added to change that, but it doesn't help the fact that running around and bringing things to people ad nauseum is... well, nauseating.\n\nSome stealth elements. While it's generally satisfying to elude guards like you're Tulong, there isn't really much to it other than getting out of sight and hiding in a barrel. They never check your hiding spots. It's more of an annoyance when you get spotted and have to take a detour to the nearest barrel or chest, but it holds up well enough to be considered valid gameplay. \n\nGameplay duration/expectations. The game ends before the story is over and there hasn't been a sequel announced. Everything the story is building up to, the protagonist's main quest, is left unfinished. We don't find Merra before the game is over. \n\nNot enough abilities. Placing decoys, playing music on your lute to keep sleeping guards asleep while you sneak past, smoke bombs you throw at your feet with one button instead of using the finnicky aiming - the reticule is rarely where your projectiles actually land - maybe a portable crate a la Solid Snake. A lot of missed opportunities mechanically. The Ears clothing slot is never used. Why not a listening device to enhance your enemy awareness or help you crack open a safe? Maybe not all of these are good ideas, but the gameplay feels like it's missing just a little bit of polish.\n\nParticle effects. In particular the Emerald Fire and the Red Mist just didn't impress me very much, nor did the Dying Light which obscures Tilo with its oddly opaque blue flames.\n\n-------------\n\nIn my personal, non-professional opinion, Ghost of a Tale is an experience worth having. It has a few problems symptomatic of being an indie game, but it still stands head and shoulders above other similarly budgeted titles mostly thanks to its beautiful environs and rich writing and lore. The story is left unfinished and key characters are never met, but what is there is sure to whet your appetite for more. You'll fall in love, you'll have your heart broken, you'll laugh and you'll weep. You'll also occasionally be pulled out of all of that by a frustrating camera, some buggy enemy AI, and more than once by getting stuck on a ledge you should definitely be able to walk over with ease while getting lost - figuratively and literally - in the game's lovingly-crafted world.", "timestamp_created": 1548738755, "timestamp_updated": 1548738755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.56204378604888916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48615009": {"recommendationid": "48615009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030158706", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1558725472}, "language": "english", "review": "So...

The unlocks are dreadfully dull, one of them lets you throw stuff slightly harder, another lets you see interactable things around you for about 1.5 seconds, another is supposed to recharge your stamina faster (it couldn't have been by more than a 5% since I you can't tell the difference), these are minor stat increases or otherwise not very useful.

Who doesn't love a minstrel mouse story?!\nThe Art is top notch. the game looks great by any standards. \n\nUnfortunately its just not fun to play. The gameplay is poor and is not impacted by the story at all. For example, its a fun creative choice that the main character is a mouse....but it is irrelevant to the gameplay. \n\n The vast majority of gameplay hours is simple treasure hunts.

A really sorry attempt at plot twists is present too. The characters are flat like cardboard cutouts. So much potential wasted.\n-One of these \"where the fuck do I go\" games, these are lots of quest-related things you can't find without a guide, like these beetle eggs you're  supposed to find on a roof, and you HAVE to know they are there, because they are too small to see from above or below.\n-Quests make little sense, the worst part is, you have to run the same places and back over and over again. Without fast travel. And one trip to from the Shore to the Jail takes about 10 minutes of real time, so about the half of playtime is you running back and forth to bring items to NPCs. There are like 10 quests related to the frog in the furthest end of the jail, and woe is you if you're wearing the guard armor, because you can't run.\n-Bugs. Walls and other glitches appearing you of nowhere, falling through corners, achievments not working properly - I got the hankerchief achievment after stealing only a few o f them, but still didn't get the scholar achievment, despite having fulfilled the requirements. Shows that the game is still in it's early access phase.\n-Uninspiring stealth - the guards can't see anything above them, can't hear anything behind them and generally offer no challenge. You can literally run around a guard without being detected, his meter drops right when you're behind his back.\n-SPOILER WARNING-\n[strike]-The final battle is impossible, tenfold so if you're trying to get the no damage achievment. You have 30 seconds to plant and detonate 3 bombs, while fending  off 20 skeletons. Which idiot thought this would be a nice ending a stealth fairy tale game?\t[/strike]\n\nOverall 6/10, only buy on sale.

You play as a mouse, a creature with the largest list of natural predators in the world, everything is bigger, meaner and scarier than you.\n\nAs such, the stealth in this game may not be to everyone\u2019s liking. This is not about sneaking around and murdering everything. You can knock some people out by throwing bottles on their heads or using environmental hazards. Things with helmets have bottle immunity, but their senses are worse so they\u2019re easier to sneak around. Your best solution is to just get good at running and hiding. Be aware of your environment and all the places you can squeeze your little furry ass into; closets, barrels, etc.\n\nI only had two problems with this game. 1) the camera could be a pain in the ass, sometimes cleaving to the back of Tilo\u2019s skull such that his head took up like 45% of the screen. The camera is also a little slow, but upping the sensitivity in the options alleviated that for the most part. 2) I really liked the thief set, but not a fan of the tricorn hat.

His journey is quite a sentimental one as you discover things from the past that lead to your current situation. Theres a number of interesting characters that you'll meet, that can guide you in your quest. The story is quite impressive considering the scope of the game and I truly felt emotional regarding things you learn. This game is clearly meant to be just the start of his adventure and a sequel will follow or at least I really hope so. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe gamepaly is basically a stealthvania of sorts, sneaking around in an interconnected world with no loading whatosever. Some may find this a chore of a game, since you're basically just gathering things to progress and I am the kind of person who really dislikes fetch quests and this is the reason why I avoided the game for so long but I was certainly not bored or annoyed by these quests. Its like they fit with the world and the lore and everything, besides the fact these quests will guide you through the overwhelming map. I really enjoyed exploring everything the game had to offer. At its core, its a stealth game, avoiding guards and helping others however theres also certain armors and upgrades which you may aquire that will lessen the difficulty of stealthing around. One thing I will have to say is that I can hardly call this an RPG. Far from it. \n\n[b]Atmosphere[/b]\n\nAs I've mentioned its one big open ended map with a decent amount of secret passage ways to discover and interesting locations to explore. You'll get to see every location since most of the main quests will take you everywhere. The locations are well designed and theres a natural flow of how the leveles are so nicely connected to one another. The map isnt big but theres plenty of interesting and pretty locations to explore such as the catacombs or the forest. The details on each character is what I was impressed. This is the work of a few people and it surpasses many huge games in this regard, specifically the main character. Well done on the clothing and animations. The game also has a day/night cycle which is quite an impressive feat for a handful of people. \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\n\nThere is no voice acting in the game sadly but it wont be missed. The dialogue text will still offer emotional impact. The music is well composed, especially the songs Tilo can sing and as for the rest of the exploration/dialogue songs, they're good enough. Cant really complain. Sound effects are pretty much standard and theres nothing outstanding or bad about them. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nGhost of a Tale surprised in ways I didnt expect. Yes there are fetch quests and that may upset or bore people but they feel natural and not forced as if they're part of the game not just to fill your time pointlessly and while there is no voice acting the story is still emotionally written. A really great stealthvania with an emotional story that I really enjoyed. I wanted more but I was still pleased with what I got and I do hope we get the sequel to Tilo's adventure. 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1545755880, "timestamp_updated": 1545755880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726047277450561523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47786183": {"recommendationid": "47786183", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993167715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 617, "last_played": 1545677030}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute little game with interesting characters, a fun story, and tons of side quests.", "timestamp_created": 1545677646, "timestamp_updated": 1545677646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47785890": {"recommendationid": "47785890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137825389", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1125, "last_played": 1612269069}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of those games where I just really connected with the main character.\nAmazing game and an absolute hidden gem on steam.\n\nGraphics:\nBeautiful, and screenshot worthy. They have a photomode where you can engross yourself with the game's Stunning visuals\n\nMap:\nOpen world but not a big map. Its small in comparison to other open world games, but so dense and so amazingly made. Dark souls-esc checkpoint/shortcut system. 7 map sets/areas so a continous change in scenery.\n\nGameplay:\nStealth orientated. There is no combat besides throwing some things, if that could be considered as such. It is a very passive type of game. There is a lot of back and forth that takes place, as quests will require you to go to the several areas to help complete them.\n\nCharacters:\nAs mentioned, I have never bonded with my character as much as I have had in Ghost of a Tale in a long time. There is a lot of dialogue between characters and the main characters in this game are amazingly created. Each have various amounts of personalities and backgrounds. Heck, you could even bond with what's supposed to be your enemies if you go along that path.\n\nChoices/Interactions:\nThe game was suprisingly good when it came to how it adapted to your decisions. In terms of gameplay I'm not certain much changes according to what you do, but the dialogue is affected. Even some things you do out of dialogue can affect dialogue in the future. So be quite careful how you play it. If you stick to main quests you will have different dialogue compared to if you did the side quests as well.\n\nIs it worth the price?\nFor what its worth I would say this was extremely worth it. Its not expensive and its a nice game to play if you want a nice quiet, immersive, relaxing weekend with a bit of puzzles along the way.\n\nComments:\n-I found myself to be lost in many situations because there is no hand holding by the game. Whatever questions you may have you need to interact with the characters to find out, and sometimes they don't. So whenever you're given information, its best to pay attention and not skip dialogue.\n-Every now and then I had a bug where the camera bugged behind me and I'd get lost for a decent second but I'm not entirely sure if it was just me or thats actually something in the game. It wasn't bad to the point where it ruined the experience though.\n\nPraise to the devs:\nI really enjoyed this game. I love the characters, I love the story, I love the gameplay, the scenery and the graphics. This was a great game to end 2018 off with.\nThank you SeithCG and your team, I look forward to supporting your future projects.\n", "timestamp_created": 1545676910, "timestamp_updated": 1545676910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684411704540252686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47759159": {"recommendationid": "47759159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022433750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1545553313}, "language": "english", "review": "I had long been awaiting to get this game. From the trailers and online material it looked like a very visually stunning game, and to that point it did not disapoint. The graphics are absolutely amazing and very well detailed and in that respect I'll give them 10/10 for graphics. \n\nThe game play however, may or may not be everyones cup of tea. The game is 100% single player - which is great for those gamers who enjoy a good story line or like a bit of critical thinking to achieve quests. The game offers almost no assistance when looking for quest items or people. The game drops hints by talking to other characters, but you may want a pen and paper handy because often times once a clue is given, it is not always able to be accessed again and wont necessarily show in your journals - this makes paying attention to detail important in this game. However, even if you enjoy that kind of things, there are some points in the game where you just have to guess or get lucky to find out how to finish a quest, as there are not always hints to help you figure it out, this can get frustrating. So those of you who like spoon-fed quest progressions, this games not for you. \n\nVERY MILD SPOILER ALERT\nI'll do my best not to give anything away here, but the story line is kind of lacking. It seems as though the story progresses in an almost sparatic manner and doesn't leave much to grab players in being truly invested in the story. The story line of the game progresses with your character looking for his wife, and then about 2/3 of the way into the game, the quest lines take a whole different direction and frankly I was very dissapointed by the way they summed up the story. Which brings me to my final complaint of the game - lack of content. For a roughly $30 game I expect more content - I shouldnt be able to complete every quest, gather all the extra stuff and beat the game in less than 12 hours of gameplay, that was REALLY dissapointing.\n\n In summary; fantastic graphics and not buggy at all, game looks beautiful and functions very smoothly. Gameplay is fun but lacking in additional content that I feel should've been implimented into the game; and the storyline itself left much to be desired.

I then played it another time to see how much it would take me by only doing the main quests.\nThe gameplay itself could become boring and I can't deny that, it's simply a game of hiding from the Rat Guards while usually fetching stuff for somebody, but it still manages to keep you playing thanks to the amazing story (the lore is surprisingly deep with lot of interesting stuff to read about the world), the great characters, the top-notch graphics (really close to AAA levels), and beautiful scenery combined with a great soundtrack. And it's almost all done by a single guy which is honestly really impressive. Plus you can easily tell he worked on major CGI movies just by how beautifully done the animations in this game are.\n\nI would say this is one, if not the best game I played in a while, and I can't wait to play it again just to hear the new music that will be added in an update when the game releases on Xbox One.\nReally hope there will be a number 2.", "timestamp_created": 1543000731, "timestamp_updated": 1543000731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46637434": {"recommendationid": "46637434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129702787", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1514054825}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would run from rats again", "timestamp_created": 1542996981, "timestamp_updated": 1542996981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46565533": {"recommendationid": "46565533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066867157", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1544782611}, "language": "english", "review": "I am half an hour in and already me and my friends were having fun.

Ghost of a Tale is a visually stunning, incredibly immersive adventure with great lore, writing and characters. But most importantly it has some of the best level and environmental design I've come across. If you are into making games, specially level design, or simply enjoy good level design, I urge you to play this game. The way you explore and discover the interconnecting areas of the fortress/castle make it feel like a real, lived in place. The lore and storytelling expands this beyond the area you can explore. Making the world you play in also feel lived in and more interesting. \n\nThe gameplay is on the slower side. This is not an action game. You play as a mouse and must rely on stealth and items. The game progresses through the excellent storytelling and collectables you must find. It's like a collectathon game but with the story and dialog of a point and click adventure game, and some light platforming and puzzle combat. If you enjoy any of those genres I think you'll enjoy the game.\n\nI also want to mention the soundtrack. While not amazing, it is very enjoyable. I still remember a couple pieces months after playing the game.\n\nAs for negatives, the game did have some bugs. Nothing too annoying or game breaking. But if you are a completionist, a bug did stop me from getting one of the achievements.\n\nGhost of a Tale is a game that really left an impression on me. It is by far the best indie game I've played in 2018 and it has crawled into my top 10 favorite video games of all time. I'll be looking out for future projects from the developer.

I standardly only play hard-core strategy, ARPG's or open world/ sandbox RPG's (usually modded  for extreme difficulty). I also tend not to care about plot in my games as I can get that much more effectively from a book and I prefer to role play my own plot while gaming.  What is so impressive to me about Ghost of a Tail is that I love it for precisely the things I don't usually care about in games.  Namely, it's very-well implemented stealth mechanics and it's immersive, surreal plot and world.  \n\nI took a chance on this game because I was a fan of Brian Jacques, Redwall books and this game looked like it could be a story ripped from those pages.  And OMG was this so much more than that.  As other reviews have said, the world and environments are beautifull.  Every area oozes character, personality and charm. I gradually stopped, simply trying to accomplish the next task needed to progress the plot and found myself lingering in a beautifull courtyard watching leaves blow in the wind, or trying to find ingenious ways to climb to roofs so I could get a better view of the world.\n\nThe various characters you meet and interact with are charming, witty and eccentric. I  am one of those people that gets tired of reading dialogues and just skip them.  But I started looking forward to more interactions with these characters.  I started pausing to laugh or reflect on what they say before picking my responses.  \n\nAt first I thought, \"Ok, pretty world.  I guess I'd like to see what the other area's graphics are like.\"  But as I played, the story began to subtlly flesh out and the characters gradually became more and more interesting untill I suddenly realized that I was fully immersed in this world and that I didnt want to beat it too soon.  There are a great number of unanswered questions and mysteries as you progress in the game.  I found I wanted to know who someone really was.  Or who I could actually trust.  Or what events had happened to get my character to this place.  And as the game drew me in and I became steadily more curious, A suprisingly deep ammount of lore gradually became available. You also gradually learn your own story as you play.  Most things in this game are reaaly well implemented in an organic and natural way. \n\nThe stealth mechanics:  Very nice, tight implementation of stealth.  Not too tense as to detract from interest in the surroundings and environment and not too lax or simple as too be boring.  For me, being not a fan of stealth games, it was a very nice balence.  Hiding, throwing, sneaking, stamina management, moving objects, tools and different outfits that actually effect interactions and gameplay.  Very fun:).\n\nGhost of a Tail is not without flaws.  There was a cave ceiling with unfinished textures and a few obscure areas where I fell through the geometry, but there were very few of these and all of them were in obscure and out of the way areas-usually because I climbed way outside the world perameters.  \n\nI would highly recommend this game for those that can slow down a little and play it for its immersive story, fun stealth and beautiful world.  It is not a fast-paced game with immediate gratifacation.  It will take some patience and investment, but it will be worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1542659925, "timestamp_updated": 1542659925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706861436367034912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45894427": {"recommendationid": "45894427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026325991", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1102, "last_played": 1521612748}, "language": "english", "review": "The trailer doesn't do this game justice.

I've completed it twice now (and nearly a third time) and each time the amount of effort that SeithCG have put in to this world never ceased to amaze me. The storyline is phenomenal, the art is just gorgeous, and the team behind the game are amazingly dedicated.\n\nWhen I first bought this game, I'd seen a couple of videos about the early game, before you even reach the catacombs, so I thought I knew what to expect. I could not have been more wrong. The storyline and the lore in this game are so in-depth that I'm even writing my own stories in this world (I'm a huge fan of D&D, so I'm using this world in my adventures!) and speculating wildly about Tilo's future. The fact that the game blends the different stories of Tilo's acquaintances is amazing, with all of them interacting with each other (I will never forget the satisfaction I felt after getting payback on the Master!), and the combination of it all creates a wonderful game.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews talking about the bugs and I have to agree that they exist, but in my experience of the game the team behind the game are incredibly quick to resolve them. Only last week they released two patched on subsequent days, after the first created five new bugs. The fact that the team can fix brand new bugs just a day after their appearance gives me the impression of a dedicated team that really care about the quality of their production.\n\nThe only downside for me was the ending. I didn't really like how the story suddenly changes tack on the shore, or how the fight is on such a short timer that it is almost impossible to beat easily.

It has a charming look and feel, and well designed characters and stories. Very much care was put in the artwork, animations and music. \nMost characters are very relatable, and the game manages to make you actually care for them.\nThe quests flow naturally from the wants and needs of the characters, even if it sometimes takes a while for them to reveal those.

I was a big Redwall fan back in middle school and this setting is clearly inspired by it. First off, not only are the visuals gorgeous, but the music is great as well. My favorite aspect though by far is the characters and dialogue, let me tell you, they are just an absolute treat to read through. The little character portrait artwork perfectly encaptures the kind of personality of the character you're talking to, and most characters have their own theme music as well which just adds to the atmosphere. Another aspect this game handles seamlessly is the lore. You can tell this was carefully thought through and there's a whole world and history out there that you don't know about. The lore catches your attention, and I found myself reading all the optional footnotes that explain certain phrases as they fit in the lore, which is a feat in of itself, as I usually skip through any optional dialogue in games. I'd even go as far as to say it's very akin to the Tolkien universe insofar as it's so well put together that it creates a believable world despite the absurdity of it. \n\nAs for gameplay, it controls well enough for what it is. There's little to no combat, and the game is very stealth heavy. Some people do not like the fact that the quests are vague, and there are no quest markers or minimaps or fast travel, honestly, for me, it's a breath of fresh air. We as modern gamers are so used to following quest markers and icons that when a game actually forces us to think and remember where that room was, or where that NPC was, or to follow dialogue directions instead of on screen arrows, it throws us off, but when you actually take a second to think, it's really not that hard. It's definately old school in that sense, although it's not near as hard as games back then, but I digress. \n\nAll in all, I can't wait to finish this game.

The ultimate fantasy mouse sneaking and eating simulator RPG. The UFMSESRPG, if you will.\n\nIt's a little rough on the technical and performance side, but if you can stomach that, this is an engaging and beautiful little adventure, with very strong worldbuilding, attention to detail and a gentle yet haunting atmosphere.\n\nWhat starts as a heavily stealth focused prison escape, avoiding guards, sneaking into different parts of a fortress, snagging keys and food, quickly expands into a broader game of disguises, exploration, conversations and puzzle solving. \n\nMuch like the gameplay, the story quickly expands and unfolds, adding weight, detail, meaning, purpose. The characters reveal new sides of themselves, colouring their actions, explaining their motivations. Their dreams, their fears, their regrets and painful memories. Their mistakes. It's all surprisingly powerful stuff and you grow to love them all a little bit. It makes you wanna see Tilo find his path just a little bit more.\n\nThe game world is relatively small, but there is a Souls like feel to the lack of handholding, as you venture further and further down winding corridors, stairwells, basements, rooftops, caves and forests and catacombs, the pathways and passages crisscrossing and looping back into each other and opening up new shortcuts and secrets, as you keep returning to previously visited areas. If you absolutely hate backtracking, consider this a fair warning.\n\nThere's a host of great characters to interact and help or avoid, and the whole thing is just incredibly charming and engaging in every way. There's even a tiny bit of choice on what to say and who to help. It's nothing major, but it adds a little bit of extra on top of an already engaging narrative.\n\nNow, there ARE technical issues and little bugs you might come across. This is a GOOD looking game, but playing it a little longer, you can tell the team is small. So just keep that in mind if that kind of stuff REALLY bothers you. \n\nThe enemy AI isn't particularly smart, making the stealth a lot easier than it initially seemed (thought there is an achievement for completing the game without guards spotting you, and that will take discipline). The puzzles can be obtuse and will leave some wandering aimlessly not know what to do or where, but there, again, is a Souls like appeal to it: the game trusting you to search and explore for yourself, making the discovery of a new key or an item or a piece of clothing or a bit of narrative so much more rewarding. And should you get stuck, there are NPCs that will point you in the right direction should you need it.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is a compelling glimpse into a fantasy world I deeply want to see more of. The animal characters are all endearing, brought to life with lovely portrait art and animation, and written with great care and wit. The crooked architecture and gorgeous skyboxes are dreamlike and perfectly fitting of the tone of the world. The combination of exploration, sneaky theft, puzzle solving and no outright combat proved completely irresistible for me and I loved all 20 hours of it. Here's hoping there will be another chapter in Tilo's tale as this is a wonderful opening act.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1537651768, "timestamp_updated": 1537714882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44869509": {"recommendationid": "44869509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043909689", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1977, "last_played": 1678465760}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic dialogue, charming characters and environments, beautiful graphics (especially for a one man team!).

VR Review. Spoiler-free Review. [/h1]\n\n[i] Note for VR: this game does [u]not[/u] run natively in VR but can with a downloadable mod. You also need to download a prior version of the game. I will include a step by step at the end of my review. [/i]\n\nBefore I mention anything else, this is one of the best story focused, quest-driven, single player games I have played in VR. It's not as good as Hellblade: Senua's sacrifice, but it's up there, just one notch below. The game took me about 24 hours to complete the main story and some side quests. I did not complete every side quest although I did attempt nearly all of them to some degree. I did try to complete the game without looking online for answers, but did have to do just that for some quests after being stuck for a bit.\n\nI developed red marks on my forehead from having my HMD on my face for many hours at a time (they're gone now). This game will test your VR limits because you'll want to finish the game, but it is a daunting task in VR. You'll need to take breaks while at the same time, not let too much time pass by before you forget where stuff is. This is a small world when you think about it, but it seems big, maybe even bigger in VR. It kind of feels like Dark Souls 1, because as you go you'll encounter shortcuts traversing the world, a secret passage that you didn't know was there. \n\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning. When your mouse (Tilo) gets a new costume, there's just a cuteness overload. So you'll definitely want to get those, but of course, the pieces are hidden and strewn all around the game world. The environments look great. This mod really shows how detailed the world is and how much love these devs put in making this game world. Lots of little details that you'll probably miss playing this game 2D. About the only things that didn't look great was some of the textures on the harbour/ shore, low light areas, and the bees. Each area looks different and it's just amazing to discover it in VR.\n\nDespite the amazing VR experience, there's lots of flaws with this mod. So it's not for everyone. You'll have to put up with lots of bad things to enjoy the good. Probably the most annoying thing is that the Control C, Control V, F5 doesn't always work and you'll have to try several times (don't worry if you don't know what that means, you will know). You also can't see your aiming reticles so you'll be firing blind most of the time. Luckily, you can still hit most things with just a little practice without any proper aiming. \n\nWhenever you hide, which you'll be doing often, for whatever reason these comfort options turn on that create blind spots. Those will be annoying but you'll learn to live with them as there's not much you can do about it. Unfortunately, they sometimes stay on your VR headset display even after you've left the hiding spot. You may want to try Control C, Control V, and F5, but it doesn't always fix it. You may just want to scoot your head closer to your sensors or farther away. Just moving your head around will fix the issue although it may be uncomfortable. \n\nIf you move your head around, you can get into situations where the game tells you you're out of bounds. That's annoying as you'll have to move your head until you land back within playing bounds. You can also clip through objects and see far off into the map. Depending on your video card, you will get low frame rates per second. Mine got as low as 22, especially in the harbour area and the end fight. Usually, I ran at 45 frames per second. When the game hits low frame rates, your walking speed will feel it and it's painful to play for that reason although it's actually not painful to watch like it does in other games with faster movement.\n\nThe last negative is that you're playing an older version of the game, so you'll have to deal with some bugs. The biggest one for me was that certain stuff wouldn't show on my map like the location of things even after paying off the smith. Don't worry if you don't know what that means, you will. I did also have a missing object, but simply completely exiting the game and restarting did the trick.\n\nVR Rating 7.5/10. Amazing mod overall. I wish SeithCG would make this game native VR. This mod shows how amazing the VR experience would be in this game. If you love VR, I recommend you take the steps below to experience this game in VR. If you're wondering, I rate on a bell curve, so a 7.5 is actually a very good score. I gave Hellblade an 8.5 if that gives you some frame of reference.\n\n[olist]\n[*]Buy the game. \n[*]Download the VRGIN mod 1.1 by Eusth on Github (google VR Ghost of a Tale for link). \n[*]Run Steam console (see YouTube videos if you don't know how).

There are less than twenty named characters and no voice-acting, but the npcs still have plenty of personality, which is conveyed in their dialogue, and the changing little portraits that accompany it. \nIn the age of empty sandboxes and games that apparently think their players are stupid, it is incredibly refreshing to have to actually search for items and solutions yourself, even if that occasionally means googling an answer in frustration.\nThe visuals are gorgeous. While not exactly high-end, the art-style is really what makes the game special. The scenery is amazing, and the character-models are sometimes adorable, sometimes hilarious, and always spot-on. \nThis game also has surprisingly deep lore, a lot of which is very slowly revealed throughout the game, but not nearly everything, which leaves a lot of room for further installments, which I truly hope will happen.

He's awesome.\n However I did find a game breaking bug where I stopped animating, unable to do anything, reloading my saves did nothing, right in the midst of playing.

It was being developed for like 5 years but the news never reached me at all, then suddenly Steam recommended it for me and I decided to buy it. \nIt's not a very long game - unless you get lost all the time, your first playthrough shouldn't take more than 10 hours.\nFor some reason, all the reviews and descriptions call it an action-RPG, which is balderdash. It's a stealth game with some RPG elements (levelling up your health/stamina, getting some new gear -which acts primarily as disguise- and learning some more or less useful skills).\n\nNow as far as gameplay mechanics go, it's not too shabby but nothing special either. You sneak, lurk in shadows or hide in barrels/chests, distract or temporarily knock out your enemies (you're no murderer, alright?) and fetch stuff. Where the game really shines is its story, characters and lore. \n\nThe game world - Dwindling Heights Keep, where the entire game takes place - seems intimidating at first and you will get lost a lot, but will soon find out that it isn't THAT large and soon enough you will see yourself doing plenty of backtracking to get new items, unlock previously locked areas and discover shortcuts. By the end of the game, the place will surely grow on you as you memorize every single room and corridor. It has its charm and for a lack of better comparison, it reminds me of the mansion in the first Resident Evil game - a place where everything is hostile to you, and yet it starts to feel like home. Same stuff right here. Even your enemies (whom you can eventually trick to think that you're one of them, and thus, talk to you) will start to feel like your buddies, too.\n\nAs far as quests are concerned, they're not very inspired, generally you have to steal/fetch/find something and that's it. There's one quest where you're serving tables in a mess hall so that's pretty unique, I think. What matters the most about the quests is all the story and dialogue behind them.\n\nAnd as far as those things go, it's pretty great. The characters are all unique and interesting in their own ways, some have much more to them than it may appear at first (Silas and Fatale being the prime examples), the dialogue itself is very pleasant to follow, thanks to simple yet satisfying writing style - no excessive dramatism and purple prose, which are all too common in modern games, the lines feel organic and natural, with even some jokes mixed in. \n\nThe lore about which you can learn from dialogue and in-game codex is pretty creative and fun to read about, with more focus on relations beetwen the races, customs and traditions, rather than stuff like wars, heroes and villains. Really gave me the feeling that there's a living world somewhere out there and the urge to get to know it better (even though I'm not generally fond of Redwall-esque animal kingdom stuff)\n\nIt's not without flaws, though. Like I said, the gameplay mechanics are nothing to write home about. Your adversaries are so dumb sometimes you just wonder if they have to be told to inhale and exhale or else they will forget to breathe (the game does tell you that they're mostly the biggest losers out there, story-wise). Almost feels like an old Tenchu game. Searching the barrel in an otherwise empty room to which you've fled is above their pay, it seems. Overall, once you get the grasp on controls, enemies become more of a nuisance than an actual threat, with a few exceptions.\nAlso,  the game was mostly created by one guy, which shows at times. While the graphics, sound, attention to detail and level design are all top notch, sometimes the game falls short, particularly when it comes to bigger story events (enemies bugging out when fighting each other, NPCs not reacting properly to recent events etc.).\n\nAnother issue is the lack of replayability. One thorough playthrough is enough to get almost everything out of the game.\nI managed to get all but one achievement (which I believe is bugged) in my first (and for now, only) playthrough so you definitely won't come back for extra challenges or anything like that. You may play again so that more early-game stuff makes sense because you now fully understand the story, but other than that it's a game that you won't play more ofter than once every few years or so.\n\nAs for the bugs and technical stuff...I did encounter one game-breaking bug but it was taken care of recently and the support did fix my savefile. Other than that, nothing major. The game also runs smoothly in 60 FPS all the time.\nThe game definitely shows a lot of promise and I'm sure we could expect a lot from potential sequel/DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1533775623, "timestamp_updated": 1533775623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708700954914093018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44004457": {"recommendationid": "44004457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335501062", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1424, "last_played": 1533746494}, "language": "english", "review": "Cutest game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1533747628, "timestamp_updated": 1533747628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483769893646240234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43988021": {"recommendationid": "43988021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960291325", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 1380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1533669280}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El fuerte de este juego es su gran historia, f\u00e1cil de entender y muy entra\u00f1able.

The art style and visuals are gorgeous, and the still frame drawings during dialog are expressive and unique. Core gameplay is 10/10, all the ingame items are not fluff, and are all very useful when used appropriately. \n\nCons: You have to want to invest a lot of time figuring out all the maps, and the perks you get from certain items (*1). Once you've done that, a second play through will be MUCH more enjoyable. Some minor glitches (*2). Level design is very confusing, but I feel as though that was on purpose. I often find myself running around for a long while trying to remember how I got to one specific place just to give up and google it, along with 90% of all ingame items and locations (*3). That does encourage exploration though, however, doing so is not really possible without certain gear that you acquire later on, which can be very frustrating not being able to, nor know how to complete a mission. Missions are very non-specific in how to go about or solve them, even the main story line. A LOT of guess work is needed, or looking it up. While this harkens a mindset back to how Morrowind was played, they give you even less to go on here, which most times is hella confusing, and down right frustrating. More specific information for certain items and story lines would be outstanding. If you fail to complete some certain side quests by a certain point in the game, that's it. You're done. You'll have to restart a new game to complete it and get the achievement. While it IS only a 20ish hour game, a second playthrough only attempting to get those quests completed isn't sooooo bad. \n\n*1: Items, for the most part, besides health regen, do not indicate their uses. Such as, when you collect a full outfit, the game does not let you know the perks of wearing the outfit, which for some, are NEEDED to finish a quest. While some are slightly obvious, like wearing the pirate costume when speaking to the pirate to further along a story line, or wearing the thiefs outfit to further along a story line, there are other perks that you gain while wearing the full outfit that the game doesn't even hint at, such as when wearing the Ranger outfit the guards wont attack you. Things like that would be SUPER useful to know as you need certain outfits to get to certain areas. Some hints about items and outfits will go a LONG way.\n\n*2: Minor glitches. There will be a few times when a dialog box will not appear, or a wall is in the middle of a passage way that wasn't there before. A simple save and reload at the closest save point 9/10 times alleviates this issue. SAVE. OFTEN. Every chance you get. If you've gone 100ft from your previous save point, SAVE. AGAIN.\n\n*3: There are in game maps which show mission specific items and locations, but the maps are useless sans for which direction to go in (North, South, East or West). They do indicate whether the item or location is above or below you, but the maps are so poorly done that you will never be able to figure out how to get to that location using the map. Nor do they indicate which part of the level, above or below you, that the map is drawn. For instance, they show a hallway that only exists on the 3rd floor, you can't see what is on the second or first floors (other rooms, other hallways, stairwells etc). This, combined with the confusing level design gave me the most headache when trying to complete side quests. The poor map design does not guide you to locations you KNOW are possible to get to, but can't figure out. The ability to leave marks or something like that on the map would be super useful. \n\nOther: 20 hours in, beat the game with only half the achievements unlocked. And only JUST started to barely memorize the first 2 playable areas. A Second Playthrough is needed to get a full grasp of the game. I feel as though the Devs know this cause the option to Start A New Game is right there during the pause screen. \n\nAll in all, it is a VERY well done game visually, aesthetically, and replayability. All the characters are unique and charismatic, and the art style and drawings are superb, which is nice considering the only time you ever interact with any of the characters is through a dialog box. Once you figure out what all the items and outfits are for the game becomes way less frustrating. But with that in mind, Id give it a 7/10 for some minor glitches and the headache of trying to figure the maps and what most of the items are for. It is a finite game, with definite story beginning and end marks that you may miss if you progress the wrong story line too quickly over the others. But again, a second play through should be much more enjoyable once you know what you're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1532327668, "timestamp_updated": 1532327668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600416481494903564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43688940": {"recommendationid": "43688940", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961558957", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1555456601}, "language": "english", "review": "Where can I go to donate to the sequel?\n\nI am currently writing this while whining tears from my eyes.\n\nOnly one other game has ever made me bawl like this. The incredible story partnered with such precise and intuitive controls is beyond all comparison. Frankly, this is now is my number 1 all time favorite game ever.\n\nEvery square inch of this game, every nook and cranny is full of detail and makes it impossible not to become immersed in the story that is being so skillfully told. Things were being introduced that seemed to be nothing at all, and slowly developed so well that when I experienced the exact same thing later in the game I would become choked up. For example, the songs in the game, while you can read them, and listen to them near the beginning, mean nearly nothing more than something silly or fun, but as the story progresses, and you are introduced to more lore, or meet certain people, these songs suddenly have meaning.\n\nThere were event sin the game that came up that I was genuinely heart broken, even scared and was afraid to continue forward, spending over an hour to prevent something from happening. I made nearly no progress during this hour, but I was desperate to find a way, to prevent what would be.

Being a gamer since 1987 when I got my first taste of videogames, Ghost of a Tale is one of those games that restore my faith in the gaming industry. It revives that passion that I felt long ago in the NES/SNES/N64/PS1/PS2 era. You know, back when developers made games out of love and passion for them. You somehow think that is all fading with huge AAA developers and publishers taking the \"Business\" approach as their priority, but as long as there are still small and passionate indie developers, the industry will never lose its soul.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a beautiful thing! A very rich and engaging story that it is given to you in a very oldschool style. No voice acting, just a lot of very interesting lore to be picked up as you explore or speak with NPC's. It feels like the old Zeldas or Okami. The way the whole game works screams the old N64 golden age of open-world fantasy adventures. It is not a difficult game, but it does not hold your hand either. No markers, compass or nothing. You get you clues and hints by listening, reading carefully and learning the map the old fashioned way.\n\nNow, it might be oldschool in how it works, but visually, this game is a modern as it gets. Graphics are gorgeous, characters designs are rich and realistic, with very charismatic \"toony\" depictions in dialoge boxes. As an artist myself I got to give props to the master mind who drew the \"toony\" versions of the characters. They look straight out of a classic Disney movie.\n\nWhat struck me the most is the light/shadow effects. I have honestly not seen a game THIS good looking. It will make you stop what your doing and just hand around the forest or courtyard to admire the beauty around you.\n\nAudio is phenomenal. Appart from the sound effects, it is the music what really holds on to you since the very first moment you start the game. This game needs an OST release ASAP!\n\nConstrols are fine. Take a bit used to and you might get stuck here and there regarding how items and inventory are handled.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it is a lot of fun. It's mostly exploring, item hunting, stealth and such. Enemy NPC's aren't really that hard though. this is not Metal Gear. You eventually learn that A) They can't run and B) they have masive blindspots. So after a while, it is just an annoyance rathen than a difficulty or a challenge  having to walk around them. On the bright side, there is a point through the game were you can interact them, and they all have pretty funny things to say.\n\nThis game also runs amazingly smooth for the most part. It has its hiccups here and there, as well as a bug that defaults to 30FPS everytime you run the game, despite you have 120FPS selected. Checking another FPS setting and back to 120fps fixes it. Other than that, I noticed slight hitches in some areas, which I attribute to the game loading the environment. definitely not game-breaking or distracting. For the most part, I got 120FPS solid at max settings and 1440p (I can only imagine how amazing it would look in 4K), which is more than I can say from many games that are all over the place.\n\nAnother complain is that this game is a bit too short. Took me 11 hours with about 80% of everything done (17 total of playing around with graphic settings, test runs, starting all over a couple of times). But then again, this is the kind of game that you don't play once. You go through the learning and getting used to process the first time, and then enjoy it at its fullest the second time.\n\nIt's hard to recommend a game since most youngsters might not find it appealing.

The story is endearing, the graphics are very pretty and the no kill stealth mechanics/quests are refreshing. If you liked the trailer you should really like the game as it's a fair representation though it doesn't convey how good the story is or the other NPCs. I suspect the creator was a fan of Redwall.\n\nI have been waiting for years for a fully made RPG like this where the character doesn't ultimatly just resort to hack and slash to get things done. I'm not at all against violance in games, but it does get boring when so few RPGs consider a character that doesn't become a murderer. This mouse is a stealthy bard, not a fighter.\nThe quests are fun, even the go find X number of Y are actually enjoyable because story wise it makes sense and the numbers are low enough that it doesn't feel like a grindy chore. One of which rewards you with revealing the mouse's story which is surprisingly touching.\nThere are a satisfying amount of areas and they do a good job of making them all initially feel larger than they are.\nI liked all the NPCs and enjoyed their dialogues the fact its not voice acted didn't bother me infact I think I prefered it as I could imagine them how I liked. If I have to gripe it would be that the dialogue boxes dont give you a clue as to wether your speach options are repeatable or one time only. Sometimes you pick one and the other option is still availabe after, othertimes it's not...\nAll areas of a map (and some not on the map) are eventually accesable except one very small bit. I lost my mind trying to get into that section before accepting that other players comments on it's inaccesability weren't outdated.

You unlock new areas but still often come back to old areas, so you get plenty of chances to find everything (though i did look up some item locations online to save some time searching).\n\nA lot of the interactions with other characters are really fun, and the writing is excellent.

I just beat it earlier this morning and I have to say, this game was just what I needed. I loved it! With that said, I don't really write a lot of these reviews and am hardly an interesting writer, but I'm going to try to keep things legible and avoid spoilers.\n\n[u]What I liked[/u]\nThe visuals and music are perfect for what they need to be. If you grew up reading Brian Jacques' Redwall books, you will feel  pretty at home with the aesthetic that they're trying to achieve here. Regardless of whether or not you are familiar with them, the most basic idea is that you play as a little mouse minstrel escaping from a jail controlled by rats, while also trying to find the whereabouts of your missing wife.\nAs little Tilo, you face the challenges of being smaller and weaker than most everything in the world and deal with it through cunning and a good deal of stealthing. The world lore is great and you see it reflected very well in the characters you interact with, and all the places you visit feel genuine and put down with a good bit of lore or story relevance. How willing you look into the lore is still up to the player, through clues in books or notes you find, or through the songs you play as a minstrel, which feels much less invasive than other games which rely on random audio logs or unrealistically written journals (like the ones that literally write in a change in the state of mind of someone turning into a zombie).\nIt should also be noted that a lot of the character interaction in this game is fun and well-written, as the characters you meet go through their own respective arcs, I felt myself growing a genuine attachment to them with a few good laughs and surprises throughout.\nThis game excels in being a place where you just want to go around; ranging from places like gorgeous forest settings as a backdrop to grand architectural spectacles of ages past, to the dark and ominous ruins of the underground. Everywhere you go has a little bit of grand mystery to it, and accidently wandering into a new place has all the raw feelings of awe and caution to them. The graphics do well in making this happen, with lighting and shadows being a major component, additionally making light a precious resource especially at night time.\n\n[u]What I didn't like[/u]\nWIth how much I liked about this game it's only fair I also bring out things that it fell just a little short on. The stealth mechanic sometimes can throw you out of the experience just as much as it does put you in it. There are a lot of moments where you don't feel like you should be seen but end up getting noticed, just as much as there are times where you don't get noticed when you feel like you should be, which I feel is due in part to how stealth itself works in the game. Sound and line of sight are both triggers that fill up a gauge that indicates whether or not a guard has spotted you or not, so the stealth becomes more or less a game of 'how much am I willing to push the limit to get to where I need to go' and less about effectively using cover or a clever use of items. The escape mechanic is also relatively simple in that you just have to 1) lose line of sight of your pursuer and 2) get into a hiding spot, and successfully making it into these hiding spots immediately makes your pursuer lose interest, which at times makes you wonder how that worked or if the guard was just [i]that[/i] dumb or lazy.\nAdditionally, the 3rd person camera does tend to stick hard onto Tilo and doesn't exactly accomodate chase sequences well in that a lot of times you can run into a wall or dark corner and just immediately be confused, fighting the camera along with your pursuers. While it can be said that because it's a stealth game and your [i]goal[/i] is to avoid getting caught, it won't necessarily be easy, and will likely happen at least a few times in your first phases of the game where you're trying to get your footing.\nGames nowadays do rely on a lot collectible and/or fetch quest objectives to kind of extend their game, requiring a lot of back and forth between locations; though while exploring the settings in this game is a wonder, this game is no exception to that trope. It does have the benefit of opening interesting secret passages and shortcuts to people willing to look (some are outright just spelled out for you), yet this only makes this job feel less tedious, but not painless. Ghost of a Tale also has a few quests that can be initiated but not completed until you progress well enough into the story, so just keep that in mind if having hanging quests bothers you as a completionist.\nThe many fetch quest objectives even conflicts with the awesome character interaction as some conversations do end up with a job for you to do, but it wasn't enough to make me outright hate any of the characters.\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\nTo conclude, this game was a wonderful and decently paced adventure that I would be willing to come back to. It delivers a fun, fantastical story that I would love to see future installments of, be it books or visual novels, or even future games like this.  It's an awesome work that I feel is a wonderful vision into the creator's imagination that, despite some of its gameplay flaws, I just can't help but want to see more of. And without much more to say without spoiling anything, I'd like to rate this game a solid [u]4/5.[/u]", "timestamp_created": 1531559072, "timestamp_updated": 1531559250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43516358": {"recommendationid": "43516358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069539700", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1323, "last_played": 1531442730}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a type of adventure game that is sorely needed today.

The level design and graphics are fantastic. The setting and lore is fresh. Moreover it is a (mostly) violent-free game but still challenging.\n\nYou play as Tilo, who has been seperated from his wife and finds himself caught up in jail. Escaping the jail is just the start to a 15-20h adventure through a medieval fantasy world, which is mostly ruled by hostile rats in armor.\nAs a much weaker mouse, you have no chance fight the rat guards, but sneak pass them. Later on you get the chance to disguise yourself as a rat guard, giving you more freedom and let's you concentrate on the many quests.\n\nThe game is designed as a (relatively small) open world. But the effort that has been put into the very detailed and believable areas easily compensates the size. Transitions are fluently and you will dicover new areas step by step. Fast traveling is not available so you have to backtrack a lot. Luckily you'll find many short cuts while you advance in your explorations. The level desing features a significant \"verticality\", meaning the areas are not just placed next to each other but also stacked onto each other.\n\nWhile the game features a helpful quest journal, it doesn't hold your hand by pointing you to the next location to solve the next sub step of your quests. Attention has to be paid during conversations, but usually the quest log will remind you of the most important facts.\n\nThe inventory is kept relatively simple with different areas for things like food (to regain health), documents and clothes. While clothes also have an impact on your stats like swiftness, protection etc. they play an important role during several quest, as you have to disguise yourself as someone else.\n\nDuring my playthrough I didn't encounter any significant issues or even progress blocking bugs. All in all it performed very well.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game. I often found it difficult to let go and do something outside this beautifully created world with its fresh perspective.\nBacktracking and searching for the next steps to do was sometimes a bit tedious, but reminded me of the \"good old games\".\nLet's hope for a sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1531513444, "timestamp_updated": 1531513618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43510079": {"recommendationid": "43510079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074676678", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 931, "last_played": 1610127610}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is awesome", "timestamp_created": 1531510799, "timestamp_updated": 1531510799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43486325": {"recommendationid": "43486325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163997001", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1022, "last_played": 1561331066}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely lovely game, with interesting story and beautiful design.

I can't tell you that Ghost of a Tale is \"the\" game of the year, but I also can't say it's bad. It's something in-between that ^^ \nIt started a bit unpolished. To give my best Review here are some SPOILER ALERTS in case I spoiler some things by mistake :3\n\nAt the beginning of the game, I have to admit, that I was a bit disappointed, because the game isn't voice acted (I have to admit too, that I overlooked that in the description on the Shop-page =D) For my taste it all is a bit to quiet, the music is beautiful, but is a bit low in my opinion, but that's just me, I can't speak for anyone else. \nAnother negative point for me is, that there isn't a mini-map! I have a very very very bad sense of direction, it's totally okay that you have to buy a full map of the location or find it in there, but at least descriptions on this maps or as I said a mini-map would have helped sooooooooo much! It took me YEARS to find the commissary .... because I just didn't saw this stupid door everytime I walked around there...... And to be honest I don't count this candlething with the maps as a description, because this didn't helped me at all xD \n\n\nI have to say, that here and there were a few bugs. As an example the slime jar stack in Faustus chamber in the sewers, it's gleaming red if you use the red mist but you can't pick it up... and believe me I tried! Now and then the game was a bit choppy, especially when I walked through the northern slopes to the shore. AND in the catacombs in the room with the platforms, I couldn't die there. You might say that's cool, but it isn't if you walk around on the deep black ground and can't find a way up and have to reload^^' Also I couldn't burn every Banner of the Red Paw. There were two that refused to get burned even as every rat guard was unconscious. It told me I was watched and it would be to dangerous to burn it now. This was with one banner at the harbor and one in the soldiers barracks. Because of this bug I couldn't get the steam trophy for burning every burnable Item in the Keep.\nMaybe this is a bug too I don't know, but at the end of the game one costume wouldn't be recognised. It said I had 6/7 but there weren't any more parts to find. I had all of the King, the Thief, the Ranger, the Pirate, the Guard, the Gilded Armour and of course the Minstrel. I had also all of the other clothingparts: the Clothespin, the Pumpkinhead, 3 sackcloth Hoods, the Candle Hat, the plague doctor Hat and the plague doctor Mask.... Don't know what I should've missed, but okay....\n\nFrom time to time the game was a bit boring or long-winded, because it took so long to get from one point to another even with the few shortcuts that where given, but as I wrote above: A mini-map would have helped so much Dx \n\n\nBut besides this, this Game is pretty cute, and the grafics are amazing. The story is wonderful and develops from quest to quest and gets more complex. The beginning was a bit clunky, but it got better and better. For me the climax was just before the end, so not really satisfying.

It's an extremely charming game with gorgeous environments some beautiful worldbuilding and an engaging story.  Seriously one of the prettier PC games I've played in 2018 despite being an indie project.  You can tell the dev put a lot of heart into the universe they were crafting and I appreciate the pop-out terms glossary which made it simple to read more on a topic if you care to (I always cared to).  The characters you engage with are fun and well written.  I particularly loved Fatale.  I enjoyed the stealth gameplay and Tilo's movements and actions all felt snappy and natural.  \n\nDespite all these immediate positive comments about this game that spring to mind there are a few negatives that cloud my time with it.  The quests you receive can be a little nebulous, and occasionally the suggestions in the log may not do enough to nudge you in the direction you're looking for.  This seems to be a concious decision and something that most players can work through but it's something to bear in mind.\n\nI do not dig the game's stamina system.  There's no fast travel, and I can deal with this in a game if I can move quickly throughout the game world.  That's not the case here.  By the end of the game you're frequently having to cross multiple zones to do quest turn ins and even with outfits set up for optimized stamina regen (and upgraded stamina training) I still felt like I was frequently having to stop wait for Tilo's stamina bar to regen so I could sprint off again.\n\nWhat does more grievous harm to the game, I feel, is the final encounter.  At the culmination of a game whose strengths involve music, conversation, subterfuge and thievery is a mission that deals with none of these. Instead, it involves a combat encounter where you are moving slow heavy explosive objects while enemies that are quicker than you chase you down to swat you and detonate them all while you're working on a time limit.  Meanwhile the AI that is ostensibly there to assist you and run interference does anything but that. It is an incredibly frustrating finale which, at this time, has prevented me from seeing the game through to completion and likely is going to result in my resorting to YouTube to see how the story ends as I no longer have the patience to do it again.  It really doesn't help that there is no autosave at the point of no return and the game forces you to run back from the nearest spawn point half a zone away.  \n\nThe finale mission is an unfortunate dark spot because of the 14 hours I played of this game I enjoyed 13 of them immensely.", "timestamp_created": 1531207648, "timestamp_updated": 1531207648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43421450": {"recommendationid": "43421450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062604079", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1578, "last_played": 1531137618}, "language": "english", "review": "Crafted by people who love their work", "timestamp_created": 1531137693, "timestamp_updated": 1531137693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43414469": {"recommendationid": "43414469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285354111", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2387, "last_played": 1561860530}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of thoughtful details, lore, and amusing dialogue.

I'd rather have fun completing a less taxing scenario than to have something complex yet devoid of fun so it feels more like a job.\n\nWhen got finished the game I actually experienced sadness that I wouldn't be exploring the halls or surrounding landscapes of Dwindling Heights anymore, but I had a few achievements I didn't nail perfectly so I'll be going back again.\n\nCan't wait for a sequel I will pledge on any sourcing platform and encourage others to do so as well. \n", "timestamp_created": 1530925139, "timestamp_updated": 1530925139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43352772": {"recommendationid": "43352772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976229736", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1412, "last_played": 1530887879}, "language": "english", "review": "simply brilliant... beautiful world and great story", "timestamp_created": 1530888204, "timestamp_updated": 1530888204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43350273": {"recommendationid": "43350273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012512061", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1123, "last_played": 1634856554}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm rarely compelled to write a review, but this game is an inspiration. To put it short: 'Ghost of a Tale' is a masterpiece. Go ahead and buy it. Tell your friends to buy it too. More thoughts:\n\nHideaki Itsuno recently said that the art style of his upcoming game was meant to convey \"Quality at a Glance\", meaning one screenshot or clip would be enough to convince that the game is a cut above the rest and worth your time and money. That idea, Quality at a Glance, is what came to mind when I saw a screenshot of \"Ghost of a Tale\" while browsing Steam---from one screenshot I could tell that it was set apart from anything else on the market in terms of presentation. It looks like the kind of game I expected to be playing when I bought a high-end PC, the stuff of dreams. I bought it immediately and was not let down! Having played for a dozen hours or so, here's some highlights:\n\n-Texture detail is insane\n-Crazy foliage density (with dynamics!) and, from my experience, zero pop-in on default settings.\n-The most effective use of Sub-Surface Scattering in any videogame, ever.\n-BEST FUR IN THE BIZ\n-Incredible dynamic lighting effects and probably the most impressive day-night cycle in a game to date.\n-Animation quality that would make even most AAA studios blush.\n-Physics effects are so fluid and consistent that I'm now wondering if they were all animated by hand...\n\nOverall this is one of (if not THE) most beautiful looking games I've ever played and would recommend it on that pillar alone, and on top of that the SSS-tier quality of writing, charming and memorable characters, labyrinthine world design (I hate to make Dark Souls comparisons, but...), and light platforming gameplay with a very satisfying gamefeel puts Ghost of a Tale in GOAT territory. A lot of games these days feel fleeting and consumable, but I will remember 'Ghost of a Tale' forever.\n\nIf you showed me a screenshot of this game I would have assumed it was some AAA Sony project or the like, so finding out that it was made in Unity by a very small team (Only one full-time developer, if I'm not mistaken...) was a real shock! It's a real inspiration to me as a dev and proves that indie games don't have to look like a lazy mess of flat polygons: that through enough dedication and skill anything is possible.\n\nGood job Seith, and thank you for all the good times I've had with your game. You are an absolute BEAST of a game dev and I will be sure to follow your work going forward.

Reminder; no fast travel.\n- Action/interaction scenes are exclusively described in text rather than shown in animation/cutscene, which based on the budget/team is understandable, albeit a little regrettable. This is of course arguable, as it is also quite charming.\n- While an incredibly enjoyable and entertaining experience overall, the ending, (no narrative spoilers,) leaves something to be desired.

I'd never even heard of it until I saw it on sale for 20% off, bought it on a whim, and spent the next 22 hours of my life enraptured by the incredible tale of Tilo.\n\nGhost of a Tale is a casual difficulty stealth game, very forgiving unless you're going for the (frankly crazy) \"don't alert any guards ever\" achievement.  Fortunately, you can save-scum the hell out of it if you're that kind of person - the game gives you ample opportunities to save, and the load times are lightning fast with an SSD.\n\nThe primary draw is the beautiful world-building, supremely written cast of characters, outstanding dialogue and possibly the most lovable protagonist in the history of media - Tilo, the mouse minstrel.  The game should not be dismissed as a children's tale, as you will find yourself going down some dark paths as Tilo unravels the story of the world, and the rodents around him.\n\nThere's a rudimentary leveling system in the game where you gain health and stamina as you go, but the real progression comes from the costumes you unlock, which allow you to move more freely in the world, or gets you access to things you couldn't reach before.  It is masterfully done, but I don't want to spoil too much.  On to the something else.\n\nThere's a bit of a thing going around in gaming reviews, has been for a few years.  You probably thought you'd be safe from it here.  You probably thought \"This is a game about a mouse minstrel.  Surely, nobody is going to make THAT comparison.\"\n\nBut here we are.  Dark Souls.\n\nNo, come back!  You aren't going to be dying every five seconds, restarting from bonfires or fighting giant monsters with your lute.  The way the lore is presented in-game is extremely reminiscent of the Souls series - through item descriptions, area design and a lovingly detailed, hand-crafted world that is now a hauntingly beautiful shadow of its former glory.  The game also is full of clever shortcuts between areas that would make Miyazaki proud.  Exploration is encouraged and rewarded.\n\nI ran into a couple of bugs that didn't take much away from the game for me.\n\n-At one point, I reloaded a save to find myself falling to my death, so I had to reload one from 3 minutes earlier.  There are a lot of save points.\n-There's a graphical glitch when getting into and out of hiding spots, or when the camera clips into too much terrain, that causes it to spaz out a bit.\n-There's a guy you can pay to help you solve puzzles or give you the location of certain items, which he will mark on your map.  In one case, there was no mark where the item was, which forced me to tab out and google it.\n\nSimply an outstanding game, well worth your time and money.", "timestamp_created": 1530803388, "timestamp_updated": 1530803606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43323232": {"recommendationid": "43323232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159552659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1530793979}, "language": "english", "review": "My husband git me this game to cheer me up, and it worked!

And where this story ends it feels like it's a world that still has so many tales to tell. \n\nGraphically, you can't really fault it, and it feels like it fits the world so perfectly. The main character in particular is well designed and animated, definitely one of the cutest protagonists out there. The world itself is also designed very well, with plenty of little secrets and shortcuts to unlock as you explore. \n\nThe game advertises itself as an action rpg, but it's more like a stealth adventure game, with mild combat in a few places along the way. It fits with being a mouse that you're not this overpowered warrior. There are a few skills you unlock that make it a bit more 'rpg-like', but nothing like a full blown rpg.\n\nThe missions are basically your usual series of fetch quests and busywork, but the story behind them is interesting enough, that it never feels like you're grinding to no end.  I also like that the game doesn't always spell out for you exactly what to do at every point. There's a character in game who can help you out for a fee, but it's very much a game you need to spend time exploring for yourself.\n\nThe only downside is that you will need to do a fair amount of reading, but that's more or less expected with a fantasy based adventure game.\n\nI was very interested in this game from when I heard about it and this is a rare case where what I wanted was what I got. I really hope that more people play this game and that in turn helps motivate a sequel or two, especially if the same level of attention to details is applied.

Also in the level architecture it looks up to Dark Souls and the way they connected their world, with lots of shortcuts, hidden areas and \"a-ha\" moments.\n\nBut it brings its own stuff to the table also. Unique lore in video games, a story that keeps you guessing, a set of characters that are intresting to talk to. Quests are in the tone of the game, very logical and nicely connected between each other. And fun also! \n\nGraphics are stunning, and the quality of animations is like looking at a Pixar cartoon. It lacks voice acting and its a bit rough around the edges when it comes to performance. Also, a must mention is that there is no fighting in this game (if you dont count knocking down enemies and 5 spider encounters).\n\nSo, if you are looking for some indepth skill system, dialouge branching, fighting system, different endings, crazy boss fights - then skip this title. BUT, if you want to taste a little bit of that \"old school\" magic dressed in a new suit, I say go for it. \n\nYou will get a really lovely title, created by the people who love video games from the bottom of their hearts.

You don't hear music all the time, but they just nailed it with how they did it.\n\nGameplay:\nthe overall feeling of control is perfect, the character reacts on spot when you give an imput (I played with controller), great platforming, a nice mix of stealth and non stealth gameplay that, at a certain point in the game, you can change on the spot to your liking in most zones (using a very ingenious and absolutely ADORABLE system), leaving you with three options of gameplay, stealth, a stealth \"light\" where you can get caught but don't get attacked but get other penalties, or an easy mode where you don' get attacked by a majority of the \"enemies\" at all, also with a penalty. The stealthmode is a bit basic, its simple line of sight and \"making noise\", but those mechanics are solid and work very well. The hiding mechanic is not light based but a more classic approach that got used in more classical stealth games, aka, hiding in and under furniture.\n\nQuests:\nThere is a plethora of quests you can do, that mostly are fetch quests. What sounds boring isn't at all though. Through questing you get access to a lot of fantastic lore and character backgrounds, one of the major things this game has going for it. The second thing is that these quests help you to learn your ways through the world you play in, and omg, what a world that is!\n\nGameworld:\nIt's not an open world game from the get go, although you don't have any loading screens between the different zones. To get through the world, you unlock certain doors by following the main quest. The world is full of shortcuts that you open along your way through the story, wich helps a lot, since you will revisite these places again and again on your journey through this game.\nThis doesn't get monotonous though. The different gamestyle approaches you can chose from to mix things up, the absolutely astonishing world design that is on par with Dark Souls 1, if not even better (yes, I just said that!), the gorgeous graphics and an overall \"right\" feel throughout the level design doesn't make you get bored but gives you a sense of \"beeing at home\". The whole worldmap is designed with love for details, nothing feels empty or out of space.\n\nStory:\nI mentioned it already, the story is very compelling, almost like a good book that you just can't put aside. You can sense that this whole universe is the baby of someone who put a lot of love into the lore, the small lore within the game and it characters, and the overall lore that you only scratch on through reading item descritions and dialogue. Behind all this lies a huge world with lots of details that leaves you longing for more, it doesn't help that the end of the game is somewhat open, not cliffhanger open, but \"I really want to know what will happen to all these interesting characters, that I got so attached to, now\" open. (Just in case the Dev reads this: You better start working on a sequel, or start writing some books, because if not, I can't guarantee you that I won't go all \"misery\" on you when I ever meet you in person!).\nDon't want to spoil anything, but there are some really unforseen turns and dramatic revelations happening, that literally had me going \"OH MAAAN; YOU DIDN'T!!!!\" in front of my monitor, thank god I was playing alone, though the cat look a bit weird at me... not the most proudest of moments in my life.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis is a gem of a game that everyone with a sense for exploring and good story should play.\nIt's price is more than justified, the overall quality of the game is great, and the mere fact that this is mostly the work of one person (with a bit help from others: GREAT JOB EVERYONE) is just mindboggling!\n\nIt does have it's flaws, yes, there are a cupple of bugs and glitches, I encountered 2 in the 17ish hours it took me to get through the game blind (could have been faster, but I was very torough and didn't want to miss anything), but both could be resolved by a simple reload and yes, you can get a bit lost on your search for items to finish quests, but if you read carefully that shouldn't be a problem, every quest tells you pretty much what to look out for, and in worst case there is an easy to access, in game help for the cost of just a few florins.\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is save often and on different slots, but thats pretty much RPG standard for the last 30+ years, so that should be no problem.\n\nTL;DR TL;DR\n\n1) BUY GAME!\n2) WHERE IS MY SEQUEL?!", "timestamp_created": 1530190103, "timestamp_updated": 1530190304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43114677": {"recommendationid": "43114677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037622659", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1063, "last_played": 1530094179}, "language": "english", "review": "Be a mouse\nBe a pirate mouse\nBe a knight mouse\nRun from rats. \nAdorable as heck.\nExtra strength pretty.\n\nA little short though.\n11/10\nShould buy", "timestamp_created": 1530145447, "timestamp_updated": 1530145447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43088904": {"recommendationid": "43088904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109525621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1205, "last_played": 1530073408}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished playing this game and I don't know how to hold in all these feels, so I came to write a review/sing its praises.

I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nArt assets employed in the making of this game, are just fantastic, especially the area design, excellent lighting, 3D character models and animations, 2D character portraits and visual effects. Story and lore are deeply fleshed out through dialogue and additional footnotes. Interaction with NPCs are a strong highlight due to well-written dialogue which gives the NPCs strong personailities. One sweet detail was how NPC's portrait would change depending on their mood or what they're talking about. \n\nIt's more of an stealth-adventure-RPG rather than action-RPG, considering how there's little actual combat invovled and your only offense is throwing certain consumables against foes. Furthermore, unlike monstrous opponents, humanoid opponents can only be knocked out. I would have preferred if the option to fight was available, considering all the weapons littered around the place, missed opportunity really (maybe in the next part where Tilo has to fend for himself?)\n\nThere are some bugs, but nothing near game breaking. Some examples include getting hit by a guard's halberd while he's in the Idle state, sometimes being unable to interact until I reloaded, containers highlighted even when empty.\n\nSome flaws are the lack of voice acting and some backtracking. Perhaps its left up to the player to imagine the voices, but I feel that the player and NPCs capable of combat should be given a basic voiceset catering for attack, hurt and death/knockout states. Although one can unlock shortcuts and safe routes, backtracking can get a bit tedious, but once I got familiarised with the layout travelling became much easier.\n\nIn summary, I would describe as a solid adventure RPG where you play as a Bard/Rogue multi-class character, who mainly relies on pacfist, trickery and stealth solutions to solve quests.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1437, "last_played": 1591238384}, "language": "english", "review": "While the description of this game being an RPG isn't wrong, be warned it's not an RPG in the same sense that Final Fantasy is with stat screens and combat and level ups and the typical RPG tropes. This is actually a Role-Playing Game, where you are meant to imagine yourself in the hood (not necessarily shoes) of the character Tilo. The game outside the roleplaying begins as primarily a stealth game then shifts to more of an adventure as you become a master sneak. Combat is definitely not a focus for this game (there's really only one 'fight' in the game and it's less of a fight and more of a frantic puzzle). Don't expect Metal Gear Solid stealth complexity either. The stealth is fairly simple to understand and master and there's a way to avoid the need to be stealthy entirely after a certain point. The world is highly immersive and you are expected to pay close attention to the lore and details that almost every character speaks about if you want to play the game well. \n\nThat being said, the game is incredible. As far as immersive roleplaying in a fantasy world, only enormous AAA games like Skyrim and The Wticher have done what this game has done on a much smaller scale made by a much smaller team with a much smaller budget. The game really makes you want to be able to explore the world they've built beyond the scope of the game and luckily they've set up the ending to have some decent potential for a sequel while also keeping it largely conclusive so you're not left with a sheer cliffhanger that basically says \"See you next time!\" Yes, there is a bit of an 'up in the air' ending, but if you pay attention to the lore, that's actually a pretty fitting ending too. \n\nTheres only a few problems in this game. The first is that sometimes you have to look for the smallest item that could be absolutely anywhere in the play area. There are tools in-game for finding items more easily whether that's a map with an icon on it or clues that characters mention, but even with those sometimes it's a pain to find the item. Eventually you can get the ability to 'see' interactible items but only after getting a few of these hard to find items in the first place. This can be very frustrating if you are new to the style of game this is. If you've played point and click adventures you can know that everything hinges on one small item that you may not spot even on repeated journeys through the area.

However, I found after an hour or two of playing that the narrative is on a more complex and nuanced level. This is not a game where species are portrayed in a carte-blanche \"All mice are good\" vs. \"All rats are evil\" sort of fashion.\n.\nDialogue is interesting and well-written to each character, and supplemented by clickable Terry Pratchett-esque footnotes to help fill in details. Although nothing is overtly graphic or explicit with intent to shock -- topics discussed can range from mature, heart-wrenching, and even playfully ribald at times.\n.\nIf you enjoyed Redwall, the Rats of NIMH, or other such timeless tales of timorous types of cunning creatures, please do yourself a favor and pick this one up.", "timestamp_created": 1525630566, "timestamp_updated": 1525631039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547169804573059082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41891374": {"recommendationid": "41891374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982371681", "num_games_owned": 697, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1722, "last_played": 1524103103}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is adorable and I really had a lot of fun exploring its world. \n\nI think that, first and foremost, this game is a story driven exploration above anything else. Its secondary genre would make it a stealth game. It does that first part increidbly well, and the artistic direction of the game and level design is super interesting. It sort of falls short on the stealth mechanics, but I'll get to that in a second.\n\nFrom what I understand, this entire game was made by one guy. It's usually pretty impressive when its done by people like Toby Fox, Austin Jorgenson, or Eric Barone, the people who designed all their respective 2D Pixel Art games (Undertale, Lisa, Stardew Valley). BUT WOW. THIS GAME?! The amount of time I imagine it would have taken to design such a vibrant, high rendered 3D environment and the models and animations for all the unique critters, just WOW. \n\nSo with that in mind, any faults this game has really pale in comparison to the amount of effort that went into this game and for it to not turn into a complete disaster. My only critisms are small ones usually, and the biggest critism is that the Stealth portions of the game are kind of boring/easily manipulated. You can pretty much just dash past guards and jump in a barrel. It kind of breaks up the flow of exploring environments though. For example, probably the most tedious example was for an optional quest where you have to gather mushrooms from the forest but there's a guard patrolling the path. You're already spending a lot of time searching carefully from these mushrooms just to have your search disrupted because you have to run and hide. But, again, it wasn't enough to ruin the game for me. \n\nI imagine that if the creator had a full team of developers behind him, he could create a mindblowing 20 hour AA adventure game focused primarily on exploration and its characters. The stealth doesn't need to go away, it just needs to be redesigned and utilized appropriately (sections of the game that don't require you to throughly search them).

As a whole we should cover some details on both the positive and negative scale, because it'd be easy to say one crucial thing and ruin the review despite how true it is, so please read on after this; Ghost of a Tale's stealth system isn't very good.\n\nIf I haven't scared you off or offended you (in which case, I'm sorry), but it is very barebones. It functions alright, literally a line-of-sight detection effect mixed with motion and proximity. However, a core mechanic of having items of clothing offer bonuses means that it doesn't take long for you to find things that allow you to almost entirely circumnavigate the sneaking aspect, albeit if you actually do a solid job at exploring and finding said items. Even if you are spotted, the AI isn't especially bright, and very easy to escape from.\n\nI should also provide another criticism here that I did encounter some glitches, such as falling through the floor a couple of times, including a repeatable one involving an elevator late game, as well as a (thankfully) single crash to desktop.\n\nRIGHT, enough with the negatives. Yes, the gameplay mechanics are lacking....beyond that though? I could sing this games praises for hours and still think up other things to compliment.\n\nSo, for context; You're a mouse in a world where all manner of smaller creatures have civilisations, legends, heroes, lore and just a little magic in the mix. You're imprisoned and seperated from your wife in a fort run by rats, who compared to you are towering thugs, more than twice your height who you have no realistic hope of fighting. However, you soon find some folk who're willing to talk to you and you begin getting involved in all manner of goings-on around the fort in the hopes of finding your wife.\n\nYou're a mistrel/bard, a musician and traveler (your wife a dancer to add to the show), and a core part of the games is both a repetoire of songs you can sing/play, while learning more as the game goes on, often the game making you pick appropriate songs for a given moment based on the folks you talk with. As you'd imagine you don't/can't fight, but with wits, sneaking, guile, the occasional thrown bottle at a rat guards cranium and some puzzle solving, you engage in a number of tasks for the various figures around the fort who aren't out for your blood. The world isn't huge, literally a fort and the grounds around and below it, and I was glad to see a great deal of interconnectivity with it.\n\nThe graphics are very solid, atmospheric and fitting. There's some good details, which really does show off what the Unity engine is capable of. Lush foliage, pretty well detailed character models, gorgeous god-rays and the like. It's marred by some odd seams in the textures and ground rubble here and there, but it's easy to ignore unless you're especially critical. The lighting's pretty solid too, as there are times and places where you really do need to use the light sources provided.\nWhat I adored the most visually is the art for the characters when talking. Very well drawn and coloured, hugely expressive and very fitting.\n\nThe sound's good. I found it very quiet to begin with for some reason, but tweaking the volume mixing fixed that. The game has no dialogue, which goes the same for the 'singing'. However, each song has a tune that you can fit the lyrics into. Otherwise it's fairly minimalist, good environmental effects and the like.\n\nThe story seems simple to begin with, but rest assured, it was one of the things that really stood out as things went on. There's a fairly limited cast of characters, what with it being based in a fort, but every one of them is very unique and has a lot of hidden bits of dialogue based on certain outfits as well as other lines in terms of the story. You'll frequently find yellow tinted text in conversations that you're given a prompt to look deeper into which yields very interesting morsels of lore and history in what's a very surprisingly fleshed out world. I really do hope a sequel is on the table, because there's so much more of this game that makes it seem special.\n\nWith a bit more refinement in the gameplay and a little more polish in the seams and textures, if another game is made by this group, I will buy it in a heartbeat.", "timestamp_created": 1524283413, "timestamp_updated": 1542854986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624745070934295654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41597442": {"recommendationid": "41597442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972512174", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1714, "last_played": 1524282214}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is charming.

(Spoiler free)\n\nOverall this game was very straight forward, nothing too hard to understand; Easy puzzles and easy costume use.\n\nHere is why I don't recommend you get this game, the quests are horrible. Not bad in a story way but bad in a design way. My examples are: fetching items in a wooded area with rocky ground where the items in question are small and and share the same shapes and colour as the rocks surrounding them; In multiple quests you have to fetch specific items that you cannot get when you first recieve the quest(s), you have to first unlock other areas through the main story.\nIn my opinion when you recieve a quest you should be able to complete it without having to do another quest, all the items required to fetch should be available from the start of the quest or the quest itself should unlock new areas.\n\nThe game is brown, as in the colour brown. It is all lightshafts and dark brown. It could use a bit more variety in colours as it currently looks as if it had been washed with an oil. \n\nThere are alot of windows into the abyss (missing textures/ unintentional bottomless pits), although if you aren't the type to search every nook and cranny you will probably only see a few (still immersiion breaking).\n\nThe AI does what it wants. The AI is very basic and is the same for all enemies however the inconsistency of the AI makes it actually seem like the rat guards have different personalities since some have pathing that makes it seem like some can't be bothered if you are standing out of their reach while some will seemingly never stop trying to kill you.\n\nTL;DR\nBad quest design (wasted several hours looking for something I could not yet recieve), Brown look, missing textures, Inconsistent AI.

These portraits make dialogue more expressive, and characters more memorable.\n\nIf you were looking for an elaborate stealth/action game however, this is not it. The guards are easy to outrun, easy to outsmart, and easy to over power (given they are not wearing a full set of armor.) The real challenge is not alerting them in the first place! They get alerted when they hear or see you too much. Avoiding them takes patience, memorizing their patrols, and a little cheese (no pun intended.) If the developer were to make a sequel, this is the area that needs the most improvement.\n\nAlthough I was let down by the stealth, the game compensates by including a variety of interesting, plot-related challenges. I had to solve a cryptic puzzle to open a secret door, research a book about ports so I could send prisoners to a safe location, climb to seemingly inaccessible places to find pieces of a costume, etc. \n\nThe second biggest issue are the bugs. I had to reload a save because I didn\u2019t die when I fell down a bottomless pit. My cursor broke every time I changed the resolution. These bugs made me paranoid I might lose a bunch of progress, so I followed the game\u2019s advice and kept multiple saves just in case.

However, following the branching narratives and story arcs, you quickly forget that you're looping through the same places and it becomes a wonderful environment that suits the story well. It's not too large and far from too small.\n\nThe game itself does teach you the basics, but really there's a lot to discover. I won't say there's 0 handholding, but really it felt like the old games I grew up on where you learn how to do the basics and then dive right in. Dynamic movement, refinement of controls, and proficiency are entirely up to the player. I will say that halfway through day 1 when I swapped to the controller, I was grateful I did. The controller scheme suits the game's playstyle significantly better than keyboard and mouse, and I'm certain there's a lot of exploration and indeed sneaking about that was easier with the incrimental input available on the control's joypad that is not shared by WASD/Mouse.\n\nThe art style is breathtaking. I spent more than one instance standing from a parapet or windowsill enjoying the vista and the sounds. Turning the music off at night just brought the ambience of the environment to the forefront, and I would highly recommend playing both with the music (for the intended cinematic feel the music brings) and without to just really savor the environment and sound. Bonus if you have a nice headset with surround or any other directional sound feedback device.\n\nIn the end, I spent 11hrs and missed a full completion by 1 quest (2 of Faustus' mushrooms proved difficult to find). I've never felt compelled to do that on a first playthrough, but this one was an exception and rightfully so. Completing side-missions was not a difficult task, and I found them to be enjoyable and really add depth to the narrative that was playing out.\n\nThe Cons\n...and I use that word lightly and perhaps incorrectly. There's a few small issues that I noticed throughout the gameplay, but they were far from game-breaking.\n\n1) At one point, wearing armor upgraded only once, I swapped to the thief's outfit for some narrative dialogue and then swapped back. The armor bugged and I was able to run/sprint/hide at normal unhindered speed. This effect vanished when I died and reloaded from a quicksave point.\n\n2) There was a gap in the floor texture in the tomb beneath the magpie after opening the doors to the ledge in the tapestry room.\n\n3) The rope that hoists you up from the lower to the upper level in the caverns by the shore had a gap between it ant the knot holding it to the bucket. As the bucket rose, the gap slowly vanished. Lowering it opened up.\n\n4) When you surrender the pirate hat after collecting the set, the statistics drop from 7/7 Costumes Completed to 6/7 Costumes Completed. \n\n5) From time to time during Quest Dialogue or when viewing books, the video would freeze. I could still press controls/input and hear the menus opening, closing, and so forth, but the video would just halt. I would have to close and restart. This would happen infrequently, perhaps four times on my total playthrough, on a 4k monitor with max settings, powered by a 1080GTX, windowed mode, Windows 10, both with mouse/keyboard and controller.\n\n\nAnd...really that was all I saw on the first playthrough. #2 will probably be far more thorough and my Designer's eye will start to be the lens I look through.\n\n\nBravo Zulu, SeithGC.

The characters are fun and quirky. The lore is interesting (if you the read all the notes), and the music (when it plays. Wish for more please!) is pleasent for a game about a mouse in search of his wife. The ending could have been better, but I am okay with it due to the loads of fun I had leading up to it. \n\nThe game shines in those areas above, however this game does require a lot of back tracking, which didn't bother me once I learned where everything was and had all the shortcuts/perks. I would also like to note that there is a reason for back tracking because of the location (a fort), so it only makes sense for there to be back tracking.  If you don't like games where you back track alot I would not recommend this for you. \n\nThere is also plenty to do in terms of \"side\" quests which you should totally do since it is nicely intergrated with the main quest. There is also a light RPG element to the game, though I wish there was more that could have been done with it. \n\nIn thinking about some negatives, there were a few glitches here and there, and the occasional glitch when pressing the pause button. I guess the major one I had was the sense of direction with regards to quests. Certain quests couldn't  progress without progressing the main quest, which got me scared at times due to wanting to complete all the side quests. That was a bit nerve racking, and sadly I had to look online to be sure I wasn't going to miss out. \n\nOverall, a fun game that I would recommend for anyone looking for something different, cute, and breathtaking. As someone down below wrote, think \"Secert of Nimh\" which was sort of the vibe I got when I first saw this game, though it's more based around stealth n all. Definitely worth your time. Maybe someday I will come back and do those more stealthy achievements (curse you rats!!!!). \n\nGet it.", "timestamp_created": 1522635452, "timestamp_updated": 1522635452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41215449": {"recommendationid": "41215449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165633109", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1608144224}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't want to give a bad review.

This is the sort of game that you leave feeling empty because you can no longer play it for the first time.

The side quests are also plentiful, and tie into the main story in a way that lets you ignore them if you wish, but also follow them without having to divert too much attention from the main game.\nA personal win for me, though it might not tickle your fancy, is the lack of handholding. Items and clothing can be found relatively easily through context clues or the blacksmith, but there are less obvious tasks given to you, that will require you to remember a lot of hints given in dialogue, and these hints are not written down anywhere (as of version 6.51), so it's hugely helpful to keep a notebook at hand at all times. I was also pleasantly surprised at how many instances where you could find answers to a question by looking around or analyzing the context.\n\nOn the negative side, the game can run a bit poorly on occasion, especially in the forest areas (the far tower specifically), and in areas with a lot of torches. The lack of handholding can be seen as a problem for many, though, as I said, I personally enjoy it. The forest areas also suffer from a lack of save points, as there are very few hiding spots, or characters to talk to. The catacombs and other areas with open fire also reduces the frame rate massively.\n\nFor a price tag of 25 dollars, this seems to be a good investment for many hours of entertainment.

So much heart is instilled into every character and the world around them that you'd be forgiven for assuming this isn't SeithCG's first game.\n\nA few bugs and speed bumps do not stop this game from being wonderful, and serve only to show how fantastic everything else is in the game. I completed it at just under 100% around the 25 hour mark, and before some of the steadfast patching was implemented. \n\nWhile I did encounter some problems, none of them prevented me from playing and enjoying the game immensely. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until reading later patch notes that I even realized that a few things weren't working completely. I was already so engrossed in and enamored of the game that those small technical issues had no effect on how much I enjoyed the game.\n\nIf you like great character development, clever plot twists, gorgeously rendered environments, and worldbuilding lore deep enough to inspire several sequels (pretty please, SeithCG?), then you owe it to yourself to play Ghost of a Tale!

Well worth the $25! I'd definitely back a sequel.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n- It's very pretty to look at!\n- The level interconnectivity and the feel that everything is truly part of one big world is near Dark Souls-level good. There are tons of shortcuts that you open up as the game progresses (provided you pay attention), which really impacts the back-and-forth gameplay.\n- Fantastic story with a few fun twists and turns.\n- Simple but straightforward stealth mechanic in the early part of the game.\n- I love that you can't kill the rats. It's nice to have a game in which combat is basically never the answer.\n- The game does not hold your hand. There's no mini-map, no quest objectives, no golden shimmer around objects with which you can interact. It's a bit of a throwback, and I found that refreshing.\n- There's just enough lore that you get a real sense of the world in which you're playing without having to read seven hundred books as you play through the game.\n\nThings I didn't like so much:\n\n- Yes, there's a lot of back-and-forth fetch quests. I didn't really mind that, although there were a few times where it proved pretty tedious, especially since I encountered a bug that wouldn't allow me to pass through an opened door in the harbor, meaning I had to go the long way every time. Supposedly this is now fixed.\n- The stealth mechanic is ditched entirely about 1/3 of the way through. I mean ... you can still play it as a stealth game if you want, but you no longer have to, and it's hard to justify doing so.\n- That said, the stealth mechanic is circumvented by something that causes your player to move maddeningly slowly for a while.\n- The stamina meter's recharge rate is indeed awful, even upgraded.\n- Framerates were questionable in certain areas.\n- You can lose the opportunity to complete side quests if you accidentally advance the main quest too far (I only lost one side quest, but still)\n\nOverall this is a ridiculous accomplishment considering the vast majority of it was done by one guy.

I am the kind of person who wants a good story in the games they play, if I need to grind or fight too long when there is no true goal to it or won't push the story forward then it gets old real fast. I first bought this game after watching the beginning of a play through (didn't finish the video since I didn't want spoilers) and it was the best decision I ever did.\n\nThe game itself feels almost like a mix between the Secret of NIMH and Spirited Away. The atmosphere is amazing, the music lets you feel exactly in the situation you are in or the personality of the characters you are around, the world and artwork could be straight from a movie and the lore of the world makes it feel almost like a book. The characters are all in their own gray area which makes them feel real and gives them more room to grow and develop, no one is a straight up good guy or bad guy in this game (except for Tilo, poor guy reminds me of Bilbo Baggins with how he was swept in into this messy yet awesome adventure) and they all have their own reasons for their way of thinking and have their redeemable qualities. I can't remember the last time I liked so many characters in a game and was happy to see them all time and time again, my heart soared when they all came together at the end even if just to say goodbye. I feel kind of bad for the Commander, he and the other guards were very likable as well even though you get a few scares that they might find you out (you know, just to remind you that they will NOT be happy when they find out your lie so don't get too attached).\n You really feel like you are in Tilo's (metaphorical) shoes all throughout the game and really want to get him to his destination safe and sound. His backstory is kind of bittersweet, just the way real life can often be, you deal with many a heartbreak but you just get up and make the best of things and you can really connect with how he must feel. He's the kind of mouse that keeps on going, yet at the same time you kind of get a feeling that the reason why he is going with all these dangerous plans and situations are because he (aside from having a heart of gold) has nothing left to lose. I really wanted to hug this little guy and tell him everything will be ok. (Silas too, though there IS a moment when you want to hit him over the head to make him stop talking. I won't spoil it for you, you'll know when you get there)\nThe ending is what reminded me of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece more than anything. It is the perfect ending for a perfect adventure, yet it willingly leaves room for more. And to make things better (or worse, depends on the level of torture you feel at this, I am right in between) it leaves you WANTING more. You want to know more about Tilo's journey, you want the questions left unanswered (on purpose, trust me I found no plotholes in this story) answered, you want to explore more of this gorgeous world that the creators have built.

If you want a fun experience where you're not on wiki ever two hours or so trying to understand whats wrong with your game and simply resorting to loading back and losing hours of gameplay, than just wait for this game to be finished and play it at a later stage.\n\nI wish the developers the best and hope they can make this into a solid product at some point. .", "timestamp_created": 1522327675, "timestamp_updated": 1522327675, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586700558662414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41128750": {"recommendationid": "41128750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374393505", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 370, "last_played": 1540651317}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought this game yeterday and didnt expect to have to check the requirements.

It's by no means perfect, but I'd say it's my favorite game I've played so far this year.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- Enemy AI is pretty stupid. They can easily detect you yet if you turn a corner, it's like you're invisible to them.\n- At points it feels as though a cutscene or some sort of cinematic should play, but instead you just get a textbox explaining what you would be seeing. Understandable though, considering the game was developed by about 3 people (not including the music and 2D art).\n- I had less than 10 crashes during my entire playthrough, typically when I was trying to save. Luckily I was saving often, so it wasn't too bad for me. Be warned though, save at any chance you get.\n- Maps can be a bit confusing at times, as can quest objectives.\n- The later segments of the game don't seem like they got as much attention as the first 1/3 or so.\n- Some sidequests, and even main quests, can feel a bit tedious, but not grating enough to where I wanted to stop.\n- Just the ocassional small bug, but I never had any that were game-breaking.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- Absolutely stunning in terms of design, lighting, atmosphere, overall graphics, as well as in sound design. The world truly feels lived in, and you genuinely feel like a tiny mouse in a rat's world (like, everything is clearly designed for someone twice your size).\n- Memorable characters, and charming dialogue.\n- A wonderful world filled with lore to learn about. If you're a fan of Morrowind, the game has a system during dialogue where you can open entries and read about what the characters are discussing. Does wonders for immersion and world building.\n- While the enemies can be pretty stupid, stealth still feels excellent and works as intended.\n- Attention to detail is astonishing.\n- Loads of sidequests to complete, and plenty of replay value.\n- Music is delightful and generally very fitting.\n\nI recommend this game if you're looking to get lost in the world of a fun, replayable stealth game with RPG elements and a great story. Think \"Secret of Nimh\" with a bit of Thief or Metal Gear. Despite it's flaws, the game was delightful the whole way through.

I think my favorite character besides Tilo is Silas, however, Kerold had me cracking up - I got excited every time I had to go speak with him. He is a riot!! I also constantly get the little instrumental songs stuck in my head. I think my favorite ones are The Gilded Warrior and The Orphan King. It is clear to me just how much love went into this game, which made me love it just as much in return. From the adorable little mice (complete with cute little tail flicks and floppy ears) to the beautiful drawings of each character with different, matching expressions in each dialogue, I was completely entranced. Also, it was so amazing to see and hear the foliage rustling as your little mouse walked through the forest, as well as hear the pitter patter of his little feet as he walked *super squee* my husband was laughing at me because I could not stop squealing at how cute Tilo is!!

Play-time can be expected to last roughly between 10 and 20 hours depending on the degree of completion.\n\nThe game progresses through dialogue and item collection while navigating the maze that is Dwindling Heights and evading the rats guarding the place.

But, honestly, you just have to take one look at Tilo and all of the problems this game has will vanish from your sight.\n\nAll in all, this game offers a refreshing light-hearted experience and a welcomed respite from all that is wrong in the world. 10/10 would like a sequel.\n", "timestamp_created": 1522257920, "timestamp_updated": 1522257920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41111974": {"recommendationid": "41111974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986401146", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1603715559}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game while it was in early access and I played it for maybe 2 hours, then decided to stop for one reason, I didn't wanna ruin what i knew was building up to be an amazing experience.\nRelease day I downloaded it again and I've loved playing it.

I expected a more linear style of progression, where you move past Zones and NPCs once you've gotten what you need from them, but throughout the entire game you're constantly cycling back to places you've been and people you've talked to. You end up finding all these secrety hidey-holes and passageways that connect all the far-reaching areas of the map in cool, quirky ways. I can't tell you the number of times I've absentmindedly been running through a tunnel and come to the end like, \"Oh THIS is where I am!\". Perfect example of a smal world done right. \n\nEqually, the writing is divine. I was coming off a pretty big Skyrim kick when I started Ghost of a Tale so I thought I was going to be BLAZING through any books/texts I came accross in the grand Bethesda tradition, but nope. Concise, quaint, readable paragraphs make you WANT to read them. You can get the sparknotes lore from this game so easily, and if you want more, you have your clickable yellow text conversation option that's not really necessary, but still fun. I think it's the mark of any good RPG to make you care about the world beyond completing the game/collecting everything/getting the achievements/etc etc. \n\nI'm going to spare any comments on the art, bc I think what needs to be said has been said. It's beautiful, end of story. You feel like you're in a Brian Jacques novel, traveling through a post-apocalyptic Redwall abbey. It's a stunning world. It's got a very Guild Wars 2-esque light and shine about it. \n\nThe costume system is fun and great, although I would've wished to see them all have equal purprose. You definitely spent more time in certain clothes than others. \n\nTo the negatives, there's a lot of logistics I wish had been tweaked. I wish opening the menu paused the game (like most games). Sometimes there are little UI snaffus that end up needing a re-load. I glitched into the basket up to Silas's watchtower and lost a TON of progress. Sometimes the sound effects would glitch out, but the music would stay, and I'd need to hop in a barrel and pop out of the game for a second.\n\nOn a larger scale, the quest structure is a little off. You're never given any indication which quest you should be pursing, only that you have main quests, and side quests. Turns out, you can inadvertantly lock yourself out of a lot of sidequest content by completing too many main quests! \n\nAlso, there is no reason on God's green, 2018 earth why any game should have a checkpoint-based save system. Yes, the hiding to save fits with the aesthetic, and no, it's not the most frustrating thing in the world. But it's an unnecessary inconvenience at best. It doesn't add anything to the game overall! (EDIT - Someone has clarified down below that it accommodates consoles + a small dev team which is an excellent point. Consider the aforementioned a light critique at best, and a moot point at worst. Certainly shouldn't stop you from getting the game.)\n\nThe last big negative I'd drop is this, it's short for the price. If you're gaming on a budget, you should not buy Ghost of a Tale. I know it's beautiful, and I don't want to devalue the work of the devs, especially since I know nothing about development! But if you have to put yourself in that truly terrible mindset of \"I Only Want A Game With A Lot Of Playtime, Because I Can't Always Be Buying Games\", then you are going to be sorely dissappointed by how fast this all goes by. If you're on a budget, and you're okay with a less-occuppied experience, then honey, buy this thing. \n\n[spoiler] The ending sets it up for something big. I want a sequel. I want sequels. But I'm worried with how long it took for the funding for this game to come together that that may not be a reality.

Over. And. Over. Again.\nOn the top of that... [u]the main character isn't able to cover great distances because of a really dumb mechanic, which will be shown down below.[/u]\n\n[b]2- The wretched, stupid idea of combining the health-stamina bar into a single one[/b]\n\nYour health bar and your stamina bar are the same thing and they share their grim fate, meaning that if you get hit by an enemy, you'll loose health and stamina at the same time and by loosing health you'll be prevented to run away, allowing your enemies to kill you with ease and reducing your stamina even more while chasing you down.\nThis is quite infuriating, both for stealth and not stealth sequences.\nSomeone could rightfully say: but this is a stealth game, just sneak past them LUL!!!\n[b]The harsh reality[/b]: you don't have tools to get past guards, you don't have neither supernatural powers to dispatch them nor that tools that allow you to move way faster or in a sneakier way, so the \"sneaking\" is extremely hard or undoable.\nNote that i'm not saying that this game needed to be a mouse version of Dishonored. Far from that.\nThe exploring part is even worse: you'll be breathless after running for few meters and it'll take a lot to recover the stamina to keep running in order to be able to explore and backtrack, while trying to not to get bored to death, [u]while trying to find that darn precious item you're required to bring in[/u] in order to progress with the story.\n\n[b]3- The inconsistency of skills, items and stealth mechanics[/b]\n\n[u]Skills[/u]: they're not skills. At all. They're just boring and predictable passive abilities such as a faster stamina recovery and reduced damage when falling from the higher grounds. These skills...don't serve any purpose. Having them or not don't make your gameplay more fun or variable, like it happens in the Styx's series or in Dishonored, it's just a gimmick to fill your free text space in your inventory.\n\n[u]Clothes and costumes[/u]: those stats granted by most costumes are mostly worthless, as those bonuses that they provide aren't worthy at all and are hardly appliable. The brighest example: the fire resistance. Unless you're planning to swim into a oil lantern 24/7, this stat bonus is blatantly useless. The only good thing that comes from costumes are the visual effect of them and the fact that wearing those costumes can trigger optional dialogues and side quests, which sadly you might be induced to do.\n\n[u]Broken stealth mechanics:[/u]: The game DIES right after leaving the prison cells that you see in the steam store page. If this game was based upon proper stealthing into closed areas, the game could have been great.\n[u]What you get instead[/u] are guards that get more suspicious when you use the stealthy footsteps and not when running, brutal and abupt framedrops while talking to NPCs or while pickpocketing them or even during quicksaves. You often will have to explore while stealthing, making the whole thing insanely boring and stressful, especially if you're going for the \"undetected\" achievement as you'll be always without stamina or with low HP, preventing you to run away from your enemies or enviromental perils.\n\n[b]TO SUM UP:  Why giving this game a 4/10? [/b]\n\n1- The game is clearly unfinished, as there are blank spots all over the men\u00f9  and in the story itself. There are even body item slots -showed in your inventory menu - that are never used in the whole game (which i've completed at 100%); \n\n2- the backtracking is insanely clunky, badly optimized and boring, as many events take place during some precise parts of the day/night which you will have to wait patiently (unless you find a bed to skip the waiting) while wandering around while searching for that cursed item you desperately need to complete a main quest\n\n3- the stealth is nonexistent and illogical\n\n4- the skill/item system is shallow: items that are used only once most of the time, foods that were supposed to be used to prepare potions (according to their ingame lore) which eventually never came up with this functionality at launch\n\n5- The story was actually nice (and the secondary characters too!!) but it gets explained way too abruptly in the end. Animations or even short cinematics are totally absent, forcing the game to explain everything through text only, which leads me to think that they've ran short of time and money during the development\n\n6- Enemy variety is nonexistent, except for 3 nice NPCs\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night. \nFeel free to join my curator group and to become a follower of my reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/", "timestamp_created": 1521931229, "timestamp_updated": 1557695666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545844554901123047", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41028053": {"recommendationid": "41028053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025402202", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2977, "last_played": 1522011913}, "language": "english", "review": "Other than a few bugs (one of which made me restart from my last save point) this game is amazing.

It has RPG, adventure and platforming in equal doses, but it's not really committed to any of those styles. It's a mixup of Dark Souls style of level design, Hitman styled costume stealth paired with traditional stealth mechanics and roleplaying elements that give you levels ups after certain experience thresholds have been reached. It's a weird experience,  certainly like nothing I have played before. So, what Ghost of a Tale really is, is deeply flawed but still competent game, and if you can stomach the many faults it has you might find an experience that stays with you.\n\nGhost of a Tale begins at a keep of Dwindling Heights, giving you only a brief backstory to go on with before it pushes you out of your cell door. The whole game happens in this prison and it's surrounding areas, and even though it might sound like a small premise, the map is large enough to give you room to explore. This is also the area where the game shines brightest. It has amazing map desing, combined with graphics that make you wonder how only a team of few developers managed to pull it off. The map loops to itself in surprising ways and gives you shortcuts that cut down backtracking. I have played only a small amount of Dark Souls but I can confidently say that people who love it will find joy in mapping and exploring Dwindling Heights. \n\nThe artwork and graphics further sell the impression that this is indeed a story book from olden days brought back to life and now drawn to your computer screen. Character models and their animations are absolutely fantastic. They are full of detail and you can see the hours and love put in to them. Music doesn't fall far behind with few good tunes that don't take away from the experience by being just awesome music, but play in the background and enhance the experience. By visual standards, this game is a master piece.\n\nWhich brings me to the unfortunate section of \"bad\" in my review. The game is buggy as hell. Keep in mind that I don't really mind about bugs. Sometimes I even find them hilarious, and I do understand that no software on earth, no matter how much testing it gets, can be perfect. Heck, this game was made mostly by three guys, and if I understood correctly, most of the work was done by only one of them. But there still is a line, and this game goes way past it. The bugs range from graphical bugs like textures disappearing so you can see through the map to bugs like the one I encountered when I bought food from NPC, and because the NPC didn't have that item in her inventory,the game spawned them in and left big yellow text as a memento of that moment to my screen. Permanently. Until I restarted. Sometimes your character gets stuck to certain objects and geometry, sometimes if you go through a door enemies in the previous room disappear completely and spawn back in when you go back, and sometimes controller won't work as it should (like the one time when the triggers didn't register any inputs until I restarted the game). And this is only a brief recounting of all the ones I encountered. The final part of the game suffers most from these since it includes stuff that the game certainly isn't good at, and tops it off with combination of previous bugs and AI that isn't all that bright. During the ending sequence I was watching the \"cutscene\" under water, because the camera bugged out. Way to leave the last impression. These are indeed nothing game breaking, but still stuff that gets you drawn out of the experience. Hopefully, these will be fixed over time since these are bugs that CAN be fixed with patches.\n\nAlso the game mechanics can be a bit tedious. I loved running, sneaking and jumping around, the character feels great to control and even though sneaking gets kind of forgotten after a certain point of the game, (because you get costumes that fool the guards, more stamina so you get away easier and you learn to trick the AI) at the start of the game these segments can be really tense. Game could do with more depth to these mechanics but since these are not the focus of the game I don't mind that too much. At the end I had lots and lots of food stored in my inventory, and the only deaths I countered were at the beginning when I was still learning the ropes, a few stupid mistakes in a rare instakill platforming segments and the finale, which is it's own can of worms. There's also a LOT of backtracking, so in the end your going to know this keep like your own pockets. I did enjoy this, but I can see why you can start hating it, escpecially the game doesn't give you specific locations on where to go, and you can search an area for a good 30 minutes before you find the specific spot.\n\nThe game took about 10 hours to complete, and I did do most of the side content. I loved that there was no objective arrows to guide you, so everything you did you had to do yourself. Or buy information from a certain blacksmith who can mark locations to your map. Not too helpful, since the game doesn't always change to correct map when you go to different area. He can also give hints about puzzles, but only if you have money to pay for it. I found this a great way to implement help function in the game, these hints are never free so at least you have to give something in return for those tips, other than your pride.\n\nSo, in conclusion? I loved this game. It has it faults, yes, but the lore is so fascinating, and we don't see this type of fable stories too often in gaming. The game's Early Access roots shine through in wrong ways but for every bug there is a wonderful story/character beat. It's also absolutely stunning to look at. This game is definately NOT for everyone, but if you can look past it's flaws you can find something truly beautiful.

However, you do not play a rat, but rather a minstrel named Tilo who has been imprisioned for sedition because his wife refused to dance for the Baron. When you awaken in your cell, you discovere under some stale bread, a key and a note from a benefactor somewhere in the keep who needs you assistance. In avoiding detection you find your benefactor, and from here you embark on your journey though Dwindling Heights (Formerly known as Duinlane Heights) in a quest to find your beloved Merra. \n\nNow, before you jump into this wonderfully rendered game, you will need to read some of the ingame books in order to understand the circumstances of the characters in the game. You need to READ AND COMPREHEND. If you don't, you won't understand what others are wanting from you. Some outfits also have social modifiers to them, wich you can learn about by reading the entries on them, the most obvious is that dressed in the armor, you appear like a scrawny rat, as as such, can move about in the game, unchallenged. \n\nWhile the game has been finaly released in March of 2018, it is still a little buggy. Sometimes you are unable so get out of hiding places, other times you are unable to pick up certain items, and if you find yourself in too tight of a spot, the camera will glitch out. Most of these glitches are easily remedied with a restart, or simply moving Tilo to another place.\n\nAnother thing to know is that there is no real combat in this game. Sure, you can indirectly kill spides, or knock out a rat or two, but if you think you're going in with a sword, you got another thing comming. It's a stealth game, and apparently, in this game, mice aren't exactly know for their courage.\n\nMy first complete play-thru after release took about 16 hours to complete. This is because early reliance of the full suit of armor (needed to disguise yourself as a really small rat), is heavy, and requires modifications to allow you to move quickly. This can be done by focusing on the quests assigned to you from the Commander. Also, finding keys is important too, as most of the shortcuts in the game are locked or not too terribly obvious. You don't need to do all the quests in the game to finish it, but doing quests will give you benefits, such as special pieces of clothing, or as I previously mentioned, modifications to the armor.\n\nThere is also leveling in this game, but this is mostly tied to your health. The higher your levels, the more health you have, thus are a little more durable in case you fing yourself discovered by a very unfriendly rat that would like to pound you flat.\n\nAnd lastly, while this is a complete game, it seems like this game is the start of a larger saga, as at the end, Tilo sails away to find his wife who is supposedly on the Isle of Periclave. I look forward to it's sequal.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521781373, "timestamp_updated": 1521781373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522205233573913574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40986437": {"recommendationid": "40986437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316194089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2191, "last_played": 1521848593}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00a1Excelente juego!

I couldn't find the eleveator key and even forum posts about said key didn't help me figure out where the hell it was located.  The shores?  Is that the cliffs?  The faraway tower?  I think all three of those areas are the same area.  Maybe I'm stupid or mayb the game just really lacks a sense of direction.  The smithy can also provide maps to you but for only a handful of areas which would of helped me distinguish between these locations because where area has the same walls, chests, barrels, etc.\n\nEnemies are brain dead and it is very tiring \"sneaking\" by them (by just running past their poor AI).  90% of your game time will be running through the same halls passing the same guards who take the same routes.  All of the quests are fetch quests and the only thing carryign them is the charm of the characters which only continues so far as you do fetch quests for them.  There's no puzzles to solve and the story randomly involves this ghost spirit from way long ago?  Why?

Clunky combat puzzle things?  No closure on the missing wife?  More ghost crap?  I mean, I get the game is called \"Ghost of a Tale\" but if the plot opens with me concerned about my wife then why does the game end without closure on wife?

Now you must find out who rescued you and why, and more importantly, find out what happened to your wife Merra and your son Bryn. Along the way you meet a variety of characters and are given a lot of backstory of the world Tilo lives in.\n\nLet me start by saying that the art in this game is absolutely beautiful, the character models and animations are gorgeous and the world matches perfectly. The visual fidelity is AAA. The sound matches pretty well and the soundtrack is lovely. The handdrawn art for the dialog for all of the characters is just as beautiful and lively. I loved just looking at this game.\n\nHowever, the gameplay itself is not on par with the other elements. The game is primary a stealth title, there's almost no action, but the problem is that the stealth isn't that good. Sneaking around is easy, but Tilo is very slow and sneaking makes him even slower. It tests your patience a lot. The worst part is that sneaking around doesn't really benefit you in most situations, guards are slow and you can easily get to areas they can't access due to their larger size or inability to climb. Sneaking around is effectively pointless and doing it isn't rewarding.\n\nThe game is very \"aimless,\" in that you're left to your own devices to figure things out. It's kinda nice, because it has this open feel but sometimes you'll get majorly stuck trying to figure out just where the hell to go or what to do. The quest log helps, but sometimes it's incredibly vague ie, \"Go here to meet X\" but where exactly in the area you have to go isn't clear. And a lot of the areas are large and winding. Being that Tilo runs out of stamina incredibly quick and takes forever to regain it, you'll be jogging back and forth around these areas more than you'll like. Keys are also insanely annoying, some keys are given to you via quests, some are just found on walls, some are stolen from guards and some doors can be circumvented by clever jumping or alternate paths. This gets you wondering what you should do when you find a locked door, should you look for a key? Find a way around? Or just wait to get further into the story to be given a key? While this sounds like it gives the player options, finding the right option can lead to a lot of time wasted just trying to get by a gate or door.\n\nThe gameplay isn't varied enough, all quests boil down to typical fetch quests. \"Go here and get X, Y and Z,\" \"Find X amount of Y item.\" Blah blah blah. One quest has you finding 30~ mushrooms, it's excessive. Bringing these items back will usually net you some information, another fetch quest, or a key. It's a really repetitive cycle and mostly feels like padding the game out.\n\nSome areas of the game are incredibly under utilized, especially the Northern Cliffs and Shore areas, they're quite large but almost no quests take place in them and there's nothing to do other than run through them. It feels like they ran out of time implementing them properly.\n\nThis complaint is minor, and won't bother most people, but there's a little too much lore in the game for me. The game fleshes itself out very well in it's texts and it makes the world feel properly alive. However, when you spend most of your time reading and clicking through text over and over it breaks up the pacing of the game and brings it to a halt. This is also compounded by the fact that the game has a lot of names, locations and even it's own made up phrases that are presented in yellow text and clicking will bring up another dialog box with a paragraph of backstory on that single word. It's great, if that's your thing, but it became overwhelming for me trying to piece everything together.\n\nLastly, the game is too long. Around the 7 hour mark I felt like the game should have finished already as it showed everything it had to offer in regards to gameplay without changing anything up at all. But it didn't for another 5 hours. By the end I was wondering if I should just give up and uninstall as I was having little fun getting to the end. I soldiered on to find myself tasked with the most miserable \"final showdown\" I've had to endure in a game and an ending that didn't resolve a major question I wanted answered (presumably to make a sequel). I was disappointed.\n\nFor an indie game this is an ambitious work of art and should be praised for that alone, but sadly there's a LOT of fat that needs to be trimmed to refine the experience into something that doesn't end up feeling like a chore.", "timestamp_created": 1521615199, "timestamp_updated": 1521615199, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650521337985992432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40951371": {"recommendationid": "40951371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063688258", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1054, "last_played": 1532835304}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't your standard \"Throw on your big-boy pants\" game.

Combat is a pretty integral part of that third-person romp through atmospheric lands. Now, however, that sticks in my mind as an accurate, boiled-down description of the gameplay in Ghost of a Tale.\n\nI adore this game.\n\nI've seen some reviews that focus on the stealth aspect, which is not entirely invalid, but that matters less after the first third (or so) of the game, when a disguise allows free movement through previously-guarded areas. There are some puzzles here and there, as well as things to find. That leaves the main thread of gameplay being the heavy emphasis on exploration of areas that interlock and curve back on themselves in ways that are fun to uncover.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely there, it not as bleak and lonely as a Souls game. A nice feature lets you get a pop-up with further details on lore terms as they come up in conversation (rather than needing to dig through menus) and there is a weight of that history hovering over the present, both in setting and characters. I found the handful of major NPCs all game across as very genuine. The player gets insights into the protagonist's history as collectibles are found, but he starts to see some of that through new eyes as well. As Tilo is a mouse minstrel, we also get his book of songs - one that is revised and added to over the course of the story and makes a very nice touch.\n\nEarly on, I felt the distinct lack of voice and immediately thought, \"Man, this could have been that much better.\" Looking back after completing the game, however, I'm less sure. That might have been a design/budget decision, but for as much as I wanted voice to start with, I wasn't bothered by the absence by the end. Some of those lines would have been difficult to deliver with the proper emotion and I find myself wondering if filling in the gaps mentally (as one must with a book compared to a movie) might have actually added to the experience.\n\nTechnically, I had a few problems along the way. Three or four times, I got Tilo and the camera stuck in a spot for several seconds. There were some occasions of being able to see sky instead of terrain until I moved close enough. I also hit a progress-blocking bug with a quest - thanks to a note on Steam, I was able to email my save file and get a fixed version back in within an hour (on a Sunday). There have been update patches coming out frequently these first few days after release fixing most of the major issues. Given the game was largely developed by one person, I credit the response time more than I blame for the bugs in the first place.\n\nI don't consider it a spoiler (though some might) to say the ending does not wrap everything up. To me, it felt satisfying in the way that a short first novel of a series might. There are revelations and developments. There's a climax. The main threads of the story, however, are still there and the door is wide open for continuation.\n\nAnd I find myself sincerely hoping it comes.", "timestamp_created": 1521558250, "timestamp_updated": 1521558250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40938916": {"recommendationid": "40938916", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963183636", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 2969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2826, "last_played": 1613336974}, "language": "english", "review": "// VERDICT - PLAY IT!\nGreat: The story is amazing, how all the characters and quests come together and revolve around each other... still overwhelmed.

Nowhere can you find a more devoted and hardworking developer.\n\n===================\n\nTo end with, I'd like to list a few of my favorite aspects and little details that speak to the incredibly high quality of this product:\n\n[list]\n[*]The environment is just unbelievably detailed and un-video-game-like. You know how in even the biggest budget games, in so many cases you will run into blurry textures and flat meshes? There might be incredibly nice-looking foliage, but you can see the ground is a plain flat mesh with a basic texture underneath.\n\nI haven't found a single spot like that in this game. This is possibly the single best usage of tessellation ever: every single pebble sticks out of the ground. Every single brick and rock stick out of the walls with real depth. There are no flat, fake looking or blurry surfaces anywhere in this game. It's an almost surreal experience when you are so used to what a video game \"looks like,\" to suddenly be wandering through something that feels like it is built out of actual real-life objects instead of meshes and textures.\n\n[*]On top of that, the collision and player control are fantastic. Despite the ridiculous three-dimensionality of the world, movement is supremely smooth. I am constantly surprised when, expecting to get stuck bumping into a rock protruding from the ground, Tilo instead scampers right over it. You know, exactly like any game character should, but never does. Other devs, please take note.\n\n[*]Classic platforming is certainly not a major part of the game, but perhaps it should have been, because jumping and climbing is just as smooth and enjoyable as walking and running. I would kill to get a better look at how this works under the hood along with the meshes and colliders on the rocks, because my gosh the way I was able to clamber my way up from the bottom of the utterly natural looking rocky hills in the shore area to the top blew my mind.\n\n[*]Last but not least, foliage. It would be one thing if it was [i]only[/i] some of the most lush and beautiful foliage ever rendered to a screen in real time, which it certainly is. But the interaction just knocks it out of the park. I swear, if all you could do in this game is run through ferns and watch them brush out of the way and then cheerily bounce and snap back into place, it would be worth it.\n[/list]\n\nThis is what I'm talking about. This obsessive attention to the smallest detail and the dumbfounding sense of presence and place and believability it results in.

When I get to play as an amazingly well animated character like that, my enjoyment of a game immediately goes up considerably... yet even with that taken into consideration, I can't recommend this game.\n\nI'm sure this review will get buried beneath the slew of positive reviews with <5 hours of playtime, but for the few folks who actually see this, I hope I can shed some light on the things they aren't telling you.\n\nThe art direction in this game? Inspired. It's clear that a huge amount of effort went into creating well-crafted, well-animated art assets and the love that the modelers and artists had for this product shows. It's by far the best thing about the game. The first half or so of the game's world is incredibly well done - detailed, stylized, believable... I was feeling quite fully immersed in this world and its characters and the story. So what changed?\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say the developers got about half way through making this thing and got bored, or ran out of time, or ran out of money, or something, and just scraped the second half together. There are bugs - holy shit are there bugs - and some of them systematically dismantle the experience from its core.\n\nAnyone who only played the first 3-5 hours of the game probably never encountered any of this, and will read this and think I'm crazy for not recommending this game, and if I'd only played 3-5 hours, I'd be right there with them, but once you get to the middle / end of the game, the lack of polish becomes readilly apparent. Holes in the world geometry abound. Leaving the pathways and going to explore the outdoor areas of the game - particularly the 'Shore' area - is just asking to fall through the world. It's clear to me that basically no testing was done in this regard, because you don't even have to try to do it. Luckily, when you fall through the world, the game puts you back on the surface - or, it tries to. All three times this happened to me, the game put me back under the world and created a loop of falling - respawning - falling that forced me to alt+F4 the game and restart it again to continue.\n\nA lot of sounds are just flat out missing. Music exists in some areas and not others, and when you transition between them the music track starts playing in the middle and is quite jarring. There are events that should have sounds associated with them (ringing bells, for instance, or combat happening mere feet from your character) which make no sounds at all. Coincidentally these sounds are primarily missing from the second half of the game - see a theme developing here? No dialog is voiced, and some of it really could have used it. In fact, there's no cutscenes of any kind except the ending which only qualifies by the barest definition of a cutscene, and while the sounds that *do* exist are very well done and really add considerably to the experience, the ones that are missing will pull you out of the game and destroy your immersion.\n\nSpeaking of dialog, dialog loops and sequence breaks frequently create nonsensical situations. I'm going to try to be spoiler-free here in case, after reading this, you still want to play this, but there's an encounter near the end of the game wherein a rather monumental event takes place, and a number of guards in the prison the game takes place in watch it happen (or... should, in theory? They were standing literally 10 feet from it...). They then proceed to not react to it in the slightest. This may not sound terribly egregious, and without major story spoilers I can't really illustrate why it is, but trust me when I say that it's completely immersion destroying.\n\nHopefully you don't just click through the dialog and skip that monumentous story event, but if you do, it's okay - after the event takes place, you can go and talk to an unconcious character and the game will *play the entire event again as if it never happened*, with unconcious characters talking to you, conversation repeating, and those characters getting knocked unconcious again. This is clearly not intended.\n\nThe final encounter in the game is the most uninspired, infuriating thing I've experienced in recent memory. Imagine that you're playing Mario, and you're comfortable with the mechanics of Mario and how the game operates, and then in the last level, the game switches to the N64 Superman game. This is the closest approximation of this shit-show that I can make without completely spoiling the story, but but let me assure you that it is utterly ridiculous how contrived it feels. Not only that, but you're required to utilize some objects to complete the encounter. There's about... 8 of them, if I had to estimate, and when you use one, they're consumed. You need to use 3 of them successfully to proceed (why is it always three in these situations? It's like the magic number of gaming bosses.) Here's the rub - if you fail the encounter, and use the 'Load Last Save' prompt that you're given when you do, any of those objects that you used previously *are still gone*. On my third attempt at this steaming pile of an encounter (which I should add is basically a die roll as to whether you can successfully do it, due to a restrictive timer mechanism and utterly unpredictably laughable AI), there were only two of these objects left, and I had to close the game entirely and re-load it to try again.\n\nThe ending... well, let it suffice to say that there is no conclusion to the story. It's basically a 'To be continued...', but there's not enough content there for it to conceivably have been a cash grab to promote a sequel... it honestly feels like they got to the end of the game and decided to just not include any real conclusion. In fact, at the end of the game, things are *more nebulous than when it started*, which is kind of a feat in and of itself.\n\nThey had a few golden opportunities for branching storylines and a satisfying ending here. There were three scenarios I was speculating would be the end as I was playing, and I was excited to see if my speculation was correct - I would have been better off just not playing the last 20 minutes of the game and writing my own ending, instead. This lack of story wrap-up combined with utterly ridiculous immersion destroying game system choices (dialog is all handled via the game's equivalent of popup boxes, which pause everything else while they're taking place, and the game decides to, while you're being chased by multiple NPCs who're actively trying to kill you, suddenly pull you into a 5-6 line dialog between three characters... on MULTIPLE occasions... in the span of 2-3 minutes, during this ending...) completely ruined the amazing experience that the first 5ish hours of this game brings.\n\nIf you feel you must play this game, I wholeheartedly recommend that you stop when you reach the Shore area for the first time. Maybe even the Slopes, because that's where the problems really start becoming apparent. Just stop there, write your own ending in your head, and suffice to say that no matter how ridiculous your version of events is, it will be better than what the team behind this thing actually decided to include.\n\nTL;DR: Bugs. Sequence breaks. Frustrating design choices. Ruined immersion. First 3-5 hours are amazing, one of the best gaming experiences I've had in the past few years. The second half of the game is a smoldering dumpster fire with little hope for redemption.

Yes, it is that; however, what makes it tolerable, is there's a lot of shortcuts and different ways to get from point A to point B.

Sounds don't play sometimes or abruptly turn on.\n       d. Some quests don't even work. For instance, there's a part where you have to shut \n           someone up because they are wistling to loud. First, you don't hear any wistling (issue from \n           c), but I knew who I had to shut up, or so I thought. When I went to the guy, he just told me \n            to fuck off. After spending 1 hour trying to find the guy I'm supposed to tell to tell to shut \n           up, I end up raging and shutting the game off. I come back and the original guy I thought I \n           was supposed to talk to suddenly wants to talk to me. That was fun... There's many more \n           but I'll stop there.\n 2. Story - The story was meh. All the bugs and glitches pretty much took me away from the story \n                 so didn't feel very involved.\n 3. Gameplay - I see people praising this game for being a true stealthy game. I'm here to tell \n                        you that that is not true. Maybe the first fourth of the game is like that, but once you \n                        get a set of armour that makes guards ignore you, there's no more stealth. The \n                        only time I felt like this was a stealth game and was actually scared of the rats was \n                        in the beginning. After that, there are no more consiquences. The rats are slow and \n                        easy to out run. Some enemies you actually have to fight and all you can do is \n                        throw shit at them. If you don't have the right thing to throw at them, tough shit. \n                        There's a lot of running back and fourth. There's a total of 7? places I believe, but \n                        you'll be spending most of your time in 2 of them.\n 4. Ending - Shit. Boring. Why? Fuck you.\n\nVerdict: 5/10. I really wanted to like this game, but the bugs just made it unbearable. Seeing all these great reviews confuses me because it makes me feel like either I'm the only one getting all these bugs or these people don't give a shit about them. I basically forced myself to finish it because I actually wanted to see how it ended. Without giving any spoilers, It was VERY disapointing. I'd wait to buy it until they fix the bugs.\n\n* formatting fixes", "timestamp_created": 1521412234, "timestamp_updated": 1521414116, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413763314485549927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40909181": {"recommendationid": "40909181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015919586", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1355, "last_played": 1521411607}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Game with a captivating Story and beautiful visuals.

I plan to do Multiple playthroughs of it. However the current state of this game is completely unacceptable for a full release. i would have much preferred for them to have taken more time in the Early Access phase to iron out more bugs and add some polish.\n\n\n       Bugs stay with this game from start to finish. Holes in the geometry of the world, very easily seen. Missing sound effects in the game, the [spoiler]magpie encounter[/spoiler], elevator bells dont ring, [spoiler]Silas' whistling[/spoiler] is never heard, rope basket moving has no sound, pinecone explosions dont make any noise. There are a few animations missing from the game, the most blatant one is the missing transition from standing to climbing a ladder. The worst are the numerous game breaking bugs that halt all progress for the main quest. I personally encountered two bugs (though the steam forums suggest many more can happen) that stopped all progression requiring me to reload multiple times to figure out what order to do certian actions to get a quest to register and advance when there should be no such need. If you do certian actions too early in the game without recieveing the proper quest that quest can be forever locked out in the current playthrough.\n\n\n        Ghost of a Tale is a wonderful game, I did enjoy it but it is simply unacceptable to call this a final release, I felt like I was still bug testing through the whole game. The second half felt rushed and more streamlined to just push the player to teh end instead of letting the story unfold in the rich world that the developers have created. I can't reccommend a purchase of this game no matter how great it is until it is bug free (atleast the game breaking bugs) and offers a full experience to the consumer.

It has amazing visuals, good animations and is very well optimized despite using Unity (which is known for poor perfomance in 3D games).\n\nTo me Ghost of a Tale is like Arkham Asylum meets Dark Souls meets Hitman with cute antropomorphic mice and somewhat less cute antropomorphic rats for enemies.\n\nAs in Arkham Asylum, you go around a keep on an island and carry out a variety of tasks. As in Dark Souls, you find new equipment sets and open passageways connecting locations you already visited and creating shortcuts: level design in Ghost of a Tale is truly amazing. Finally, as in Hitman you avoid being seen or put on a disguise to move freely among your enemies.\n\nAlas, you can see Ghost of a Tale could use a bigger budget: the game lacks voice overs, has poor sound design (some sounds are too loud, too quiet or missing at all). I believe the authors planned to have songs and voice-overs (because why would you make the hero a minstrel otherwise?), but there're no resources to implement.\n\nBut worst of all, the game has quite a few bugs. Some of those are minor (like rats sometimes not going back to sleep when you wake them), some are more severe (like quests not progressing). On top of that the camera can be quirky and default controls are somewhat unusual (thankfully, you can remap even gamepad bindings).\n\nAnyway, even despite its flaws the game is great and is definitely a nice choice whether you look for a game to play with your family or a game you could play solo and go for hardcore achievements such as never to be detected by an enemy.", "timestamp_created": 1521383280, "timestamp_updated": 1542917958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40897685": {"recommendationid": "40897685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118348938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1521628487}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING!!\n\nThe devs have hired bus loads of trolls who will tell you your mother's a beech and you're an idiot if you bad the game.\n\nI will NEVER recommend this game.

For the most part, it does do a good job at that while telling a solid story.\n\nThe gameplay itself revolves around finding items to advance - I'd argue that even the included stealth elements and limited combat just serve as obstacles to get to new locations to search for the items needed to progress the story. It isn't easy either, as item highlighting ranges from limited to none, and the environments have a lot of detail and care put into them that make it easy to miss what needs to be picked up.\n\nThe game demands a good bit of attention paid to it while exploring, and that works just fine, as the atmosphere and presentation of the story throughout is top notch. I can certainly say I wouldn't have enjoyed the game if it was just a raw video game collectathon. As it is, I'm giving it a thumbs up.\n\nWith that said, there are some issues that made it a weak thumbs up.\n\nMuch of the game made me feel like it wasn't quite ready to get out of early access. I didn't run into anything game breaking, but there were plenty of small janky issues between camera jittering in small nooks, regular animation hiccups, etc. Some design elements also seem questionable or underdeveloped, such as losing the ability to revisit NPC dialogue topics. Good information and hints are lost if you forget or didn't write it down yourself, save for reloading a save to before when that dialogue was chosen. Even so, these are relatively minor grievances, and the developer appears to be working on various bug fixes that will hopefully continue until there's a fine polish.\n\nThe bigger issue, and the reason why my thumbs up is weak and hesitant, was the feeling of disappointment I got from the story. Big plotpoints did not resolved satisfactorily, or even at all - in fact, it felt outright incomplete, as though there's a missing final act.\n\nEven with its flaws, if you like atmosphere and story while exploring a game's every nook and cranny, I'd recommend giving this one a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1521278206, "timestamp_updated": 1521306185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748641490936279297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40867945": {"recommendationid": "40867945", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974965954", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1572, "last_played": 1521278014}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was wonderful.

There's an exciting trend happening in PC gaming right now where we see Indie purity of expression meeting Triple A production values. This game epitomizes that. \n\nRight off the bat, you can tell this is made by an ex-Dreamworks veteran. The animation and art design feel like a Pixar movie and Redwall book had an adorable baby. The graphics are spectacular (can't believe this is made in the Unity engine). The controls are fluid (played using gamepad) and intuitive, so much so, the controller often fades from thought, leaving an immersive link between yourself and the character. \n\nGameplay is a relaxing, yet engaging mix of stealth (Splinter Cell as a mouse anyone?) with some thoughtful puzzles and immersive world exploration. There are no MINIMAPS and NO OBJECTIVE MARKERS, and the game is better for it. Instead of mindlessly clomping towards an objective marker, you learn to navigate and explore a beautiful world, drinking in the detail. The immersion is heightened as a result. That said, once collected, there are maps you can quickly pull up without going to a separate menu. This is the perfect combination between keeping the focus on the environment, but also giving you some handy orienteering tools.\n\nThe writing is tight, punchy, and entertaining. There is no spoken dialogue or lip syncing and I absolutely prefer it that way. When someone talks, you enter a conversation window where the words appear over time (typewriter style) mimicking the natural delivery of speech. It's surprisingly effective and combined with the colorful and concise writing (no monotonous monologues), I wouldn't opt for high quality voice overs and lip syncing even if it were an option. This is a great example of turning a constraint into a boon.\n\nThe best part of the writing is the footnote system. Rather than relegate important information to a clunky codex buried in another menu, the game makes use of footnotes. During conversation, when a word or piece of lore comes up, you can toggle a footnote to read more about it. This makes the lore come alive in an efficient and engaging way without feeling like a chore. It sure is nice for the information you're curious about to be readily available at the same time, on the same screen as the conversation it's relevant to. It seems like a simple thing, but I can't think of a single game that uses the footnote system. Groundbreaking.\n\nLastly, this game oozes with character. With so many run of the mill clones out there, this game is refreshingly unique and original. This game is easily worth the price of admission for its uniqueness alone. Ontop of that, I haven't experienced any bugs (playing the full release), the game performs incredibly well, and the level of polish exceeds that of many AAA games (Final Fantasy 15 to name a contemporary). It's so good, I almost feel bad only paying 25 bucks for this gem. These are the kinds of developers that deserve our support.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521249027, "timestamp_updated": 1521317557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40860790": {"recommendationid": "40860790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009931952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69, "last_played": 1521999017}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1521246952, "timestamp_updated": 1521246952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450450420379638672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40860769": {"recommendationid": "40860769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044061387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1522263517}, "language": "english", "review": "Short review\nFun stealth RPG in a short but complex set of areas.\nGood story that has a nice flow to.\nThe game looks and sounds amazing.\nThe'er not bugs the're features and extra puzzles. \nDon't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck.\nAnd Rats are dumb just accept it. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1521246812, "timestamp_updated": 1521246812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515527963638305664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40858636": {"recommendationid": "40858636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032217407", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1923, "last_played": 1602359472}, "language": "english", "review": "True gem, handcrafted with love! \nVisuals are stunning, delivering cosy and atmospheric environments - dawns are beathtaking, I bet you'll be stopping amazed from time to time just to watch. \nSimple, but neat game mechanics, nothing hardcore or violent, and rather friendly gameplay with enough in-game hints&tips, game really stands to its 7+ rating (in good sense, really suitable fo kids)\nNPCs are fun, story is intriguing and protagonist is just the cutest little fella!\nWhatever bugs there are - are adressed and fixed immideately, I've never seen any team release patches *daily* before\nI nominated the game for \"Environment of the Year\", Would love to nominate in \"Dev of the Year\", but somehow SeithCG isn't available in neither the list, nor search for it", "timestamp_created": 1521238124, "timestamp_updated": 1542999485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40858627": {"recommendationid": "40858627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990798670", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 950, "last_played": 1523248316}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely fantastic game, even more so considering the size of the team working on it. There's lots of things about it I'd like to critique, like how the stealth falls through pretty much entirely as soon as you get a disguise, how easy it is to escape enemies when spotted. It shows that the lead dev started game development only five years ago.\n\nNonetheless, all these flaws are minor when you actually play. The visuals, the designs, the story, the characters, the world, it's all so well done, so finely crafted, dripping with charm. This game is a labour of love, and you can tell.\n\nThe level design is especially notable. It's reminiscent of the original dark souls (take a shot), as you find new places, and find new shortcuts throughout. It can get labyrinthine at times, but you will often enough acquire maps that help you navigate.\n\nNext up I'd like to commend the writing of the game, and the music that accompanies it. Throughout the game you meet a great many colourful characters, and interacting with them is a joy. Throughout conversations, they will mention lore-related topics, and you can get a quick lore snippet explaining what's being said. Read all of them. The lore draws you in, and has humor sprinkled throughout in all the right places. The pacing of the story is spot-on (I never felt like the ending just snuck up on me.)\n\nAs you play a minstrel, you will occasionally be asked by characters to play songs. If you read the songbook in your inventory, you might pick up on the fact that you'll occasionally have to play a song appropriate to the situation. Despite there being no voice acting in the game at all, the melody holds up by itself and as the lyrics accompany the song, you can just hear it play in your head. Again the writing is to be commended, as the songs range from heroic tales to shantys to satire to mockery to rude songs.

Sometimes you always hide in the same and only basket that is around in an area and the guards not even on the third time hiding there try to catch you. It would make a really really better game if guards would safely figure out where you are after some time so that they get you, you take dmg and then run to the next hideout.\n\nBut the Sound Design is awesome, the character design is awesome, it has very cool dialogues and very lovely drawn character heads with emotions in those dialogues. \n\nIf you want to have a slow game with dangerous exploring you are in the right place.\n\n\n------>>>> After Playthrough <<<<<------\n\nI must say. If I could give this game double thumbs up I would do because this story is incredibly well designed. It is so cute, it is funny, it is riddly, it is unexpected and also expected.

I got this game from a friend back in 2016 during early access (Since it was on my wishlist), i played only a little of it back then because it was unfinished and i told myself i'd get more into it when the game offically came out. The little i did play of it back then i knew i was going to love it so much. The Graphics and attention to detail caught me by surprise. It's possibly one of the cutest games i've ever got my hands on. I loved the fact it was a sneaking game too. I had no idea at the time i got this game what type of game this was, I only knew that you play as a mouse and i wanted it haha. I was not let down at all. But let it be known it's not exactly an easy game either. There's alot of puzzles, exploring and examing little things around you. I've managed to get lost quite abit but once you figure out what u have to do it's awesome. The dialogues in the game are pretty humorous as well. I've caught myself laughing alot at the things the NPCs say. It truly makes me smile. \u263a\n\nMy ONLY issue with this game is the fact that it can be too cute at times (I'm jk-ing about it being an issue btw). Often i'll catch myself just staring at my character (Tilo) and admiring the adorable little outfits you can wear and the beautiful scenery around him. \n\nNow that the game is fully released i can safely say this game is worth every penny. If you like cute things and you like stealth games this is SO for you. Currently there are quite a bit of bugs though, so i will say that. But i like the game too much to even care. So there's that. \n\nSide note: Playing this make's me feel bad whenever i hop on Wahammer: Vermintide 2 and murder rats (even tho they are evil too in this game) haha. \n\n10/10 I only wish i knew about this game back in it's early early development so i could of been a backer as well.

Please read at your own discretion.\n\n--\n\nThis game was like love at first sight for me. When I first played the Early Access back in the summer of 2017, I was instantly encapsulated by the wondrous scenery and breathtaking attention to detail. Every character felt distinct, with their own cute quirks and amusing dialogue, but not without some sense of dramatic gravitas every once in a while. The missions, both the main story missions and side missions, were fun to play through, and the story developed in such a gripping and natural manner that I could not help but keep playing to see what would happen next. And all of this is still true for the game.\nFor the first 6 hours.\nOnce you clear the catacombs, it becomes painfully obvious the rest of the game was rushed in order to make a viable release. The game starts to become more focused, more narrow, which is odd considering how open-feeling the first half of the game was. Certain quests that were immediately accessible in the Early Access version are now delayed later on into the story in order to give the player 'something' to do as a distraction. This is because, if the player buckles down and focuses on completing the side missions as soon as they get them, they will find that the story can be played through fairly quickly. Granted, I have already played through the first half of this game in Early Access, but because of how much has changed for the release version, I would argue my completion time of only 10 hours (not counting the six I played in Early Access) is probably going to be the average, give or take depending on how much they take their time or rush through. Note, that I did not complete all the side objectives, and there are certain challenge runs (don't eat anything, don't get caught, etc.) that will certainly lengthen the playtime of potential fanatics to possibly 20+ hours.\nBut the reason I can't recommend this, is because of two reasons.\n1. The game is quite buggy for a \"final\" release, and is frankly inexcuseable at this point.\n2. The game is outright not finished.\nThe first part is easy to explain, right? There are many issues with platforming, sound, and even dialogue in some cases, as well as the occasional save issue. At one point there was one particularly nasty sequence break I ACCIDENTALLY preformed, in which I skipped the Catacombs segment ENTIRELY. However, because of how linear the game's progression is, I still had to go back and complete the section in order to advance the main story.\nThe second part, on the other hand, is far more personal, and just outright insulting. As I mentioned earlier, it becomes clear in the second part of the game that much of the content feels rushed in order to reach the release date, however it gets even WORSE in the third part, near the end. Sections at this point lose any sense of polish, and start to feel like something you should see in an Early Access title, not a fully fledged release. There are no sounds for monsters, no new music, no new side missions, you are railroaded to completing the main story at this point, and while the story is still certainly gripping, I cannot imagine it holding the attention of the average gamer long enough for them to finish the game.\n[SPOILERS]\nBut the worst part is the ending itself. After finally figuring out where Merra, the protaganists' wife and MacGuffin, is, you unearth a pirate treasure on the shore which is revealed to house a crystal of the Green Flame, an apocalyptic force which arguably set in motion the events for both the lore and plot of the game. After defeating the crystal (with the help of your friends), you learn that the crystal is only a representation of the Green Flame's power, and the Green Flame itself is still housed at Periclave, the same island where Merra is supposedly trapped. It all lines up perfectly, and after tying up all the loose ends, you sail away in the rowboat to Periclave, and....\nThe credits roll.\nThat's it. You wanted closure? Too bad, have a credits screen.\nThis game is just objectively not finished. There is NO reason for Periclave to not be the final section of this game. Like, imagine if a movie ended this way. People would be PISSED, and rightfully so. This type of cliffhanger ending is just not condusive to good storytelling, because it is in no way satisfying or even worthy of being called a \"final\" ending for the game.\nI love this game, I really do, and I imagine I will certainly come back to it after a few weeks to go over the game and get 100 percent, complete all the achievements and challenge runs, and maybe even speedrun it. But, for the average consumer, I cannot recommend this.

If you don't want to read any more and want a tl;dr:, well, if you enjoy old school exploration, adventure games just go ahead and buy it. Now for the wall of text.\n\nBefore reading the review, let me tell you that I have learned this game will be released in two weeks so I decided not to play any more until it is released. So I have only 1.6 hours spent on the game as I am writing this review.\n\nFirst of all, setting and gameworld is really cute and stylistic. The feeling of being immersed in a fantasy world is there. The way the environment and characters are created is just a mixture of realism and fantasy. Actually, when I first started I thought it was going to take place in dungeons, but nope, it actually has a big enough world to explore. That surprised me a lot. I don't even know if there are other places as well.\n\nNow, most games have collectibles just to keep players in the game with no real value, like trinkets and stuff which add nothing to the game once found. However, this game does an amazing job with collectibles. Everything you collect actually serves something or adds to the depth of the game. Books add to the lore, costumes add to the character stats, foods and items can be used for various purposes and even mini-quests (not side-quests mind you) are fun to do and serve a purpose to further establish the lore. I actually solely explored the area during the two hours I played because I was so immersed in the game world that I totally forgot about the mission. Another great job there.\n\nAnother positive part of the game is that writing is good as well. Some jokes really made me giggle and characters are properly-built. No character so far made me think \"hmmm why the heck should I care about this character?\". They feel like a natural part of the game world. Collectibles that add to the lore are well written as well, there are just so much detail that if you like reading, you will have a fun time in this game.\n\nOne more thing I enjoyed is how well the game world is built. So many hidden areas, passages, things to discover etc. makes it actually fun to traverse the map. It is not dull by any means. Actually, it is so cleverly built that even backtracking isn't an issue for me and believe me, I don't like backtracking at all. \n\nThe only thing I don't like is that performance is a bit wonky. I honestly would not expect such a game to have performance issues. Ambient Occlusion completely obliterates performance for me and with it closed, I can play with around 45-60 fps, however, at some areas or while looking at certain objects, fps dips down to 20-30 so it is not really a stable experience. Anyway, it doesn't really hurt as it is not a competitive multiplayer game or anything, you can simply ignore.\n\nLong story short, a brilliant game in a time where not many well made games exist. I will wait until the full release before playing any further.

This game is suprisingly pretty. I wasn't really expecting the visual effects, etc... that were delivered, especially in a title that isn't yet finished. Theres a nice bit of \"cute\" humor like you would expect ou, well frankly, any games with animal protaganists. It may not be unique but damnit I enjoy that crap. The controls seem relatively decent, with the exception of if your being chased by a guard in which case they can, for some reason, get sluggish. Its not enough to pose a problem though. It was a nice touch that you had to collect outfits to \"fool\" specific npcs and not just for the one typical \"pose as a guard\" kind of quest. Also, I was pleasantly suprised that the outfits actually ended up having stat bonus' attributed to them.\n\nThe only complaint I really have at the moment is that the stealth aspect is a little too... easy... You can casually walk behind guards and as long as you stop a little every so often theyll never have any clue.

Musics sound great and  I absolutely love the ambiance of the game.\n\nFew bugs and crashes here and there, and the game isn't that well optimized...YET. But when you take in mind that the game is in Early Access and it is worked on by a very small team, you come to think that they have done a very good job. \n\nI absolutely recommend this to any stealth-adventure-rpg combo fan.\n\nEdit 1: added a bit to the mechanics part.", "timestamp_created": 1511888969, "timestamp_updated": 1513173362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509259223937988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37820259": {"recommendationid": "37820259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091298377", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1523031287}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, graphics, music...everything!", "timestamp_created": 1511813993, "timestamp_updated": 1511813993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37656479": {"recommendationid": "37656479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080342533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1511803114}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, amazing graphics, environment.

I bought this on Humble Bundle when I saw it was on sale for slightly cheaper than sticker price, so I decided to pick it up. The main thing that pulled me in were the graphics and the adorable character design. So, as this is an early access game, I was well surprised at the quality of the animations of the main character. When walking, sneaking, sprinting, jumping, or falling everthing was extremely smooth as if it has a proper weight to it. The gameplay is fun as a stealth game, it accomplishes the stealth well with several tools/places to hide which can give you the flexibility to play how you want. The quests amount to collectathons, this is fine as you can accomplish these as you move along the main story. This segways into the next point, the story, it's good and is relatively intriguing and makes you concerned for Tilo and his family. My only gripe with the game is probably the lack of voice acting, this is probably an intentional design choice and either way I am fine with or without it as it does not detract from the story or gameplay.
