This isn't a bad thing, I personally am a fan of walking simulator style games as a method to tell a story.\n\nThere are some puzzle and stealth elements baked into the experience, but nothing so exceptionally difficult and definitely seems to focus more on driving the story along rather than having you have to pause all that much at any given point.\n\nI do not want to spoil too much about the game, so I won't go too much into the themes that the game tackles other than to say I was not expecting it based on how the game looks on face value.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition, which I think is the only one you can buy now, also comes with a Prologue DLC for free. You have to go into the Chapters Menu to find it, and it's a good 30ish additional minutes of game play you won't want to miss.\n\n[h3][b]Recommendation[/b][/h3]\nI thought this game was great, and if you are someone that is not against walking simulator style games as a genre then I think this game is definitely worth experiencing. It's certainly a game that has a story to tell and it looks amazing while doing it. \n\n[h3][b]Video Example and Shameless Self Promotion[/b][/h3]\nI have a youtube gaming channel where I upload all my play through experiences, if you would like to check out the play through for this game (if nothing else to see how it looks before you buy), feel free to visit the links below. I will also out the link to the Prologue DLC play through if you're interested in that.\n\nMain Story Play Through:\nhttps://youtu.be/oowMcnKenFI\n\nPrologue DLC Play Through:\nhttps://youtu.be/t8paW266zBc", "timestamp_created": 1700161435, "timestamp_updated": 1700188916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150036772": {"recommendationid": "150036772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032122892", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "playtime_at_review": 178, "last_played": 1699834516}, "language": "english", "review": "Simultaneously cute and scary, with an emotionally impactful story.

If you are well versed in litterature or a certain genre of 80-90 series/movies, i doubt you wont be able to predict the basic aspects of the story or explain to yourself the gameplay mechanics.\n\nMore specifically to the game play: this is first person horror survival platformer the likes of which only baby Ezio Auditore would be able to go through (I mean, not only the skill on this baby, his cojones must have enough mass to generate gravitational pull).  The ambiance and design are coherent with what the game sets out to give you, AND if as a child you werent dead inside and had stuff happen to you, im sure you'll be able to recognize some patterns.\n\nThe reasoning for its thumbs up takes this into account and more, namely, the games is affordable AF, very well designed, very coherent with itself and its objective (which it achieves all through the game time) AND for a game released in 2017 (when a certain social virus was well on its way to ruining all of media) portrays a reality all too common which most people in the civilized world are not ready to admit happens A LOT MORE than just isolated cases (i mean, in my experience, THAT is a real pandemic).\n\nCould the game go rougher? yes.  Darker? yes.  Crazier?  Absolutely yes.  BUT ITS NOT WHAT THE GAME WANTED TO ACHIEVE.  in summary, a well made, surprising and affordable game which entertains you for a good ammount of hours... thats a thumbs up", "timestamp_created":

Mejor dicho, \"I Sleep\", jaja, COMEDIA!!!\n\nEn Among The Sleep juegas como un beb\u00e9 atravesando diversas areas tenebrosas junto a un oso teddy para recuperar recuerdos de tu madre e ir descubriendo el misterio detr\u00e1s de la historia que est\u00e1s protagonizando mientras huyes de una entidad que te acecha. \n\nSuena tenebroso en la pr\u00e1ctica, y lo podr\u00eda ser, pero aparentemente quienes desarrollaban el juego no solo hicieron al protagonista un beb\u00e9, sino que quiz\u00e1s pensaron que tambi\u00e9n lo iban a jugar beb\u00e9s porque te dedicas a caminar, resolver puzzles que no tardas en resolver m\u00e1s del tiempo que te tom\u00f3 caminar de lado a otro para agarrar las piezas para completarlos. \n\nEl monstruo que te persigue durante el juego debo decir que debe ser uno de los PEORES que me he encontrado en cualquier juego de horror, no porque sea aterrador, sino todo lo contrario, siento que es muy blando, extremadamente facil de evadir, muy poca presencia dentro de TODO el juego, creo haberlo visto unas 3 veces y ya, y sobre todo, no asusta. Quiz\u00e1 te pueda sorprender un poco la primera vez pues toda tu visi\u00f3n se va al traste, pero despu\u00e9s de eso toparselo no es la gran cosa. Simplemente aburrido.\n\nSi apreciamos el ambiente, creo que tiene una muy buena atmosfera, me gustan mucho los sonidos, agua chapoteando mientras caminas en un pantano, el flujo de un rio, el chirrido de puertas, la iluminaci\u00f3n, desde ese aspecto t\u00e9cnico creo que el juego es muy bueno, exceptuando los modelos de humanos, la madre parece sacada de la pel\u00edcula de la era del hielo.\n\nEncontr\u00e9 el protagonismo del Teddy Bear inutil, era pr\u00e1cticamente una linterna parlanchina cuya adici\u00f3n no cambia en nada el juego salvo que cuando te adentras en una nueva zona escuchas el di\u00e1logo \"Ser\u00e1 mejor que hagamos silencio....\". S\u00e9 que tiene ALGO de relevancia a la hora de la escena final, pero siendo franco, podr\u00eda no haber estado all\u00ed y el mensaje y probablemente el curso de la historia no habr\u00eda cambiado mucho.\n\nLa premisa es interesante, el aspecto t\u00e9cnico es fenomenal y de hecho, el mensaje que dan al final del juego y la historia me agradan mucho, pero siento que la ejecuci\u00f3n como tal del \"miedo y terror\" fallan, siendo un walking simulator con puzzles muy sencillos y con escenas menores de tensi\u00f3n. Para colmo, el juego solo me dur\u00f3 unas impresionantes 2 horas.\n\nSi van a comprarlo, haganlo en descuentos, porque definitivamente no merece el precio completo.", "timestamp_created": 1698558796, "timestamp_updated": 1698955719, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148827871": {"recommendationid": "148827871", "author": {"steamid": "76561199045613983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 497, "last_played": 1698204280}, "language": "english", "review": "The noises are creepy and it keeps you on edge!", "timestamp_created": 1698204391, "timestamp_updated": 1698204391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148758338": {"recommendationid": "148758338", "author": {"steamid": "76561199502705166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1698188688}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1698101141, "timestamp_updated": 1698101141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148672539": {"recommendationid": "148672539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033923039", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 244, "last_played": 1697990359}, "language": "english", "review": "Great artsy dreamy and nightmary graphics, marvelous sound stage, controls good.

Tenemos un lobby con cuatro escenarios diferentes (obligados) y cada escenario tiene ese toque que recuerda millones a Little Nightmares, donde no sabes si de verdad hay algo que nos \"persigue\" o solamente ha sido algo que se ha ca\u00eddo.\n\nY entra en juego la m\u00fasica y la bso, con unos sonidos muy pero que muy conseguidos (lo he jugado con auriculares) hasta ponerte los pelos de punta. Podremos encontrar coleccionables (dibujos) en cada fase. Como mec\u00e1nicas podemos gatear para escondernos, correr, agarrar y lanzar cosas y un inventario para poner llaves u otras cosas que nos permitan avanzar. Punto a favor es que es casi imposible morir o perderse.\n\nCuenta muy bien lo que quiere contar, una historia adulta de la que no entrar\u00e9 en spoilers vista desde los ojos de un beb\u00e9. Ese toque de escuchar cosas o parecer que has visto algo es lo que mantiene el punto de terror justo. Pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda muy malo, monstruos, huir, esconder. Para nada, podemos subir a muchos sitios libremente. No dir\u00e9 si hay monstruos o no para no joder la sorpresa, pero de verdad que hacen falta m\u00e1s juegos de terror light as\u00ed.\n\nEn general funciona en todo (subs en castellano y voces en ingl\u00e9s, poca accesibilidad y letra peque\u00f1a), buena historia, buena jugabilidad, perfecta duraci\u00f3n y espero que esta gente haga m\u00e1s cosas as\u00ed.

There's no replayability here, which means once you're done, you're pretty much done for good.\n\nThe story has a dark-ish vibe, even though it follows a predictable path. But I'm not too fussed about that. What did bother me a bit was that I wasn't really invested, mainly because I saw what they were going for once the first horror element was introduced.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty basic stuff. I never really felt threatened by the monsters; they're quite forgiving. I understand that the focus might not have been on making it super challenging, so I won't gripe about that too much. It's worth noting that the only time I died was when I unexpectedly fell through the floor\u2014make of that what you will.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, though I wouldn't call it fantastic either.

The idea of a helpless toddler navigating a twisted nightmare world was more than enough to intrigue me, even on paper. I eagerly anticipated its 2014 release, hoping to be drawn in by its premise alone.\n\nAnd this many years later, I still don't regret buying it. An all-time favorite, and not just in the Indie scene.\n\nYou don't play Among the Sleep for its graphical fidelity, or its mechanics (though the simplicity of said mechanics is still welcome), or any scripted scares. No, you play this game for its intimidating scale that makes you feel small and powerless, every step of the way. You play it for its dark, quiet, unsettling atmosphere, and unrelenting sound design that leaves you consistently anxious, even when no threat is present. You play it for its colorful, surreal, fantastical setting, with environmental storytelling that very cleverly leaves enough details to clue you in on the main twist before it even happens. And even then, it doesn't quite specify the full picture until it's sure you've seen enough.\n\nIf you're playing through this game with the intent of simply completing the objectives, you're doing it wrong. Don't just play it. Experience it. Take your time, absorb the environment, really get a feel for how tiny and isolated you are in a world so unfamiliar. Don't be afraid to look around. The visual cues will really engage you. And I don't just mean the collectible drawings. Look at the environments and see if they imply anything in particular.\n\nThis is a beautiful tragedy with a very adult message about perception, and how our choices and behaviors can greatly affect how our children see us, all told through the perspective of its victim.\n\nKrillbite nailed this one out of the park.", "timestamp_created": 1692331102, "timestamp_updated": 1692331102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144370517": {"recommendationid": "144370517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147594770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1577552802}, "language": "english", "review": "buy", "timestamp_created": 1692228773, "timestamp_updated": 1692228773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144346546": {"recommendationid": "144346546", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168382480", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1692202588}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Among the Sleep\" este o aventur\u0103 captivant\u0103 care te plaseaz\u0103 \u00een pielea unui copil mic, oferind o perspectiv\u0103 unic\u0103 \u0219i emo\u021bionant\u0103 asupra lumii din jur.

This game taps into something I've never experienced before, yet something everyone has felt but most don't remember. Of course the story is personal, but the small ways a child's mind twists the ordinary world is something that I've never seen explored before in a horror game. Its so well balanced, nothing feels over the top or forced, keeping things playful yet tense. There are a couple of bland parts, but the that's about 10% of the experience. The rest is something really special. The way the sounds were used, the size of the character, the visuals, it really tripped me out.\n\nThe story is also pretty good and grounded. Without spoiling anything, its something a lot can understand even if they didn't go through. And when the pieces come together it hits you hard.\n\nCan't recommend it enough.

You can stop dreaming and then immediately start dreaming again, as the title implies. As an unnamed infant you're going to go and explore the depths of your own mind and memories as a means of understanding and processing what is happening in your life.\n\nHonestly, this becomes pretty clear within about the first minute of the game before any actual gameplay takes place. The following levels really just touch on the emotional experience of it all both for the player and how they perceive it to be for the beings that they encounter. While I would have preferred the game to be a little more of a detective story, I'm not sure what one can reasonably expect to find in a game where you're literally playing a two year old.\n\nSo what's the goal here? Navigate modestly sized environments, avoid unpleasant roaming entities and figure out what the nightmare is all about - ignoring what I said before, it's fairly obvious right from the start - while optionally collecting drawings scattered around the levels.\n\n[b]*Gameplay[/b]\nAtS is essentially a stealth game but greatly simplified. Unnamed Child can open doors and hide in closets, crawl under furniture and move at surprisingly high speed when down on the ground. Running is an option but not for long. Basic item manipulation such as grabbing and throwing is possible and so is climbing up onto obstacles that are at perhaps chest height or so. Altogether this gives you enough ways of navigating the dream worlds you enter, looking for memories to recover. The foes you'll face wander the dream levels in solitude, warning you of their presence with strong visual and audio cues (distorted screen for one), giving you a chance to look for cover.\nSolid Snake you are not, but the game comes with a low enough difficulty that you don't have to worry about being perfectly hidden. Apparently all you have to do is be under something to be perfectly safe, alternatively hide inside something.\nThere are no real puzzles in the game but you do have to go around and collect an item here or there to unlock the way forward.\nIf there's anything I feel I should be commenting on it's the somewhat minor clunkiness of climbing objects. You sometimes need to get the proper angle for it to work and that can be a little annoying when the game is letting you know a baddie is nearby. I don't recall it ever seriously getting in my way of progress or survival, but it's a minor annoyance.\n\nThe horror part of the game is mostly the suspense of the nightmare creatures out to find and \"get\" you, aided by dark areas, oversized obstacles and items like boots or raincoats. The creatures themselves, being lonesome as they are, aren't particularly scary outside of the character design aspect. As a first time player getting into this game I was very careful and slow to move around and between 'cover' (read: furniture like coffee tables and beds) because I wasn't sure about the parameters of failure: how many enemies are there, how can I be detected, etc.\nYou're also not completely alone through most of the game, your new best friend Mr. Bear is usually with you to provide cuddles and light - emitted from him like a small beacon when held in front of you. This mechanic isn't quite necessary for progress but it's just what a two year old needs in a nightmare.\nTurns out that it's generally quite easy to get through any level without being caught out - doesn't matter if you can literally make eye contact with the monster in question, just being out of reach is enough.\nClearly the intention is for you to be able to take in and appreciate the environments the devs have crafted for you, getting through the game like you would a short story rather than a puzzle or a challenge of skill.\n\nIn conclusion, expect a fairly smooth ride all the way through. The gameplay isn't dazzling, there's no clever mechanics or clever gimmicks but when you see it as more of an interactive little story it's rather decent. Story-wise, it doesn't REALLY end up going anywhere helpful. There's also a prologue level available that sets up the main game but again, no ending. Is it something the game absolutely needs? No, I suppose not. But it still would've been nice, barring any kind of sequel.\nSo, have you got this title sitting in your backlog, collecting virtual dust? Dust it off, have a go at it and check it off your list in a few hours time!\n\n[b]**Achievements:[/b] Perfectly in line with just beating the game itself, acquiring the achievements for Among The Sleep is quite easy and can be done within a single (your first, in fact) playthrough. All you have to do is literally play around a bit in the first playable part of the game, beat the game and find all of the drawings scattered around the levels. Naturally you can find their locations in steam guides but with the levels not being huge and complicated, you likely won't need a guide at any point. Just be sure to look in every corner. Most of them are in plain sight, lying under furniture, in a closet or something like that. Find 10 per level and you're done! Start looking for them after night falls and from then on in every level, including the prologue that's available from the main menu. Happy art hunting!\n\n***\nVisit our curator page to see more reviews or our steam group for more info:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/7822855/\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreview", "timestamp_created": 1681407223, "timestamp_updated": 1681407223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136617642": {"recommendationid": "136617642", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013409327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1698587986}, "language": "english", "review": "its scary asf\n", "timestamp_created": 1681378522, "timestamp_updated": 1681378522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136594346": {"recommendationid": "136594346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032615196", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1681332188}, "language": "english", "review": "Creepy concept playing as a toddler looking for its mother.

And of the many things being pitched that day, the premise that stuck with me the most was that of a child and his teddy bear braving unknown horrors, with the teddy bear assuming a more proactive role to ensure the child's safety. When I was made aware of Among the Sleep's existence, my initial assumption was how this game would fit that bill.\n\nUnfortunately, I was wrong.\n\nRather than a horror or adventure game, Among the Sleep turned out to be a very boring walking simulator. The game tries to creep you out pretty early on, but doesn't really follow through with its threats. Contrary to what the teddy bear warns you upon gaining access to new areas: you don't really have to be quiet, you don't have to avoid lingering in any one particular area. And most importantly: you don't have to be scared, because nothing ever happens.\n\nThe game is unbelievably linear. The game starts at your house, a couple of story elements compel you to explore, you inevitably end up in an otherworldly hub from where you travel to a small number of linear worlds in a specific order. In each world, you go on a fetch quest to unlock the exit that allows you to return back to the hub to travel to another linear world to perform another fetch quest. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe game nails the atmosphere down, but it doesn't make any creative use of its elements. The only thing you get out of being a baby is a unique camera angle, and when the teddy bear isn't acting as the game's guide/narrator, he serves the purpose of a glorified lantern to light up dark areas.\n\nThe game is boring.\n\nAnd I could keep rambling on, but I feel confident that \"boring\" really summarizes well my opinion on Among the Sleep.", "timestamp_created": 1679320560, "timestamp_updated": 1679320560, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134952984": {"recommendationid": "134952984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098949081", "num_games_owned": 1029, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1635517635}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an ok horror game, but quite short.

Ese punto de singularidad se lo da el hecho de que tomamos el papel de un ni\u00f1o de dos a\u00f1os, y lo cierto es que le sienta de maravilla, ya que consigue hacerte sentir la vulnerabilidad y el miedo del peque\u00f1o.\n\nCon ayuda de nuestro amigo, un osito de peluche que habla (esto ya lo he visto...), vamos en b\u00fasqueda de nuestra madre (la cual da miedo, todo sea dicho). La verdad es que la ambientaci\u00f3n es una gozada. Esa mezcla de elementos infantiles y t\u00e9tricos es un gran acierto. El tipo de gr\u00e1ficos tambi\u00e9n ayuda a crear esa atm\u00f3sfera.\n\nA pesar de que dura poco (unas 3 horas), y aunque en lo jugable es simplemente un walking simulator, me ha parecido un soplo de aire fresco en el mundillo del terror.

Story wise, the dev's are absolutely brilliant in the use of symbolism, a child's POV, and incredibly complex situations. I admit, I was not prepared for this story when I streamed this game. I absolutely applaud the writers of this story and how well it was executed with subtlety, finesse, and just enough of a push when needed to \"see\" the reality of the situation.\nGameplay, art and sound design was fun and enjoyable, in matching with the storyline and the overall feel of the game, a child in a nightmare landscape, you are walking through a nightmare solving puzzles. There were a few instances in gameplay that were frustrating, I personally struggled a bit with the field of vision as it just felt a bit off, however it was a minor inconvenience at worst. The swamp area was very maze like and easy to get lost in, again though, minor inconvenience at worst. The art design in most levels were simplistically stunning in some levels, i.e. you never play as a toddler, this POV provides a fresh challenge, and the art design builds around this POV as opposed to just \"lowering the camera.\"\nFinal thought, Among the Sleep is a gem of a game and I would highly recommend grabbing it. While Among is a bit on the shorter side, it can be completed fairly quickly in about 2.5 hours, it delivers an absolutely brilliant and emotional gut punch from a unique perspective, AND it is still most certainly a horror game which, at least in my perspective, makes it that much better! 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1668708819, "timestamp_updated": 1668708819, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125607113": {"recommendationid": "125607113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137845930", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1637224814}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a fun game that had good visuals and soundtrack.

The concept is pretty remarkable and leaves me wondering why other games haven't already fully exploited it or at least tried to replicate it to some degree. The plot is pretty mundane and straight forward, but made compelling by its perspective. \n\nIt's a little buggy and terribly short. Like 2 hours short. Definitely not worth the price tag at $17, no matter how enhanced the version is. Also, small gripe, but I did not receive access to the prologue dlc, I guess because I bought before the enhanced version came out and didn't get the upgrade?

Ever since, this game kept going in and out of my head but i could never find it. I had such vivid, but very few and specific memories of it. Once i found the game, it was new to me again. I knew nothing about it, despite having seen and loved it before. The part that i remembered so vividly was the library. I remembered the bookshelves and the monster, but that was it.\n\nI didnt expect this game to take the dark turn it took, i kept thinking to myself \"This is all in the protagonists head\", but it was so much more than that. Everything here was amazing, but a tinge too easy. The parts that were scary were really frightening, but the parts that werent were a bit too common.\n\nI have to give props to Krillbite Studios for something that most people probably wouldn't pick up on, and thats the fact that you're completely helpless. You have no weapon, you're slow and small, the only defense you have is being able to hide, but you cannot run.\n\nI got this game on 75% sale during the Steam Halloween 2022 sale, but i would have paid full price for it. In fact, i was going to pay full price, but it just so happened that this game was on sale right as i was about to buy it. Even if its not on sale for you, i would fully recommend getting this game anyways.\n\nThe game is short and doesnt overstay its welcome, just when you start thinking \"Is it over soon?\", you're right at the end, both for good and for bad.\n\nThe gameplay and story is 8/10.

You control a lost toddler and with the help of your teddy bear you will need to find your mother, while avoiding the monster that is chasing you (similar to the new Resident Evil 2). The level design is solid and varied and the story is compelling, and a little sad when you find out what the monster is.\n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]  \n[b]How many:[/b] 10  Achievements, you\u2019ll need to find some hidden collectibles.\n[b]How much time:[/b] Around 4 hours, with a guide for the collectibles.\n[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Easy. The puzzles and platforming are simple and you\u2019ll only need to run and hide from the monster in some of the levels.\n[b]Achievements\u2019 Difficulty:[/b] Easy. The harder achievement will be getting all the collectibles, that would take a lot of time without a guide since there are a lot of them, but there are guides to help. The prologue has to be picked from chapter select, it won\u2019t load either before or after the ending.\n\n[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  \nIt\u2019s a horror 3D platformer where you play as a toddler. It has a compelling story and solid level design and ambiance. Both the platforming and puzzles are easy and you'll go through the game at a fast pace.\n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group Ribbon Hunters for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/ [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1660123341, "timestamp_updated": 1660123341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120243591": {"recommendationid": "120243591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799290166", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 288, "last_played": 1696804435}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMONG US", "timestamp_created": 1659907978, "timestamp_updated": 1659907978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120192355": {"recommendationid": "120192355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006951888", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 297, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1604243191}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1659834154, "timestamp_updated": 1659834154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120017116": {"recommendationid": "120017116", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024836865", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1659265054}, "language": "english", "review": "Boy and Teddy's Journey into a Nightmare.", "timestamp_created": 1659564828, "timestamp_updated": 1659564828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119906014": {"recommendationid": "119906014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036537462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1658979015}, "language": "english", "review": "The story was just too sad and trauma related, which is not everyone's game flavor.

OK. This is a pretty creepy, very tense and very short game with only one ending. Including its prologue, it only took me 5 hours to play through, so get it during a sale.\n\n+ Great graphics which strike a perfect balance between a childlike cartoon style and an absolute creepfest of terror. What should be fairly ordinary, common, house-hold objects take on terrifying aspects.\n\n+ But really, it\u2019s the fantastic sound that makes this game as good as it is. I have never heard a heartbeat sound effect done so well and so subtly in ANY game. All the other ambient, environmental sounds also combine to create one of the most tense, foreboding atmospheres I have ever heard in a game.\n\n+ Great idea to make your character be a defenseless 2 year old child. I have never felt so weak or helpless in any game. The consistency with which this game presents that first-person perspective is excellent. You walk poorly. You crawl faster but then can\u2019t see as well. Everything is tall and most things seem hopelessly out-of-reach. You wind up constantly looking for things to hide beneath, just in case.\n\n+ There\u2019s no gore in this entire game but I found it to be one of the more creepy games I\u2019ve ever played. Although this game is about a little kid, this game is not intended for little kids I think.\n\n+ Don\u2019t forget to play the \u2018prologue\u2019 in the level select menu. It is possibly even better than the main game However, it might be best to play it after you play the main game.\n\n+/- This game features unlockable making-of extras in the form of a 3D museum of sorts. I think it would have been better to have ALL included background information about this game unlocked by default instead of hidden behind a requirement to collect various children\u2019s drawings during the game. Why hide your work?\n\n+/- The key bindings menu recognized my additional mouse buttons. However, the controls can be clunky at times. It is overly difficult to climb onto objects or to lift your feet over short changes in elevation. Sometimes you cannot easily get into cabinets or onto shelves which should be (and appear to be) easy to get into or onto.\n\n+/- Dying isn\u2019t scary. Being in danger of dying is really scary but actually dying isn't scary. This can cause dangerous situations to lose their sense of danger and this is one of the greatest challenges facing horror games; how do you maintain a sense of danger without making the game frustrating?\n\n+/- This is, ultimately, a fairly easy game. The puzzles are usually straightforward though they do involve several basic fetch-quests. However it can be hard to know exactly where the game wants you to go. \n\n+/- There is perhaps too much mystery in this game. Until you get to the end of the game you really don\u2019t have any real clue as to what is really happening.\n\n+/- The end is poignant and meaningful but it is also somewhat unsatisfying. You might feel like you, as a game player, went through a fairly anxious, stressful and tense game for not much of a reward. But perhaps that makes some sense too, given the game\u2019s ending circumstances. This game's ending has important messages.\n\n- There is only 1 ending for this game and the events in this very short game are so memorable that there is little reason to ever want to replay it. Hence, this game has no replay value. \n\nSo what we have here are 5 possibly overpriced, (unless you get this game on sale) fairly stressful, creepy hours of quasi-fun before you get to an ending which is so serious in its tone that, while it explains the game it also, in a way, spoils any sense of fun it previously had (and you might even guess the ending before you get there). This is all presented with nice graphics, truly excellent sound effects and from a very unique first-person perspective. \n\nIf Among the Sleep was a little longer and allowed more freedom to get different, alternate endings I\u2019d almost certainly rate it higher (if its greater length didn\u2019t also make it repetitive). As it is though, it\u2019s merely OK but, if you get it cheap, it's certainly worth playing through once.", "timestamp_created": 1659334902, "timestamp_updated": 1659336152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616888642311096191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119839371": {"recommendationid": "119839371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198875433521", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 250, "last_played": 1659293478}, "language": "english", "review": "7.5/10 This game is good, I really like the idea of playing as a 2 year old and experiencing horror as a kid even though the real situation is not as scary as the kid sees it.

Along with the child protag. it's a small detail but anything that has lettering is gibberish, which adds to the whole you are a child. \n\nThe game play itself may be short, but it's still worth your while. I love this game to bits. I played when I was younger I'm a bit older replaying and I didn't understand much then, but now there's so much. it honestly makes me tear up it's sad once you think about it. To start teddy which is gifted from your dad to you has the voice of your father, which he guides you through and helps and makes you feel safe. the main game itself is great in my opinion, the perfect amount of cute, creepy, and heartwarming in a way. I like the idea you go through your house and find memories with your mom when she's the monster. \n\nThe prologue was great, it's short and it made me sad :( I DIDN'T GET THE LAST STUFFED TOY AND HE'S LOST IT IN THE SNOW :(. \n\n\nOverall id give it a 10/10 there's one bug in this game I ran into it's not game-breaking you reset the checkpoint and it's 100% fine. This is in my top 5 for horror games. brings a lot of emotions out.\n\nI think it is neat to see a game in the future like you're grown up and teddy is with you, or you play as teddy. just something that crossed my mind.\n\nanyway thanks to the devs for making this game, truly was a great experience. <3.", "timestamp_created": 1656117577, "timestamp_updated": 1656117577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439999967813491821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117539105": {"recommendationid": "117539105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250981524", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 148, "last_played": 1656059117}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a pansy, so you probably won't find this as scary as I did.

The view is out of a baby and you get basically to know how the world for a small toddler can be, it can be scary sometimes. I would include a Trigger Warning for people who suffer from alcohol abuse as *SPOILER* in the end you see the Mother being drunk and consuming alcohol *SPOILER END*\n\nThe graphic, the soundtrack and the overall feeling of the game are something what will truly amaze you, for people who play with controller...the support is incredible. I played controller and keyboard, the controller is as smooth as keyboard. If you wanna support a creator I would recommend that game. It deserves more attention. If you are scared you need definitely over 12h to complete it (as mentioned...I started my horror gaming carreer with it and it took me 10h to complete as I constantly stopped, hid and didn't wanted to continue without someone call with me on discord)\n\nif you are further into horror you usually can complete it in 2 - 3 hours.

Unfortunately it fails to deliver a complete and strong experience. Right from the beginning it doesn't give you a purpose. You just wonder expecting something new to happen. The plot has no continuity and the entire game is an abstract, random turn of events. The gameplay feels unresponsive and the puzzles are completely uncreative. Also the visuals seemed to me a bit clunky. Yet, I'm upvoting it just for those few parts that managed to give me some atmospheric, really creepy moments.\n\n\nManometer: 5/10[/b]\n\n\nThe good\n- It's an interesting concept to control a two years old baby that barely walks, trying simultaneously to be stealthy.\n- Well designed, imaginative world. Nice atmospheric lighting through the entire game. It looks really surreal at some points and with the change of scale it strongly reminds me of something like \"Alice in Wonderland\".\n- Some parts look like nightmares. They're really creepy with strong, dark atmosphere.\n- A few nice mechanics here and there (like hugging the bear to fear less). Also it's interesting that crawling is faster and more steady than walking. You are a baby after all.\n- Ultra-wide camera initially seemed to me extreme and a little bit tiring. But it worked well on creating an impression of deformation along with a stressful feeling.\n- It talks about some serious social issues, although it does it in a shallow way.\n\nThe bad\n- There is no continuity to the plot and it gets too abstract or symbolic at some points. You don't know why all these are happening. I get it that a baby wouldn't understand too but you need a reason, a purpose to play. The entire game looks like a random turn of events. A random world after another without a profound connection to each other. You don't even know what and why haunts you. You just walk and explore without a purpose just waiting for something new to happen.\n- Gameplay feels heavy and not fluid at all. Ok, you're supposing to control a clumsy baby but you cannot enjoy the game with such unresponsive mechanics. Also puzzles are extremely simplistic and childish. Something more creative or challenging would be nice.\n- Mediocre visuals. Everything feels clunky from the models to the low resolution, blurry textures. It just feels unpolished. They could have followed a more minimalistic approach if they hadn't the budget.\n- Sound design is excessive. All the time you hear distant sounds, screams, creaks, voices and more without a profound reason, when nothing really is happening. It tries to create a spooky atmosphere but most of the time audio doesn't fit to the game's pace and on-screen action.\n- Voice acting is not that convincing.

I don't want to go into spoilers, but anyone with a keen eye will know where this is all likely headed after the introductory scene.

I didn't encounter any bugs and that's a minor miracle with the current state of gaming. It has some collectible busy work that as far as I can tell is just to get some achievements and adds nothing to the game. Why it's even there is a bigger mystery than the game ever presents. So why am I rating this as a yes?

It has no sense of peril and all the \"sad story\" comments/reviews/accolades are lying to you. Its short and does not deliver on its unique concept. If you are a seasoned horror game player, chances are you will find this game lacking. if you are a newcomer, there's a million other things you should play instead. Scares are laughably easy to predict and have been done before. I can not recommend this game.\n\nPros\n- art style is decent, nothing fantastic, but good for a small time indie developer, even considering its 4 year old age. \n- there is a GOOD sense of atmospheric horror throughout. \n- its a unique concept. Not many games have you playing as a toddler, but the concept is explored very briefly\n- the first few minutes of the game are fantastic\n- tying in with the atmosphere, I enjoyed the sound design. It adds to tension\n- great companion in the game. Teddy is fantastic\n\nCons \n- length. It's a short game I was able to complete in 3 hours. It's full price is almost $17 dollars. \n- it does not deliver on the concept of playing as a toddler. After the intro and a small amount of time afterwards, you can replace the character with basically anyone. This is a real shame, how great would a horror game be if it expressed childhood fears?\n- the atmosphere is tense, but you soon realize there is really no sense of danger minus a few parts\n- there is no story. I mention this because many reviews praise its poignant story. There's 2 wham scenes that one could consider emotional. Otherwise, there's really nothing besides \"grab plot coupons\".\n- the puzzles are among the simplest you can expect in a horror game. The gameplay boils down to find an object, plug it in a hole. \n- the environments you explore are uninspired, linear, and nonsensical. There is not an overlapping theme to what you are exploring, nor a connection to the story. It would be the same as Resident Evil going from a mansion, to a desert after entering a door, then the ocean after another one.\n- lack of scares. There is good building up, but again, you realize that nothing but a door slamming or an object falling awaits you when the tension reaches its peak.", "timestamp_created": 1640931582, "timestamp_updated": 1640931582, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493764489889144897", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106941432": {"recommendationid": "106941432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245230992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 198, "last_played": 1640905935}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, a charming, well-constructed game with great atmosphere/tension and lovely visuals.

I tried to get a refund on this crap and but because I left the game on once, it had clocked up 9 hrs playtime. You can only get a refund if you have played up to 2 hrs.  I already have it uninstalled and want of rid of this junk permanently. And now my review...\n\n1 Don't buy this (or at least not until you read point 3)\n2 Don't trust star ratings or go by the first few hits on Google \n3 ***Do read proper reviews***  \n\nApart from the sheer sense of time wasting you get when plodding around looking for tokens, the play is clunky and annoying. It is one of those amateurish games where a company had a lovely idea and then screwed it up by not being able to turn the dream into a reality. They have effectively stolen a cute and creepy idea through poor execution and lack of imagination. Which is a pity, because a baby based horror could be great. \n\nTips/Spoiler alerts. \nYou are practically invincible. Turn down the sound and up the gamma. you might as well let a toddler play this. You are told, literally TOLD, by the talking teddy what to do. Which is just as well, because it it easy to end up pointlessly stumped,\n\nMostly though you can just ignore the teddy - especially when it says to be quiet. Don't bother. There is nothing there that will harm you. It's all sound effects. You are creeping around and hiding for nothing. Cheap game dynamic. One you see through the trick you can get on with playing in invincible mode.  \n\nAnyway, to finish - my life is too short to throw good time after bad money and finish this. I've heard it improves, but it would have to a massive, massive jump in quality for me to continue playing. I have been tempted to do so.. just to see.... but I suspect it will be yet another fools errand. So, no thanks, \n\nAs I say, do read other reviews too. Apparently this was a student project. It certainly feels like it. Yuck.

But the most (unintentionally) scary thing about this game is definitely your teddy bear companion; he gives me the heebie jeebies and I do not trust that MF at all... I'm still convinced he's at fault for all the nightmarish things that happen in the game.\n\nThe story is simple enough and is played through the eyes of a toddler which I think they pulled off quite well. The environments are interesting as they are translated into what a toddlers \"world\" could look like to them.\n\nJokes, aside: $17 feels a bit steep for a game that can be casually beaten in less than 3 hours with no alternate endings or anything. I did, however, enjoy the game. Get it for $5 and I'd say it'd be worth it.\n\nYou can watch my livestream gameplay of the game over on my [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wqUMU0a9g&list=PL0q93Rkkmx_t21E8REGuCz3Gt5H3mlq_3]YouTube Channel[/url]!", "timestamp_created": 1634068140, "timestamp_updated": 1634766741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603892147541046143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100949540": {"recommendationid": "100949540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021045675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 185, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1634058535}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool little short indie horror, interesting little story it tries to portray.

The story surprisingly has a great twist at the end which changes the players whole outlook on the events that lead up to that point. The character of Teddy is fine, nothing really made him stand out as anything special except for being an in-game mechanic that i will mention further down in this review. The mother is fine as well but isn't really relevant or shown any characteristics until the end of the game. \nThe setting of the child's imagination is so creative with different sections like the playhouse and the park being twisted into this dark imagery that works in favour for the game. \nGraphically, it's a great improvement from the original, however the design of the mother still looks really off (and more scary than the monsters that you encounter in my opinion!!!) and some textures regarding the areas or objects still look a bit dated. The design choices of everything that would be associated with a child such as bedtime books, parks and playhouses are done up in this twisted, nightmarish way and it looks amazing. This definitely helps with some of the dated textures to blend in more. \nThe soundtrack wasn't really that present and when it was i never really noticed it which was really disappointing. Audio in this game is great. From the simple shuffling of the child to doors creaking, it really made the overall experience that much more immersive. The only time where the audio really bugged me was when the monsters were near the player which made this really annoying white noise-esque sound. It felt like the game went for a loud = scary approach.\nIn terms of gameplay, it really let me down. The main premise of this game is to collect all the objects for the different areas that the child has to venture to, to reach his mother. While i'm not expecting any crazy game mechanics, it just didn't feel like there was anything to do except crawl about areas, grab an object and place in a certain place and move onto the next area where while it may be a change of scenery, it ultimately leads to rinse and repeating what had just been done. While the mechanic of hugging Teddy being this light source and reducing fear is a good idea in concept, the execution really fell flat as he was never really needed. The monsters that you encounter as well weren't really that scary or intimidating either. In fact I actually found it really easy to evade them and move onto the next section. While this game may be a 'horror' game, at no point did i feel scared or even tense during my playthrough. \nOverall, while Among the sleeps' storytelling and design may be the focal points, it really lacks that intense gameplay that a good horror game should. However, i do believe that you should experience at least one playthrough of this game as it may resonate more with others than it did myself. \n", "timestamp_created": 1625616897, "timestamp_updated": 1625616897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95206197": {"recommendationid": "95206197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132699033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1675520025}, "language": "english", "review": "Its scary but really cute and cool i like teddy :3\n", "timestamp_created": 1625604186, "timestamp_updated": 1625604186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95179834": {"recommendationid": "95179834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324857509", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 126, "last_played": 1604176742}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there was an option to make a mixed review...\n\nThe game was good, the concept was great, the atmosphere was good and the gameplay was pretty damn fun and not too hard to figure.\nbut the game itself has so many problems and some of them are even for being a horror game.\n\nLet's get straight to the point. if it is one of your first horror games or you are generally pretty easy to scare, this game will do the job for you and you probably won't even finish it as it's getting spookier each faze you are going through.\n\nbut if you came here after finishing outlast or something, you might as well keep looking for a new horror game to play.\nlet's get into some spoilers here so stop reading if you are into the game.\nthe game as they let you know at first sight is about a mother that celebrates her little baby his birthday.\nThe baby managed to pull his BD gift out of the box and it was a teddy bear, surprisingly a talking teddy bear.\nsomething is after them as much as we know and it isn't explained to us what is this thing, just a big darkness thing.\nthey are going into the closet and entering a wired looking world that summed up to a little cabin that has a certain amount of doors I'm not sure how much, each door leads the kid to a new location with some cool puzzles he has to solve, all that while a \"creepy\" looking ghost tries to hunt him down. **I'm going to talk about the ending now and it's a very good one so please if you haven't played the game or watched the full gameplay please stop reading**.\n\nWhen you finish the game you get to know that the ghost that tried to hunt you down was an implication of your mom's behavior as she was a drinker that mentally hunted you down as you are playing a baby and you couldn't really realize what was happening around you clearly. then your father picked you up and took you away from her as she was mentally ill. \n\nThe ending is rough, great, and went extremely well with the whole game and left me supremely satisfied, and that is the main reason why I left a positive review.\n\nCons:\n-The game constantly made some floor textures invisible and teleported me under platforms when I was simply tried to explore the place a bit. which completely ruined the experience of the game for me.\n\n-It simply ruined the scary vibe it created. the ghost that hunted you was god awful modeled and worse than that it acted worse than a Skyrim NPC.

[u]Graphics and story[/u] [i]9/10[/i] ([i]Among the sleep[/i] is a game about the story of a little boy who lives with his murky mother. A divorced mother with alcoholism problems. For she fears that will be separated from her son. But the boy still doesn't understand the mother's situation and the game offers understanding from the infant experience. Despite being a short story, we immerse ourselves in surreal landscapes as a little boy. The landscapes are quite artistic, between surrealism and expressionism with vivid colours and contrast lighting. From that point of view, we can see something simple like a piece of furniture transform into a creepy creature that prowls in the gloomy places of the rooms. The character develops in the story and we'll see how he sees things and situations with strong expressions. Furniture, objects and places have undergone a metamorphosis from reality to the experiential understanding of the little boy. The only friend and guide is his birthday present, a teddy bear. A character who will help the little boy to return the memories of love between he and their parents. The adventure of this game takes place at night, in the dream of the boy and his bear in a sullen world.)\n\n2. [u]Playability[/u] [i]10/10[/i] (The dynamics of the game is in the first person. The character movement is guided according to the children movement ability, crawling and slow walking. The game consists of exploration and solving some simple puzzles to progress through the story. And each object for the puzzle, in reality, is an important object with a sentimental charge. It has a meaning. There is also a visual narrative through drawings that show the emotional states between the little boy and his mother. These drawings allow a better understanding of the story. The character can interact with some objects and his teddy is our storyteller. A narrator who will tell us what to do in such situations, how to overcome an obstacle, as well as the implicit meaning of the objects to open doors. The adventure is a learning of the character and an experience of what he lives.)\n\n3. [u]Music and FX[/u] [i]9/10[/i] (The soundtrack is composed of ambient music. Dark ambient sounds accompanied by drone ambient. Music often creates tension and mystery. Other times it appears as if it were all a dream. We'll not listen to lullabies, but rather a dark form of the tension of the little boy experience. Sound variations of objects, creatures, ambient tones. Like the surreal sound of the saxophone like the cries of his mother or brief sounds of the chimes of the bell accompanied by a background of rain sound. Music offers impressions of things and scenarios. Each thing and object has its music. The feeling that the developers have created with the music, is the involvement of the varied sounds and accompanied by the narration and the essential moments of the character. Variation of tensions from calm to anxiety. All those variations capture our impressions, as well as the image and the narrative. Music is the representation of the little boy experience and according to how he sees around him in his situation. The music also narrates his adventure.)\n\n4. [u]Duration[/u] [i]9/10[/i] (Unfortunately, the story is short. But it's a story with a solid narrative structure. The journey is linear, but with the possibility of exploration. A prologue was added, where it indicates the way to play and an introduction to the story: a winter before the separation of the son with the mother. One can start with the prologue to get acquainted with the plot and dynamics of the game. Know the boy perspective and how he understands his home from his point of view. The game offers a different perspective, how children see everyday life.)\n\n[h1]Recommendation: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1623282090, "timestamp_updated": 1623282090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600087165832519531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93486049": {"recommendationid": "93486049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014969223", "num_games_owned": 591, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1623279200}, "language": "english", "review": "Fine/10 like it's alright, mum has a dump truck of an ass.", "timestamp_created": 1623279103, "timestamp_updated": 1623279103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93479396": {"recommendationid": "93479396", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090257816", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1658610070}, "language": "english", "review": "I was expecting much more gameplay.

I wanna try and keep this simple and spoiler-free, as I do not like to over-complicate things, nor do I like spoiling games as I want/like others to get a full experience. Though, This review may be a little long.\n\nNow, let's get into the actual review; I ADORE the game and story. It's concise, easy to understand, and I am sure many (including myself) can relate to it in some way. Not everyone of course, but I am sure many can. Though, I want to reiterate is that the story is easy to understand and say that it is not a bad thing at all! (Personally) I do not like stories that are all big and bulky, where one must unravel many strings\u2014from an entire ball of yarn (heavy, long lore). Especially, considering someone like me as I am neurodivergent and have trouble with comprehension, most notably with stories and plots. I also love the subtle hints given; whilst they are not too subtle, they are enough to get you thinking and speculating about what is going on. It is a short game (about two hours and a half) but the experience is enjoyable.\n\nI do enjoy the visuals, I do. The colours fit for what part of the story (or level) you're on and help the theme, as colours can make or break a scene's \"feel\". I feel the child-like viewpoint was nailed right on the head, as children have a real talent with their imagination and how they view things\u2014and it can get a bit wild! Yes, this is a puzzle/horror game, but it's very fun. Most times, I find puzzles to be boring! However, this game did make them feel fun, maybe because of the childlike-lense we are seeing through and that they're fairly simple.\n\nTo be honest, I can't particularly think of things I dislike about this game. I guess I don't particularly like \"SMALL CHILD IN BIG SCARY WORLD\" or something along those lines, but, I don't know if I can fault it for that since I think it was a pretty popular/common theme at the time of the original release in 2015 from what I can remember. Plus, it deals with the subject in question pretty well in my opinion, and it doesn't have the same plot as other games with a similar premise of \"SMALL CHILD IN BIG SCARY WORLD\". As for the controls? They aren't bad at all, they're alright for the most part. I encountered a minor annoyance maybe once or twice, but that's okay. As long as it is playable, I'll roll with it. I do wish there was a bit more to the game's story, just a bit more! Although, I am happy with the story for the most part; STILL love that it's concise and simple.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you are interested in it, want a short game to play, want something easy to understand if you have troubles similar to mine, or even if you're just bored and want something to do. Sorry for making this so long, but I do appreciate it if you have read this far; it means a lot. With that said, I wish you a wonderful morning/day/noon/evening/night, or whatever time you are reading this review!\n\n(P.S. Make sure to set a keybind for throwing objects! You won't need it until the very last level or so, but I figured this would be a good note to add in here at the end. I set mine to G, but do whatever is the most comfortable for you.

I would have liked to explore the museum on my own.  \n\nIn summary, the core game was really good and the moderately low FPS wasn't really a problem in playing the game, but they just didn't bother to optimize their DLC levels in any way whatsoever, which is a huge shame.", "timestamp_created": 1616973531, "timestamp_updated": 1617042309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89256148": {"recommendationid": "89256148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013580872", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1616941830}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Durante el desarrollo del juego no entender\u00e1s absolutamente nada de la historia, eres un ni\u00f1o de dos a\u00f1os que se queda dormido y empieza a mezclar un mundo on\u00edrico con partes de una realidad bastante confusa, hasta que todo se aclara al final, con lo que es parte del encanto del juego.\n\nY digo encanto del juego por decir algo, porque a los que se\u00e1is de padres separados (como es mi caso) desde la ni\u00f1ez, o teng\u00e1is alg\u00fan trauma infantil, el final har\u00e1 que ahonde a\u00fan m\u00e1s en la llaga y os vuelvan los malos recuerdos... as\u00ed que avisad@ quedas.\n\nUn saludito por aqu\u00ed.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1616942486, "timestamp_updated": 1616942486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642119526863098145", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89203080": {"recommendationid": "89203080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341986949", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1616871786}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a prime example of why you should put kids in horror games .... or movies they just make the atmosphere 10 times worst\n\nBut other than that the game is quite glitchy walking on toys and getting tossed over to the other side of the room, i fell off the map 2 times just in the void, the ghost was gonna stuck if it was hunting you and there was one piece of wood or a corner so that would make it stop\n\nother than that the game is pretty intense and creepy story also still recommended but for a low price", "timestamp_created": 1616871890, "timestamp_updated": 1616871890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531596004962921143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89084913": {"recommendationid": "89084913", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015247705", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1616710864}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to give this game a good review, but it's just not scary.

The (childish) nightmare fuel birthed from fear of loss (dad left) and confusion (mom's an alcoholic) creates a landscape of dark twisted pathways and eerie noises while your only companion is your teddy bear, animated by your imagination.\n\nFear and comedy are both subjective and the game advertises itself as a horror game. For me I can't claim it was actually scary but it was definitely creepy and while I'm immune to jump scares there are a few that I'm sure might catch some people off guard. A few darkly humorous moments create a stark contrast to the dreary ambiance your child-mind is forcing you to explore.\n\nIf you play this frivolously in broad daylight and treat it as just a simple puzzle game, you might not really appreciate it. Play this at night in the dark and truly put yourself in the mind of a toddler who misses their mother and you might actually find yourself exploring your own imagination and not just the one the game gives you. Crawling from one dark corner to another, peeking around furniture and squeezing into the tunnels of your own mind.\n\nMaybe it's not the best game in the world and I don't know if you'll enjoy replaying it for all the collectibles, but it's certainly a memorable experience if you allow it to be.\n---\n\nBottom line: Toddler Simulator ~ Nightmare Edition. Stand up and explore at your own risk, or crawl back under the table and hide.\n---\n\nEDIT: After spending more time with the game, in particular the post-game bonus material. There's an additional level: The Prologue which takes place before the main game and gives some more setup.\n\nAnd for anyone with an interest into game design you will find a treasure trove of discussion hidden in \"The Museum\" which is a maze-like experience that lets you explore early ideas and discusses the evolution of the game during development.

Everything feels quite ordinary, you have a loving mother, a magical living teddy bear you got as a present. Things are bright and colorful, you've got plenty of toys, it's all good in the hood. As you fall asleep, you dream some really fucked up shit. There are monsters out to get you, the house is all twisted and crooked. You keep hearing your mother's lullaby through the darkness, guiding you to nice memories from better days. As you progress, you start to realize that things are not that great in the real world.\n\nGame mechanics are quite simple, you can walk quite slowly and wobbly, crawl really fast, pick/drop/throw items, open/close drawers/doors/lights and climb on things. You can run for a short distance and then fall and keep crawling. These combined with being able to view your character model in its pajamas when looking down, or climbing, add a LOT to an already immersive experience. You do feel like you're inside a toddler's body. The game has \"parkour\" (very limited since character cannot actually jump forward), puzzle solving and stealth sequences.\n\nLevel design, graphics, sound design, voice acting (especially the bear) are surprisingly great. AtS does get your heart rate up a bit at times (the atmosphere, the background noises, the dark twisted world, the monsters), and at other times it melts your heart with just how cute it is. Wish more games explored dreams, this totally brought me back to my childhood, playing through Max Payne 1 & 2.

The celebration is interrupted by a visitor at the front door who is hidden from the player. The conversation is muffled and partly kept from the player. The mothers angry tone frightens the player, whose fear is presented as blurred vision. Quickly, the mother returns with a gift, but she doesn't say who the gift is from. Instead, she carries the player and gift upstairs to the child's room, a place of bright, warm colors and streaming sunlight. Before the present is given to the player, the telephone rings, and the mother leaves the player in the bedroom to play alone. The gift is revealed to be a sentient teddy bear, who climbs out of the box and hides in the chest until the player finds him. The bear introduces himself as Teddy and the player is taught how to play the game with a tutorial within a dark closet filled with dark black coats.  The small adventure inside the closet is ended by the mother finding them. The player then wakes in the night to find Teddy being taken by an unseen force. The crib overturns, and he escapes. The player then leaves the bedroom and rescues Teddy from a washing machine by unplugging it and opening the door. Teddy says that something was not right and that they have to find their mother.\nThe search leads them to discover a slide that takes them to a small playhouse within a cavern that is presumably under the house, and the door found inside it leads them into a journey through several surreal environments, consisting of an underground playground, a dilapidated mansion that has merged with a marshy forest, and a bizarre series of caverns created by hundreds of closets. Teddy instructs the player to find four memories he shared with the mother that will lead them to her. The memories take the forms of four objects. Throughout the search, the player is pursued by a large, feminine, troll-like monster and a creature with glowing white eyes, who has a coat as a body like the ones in closet earlier.\nTogether Teddy and the Player are bound to find his mother and return back to the warm and colorful nature that isn\u2019t the journey they are set out to encounter. \n\n[h1]Personal Opinion About Plot:[/h1] \nThe is a very dark plot and without any spoilers, I say that the reality the game will take you would be like the mind of a child in a very dark place. Of course, somethings in this would wont make sense and are a bit outlandish because we are the child. \n\n[h1]Game Gameplay:[/h1]\nAmong the Sleep is a first-person exploration game seen from the view of a toddler. The player can move the cursor to walk or crawl around, the latter of which is faster and is required to slide through obstacles blocking the way. Running is also an available option, though the player will fall down if it is done for too long. The player can interact with and push objects, and open doors and windows. Sometimes, the handle to open doors is too tall to reach for the player, in which case the player will have to push and climb chairs for additional height. Other than chairs, the player can climb boxes, tables, and various things to reach otherwise unreachable ledges and heights. Certain objects can also be held as well as thrown away. Others can be stored to the inventory and taken out again for later use.\n\nFor most of the game, the player is accompanied by a sentient teddy bear named Teddy. The player can hug Teddy, who emits light that helps the player navigate through darker environments. The light will wear down after a while, but will recharge if left unused. If the player drops Teddy, which always happens whenever they arrive from sliding through pipes to a new level or environment, they will have to pick it up first before advancing again.\n\nThroughout the game, the player is followed by two monsters: a feminine figure that haunts the first three levels, and a trench coat-wearing figure that haunts the final level. The monsters' appearance is indicated by the blurring of the vision, grating sounds, and in the case of the feminine figure, a slow lullaby (Trollmors Vuggesang [sv], \"Trollmother's Lullaby\") hummed about. There is no way to fend off the monsters; if they appear, the player will have to run away or hide under tables or chairs until they go away. If the player is not quick enough to evade the monsters, a short cinematic will show the monsters taking hold of the player, which results in a game over, followed by a continue screen with a pacifier. Clicking the pacifier restarts the game from the last checkpoint. The player can also get a game over by other means, such as falling into water or chasms.\n\nThe game is largely linear and involves going from point A to B, though the expansive environment with multiple obstacles may induce the feeling of being lost. After some time exploring the player's house, the player is taken to a dreamlike location with a gingerbread house-like hut that serves as a sort of hub level. The house contains a circular door that leads to a new level, surrounded by four containers where \"memories\" obtained from each level are stored. After the player finds a memory and heads to a tube at the end of the level, they will be returned to this hut. Once four memories are stored, the player can insert Teddy's right hand below the circular door to return to the player's house.\n\nIn the extra DLC level, instead of exploring dreamlike locations, the player is taken to another house with the objective of finding and thawing five frozen dolls by playing music or turning on the TV. The gameplay is still the same, with the feminine figure haunting the player, but the player is also confronted by a fireplace monster in the underground section that advances and closes in through an aisle.\n\n[h1]Personal Opinion About Gameplay:[/h1]\nOverall the mechanics for the game is much like any other horror game, but much like Amnesia\u2019s movable objects and running away tactics. \n\n[h1]Personal Opinion on Graphics:[/h1] \nHaving been a Indie game and being supported by many followers I agree that the graphics given to this game suit the situation they where given. The lighting in the game give it more of an aesthetic vibe more that attention to detail. Of course I could say that it is suppose to be through the eyes of a child which would also make sense. \n\n[h1]Personal Opinion on Sound Design:[/h1]  \nThe sound design is a bit, eh. Of course the sounds are repeated in some locations and the music is for a baby but ill give it like a 6/10 for the aesthetic feel of a dark feel to what should be a babies tune. \n\n[h1]Things needed to be Fixed like Bugs:[/h1]\nHaving made such a game does have some bugs, but for this game I seem to have done about everything that could have broken a game. The physics are just right and you can rarely get stuck on anything. \n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1] \nThis is a great indie game that definitely deserves the medals and the comments it received. If you\u2019re looking for a scary horror indie game, this is a must!\n", "timestamp_created": 1611025748, "timestamp_updated": 1611026096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558011054992675781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84829074": {"recommendationid": "84829074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198826129637", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1648137675}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor jueguito puzzle/terror", "timestamp_created": 1610856815, "timestamp_updated": 1610856815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "84821765": {"recommendationid": "84821765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326700427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1610924918}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable, cartoon style horror story that is totally engaging if your into that sort of thing.

Really strong, I must emphasize that.\nIn the other hand - braindead puzzles, undeveloped mechanics, few missed opportunities ..... and it ends so quickly, it'll ruin your whole experience. \n\nI'm fully aware of today's standards and I'm rarely mad at games length. \"Walking simulators\", story driven adventures, often wrap up in 3 to 5 hours of gameplay and that's understandable. It's important to maintain momentum, not overstay it's s welcome and offer a consistent storyline, when gameplay is somewhat limited. \n[b]Among The Sleep will take you around 1,5 hour to complete and that's really disappointing.

A part, that should be just the ending of the forest level, took me around 2-3 minutes, in which I was on my phone the whole time waiting for the monster to disappear.

On a dark and stormy night as a little baby has lost his mother, his only companion is his bear as they both look for her.\n\nSo what\u2019s to like about the game. The atmosphere in the game is pretty good definitely spooky as you wander is strange nightmarish world and jump at every sound.\n\nGraphics are nice and pretty detailed. The levels are very creepy/fun to explore and look at like chapter 3. The game does have some pretty good scares like the introduction to the swamp witch. I like the reason we are given that we can\u2019t fight back against the monsters, Like in other horror games when a person is running away from a monster you're wondering why they don't fight back. In this game it makes sense because we are a baby.\n\nThe music in the game was very good and helped with the game\u2019s horror feel. The story very good and that's all I'm saying about it.\n\nI like the prologue chapter/level it really helps with the main game\u2019s story and the toys are very cute. I really like the museum area/chapter/level in the game and finding out how the game was made and the stuff that was cut, honestly the stuff that was cut could be made into a whole other game.\n\nSo what\u2019s to dislike about the game. Well game is on the short side you can beat it in three hours if you're planning on not going after the achievements. There are some bugs, but nothing game braking. Lastly the game\u2019s price is a bit too high for such a short game.\n\nSo Among the Sleep - Enhanced Edition is a pretty good horror, adventure game. With a pretty good atmosphere, creepy/fun levels and a very good story. \n\nSo if you're looking for a good spooky horror game to play I recommend this game, but I think buying it when it's on sale will save you some money.", "timestamp_created": 1605911618, "timestamp_updated": 1605911618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79556521": {"recommendationid": "79556521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274490451", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1605828398}, "language": "english", "review": "da", "timestamp_created": 1605883449, "timestamp_updated": 1605883449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79502071": {"recommendationid": "79502071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379666215", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1652046308}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny", "timestamp_created": 1605784022, "timestamp_updated": 1605784022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79439401": {"recommendationid": "79439401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808845361", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1689643233}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD ASS GAME.

Hubiese estado mejor que se aprovecharan cosas como el esconderse en armarios o debajo de las camas.\n-Los graficos estan aceptables pero se nota mucho cuando chocas con objetos o con el mismo Teddy que se \"hunden\" entre si viendose muy raro.\n-Literalmente no veo nada, hay muy poca iluminacion si es que se pone lo que el juego te recomendaria y si le subes obviamente anulas la \"tension\" aparte de que se ve medio feo. El uso de Teddy es casi inutil pues me parece que oscurece mas todo en vez de ayudarme a ver adjunto a que su radio de iluminacion es muy patetico asi que conviene mas tenerlo en la espalda asi tienes mas campo de vision junto a que puedes interactuar con el entorno.\n\n6/10\nCortito con nula rejugabilidad, algunos errores con colisiones u objetos que se hunden entre si, no mucho \"terror\" como tal y algo de potencial desaprovechado.

Instead, like the summary suggests,  you play as a baby that gets trapped in a \u2018nightmare world\u2019 where you'll try to find your mom while trying to survive.[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Design looks is okay\n- I think \u2018the nightmare\u2019 is a good addition to this game (up till that point I got bored, but after \u2018the nightmare\u2019 appears in the game, it gets a lot more intense/horror like).\n- If you die it\u2019s not that big of a deal, you won\u2019t lose much progress\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- I didn\u2019t like the controllers (also no point using \u2018shift\u2019 for running, the toddler keeps falling anyways and tends to get stuck on higher doors while attempting to escape \u2018the nightmare\u2019)\n- Everything is too dark to actually explore in detail. The maps are built to focus on just the main-story.\n- Multiple errors and crashes. At some point my entire pc crashed, though I don\u2019t want to go as far to claim beyond any disputable doubt that it was just because of this game. The crashing part of my pc might have been a big coincidence, but other than that I had to restart the game a couple of times and stuff like this happened occasionally:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/0wPDzCx\n\n- My final point is a moral question. Do you, as developers and/or publisher, think it\u2019s \u2018fair\u2019 to simply change the $ sign for an \u20ac sign as price for this game for EU-citizens?

One thing to note is that the devs clearly took a lot of inspiration from Amnesia, all the way down to the screen shake animation when the monster is nearby.\n\nThe Good:\nKrillbite absolutely nails the world building and mechanics, making everything huge and out of reach. Even the most basic actions like walking over a small step requires you to press a button and climb it.\nHugging the teddy bear gives off a faint light to help you navigate a little better, but prevents you from performing any other action (except walking of course). Moreover, by making crawling faster than walking, you are required to choose whether to prioritise speed or visibility.\nOverall, without going into too much detail, the devs did a great job making the player feel powerless.\n\nThe Bad:\nThis game is really just a story you are carried through. The world is extremely linear and there is no real challenge.\nOn the other hand, the controls are quite frustrating a times. Climbing over objects isn't always smooth, opening doors (which is by far he most common action) could have been made easier to perform.\n\nIn conclusion, a very interesting idea that I wish would have been developed a little further.

So my first impression was good, but not that good.\n\nThen I played the prologue and went to the museum, where you get to see all the behind the scenes, developers comments, thoughts, initial art concepts and discarded material, among other content. Silly as it sounds, this simple feauture adds A LOT of depth and value and takes the game a step further. After a brief visit to each area of the museum you can get a very good idea of the development process and understand why the game is the way it is and why most if not all of the decisions made were the right ones.

It does feel a little dated, with animations and models feeling a little off. But looking past that, everything still manages to look great. I really recommend this game. It's not a very long game, maybe 2 to 6 hours at most, and it's more of a game that you play through to experience the setting and the story, than it is for the gameplay. Like others are saying, it's pretty much a walking simulator. So if any of that bothers you, get the game on sale. \n\nPlaying as a 2 year old child, the game is more about going through a set of linear levels, solving small puzzles and figuring out how to progress. While there are only 6 levels, each level is very distinct from the others, and none of them feel too short. \n\nThere are scary moments, but the game seems more about creating a scary atmosphere. It does certainly feel more scary as you are a slow and defenseless child. I was constantly making note of any small closets and crawlspaces I found in case I had to quickly hide from anything that tried to chase me later. There are some jump scares, but I think they are done fairly well here. None of them are really out right in your face, and you never lose control [spoiler]except when you are caught by one of the monsters(?)[/spoiler], so it's easy to turn your face or hide when you feel like something is about to happen. This really helps with the immersion as it's what you would expect most children to do when they see something scary: look away. \n\nAs for the story, it's a simple story. You are a 2 year old child wandering through a house at night trying to find your mother. You aren't entirely alone, however, as you carry around a talking teddy bear that can glow when you bring it out. He will comment on various things, and sometimes move on his own and help progress the game forward. There are also these [spoiler]shadowy monsters[/spoiler] that occasionally appear, sometimes chasing you. As you go through the game, you collect a \"memory\" at the end of each level, which is just an item that reminds you of your mother. And the levels are very different from eachother, such as a [spoiler]house, playground, and even a forest[/spoiler]. Playing through the game, with the monsters, the memories, the strange locations, I started to wonder anything that was happening was even real. But when you combine all that with the voices that talk during the memories and the strange drawings you might find, the story becomes something much deeper that might hit close to home for some people. \n\nWell, let's get to the flaws. They were pretty much all fixable for me, but I'm going to mention them anyways. \n\n1. The game is a bit linear. There are some levels that are completely linear and some that aren't at all, but I still think it works just fine. I put this as a flaw for those who don't want a linear game. There's not really any backtracking and you can't go back to previous levels unless you select them from the main menu. \n\n2. The lighting. It's fine and everything looks great, but some places seem way to dark for how dark they expect you to have the game set at. The worst level was level 2, which requires you to search a large area ( [spoiler]a playground in a forest?[/spoiler] ) for these small [spoiler] owl statues [/spoiler] and if you are going for 100%, the collectibles. But it's easy to get lost in all the [spoiler] foliage [/spoiler] looking for these things, as you don't get any hint about where they are, and at the proper light level, it's nearly impossible to see. This may have only affected me. Maybe the room I was playing in wasn't dark enough, but it is easily fixable by just raising the brightness a little. \n\n3. Jittery movement that is fixable. The game doesn't start out in a 16:9 aspect ratio. But after setting it to that, moving in the game felt really jittery. Its extremely subtle, but it made me nauseous and I almost decided not to play it. But I discovered the problem become almost non-existent by adjusting the FOV. I think I had to lower the FOV by 10.\n\nOn an extra positive note, I actually really enjoyed the museum in this game. Probably the only game where I did enjoy the museum. It isn't just a collection of things to look at, but also a ton of concept art and design, with commentary and text to read from the developers. It really gives a lot of insight into what they were going for and trying to achieve.", "timestamp_created": 1593911617, "timestamp_updated": 1593911617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606734693050384521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72002642": {"recommendationid": "72002642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239525100", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2518, "last_played": 1648535212}, "language": "english", "review": "Unicorn Pyjama's, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1593847968, "timestamp_updated": 1593847968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71965736": {"recommendationid": "71965736", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978624503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1593799237}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but Very deep.

Interesting enough, when you fall of the map, you go through the death menu to 2 times\n- All levels have invisble walls\n- AI is non existent and feels scripted. It isn't neither scary or presents a challenge and also spawns and unspawns in front of you...ffs...\n- It just wasn't fun to play...and after all, shouldn't this be the sole reason for someone to play a videogame?\n- 2 hours of gameplay for a game that costs 17\u20ac?

One of the few positives I can give is that the story is okay and the other is that the levels are actually very well designed, you won't get irritated by the level design here as you do in many other cheap horror games on steam.\n\nUnfortunately the story is doled out way too seldomly (a bit at the start and then just close to the end). Because of that the levels don't have any purpose, you're just playing to play. The levels are okay and some are even fun. But since there's no context for the level itself it doesn't hold your attention. You get one \"memory\" after each level, which is a line of dialogue and that's it. That's the extent of story progression you get until right at the end.\n\nThe game is very cute and very competent compared gameplaywise compared to other horror games, so I would like to recommend it. But it's just not scary. I played it with my two nieces, 14 and 17 years old, and the youngest one got scared once. Once through the whole game.\n\nSo you have a horror game where the story doesn't string you along and the scares don't string you along. The only thing left is gameplay and some actually good gameplay. I never felt lost except when it was intentional, and even then it wasn't to the point of frustration. I really have no complaints about the levels, just that there was no context for playing them.\n\nI would only recommend this to people who like levels for levels.

Through each \"Chapter\" you need to collect memory items, which in turn brings you closer to finding your mother. There are collectables in the form of drawings scattered all over the place, at first it just appeared as mere drawings to me and with the achievement hog I am, I had to find all of them. But with each drawing I found I noticed something \"Small\".\n\nThe drawings were also telling me a story, giving me more insight to my current predicament. Which in my opinion is a genius way of writing a story, see games lose touch with collectables having it as a mere past time filling out a game with useless junk to make the game appear much longer than it actually is. Among the sleep took a unique take on this offering more \"story\" with each drawing.\n\nNow you are probably wondering, is the game scary? Yes and no. From a toddlers perspective it is quite terrifying, but I never felt any \"real\" danger from the game. My first hour playing I encountered a shadow or two that spooked me, but didn't present any real threat. So it wasn't until I completely let my guard down, that I got a fright. There was this level with a well lady (trying not to spoil too much here) and I never saw her, going about my merry way collecting the items to further progress. There was this lock on a white fence gate that I needed to get to, so I moved an object to get closer and insert the key, right at that moment this well lady spooked the crap out of me by grabbing me off the chair. \n\nThe story is well told and the game looks good, for me it was well worth the play.

It only includes ultra-light puzzling elements and nearly no story at all. Graphics and animations are nothing to write home about, especially for an enhanced edition that supposedly includes 'improved visuals'. More importantly, some bugs remain in this enhanced edition, most notably clipping issues which force you to restart the chapter because you're hopelessly stuck.\n\nAll things considered, [i]Among the Sleep[/i] isn't a bad walking simulator, but if you're not a megafan of the genre or if you have plenty of good walking sims in your backlog, you're good and can safely skip this one. This conlusion, coupled with the fact that the regular price for this game is just plain ridiculous for such a short experience, made me decide to not recommend [i]Among the Sleep[/i].\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nSince I want to avoid spoilers, I can't talk about the story, as the entire story can be perfectly written out in one short sentence.\n\nSuffice it to say the developers have created a world for you to explore, which they believe may represent how a 2-year-old would interpret certain actions by his parents that don't make any sense to a toddler. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplaywise, [i]Among the Sleep[/i] is a run-of-the-mill walking simulator, although maybe I should say [i]crawling[/i] simulator because the toddler's walking speed is very slow, whereas his crawling speed is an acceptable speed to not get annoyed by slow movement speed, which some short walking simulators use as a way to artificially increase playtime.\n\nYou have to find your way through the game, which is divided into four chapters. Each chapter has a slightly different type of setting, with everyday objects sometimes looking eerie from the perspective of a 2-year-old. \n\nThe puzzling aspect of the game is limited to finding your way in the (mostly dark) game world or finding a keylike object needed to continue. So I don't have a clue what the promise of 'enhanced puzzles' in the developers' description of the enhanced edition means.\n\nOften, you're required to interact with objects by clicking and dragging, for example to open doors or move a chair to a cupboard so you can climb the chair and then climb onto the cupboard. The game handles these interactions in a very clunky way and therefore they often get frustrating to perform. Sometimes I saw an object I thought I should climb onto but my gurgling avatar refused. After looking around for a while and finding no alternatives, I went back to the same object and found out I [b]was[/b] supposed to climb it, but it only works when I face the object from a certain angle.\n\nIn the second half of the game, you'll sometimes encounter a ghost/wraith/spectre that you need to avoid or it's game over. This is a mechanic that a lot of walking simulators use to add a horror element to the game. While I've come to hate games that only revolve around avoiding a 'game over monster', its sporadic use in the case of [i]Among the Sleep[/i] didn't bother me at all. The only time the creep actually caught me was when I got stuck due to a clipping issue. I got stuck several times while playing [i]Among the Sleep[/i], even when I was two minutes in, and the only way to solve that situation is by reloading, which means restarting the chapter or a large part of it.\n\nI'm glad [i]Among the Sleep[/i] allows the player to rebind the controls. You can also adjust mouse look speed, which definitely is a welcome option because I found the standard mouse look speed ridiculously fast, something which a lot of players have written in reviews and on the forums. I'm glad I didn't need to fiddle around with my mouse's dpi settings, which would have discouraged me and maybe I wouldn't have bothered to play the game at all.\n\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nSince the developers boast that the enhanced edition of their game has 'improved graphics', I would not have wanted to play the previous edition of [i]Among the Sleep[/i]. I definitely don't consider wonderous graphics one of the main requirements to enjoy a game, but [i]Among the Sleep[/i]'s graphics are basic and often even crude. Animations aren't very smooth either. \n\nThe soundtrack is a much better aspect of [i]Among the Sleep[/i]. I don't remember hearing any music, so either it was forgettable or there wasn't any, but the constant eerie ambient sounds and creepy sound effects are great and they add a lot of atmosphere to an otherwise mediocre experience, which is probably the main reason why this game doesn't completely feel like it deserves a 'not worth playing' tag. Though I do understand that some people have an issue with the game [b]constantly[/b] playing eerie ambient sounds, even when there is no danger at all.\n\n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Among the Sleep[/i] has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nFor me, the Steam Achievements turned out to be a necessary addition to [i]Among the Sleep[/i]. Six of them require you to find a collection of drawings that are scattered throughout each chapter. This meant I had some sort of goal the whole time besides simply crawling and climbing towards the finish line. I don't think I would have finished this game without its Steam Achievements, which is something I don't think I've ever felt before. I'll also add here that this game has zero replayability as far as I'm concerned, especially after having unlocked all of the achievements.\n\nBesides the collectibles, there are three achievements that require you to perform some completely optional tasks in the game and one final achievement is awarded for completing the game, bringing the total to 10 achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1584986510, "timestamp_updated": 1584986534, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550174832344055176", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65518937": {"recommendationid": "65518937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129541026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1585017829}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't think much of this game at first.

Even if the developers are proud of the current game it seems that they also would have liked the game to keep it's original premise and promises.\n\nUnfortunately, for me, the current iteration, while is a serviceable 3 hour game, or an alternative to watching a movie, it is not a product I enjoyed.\nIt is a game that it's memory from your brain will fade in the nether, but it has a really nice buildup which fails to deliver on what I expected to be and in what it also tries to achieve.\n\nThere are some interesting moments in the game but overall I find it week and forgetable. I would have liked it to reccommend it to at least the young audience, but I honestly believe they won't get it.\n\n\nIt is a kid's scary game in a kid's world but which adresses serious issues like misshandling of babies, marital problems and how can 2 people who don't love eachother inflict traumas on the baby.\n\nAGAIN, this is not a bad game, it's a game I just don't recommend.\n\n\nReading again what I wrote, it seems the review doesn't explain what else is wrong about the game, than the plot.\nAgain, while being serviceable, the game just isn't that special gameplay wise, there is nothing really unique, and it sometimes posseses issues with moving and crawling in the environment. Having to change stance to move over a small objective, interactive a bit too much with the traps, even if you don't touch them, annoying circular movements, that seem to not react well to the mouse and keyboard setup, but better to the control ones. The drawers and objects seem to not be thinked to be operated by a baby, altough door handles do.\nSome cases of bad illumination, textures and environments not loading, or clipping in trough scenes.\nOver use of scary music, when there is no danger, a bit of mouse sensivity issues, and slight motion blur even when turned off.\nExageration of camera daze and shake when looking at an enemy.\nPoor diversity of objectives. Most of the game is either collect an object and place it into a specific spot, then go to another chamber and collect another, and when you do 3 you can advance.\n\nIt trully feel that a demo, that got transformed into a full game after someone had 180 plot change. I think they tried to do something to not fail the kickstarter fans, that pledged on the original game, and tried to offer a workable product.\nLet's not forget that Among The Sleep was in Early Access for quite some time, and it really looked as abandoned at times.\n\n\n\nSome setup spoilers.\n[spoiler]A huge part of the game is in the baby imagination, the universe in which you travel are memories pleasant, and unpleasant from their life.\nThe baby tries to find solace by searching for the mother. In his search he deforms the world and also experiences some of the fears we all had as young ones, imagining enemies and assigning people to monsters.[/spoiler]\n\n\nSerious spoilers underneath.\n[spoiler]The most interesting and unique thing in the game, is that not the father is at fault, and the father is actively searching for the son to save him, and the mother is the real monster the kid should run away. This happens when the mother gets mad at the baby and starts drinking.\nIn the end, while the baby tries to build and reinforce the positive memories of his life, it becomes more and more clear that the mother, while surely loves the baby, cannot keep him safe and happy, thus the baby is given to the father and child services.\n [/spoiler]\n\n______________________________________________________\n[i]Usually I try to keep my own opinnion on games and strongly reinforce it. But being so many positive and recommended reviews it made me led to believe that there is something I didn't spot or something wrong with me or the moment I played the game.\n\nI saw a review of a friend, which I kind of agree with it.\n\nWhile this is a negative exaggeration of the game, there are some points here that are true.\nI will post it underneath:\n\"It  managed to screw up almost every gameplay mechanic it introduced and it's neither scary nor emotional.\n\nI really do not feel like writing about this one in-depth because it's so surface-level and it frustrated me more than anything due to some stupid glitching and annoying 'run-n-hide from the monster' sequences which weren't scary, just frustrating. I'm not wasting any more time on it. I strongly don't recommend playing it. I got nothing out of it and I will never, ever revisit it, it's miserable.\n\nCheers!

Gameplay wanders between survival horror (running from monsters that are there) to walking simulator (plus running from monsters that aren't there, it was just the music getting spooky for a sec).  Or perhaps crawling simulator - crawling is faster and steadier than walking, a brilliant touch that brings you into the two-year-old main character's point of view. \n\nThe story is simple, but the game tells it well.  The atmosphere and set design are great.  The music is definitely trying to scare you, but it works with the gameplay.  Some of the middle feels a little more consciously like a video game, going through linear levels to get items to get to the next level.  The monsters are scarier when they can't get you.  Once you're used to the scare for getting caught it's more frustrating than frightening.  But the end of the game is very well executed and redeems the middle, and the whole game only takes about four hours.  (It might take you less; that included pause time and a lot of getting lost.)\n\nThe game was a little glitchy, but not too bad: I had to reset from checkpoint once because I got stuck behind some scenery and once because the screen for resetting after you've fallen/been caught/otherwise failed wasn't letting me click to reset. The checkpoints are pretty generous, so neither of these was a big issue.  The little kid hands below you when you look down mostly work well for immersion, but it's a little odd to see them still held by your sides while you move an object (hey, maybe you're a telekinetic toddler.)

I'm sorry, but the game sucks, it really does. It especially sucks considering it's a 3 hour game for $17. I know all the fans are like \"3 hours for $17 is still good as long as you're getting a good experience\". Maybe I could agree with that, if it even gave me a good experience.\n\nThis is more like an atmospheric walking simulator than anything even closely resembling an appropriate horror game. Honestly, there are only two points in the game where there is even any threat of all of actually being attacked, and it's very brief. Even then, as long as you're not standing directly out in the open or either refuse to move or even decide to walk towards the monsters, there is no chance at all that you're going to be caught. Most of the time this game creates the illusion that there is danger, but once you realize that's not true in the slightest you're free to run through all the levels freely. The one and only time I was ever scared in this game was when I jumped at my own shadow. I actually ran TOWARDS an enemy at one point just to see if it could even kill me!\n\nAt the end you get to visit the museum and see the original concepts of the game... which strangely sounds way better than the actual game is. Most of the comments is just what they wanted to do and decided to cut out for some reason. At the end there are unskippable credits that run for about 10 minutes long (you can press S to speed it up, the game doesn't tell you that though) and all I could think the whole way through it was how bad I feel that so many people backed this game for it to end up so badly and no where near the original concept of the game. This game has more backers than most other actually good indie games I've played, and it's one of the few games I've given such a bad review to.\n\n1/5\n\nHonestly, look through my reviews and you'll see I think there is maybe one other game I've given such a bad review for and that's it.

Tagged as \"horror\" and \"adventure\" but I would not call it either. I had high hopes for this, and the price tag is pretty high for what I eventually played through.\nYou play as a toddler, trying to find his mother. Along the way the story isn't developed at all until the end and the very underwhelming \"twist\" is revealed.\n\nThough the concept of a toddler's view of the world where things can transform and monsters can be seen anywhere is interesting, this game did not do it justice. The game tried a couple jump scares, and creating an atmosphere of tension and fear, but it just didn't work. I did not get scared once, and I am really a wimp. There were no puzzles, just crawling and climbing through a lackluster world with a lackluster story to reach an inevitable and somewhat predictable end. Overall I spent 3-3.5 hours playing this game to get 100% (including the DLC). There is no replayability.

Especially helpful being played from the perspective of a toddler. I really liked the subtle attention to detail, things like the baby's breathing, waddling, falling over if you run too long & the size/scale of the environments compared to the child which effects the gameplay. It was funny having to move objects like chairs or stools around to open doors. Or opening drawers & arranging them like stairs to climb up onto something. There are puzzles which aren't extremely difficult but this fits the player character a lot (I wouldn't expect a toddler to be able to solve extremely difficult puzzles). The gameplay is kind of rudimentary but given the nature of the game I felt that was perfectly fine & expected. \n\nIt was scary enough for me, but I don't really play many walking sim horror games mainly because I'm not a fan of the whole \"here's a scary monster/demon thing that you can't attack and your only option is to either run & hide or die\" those generally irritate me. I enjoy more the likes of FEAR or The Suffering. I felt Among the Sleep could have done a bit more, however I was satisfied since I felt pretty much on edge nearly everywhere in the game. It did exactly what I wanted it to do; it brought me back to those times when I was a little child trying to get from my room to the bathroom in a dark scary house that felt like it was the size of the world. Hiding & peaking around corners, keeping my back to the wall all those kinds of silly things.\n\nI liked the visuals, it wasn't too dark but you could adjust that if you wanted, and the art style looked really good. I loved being able to see the kids hands & feet and the way some of the animations worked, it was really amusing. The atmosphere conveyed by the visuals was pretty on point. The scary areas were dark & had shadows that could play mind tricks. Then the bright areas made you feel calm & settled with all the colourful stuff around.\n\nThe audio was good, definitely a big part of what kept me on edge. There's always some sort of ambience and it was scary, creaking trees, doors swinging back & forth, floor boards creaking etc... they all came together really well & complimented the suspenseful music. My biggest issue with audio though; there's an option to enabled 5.1 surround sound but doing so seems to make the audio sound significantly worse & assuming my ears weren't playing tricks, all the audio felt like it was coming through 1 speaker.\n\nThe game is a bit short, though I only paid about $4US for it, so I'm pretty satisfied with value. Overall I'd definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a balance between horror & nostalgia. I think Krillbite Studio did really great with this and I'd actually love to see a few sequels that gradually get more and more horrific as they go on. A sequel where you're playing around the age of 6-10, another around 14-16 and another when they're an adult, all with different perceptions & varying degrees of horror.", "timestamp_created": 1566708003, "timestamp_updated": 1566708003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54751874": {"recommendationid": "54751874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218474471", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 433, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1568398841}, "language": "english", "review": "You would go expecting a typical indie horror game\nbut you will be surprised by its story and its Gameplay\nReally Deep and not too hard to understand, Truly A Gem\n", "timestamp_created": 1566494266, "timestamp_updated": 1568399036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438271611928939819", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54747272": {"recommendationid": "54747272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158108021", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1648896456}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me encanta", "timestamp_created": 1566473179, "timestamp_updated": 1566473179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54743876": {"recommendationid": "54743876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075794779", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1566450286}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego para pasar una tarde, es intuitivo, mecanicas faciles, buenos graficos (normalitos), historia buena, sustos muy de vez en cuando si no estas prestando atencion te puede llevar uno.\n\ncompletarlo con todos los logros me llevo las 3 horas que tengo de juego asi que es facil.\n\n8/10 (muy facil y no da miedo)", "timestamp_created": 1566452453, "timestamp_updated": 1566452453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54718002": {"recommendationid": "54718002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198449274321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1556141954}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting concept but still just an boring horror game with stale cliches and bad level design.", "timestamp_created": 1566316022, "timestamp_updated": 1566316022, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423769265413284302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54701674": {"recommendationid": "54701674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839364505", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1561673343}, "language": "english", "review": "When this game was originally released, I saw a play-through of it online done by some obscure youtuber. After finishing it, I thought it was quite excellent and I was surprised that the critics gave it a relatively mixed reception. Now that I finally sat down to play it though, I can understand the mixed reception it got as a few aspects to it could've been refined a bit more.\n\nAs for its story, I thought it was good, but it also felt underdeveloped and not fully realized. Before I get to my issues with it though, I'll first state that the general outline of the plot (which I won't reveal due to spoilers) works fine. Its story comes with a fascinating opening and ending which are quite interesting and compelling. As for the rest of the game though, while the areas you wander through are certainly filled with all kinds of bizarre, sometimes generic imagery, what they lack are many specific items which could be used to convey meaning. Sure, a couple set pieces did this, but they weren't nearly enough, so the story strangely felt like it was taking a backseat throughout much of the game. A greater emphasis on carefully chosen props rather than reality warping and creepy and often indescribable environments would've benefited the story quite a lot.\n\nAs for the gameplay/level design, I was also a bit mixed on it. I quite enjoyed the first level where you wander around your house at night as, even though it contained very little absurdity, it was made scary both by your size and the shadows in it. It was easily the best of the four main sections of the game. The second level had some promising level design as it took place in a playground, so this left a couple doors open to some various paths which could've been ventured down. Unfortunately, the gameplay felt pretty lacking in this section as it consisted of a scavenger hunt where you wander around the environment and look for several objects which enable you to progress in it. This was a rather uninteresting and, at times, tedious way to spend this level. The third and fourth levels were probably the weakest in terms of level design as this was when the reality warping and the indescribable environments took full effect (this was especially the case for the fourth level). As a result of this, the level design in the final two stages felt more creepy than terrifying.\n\nThe final two stages were where the enemy encounters appeared. Like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Outlast, you couldn't fight the enemy and had to run and hide from it. While I thoroughly enjoyed the enemy encounters overall, they could've been a bit better. I liked how the enemy wasn't overused as this kept its appearances effective throughout. I also thought it was built up to quite well throughout the game as it would first appear briefly in the background until its presence kept on getting more and more prominent as the game went on. As for the run and hide mechanic in general, in order for it to be truly memorable, a game needs to have its singular voice which distinguishes it from other games which use it and make the mechanic its own, not a variation of someone else's. For instance, the sanity bar in Amnesia distinguished its mechanic from other games. Also, the night vision effect in Outlast distinguished it from other games as well. As for this one, the fact that you're a toddler should make it seem like it's a unique variation of that mechanic in theory, but after a bit, it just felt like I was playing a familiar mechanic at a slower speed. It did a bit to distinguish itself, but ultimately not enough for it to find its own singular voice. Overall, I'd still say this is one of the better aspects to the game though.\n\nIn conclusion, even though this game could've been better in many ways, I still enjoyed it as it had enough things to like about it that I enjoyed my time with it.

This game tries to describe how a child is processing the terrible things happening around them.  Particularly a broken home and a alcoholic parent.  Having two children myself this game his particularly hard for me because when I was a child I grew up next to a family that was destroyed by alcoholism.  You could see the effects in hindsight that it was having on the child at the time. \n\nPeople tend to forget that a mind of a child is NOT like an adult or even a young teenager.  They do not understand the things going on around them.  So they are processing them in nightmares or night terrors which is what this is is an interesting take.  The game also does a good job of pushing a sense of scale.  I recall quite clearly being a child and thinking the home I lived in was a huge house but in reality it was just a standard 1800SF house.  But to a toddler who is barely 2ft tall a house can look immense and simple every day tasks like getting on a chair could seem overwhelming.\n\nChildren are programmed to view their parents as the source of comfort if they are scared.  Particularly their mothers.  So you're trying to find your mom while your mom is actually the reasons for your nightmares.  Quite the interesting dynamic.\n\nNever had a game that made me want to hide under a bed and hold my teddy.  Like for real.  It has some seriously eerie moments.   The game will take you about 2 - 3 hours to complete depending on how thorough you are.  The game is worth the price of admission.  Well worth the three hours and it will stick with you.

He was awarded the 1995 Turner Prize by the Tate Gallery for it and said that it symbolised the duality of body and mind while also expressing the \"fragility of life\" and as one critic said \"Hirst presents a mother and child not only forever separated from one another, but also fatally severed in themselves. The impossibility of achieving or retaining an idealised (lost) unity (often coupled with a fear of fragmentation)\". \n\nThis is of course.... complete nonsense and since Mother and Child Divided was actually something as stupid as two cows, bisected and preserved inside of 4 large fish-tanks of formaldehyde. But does show that its possible to muster up enough hyperbole to justify even the most half-baked attempt at social and existential commentary. Among the Sleep's developers were clearly inspired by Hirst since the game itself is a half-hearted attempt at entertainment which contains more pretentious nonsense than a toddler on a sugar rush could shake a teddy at. Allow me to explain.\n\nIn short, this is a 3 hour game with an hour of a half of 'suspense' building before anything actually happens. At first I thought it was simply cutbacks due to limitations on indie developers but their 'museum' which is made available in-game explains that what started out of as adventure game ended up being this mess. Furthermore, they deliberately paced the game to give the 'illusion' of being safe. So this illusion of safety is maintained for half the game while you walk around environments opening doors and takings 'keys' to 'locks' in order to progress. Tedious doesn't even begin to describe it. Just as you're about to give up from sheer boredom however,  there is a stab at a half-hearted attempt at Alien: Isolation or Monstrum where you need to 'hide' from a monster which is patrolling the area. The AI of which is so basic that it actually causes the monster to glitch out and spin wildly if you happen to be on a raised platform out of reach and has no ability to actually touch the player if they are crouched under any object.\n\nThe game's attempt to provide some deeper meaning is utterly undermined by just how blatant the game is towards trying to explain it's symbolism. So much so that the developers started to forget that a game is actually a form of entertainment and fell into the trap of 'this is art'. Sorry, but games can be both art and entertainment but it takes more effort and creative direction than these developers could muster. To be fair though, the 2nd half of the game is atmospheric and varied despite the glaring flaws in the gameplay but it really needed to be that good all of the way through.\n\nIn summary though, this is not worth taking a look at. There is nothing here which is especially noteworthy or memorable and the replay value is absolute zero.", "timestamp_created": 1563825785, "timestamp_updated": 1563825920, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393700778484344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54210869": {"recommendationid": "54210869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279140910", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 393, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 260, "last_played": 1659819449}, "language": "english", "review": "Before you play , be aware that it's a fairly short game. \nThe gameplay lasts 2-4 hrs.\nIt's more creepy than scary.\nThe most scary thing for me was the mother, I can't be the only one who found her face creepy.\nIt's funny since creators stated that they wanted the mother to appear as kind,caring and hardworking.\nThe noises disturbed me the most, I constantly felt like something was behind me. \nIt's an interesting game, I never played anything as a toddler character before.\nI still think that it's overhyped.

This concept provides a limited array of actions that the character can take but some can be quite unique. While in the fantasy world this toddler must team up with his stuffed teddy bear to find his mom and escape the monsters. Simple concept but the question is whether this makes the game good or bad. I will be reviewing the game in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n      The level design is great. Not only is the art style a dream/ nightmare like but the designs of each level does not cause the player to get lost. Mainly just moving forward means your progressing the level and there are plenty of unique landmarks that are easy to notice and know where you are in the level.\n\n        The music and sound are fantastic. Now I will say that the game is not scary but these sound effects really do try to be scary. It does create a substory of what is suppose to be interpreted based on sound cues and level design or invoke some sort of lingering fear for the player. Sometimes the sound cues make you think there is a monster around when the monster isnt introduced till a later section or level. My favorite moment was hearing something coming out of the water and seeing the monsters head pop out to stare at me. Finally the music is good but they are few and more atmospheric but they do add a layer of depth to the mood or the overall level design.\n\n         Puzzles are simple. This is good because first of all we play as a toddler. In theory it is a good practice to ask what kind of puzzles would a toddler somewhat be able to solve which for a good amount of puzzles here you can see that thought process. Another way at looking at that is you dont want to make the puzzles hard since you dont want to make the puzzles too much of a focus when the big concept of the game is the story and design. The puzzles do somewhat contribute to the story but mainly to add gameplay to what can mostly be considered a walking simulation.\n\n        Some unique actions are well unique. I mainly want to focus on the sprint feature, pause menu, and the teddy bear hug. When the player sprints they can only sprint for a short period of time till the character falls over. That is normal for a toddler since they dont normally have an excellent balance at a young age to be running/ moving fast. The pause menu pops up as the character puts his hands in front of his eyes like he is scared or playing peekaboo. Finally the teddy bear is a unique feature since normally at a young age children think non-animate objects hold life and are living friends. When you use the teddy bear he lights up to make things \"less scary\" which is a normal reaction when a child is scared and is hugging their favorite stuffed animal. These small features really add a layer of depth for the game and ground it with realistic concepts of a toddler and how they act under some specific situation or the fact they have limited mobility at a young age.\n\nCon:\n      The frame rate has some issues. Through the game there were many moments where the frame rate bounced around alot which is odd for an indie game that is pretty short. From time to time the game will freeze for a second to drop to like 5fps till it leaps to 60fps again to drop to like 45fps. You get the idea, the frame rate was not really consistent.\n\nConclusion:\n         Among the sleep is an amazing short game. There was so much passion put into the game from the developers especially listing to the dev commentary. Some of these small features like the limited sprint really made the game feel somewhat grounded in realism but contradicted with the dream like atmosphere. It was a blast to see the story from start to finish to learn more about the mom and the family. I do think seeing a sequel would be nice to learn more of the father since we learned so much of the mother in this game. I would recommend the game to anyone interested in this game, I dont doubt that people would find something in it that they find an enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1562306346, "timestamp_updated": 1562306346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53471631": {"recommendationid": "53471631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335718461", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1594462348}, "language": "english", "review": "Spooky good time", "timestamp_created": 1562219571, "timestamp_updated": 1562219571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53318721": {"recommendationid": "53318721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119776426", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1562144435}, "language": "english", "review": "Babie's game", "timestamp_created": 1562144526, "timestamp_updated": 1562144562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426540285348892212", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53219695": {"recommendationid": "53219695", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961314175", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1562095410}, "language": "english", "review": "Game failed to save the game in the steam cloud.

I don't go into much detail about the story but I do talk about a few things people might prefer learning on their own.\n---\nFor an indie product, this is quite a competent and well polished game. I've found the graphics, sound design and voice acting to be pretty good, even great at parts, and I haven't come across any major bugs. I have no complaints when it comes to the technical skill on display here.\n\nUnfortunately, as a horror game, I think it leaves much to be desired. It definitely looks creepy, but it doesn't \"feel\" creepy, and during my playthrough I was able to pinpoint some of the reasons I felt so: lack of urgency and of a substantial threat, the knowledge from the get-go that nothing you're seeing is real, and the presence of Teddy, your talking teddy bear companion in the game.\n\nOut of those three issues, however, my biggest gripe is with the third. Teddy acts as a comforting presence, which aligns with the idea you're playing as a toddler, but that feels precisely at odds with what I'd want from a horror game. He speaks often, points to events and objects in unwelcome and ham-fisted ways and fails to serve as the catalyst for anything interesting. I'm not entirely sure of the developers' intentions behind the character (or at least the version of him that made to the final product), but as it stands, his presence only adds whimsy to the game, robs the player of noticing and pondering things on their own and reinforces the idea that nothing there is real. I feel the atmosphere of the game suffered greatly because of this.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's a mix of puzzle with exploration and hiding from enemies, not unlike games such as Amnesia and Outlast. Here, however, these elements are severely underplayed, possibly due to the extremely short length of 2 or 3 hours. No enemies appear until you are well into the game, and when they do show up in an actual threatening manner, there's very little challenge to avoiding them. Puzzles are also similarly basic and are most often a matter of finding an object to open something. Finally, being a toddler means you're not very agile and you have to crawl to move faster, but that's about it; the gameplay is otherwise very similar to other first-person view horror games and most of the relevance of your character's age lies in the aesthetics and plot.\n\nThe story is a metaphorical one, where things you see are really just a representation of what is truly happening in the real world. As stated before, I felt this too was a detriment to the horror aspect of the game as it gave me little reason to worry for the well being of any of the characters involved. There are ways to incorporate this sort of symbolism while still having high, tangible stakes, but it was not done so here.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that intrigued me with its premise but failed to execute it in a satisfactory manner. There's a concept room you can visit after beating the story that showcases a lot of the art, models and ideas behind the project, and I have to say, the final result doesn't do all that concept justice. They even had an original, much darker ending, showing that at one point their vision for the game might have threaded quite a different path.\n\nUltimately, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a horror game to be more than just a game whose visuals happened to be too dark for it to fall into any other genre and, in this sense, it didn't work for me. However, I want to reiterate the game from a technical standpoint is perfectly fine and I believe the developers are well equipped to make more games in the future. Whatever their next project is, if any, hopefully I'll like it much better.", "timestamp_created": 1561840391, "timestamp_updated": 1561840391, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52175034": {"recommendationid": "52175034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057672452", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1560894280}, "language": "english", "review": "What made the experience unlike others was the perspective.

You can hold the bear to light the way in the darker areas. Keep in mind that you can\u2019t sprint toddle and hold the bear at the same time. And you will be sprinting unless you like being caught. There are some very light puzzles that can consist of finding an item and then using it or figuring out how to climb up to reach a doorknob.

You play as a toddler that just turned two years old; in the middle of celebrating your birthday with your mom, a stranger shows up at your door bearing a gift for you. Of course, it's your very own Teddy. You end up going on the adventure of your lifetime with your new best friend, who serves to help keep you safe from the ever-looming malicious entities of the worlds you're about to explore.\n\nSaying a lot about Among the Sleep would be giving away all of its secrets, so this review will be kept fairly brief. It's impressive just how accurately Krillbite Studio were able to nail the mechanics of being a barely walking toddler. You move faster while you're in a crawling position, but you can still run if you're standing and walking; running for too long makes you fall down, however. You also have to push and pull objects to create paths to climb up, using items such as chairs and ottomans to crawl up to unlock doors. Rather than a flashlight, you can remove your Teddy from your back and hug him to have him cast a warm, safe light around you. One really cool small detail is that every item that would have words on it has them written in gibberish, since obviously a two year old doesn't know how to read yet.\n\nThere are five levels in total, with four of them having to be explored to find memories of your mother so that you can make progress towards finding her. Most of the puzzles simply involve making your way through the level, while climbing drawers, dressers, chairs, and ottomans to reach items that you need such as keys and glowing shapes. There are also drawings dispersed through each location, and although they do nothing but give you achievements if you happen to find all of them, they do add some incentive to explore the game to its fullest. For the most part, exploration doesn't feel like a chore since you're not constantly being hunted, and the environments are well detailed with a unique feel to each of them.\n\nIn the end, there is an unexpected plot buried within the puzzles and mild walking simulator gameplay that Among the Sleep carries. In the hundreds of horror games that I've played, I cannot once recall playing as a toddler; that in itself is a unique feature worth checking out, especially since it's so well done. Even though the story isn't totally spelled out while the game progresses, there are drawings on walls and other subtle hints to help guide your mind along what is happening. It's a slow burner for sure, and one that some players may find dull, but one that's worth carrying on with if you like a unique experience.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1560606246, "timestamp_updated": 1560606246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.7650565505027771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "51237772": {"recommendationid": "51237772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087730263", "num_games_owned": 913, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1560601568}, "language": "english", "review": "Buggy AF.\n\nThis is just not a fun game, the intro starts off interesting and the mechanics seem OK but then you get into playing the game you will find the controls and interface is horrible.

I have yet to completely finish the first Amnesia. I have a backlog of horror games (including some point n' clicks) that grows every day. Because I have a problem. I LOVE horror games... but like an ice cream enthusiast who happens to also be lactose intolerant, horror games do not love me. So there you have it; that's the score.\n\nNow that being said, I'm going to power through this one to completion. Know why? Because it's that good. Oh man is this game good. It is a testament to why horror games are so great... and why even now, in a market saturated with action horrors and tired old tropes, you'll still find an \"Among the Sleep.\" This game is horrifying. Care to know why? What's the biggest issue plaguing the horror genre? That's right: termites. And player empowerment. Sometimes I'm a big, brave guy lugging around a shotgun. Sometimes I'm running around with a camera. Sometimes I might as well be stark naked. But I always find myself on equal ground with the baddies. Sure they're menacing, but I'm faster. And smarter. And sometimes more heavily armed. And suddenly we're not playing a horror game anymore. So how do we remove player empowerment, a hypothetical developer might muse? How do we make the player feel like a babe lost in the woods? We turn them into a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing babe, right down to the wobbles and coos and imaginary friends.\n\nAnd when I tell you that makes this game immersive and terrifying, I'm not kidding. When you pause the screen you cover your little eyes. When you move at all, AT ALL, you make adorable little sounds of struggle. And when you, the player, gaze into that mother\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing abyss, that sucker stares right back. Every shadow hides a menace, every sound betrays a would-be threat. Everything is so big and intimidating. The whole environment just mocks you as you explore it semi-impotently. Because you're a baby. A smart baby, yes. But a baby. And that big, scary world is out to get you.\n\nI'm not remotely done with this game. I know I have a ways to go. I'm already freaked out - in a good way!

While it's not necessarily a horror game, those who have childhood memories of being a little kid will have some nostalgia.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics and atmosphere are beautiful in this game. There are many shapes and interesting stages that are warped around a child's mind and feeling. The design in some stages are on the playful and creepy side. It gives me a Yoshi's Story vibe from N64.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are a bit wacky, but still playable. You can toggle between crawling, walking, and running. However, you can't really walk and run for too long. You can press ESC to cover your eyes and pause the game, press a button to hug your teddy bear, and interact and throw objects. Just a heads up, you may want to set the controls once you start the game to default. When I started, there were no keys assigned.\n\nStory:\nWhere's mommy? What happened to mommy? Is mommy okay? I am looking everywhere for her with my teddy bear, but no sign of mommy. Why is she humming? Why is she crying? Why are there scary things out there?\n\nVoices:\nWhile there isn't much characters in game, the voice acting is great. The mother's voice is what I pictured: loving, caring, and struggling to keep a straight face in front of the baby. The baby's acting is natural...well of course straight from a baby. The teddy bear's voice acting is kinda creepy. In a child's ears, it sounds comforting. To us as adults...well...let's just say it's someone we don't want to hang around with our kids.\n\nGameplay:\nThere was a good bit of glitches and bugs in the game, but otherwise I was able to move around it. The good news is there isn't much of a consequence when it's game over. Instead, it spawns you a bit back to where you were. There were cases like In the forest where I was following a bridge that ended up leading to no where except off the stage. I thought it was part of the game so, of course, I fell off and it was game over. When I went back, the way spawned up. Another area is the closet, where in some cases you can see throughout all of the stage in some areas. Again, sometimes I walk through those areas, thinking it was part of the game...and I fell off the map. Another case is where some of the voices and lines don't pop up as well. In the closet, I played through it a few times to find the drawings, and some lines I never heard the first time popped up. Last case was at the well, where I was stuck and I could not even open the game menu and have to force close it.\n\nThat aside, the goal of the game is to collect objects to open the path further to finding your mom, and there are optional drawings you can collect and small objects to interact with for achievements. You just need to have an explore-like mindset to get through the game. There is a limit to walking and running, of course, since you're just a baby. You can get easily spooked in some areas and snatched up by creatures.\n\nHorror?:\nThis game is categorized as a horror game, but it's not really a horror game. Think of it as a 4 out of 10 on the horror scale and categorized as creepy. This game is suitable for preteens or people who don't really like horror games. If you're looking for a game that is creepy like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Slender: The Arrival, this isn't that category.\n\nOverall:\nDespite many bugs and glitches, Among The Sleep still earns itself as a unique and enjoyable game that can be played by preteens and up. With a switch from the normally-used  teenager or adult protagonist to a toddler, it shows the limits and imagination of the child through their eyes. With beautiful graphics, great atmosphere, and unique maneuvering to get through the game, this game is a unique gem of modern-day gaming. While it's not really a horror game, it's still a game that should be played and will be enjoyed by many.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful atmosphere and graphics.\n-Good voice acting.\n-Unique gameplay.\n\n???:\n-Not really a horror game.\n\nCons:\n-Glitches that can interfere gameplay, but moved around with.\n-Weird controls at times.\n-Bugs that may require you to restart the game.", "timestamp_created": 1556482691, "timestamp_updated": 1556483209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50329631": {"recommendationid": "50329631", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972303784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1556271725}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not saying the execution is bad.

Although I'd ultimately recommend the game, I also have to admit that I'm pretty disappointed with it. I feel like this is a really unique and interesting concept - after all, you don't assume the role of a baby in many games out there. However, it's poorly executed and marred by horrible controls. I used both the keyboard/mouse and a PS4 controller; each was awful. So alas, there's really no escaping it.\n\nThe story was interesting, albeit a bit predictable - especially in terms of the ending. Graphics are decent/generic. Voice acting is nice, but nothing special. Pausing the game results in an animation where the baby (player character) covers their eyes, which is pretty cute/clever and fitting. The game itself isn't very scary - there are a few minor jump scares, but that's it. I developed more anxiety during one of two short stealth \"puzzles\", but even they weren't terribly difficult.\n\nIf you can get the game on sale and you're willing to deal with the terrible controls, then Among the Sleep is a fun and slightly different experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to play it, though - which is a shame because like I said earlier, the concept itself is pretty neat. I feel like they could have done a lot with the player character being a baby (helpless, limited in the way they can interact with their environment/surroundings, etc.) and the game's half-hearted execution left me feeling disappointed.

You can climb up on chairs, drawers, and other platforms as well.  During the course of the game you will go through 4 chapters collecting memories and from time to time you have to hide or not get caught by a monster who lurks in just about each level.\n\nThe overall story that this short game tells, the graphic style, the sounds and music all make for a very enjoyable complete package.  As a horror game, or at least an intensified adventure experience, it actually does really well too.  The lighting creates a great atmosphere and mixed with the sounds and the music, it does create some haunting situations.\n\nOverall, I really liked this game, came back and completed the achievements which has you mainly collecting drawings made with crayons.  If the price is below $10 bucks, definitely worth the time to load up and play.  It's not perfect, nor is it too difficult or physically intense like a shooter would be.

I just knew I\u2019d be playing as a toddler. To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the game. Well, more like the atmosphere did a decent job of making me feel creeped out and uncomfortable.\n\nWhat made the experience unlike others was the perspective. Remember, the world is how the child sees it and that means everything feels much bigger than you. And more threatening. Even the teddy bear made me feel a little unsafe when picking it up since it was so close to my face with those eyes of its.\n\nThe story starts off somewhat normal with no horror elements until after the game lets you learn the moves. Crawling, toddling, and climbing are your main methods of locomotion. You can hold the bear to light the way in the darker areas. Keep in mind that you can\u2019t sprint toddle and hold the bear at the same time. And you will be sprinting unless you like being caught. There are some very light puzzles that can consist of finding an item and then using it or figuring out how to climb up to reach a doorknob. Most of the game is spent navigating the levels.\n\nThere are only a handful of jump scares. The game relies much more on tension, atmosphere, and the feeling of being pursued by a big ol\u2019 monster. I didn\u2019t know overcoats could make me feel anxious like they do in Among the Sleep. They look menacing and not very friendly.\n\nI can\u2019t say much about the story without spoiling it, but I thought it was handled well. It\u2019s a somber tale being told and a moment that made me shake my head with sadness.\n\nThe main game isn\u2019t that long. You\u2019ll probably spend around two hours with it. There\u2019s a prologue chapter somewhere, but I didn\u2019t have an urge to play it. I was content with what I\u2019ve already played.

Story is simple as well, yet very effective and displayed in areas and characters. You play as a toddler and face all his fears, while carrying a guardian teddy bear, which provides you light and safety in dark. The game is very creative and plays with every day items and locations, shifting and twisting them into obscure and unfriendly environment. The sounds are amazingly made, bringing eerie atmosphere and suspense. Another great feature is that the game contains museum chapter, a place where you can find all the info about the game contents and the development. It's interesting to see the path of creating the game, the ideas which were thrown away or redesigned, characters which got changed with time and story, etc. While the game has a plenty of strong sides, some parts may seem weak if you look for a game which takes a plenty of time to beat it, complicated puzzles or tough enemies. The game already offers a fine challenge, to test your senses and fear while crawling in the dark, surrounded by items and creatures perceived by toddlers.\n All in all, the game was a very pleasant experience.

La aventura se basa en los recuerdos y los traumas que tiene el ni\u00f1o protagonista. Para no destriparos m\u00e1s el argumento, no entrar\u00e9 m\u00e1s en detalles para dejaros que se\u00e1is vosotros los que los vay\u00e1is descubriendo mientras jug\u00e1is. El juego est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol. \n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\n\nEl control del beb\u00e9 es muy realista, pudiendo correr poca distancia y cayendo al suelo si lo hacemos durante mucho rato, siendo m\u00e1s fiable ir gateando a los sitios. Podemos manipular objetos, lanzar pelotas, arrastrar sillas para alcanzar pomos de puertas...\n\nEl juego se basa en avanzar por los escenarios y explorar en b\u00fasqueda de los dibujos, solucionar peque\u00f1os puzles, abrir puertas y conseguir objetos. En ocasiones tendremos que escondernos de \"cosas\" que ya descubrir\u00e9is por vosotros mismos. La ambientaci\u00f3n es muy buena y nos llevaremos unos buenos sustos. \n\nMuy recomendable jugarlo con mando, aunque con teclado es perfectamente jugable tambi\u00e9n. Yo lo he jugado con el mando de Xbox 360 y responde bastante bien (salvo alg\u00fan que otro problemilla) y tiene vibraci\u00f3n, lo cual nos ayudar\u00e1 a meternos m\u00e1s en la ambientaci\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\n\nEl juego luce bastante bien: escenarios muy variados y llenos de detalles, multitud de objetos, buenos efectos de luces y sombras... el problema es que tiene multitud de bugs gr\u00e1ficos, como fallos de clipping, haci\u00e9ndonos atravesar objetos constantemente, texturas que aparecen y desaparecen, etc. Estos fallos se hacen especialmente evidentes si intentamos acceder a zonas del escenario que no estaban pensadas para ello, pero choca bastante que sean tan habituales siendo la versi\u00f3n mejorada.

I say 'game' loosely. This is more of a psychological journey into how the mind of this 2-year old perceives, and is affected by what goes on in their life. The mechanics were perfect, turn the crosshair off unless you get frustrated trying to centre the screen to interact with things, go into the controls and make sure they are all assigned as for some reason, 'throw' wasn't on mine, then turn the lights off and play!

Then visit the museum and play the Prologue chapter afterwards, as unlike most behind-the-scenes content, it is actually really interesting and rewarding and adds more depth to the game and a great insight into the developers minds! \n\nThe only negative is there is not really any replay value. There were drawings to collect as I went but it didn't let me know how many I found or reveal anything for doing so. Maybe alternate endings would have helped, or a hardcore mode where you only get one chance, with relevant steam achievements attached to spur on players to replay.

Lots of poping in the environement. i guess the LOD management system had some issues or the tool doesnt clear the cash in the game and the player can encounter this sort of issue. \n\nGameplay:\n- i dont feel it was necessary for the toddler to be alternating between crawl and walk. kid is suppose to be 2, kids start walking around 1. and when running for a certain  amount of time to trip is not necessary. my son has been walking since he is 10 months so he doesnt trip at 2 he runs and never stops. \n-Opening door is sometimes tedious \n-grabbing objects doesnt feel great, the mechanic of throwing object is introduce in the fourth level, this is something other level could have experienced with. \n-Navigation is a bit hard with the collision not being smooth, you have to look at your feet to make sure you can walk over collisions, like little woodboards that are elevated can make you feel stuck if you are not looking \n\ngame is short around 2.5 hours \nI still wanted to complete it i was curious to see where it would get. \ni didnt feel vunerable enough as a kid, i would have love to get the bear more interaction and maybe some save or help from the bear to have a better attachment to the character \n\ni still loved the game, maybe i will play again in the future.

Along for the ride is your new teddy bear that you got for your 2nd birthday. The voice acting for the bear is really appropriate and well executed.\n\nSince you're a baby, you know the game will do the whole \"new perspective\" thing on the environments. They don't do anything creative with the new viewpoint though, but it's nothing too bad either. The environments are pretty middling at best. \n\nOver the course of the game you figure out more of the story behind everything as everything slowly unravels. And then in the last 30% of the game, the whole point is more than revealed yet the game still has the need to beat your over the head with the message that it showed. It seems the developers forgot that only the player's character's a baby, not the player themselves. Overall it's a good story and I was fine with the conclusion. If the game didn't obviously hit you over the head with the conclusion for a good chunk of the game, it'd be on par with games like Layers of Fear, which kept things more vague for a longer time. \n\nThe visuals are alright. It's relatively colourful and there's darkness aplenty. Though luckily it's never too dark to not see. Don't expect top tier texture quality or amazing visual tricks. \n\nThe gameplay's very basic. You're a baby, so you're small. Interact with the environment to make up for it. Open drawers to create makeshift ledges and Mirror's Edge your way through a kitchen or some other place. The game makes you find certain things and that's pretty much the entire gameplay loop. You enter the level, you need a certain item from it. To get to that item, you have to complete a treasure hunt to open the route to that specific item. Later in the game, you'll have a baby's first Outlast aspect, where you hide from the \"big bad\". It sees you, you hide in or under something, wait for it to go away and you keep moving. The game's forgiving with the \"big bad\". Often it makes it disappear or just walk the wrong way, which makes it more easy, but also way better overall. Nothing's more annoying than having to wait 15 minutes to get through a 5-10 minute long level. The level design's well made and I didn't get stuck once. Everything was intuitive and nice to go through. \n\nThere's also a small DLC level, called \"Prologue\". It's overall a good level. It doesn't have the teddy from the main game for obvious reasons and I do think the level suffers because of it. Overall though, it's basically a level with 5 extremely simple puzzles. Do them and you're finished.

The game puts you into the shoes of a two-year-old where you start to experience and see things that are not natural. As you progress through several nightmares or levels with the help of your Teddy Bear, you start to figure out what exactly they represent, up until the end where it all makes sense. \n\nI kinda figured it out as I was playing but overall it was a decent story, one that may reflect with some players.\n\nStory rating: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAmong The Sleep is basically a creepy walking simulator. You basically have to traverse several levels, find some keys to progress, find some objects and short moments where you have to avoid the monsters. It's basically the baby version of Amnesia but a lot less scary and no difficulty at all. \n\nMovement felt kinda janky and going from crouching to standing or climbing and using your light was at times very cumbersome. \n\nGameplay rating:  7/10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe game's audio is quite well done. It does help a lot in creating a very creepy atmosphere and the soundtrack impacts that creepiness level as well. There's also some voice acting, which was all decent. The overall sound design is probably and should always be one the most important aspects of a creepy/horror game and I think it does a good job here. \n\nAudio rating:  8/10\n\n[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]\nThe atmosphere is okay most of the times and varies somewhat from forest areas to weird indoor locations. It's mostly very dark so you can't really tell or admire the levels. \n\nPerformance is as you can imagine, really good, no issues running the game and I have not encountered any kind of bugs. \n\nGraphics, performance and tech analysis rating: 7.5/10\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall Among the Sleep is an okay horror game or not even horror but mostly just a creepy experience one that ultimately does pay off, at least for me. Some may not find the conclusion that interesting but I'd say at this point if you still didn't get the game on the endless sales and bundles, go for it when you get the chance. \n\n[h1]Final score:  7.5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1551908688, "timestamp_updated": 1559166265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723282039165496826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49400758": {"recommendationid": "49400758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101369033", "num_games_owned": 1867, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1500819243}, "language": "english", "review": "Key for someone to take, to prevent a bot from taking it fill in the blanks with the letters below\n9_FYW-JTWQT-ALHV_\n\nfirst blank is H\n2nd blank is E", "timestamp_created": 1551902251, "timestamp_updated": 1551902251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549848854541778564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49388315": {"recommendationid": "49388315", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989856276", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1551845323}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall score: 82, great work :)\n\nMy friend gave me this game yesterday and i must say i heard for this game for the first time. I generally like horror games. Then i started to play and i wasn't to thrilled :) then i finished at the 3/4 of the game i was  satisfied that story is more like social drama kind :) i like those and that monsters are in fact struggle of this young boy.. Long story short, at the end i started prologue and i felt like im even more attached to game than ever before cuz it quite showing of harsh reality that it is if your single parent is alcoholic during the childhood. Then i found out concept art and 'directors cut' and i must say i am checking out it for 2hrs reading all of it and im thrilled even more than ever before :O wow.. this game is hidden masterpiece :) i like some ideas you had.. this 2 worlds (house and forrest ''house'' is really awesome), im happy you didn't add the boss (hill of garbage) cuz i hate those ''generative'' rooms (like hospitals, schools enviroment, etc..)\n\nIt is an interesting idea that you had about cute teddybear lurking you in dangerous adventure. but as i understood that then the concept of the story would be completely different. If i need to decide i have more likely to see ''social kvazi-traumatic experience'' like its now..)\n\noverall I like all aspects of the game:\n- Graphics 10/10 \u2192 I like your game of shadows and placing objects on the spot to look like monster.\n- Level design 7/10 (everything good except this swamp..) - its good idea i'd like to keep it but it seems to be unfinished or shall i say incomplete. Misplaced and should be combined with ''teddybear lurks you into dangerous adventure'' + it would be place which is behind the house (even a minute walk from home) \u2192 I'm sorry to see you didn't have time to do it like you though at first.\n- Physics 9/10 working actually very good, i didnt expect that.\n- Audio 9/10 less is more :)\n- Content 6/10 \u2192 The biggest minus is lack of content..\n\nconclusion: I definitly reccomand the game. Sensitive story, touching, easy puzzles..\n\nP.S. i missed to see dad at the end (before credits) felt quite empty when open doors and just white screen infront of me)", "timestamp_created": 1551845295, "timestamp_updated": 1551845295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515063166618347168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49370458": {"recommendationid": "49370458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037502679", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 246, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1551739912}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice story that you will understand closer to the end of the game unless you can figure it out before that.\nIt is a short game 2.5-3 hours.\nAs a toddler you solve puzzles to progress further and to finally find your mother.\nThere is thou something out there that will chase you if you disturb them.\nA nice little game to enjoy if you like easy puzzle, walking/crawling around games.", "timestamp_created": 1551782964, "timestamp_updated": 1551782964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553248882293701172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49223309": {"recommendationid": "49223309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283790093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1669523511}, "language": "english", "review": "A game so unique, that I could not stop playing. the whole time your mind is playing tricks on you. fear of what may come out in the shadows.

You play as a two year old and have to experience a very scary and beautiful world. You take in your surroundings from the perspective of this child so everything just looks so big. The animation, the sounds, the design, it was all done so perfectly. You can tell the developers really cared for this game especially since even after it was released they were fine-tuning it and even released a prologue DLC absolutely free a few months later. The story is very interesting and you have no idea whats going on at first. The controls work perfectly and are quite realistic. For example, if your running for a long period of time the kid will fall over and start crawling, since your playing as a two year old this is quite the realistic feature in this case though it can get annoying here and there. It's well done and I would love to see a Among The Sleep 2. The enhanced edition, which is upgraded for free if you own the original, was released 3 years later, adding quite a bit and changing a lot of stuff. Sadly it also removes some things that I found cool but luckily I am one of the people that managed to play and beat the game before the enhanced edition released.

Something that an adult wouldn't find terrifying is filtered through the eyes of a child and turned into an absolute terror. While it is a short and rather linear game it's a unique experience that no other horror game has properly covered prior or since, and it's done beautifully. \n\nIt's your second birthday party with just you and your mother, when a man arrives at the door with a present for you - a teddy bear that can walk and talk to you. After you've had your cake and are getting ready for a nap, your teddy is stolen from you and your mother disappears. You and your bear crawl out into the darkened house to find her, traveling across several dark and twisted worlds to discover the story of what happened to her, and to you.\n\nPlaying from a toddler's perspective puts a twist on everything we're shown as adults, obscure hints at the story come out as seemingly obvious to us. Even from the start we're given context as to what the life as this child is like, and what happened to our family. Symbolism through all the levels gives clues as to how the ending plays out, but it never fully clicks until the last half hour of the game. The subtle hints and the gentle guiding toward the deep and darker meaning behind it all is done with the right balance of hand holding and throwing you into the story that most would make sense of things right away, and see the underlying messages for what they are.\n\nMost of the game is based around collecting items or solving puzzles to unlock the next area, having you crawl through small spaces to find new areas or pulling yourself up on drawers to reach areas higher up. There are collectables to find through the game, different drawings that provide more clues toward the story and give you achievements for taking the time to find. Most of the gameplay feels very appropriate for the setting, and semi-realistic for the capabilities of a toddler with a sentient bear guiding him along. Paired with the environment where coats look like monsters and furnaces can come to life and chase you down, Among the Sleep does an amazing job at playing on and bringing to life all our worst childhood fears just in the gameplay alone.\n\nVisually, the game has a tone that reminds me of a \"dark vibrance\", where a lot of the child-like items such as toys and plushes are very bright and colorful but muted by the horror tones of the game, giving them an eerie quality. It does have some optimization problems and the lower end graphics glitched/stuttered at some points on my average laptop, but the visuals are still beautifully done and only add to the immersion and fantasy-based storytelling. It feels very much like a child's nightmare, and everywhere you look is something that reminds you that you're not only playing as a child, but you're supposed to be scared.\n\nAmong the Sleep is a unique horror game that lovers of the genre should appreciate. It reminds us all of the things we were scared of as children, and brings them to life in such a way that can scare us all over again as adults. Anyone who enjoys unique indie horror games should add Among the Sleep to their library.", "timestamp_created": 1546123530, "timestamp_updated": 1546123530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619092881679534912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47881530": {"recommendationid": "47881530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056079806", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1545957105}, "language": "english", "review": "Good couple of hours of nice story telling.

It's a very average kind of puzzle game (quite literally) that poses no challenge whatsoever. \nWhile it could be interesting as a concept, it is flawed in its premisis: it isn't exactly much fun and it doesn't have a story good enough that will draw you in...the level design is not the most boring but at the same time it doesn't really have anything special to offer to eyesight. You get to walk or crawl across a few levels that, to be honest, are quite linear and are truly set on rails. You don't have much to do other than follow the storyline/path and make sure to avoid the monster triggered by the scripts when you perform certain actions or hear a certain soundtrack. \n\nIt also isn't particularly fun because, for the most part, it is designed with height and platforms in mind, BUT you get told from the start that your best choice for moving around should be by crawling instead of walking, and the game does indeed make that annoying by literally causing you to fall on your face once every few steps if you decide you'd rather walk and see stuff. Also, you're often supposed to vault on furniture or other items, and the whole animation is something you cannot control, it is both unnerving and unpleasing to me. Why the heck we can't jump? It's not a game designed with realism in mind, for God sake.\n\n\nLast but most important, this game is boring because it is so damn repetitive: you're supposed to look for 4 different items from the start, and aside of that being so clich\u00e8, old school and whatever you can call it, they really didn't try hard to make it enjoyable or that interesting at all. Actually, several areas are nearly literally a copypaste in the way they play and feel. \nThe final level is perhaps the only one that somewhat truly redeemes the whole game as it becomes more of an actual dream-like experience and less of a rational or plain scenario with the odd bits and pieces here and there, it actually tickles your mind a fair bit and has elements that could well belong to \"Alice: Madness returns\". \n\nOh, and the bugs. You sometimes can get stuck, or happen to fall into water because you slipped 2cm within the closest river. A particular corner in one of the scenario has an issue where you can literally see the whole skybox through the room. And i could replicate that bug really easily! Why they couldnt fix it in the first place?? \n\nOverall this game isn't terrible. But it isn't expressing its full potential for sure. The gameplay lacks so much depth...the story seems to offer interesting suggestions here and there, but not that much is getting delivered.

It's a story of a broken family, a kid who is too young to understand, and a freaking creepy teddy bear. Among the Sleep is written very well, and the voice actor for Teddy is comforting and unsettling at the same time. How he managed that, I can't even hazard a guess. \n\nThe plot is fairly predictable, but it's about the journey. This is more of a horror themed walking simulator (i.e., Layers of Fear) rather than a strictly horror game. You can \"die,\" but it's quite easy to get through without ever having failed at your tasks. This is NOT an action adventure game. It's essential that you take your time, explore, enjoy the art and the perspective of being a terrified 2 year old, so that you will find all the beauty and depth that lies in the game. The level designs are fantastic, surrealistic, and appropriate for the mind of a toddler. I loved how many things look like feet or people out of the corner of one's eye. \n\nI got this game in a bundle, so I can't say if it's worth the full price or not. It's only 3-5 hours long or so, but they are a very good handful of hours. I'd highly recommend this at $10 or under. If you are already familiar with, and comfortable with \"walking simulators,\" then you can't really go wrong at full price either.\n\nLiked this review?

And as someone going into this looking to be blown away after seeing a few LPs of the intro and trailers on youtube I can tell you it falls short. It falls short of the promises it gives of scares and gameplay and I'm bitterly disappointed.\n\nCons:\n-It is way too short. If I were a better gamer with better reaction times and better spacial reasoning I would have completed it in under 2 hours. For such a powerhouse of promises I'd expect at least in the 4 hour mark for the amount this game cost. \n-There is very little hinting in the way of the ending and it feels like it comes out of nowhere.\n-The obstacles aren't very challenging as a puzzle game and mostly little physics things that anyone could figure out.\n-As a horror game it's mostly jump scares or distant glimpses that are often missed and you have to rely on a sound cue to know they even happened (this occured 4 times).\n-The whole of the game is really linear with very little diversion from the beaten path.\n-As a stealth game there's very little threat as they disappear after they do their patrol over whatever trigger caused them to spawn. \n-There are instances that break the immersion that happened frequently where I would climb and the model would clip through the environment and I'd see through the world.\n-There are collectables...I'm sorry this is just a personal issue but I really don't think collectables have a place in horror. If your game is truly frightening then it's not worth hanging around to look for extras once you clear a room. It's just confirmation from the creators that they also don't think the sense of dread I should get from this game is present.\n\nPros: \n- The music and sound design overall is one of the few pieces that are hype worthy.\n- If you like jump-scares and spooky noises this is your jam.\n- The graphics are a solid 8/10 with the acception of the clipping issue through the environment (seriously guys just fix it with a black background under the world). \n\n4/10 not a fan.\n\nIt's a very placcid horror game with very little meat left after all the build up I've seen it get. It has 0 replayability and the ending felt like it came out of nowhere. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1524601718, "timestamp_updated": 1524601718, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492957741022109985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41565115": {"recommendationid": "41565115", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974781470", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1493605930}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved it. \n\nControls are clunky, but kids this age can barely drink out of a cup without messing it up, so whatever, pass. \n\nStory's great, \n\nKind of a walking sim with some run and hide bits, not a difficult game, but there's a good creep factor to it all. \n\nTreat yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1524110473, "timestamp_updated": 1550113065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41532834": {"recommendationid": "41532834", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993929017", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1523933695}, "language": "english", "review": "In this game you play as a mentally deficient two year old as he searches for his lost doodles.

The developers cleverly made this brain injury a reality for you, the player, through frustratingly unresponsive controls. As you find your doodles, you will be chased by[spoiler]your parents as they attempt to stop you from receiving a second brain injury as you climb shelves and countertops that are dangerously high for anyone under the age of four. As the game progresses, you learn that your selfish desire for your lost doodles has driven your mother to drink herself into a stupor as you wander off into a bright light that claims to be your father. So I guess that makes you Jesus.[/spoiler]\n\nShort and sweet game with a nice story that touches subjects you won't find in other games.

This may be regarded as an \"indie\" game, but personally I think the number of staff involved in the project, should've yielded a more polished experience. I would've recommended this title had the developers focused on EITHER polishing the gameplay OR the games aesthetics.\n\n///\n\n*** SPOILERS CONTAINED IN REVIEW *** \n\nAmong the Sleep has an interesting concept; a child loses their mother and goes on a quest to find them. The main technique used to convey said child's perspective is very simple, move the camera closer to the ground. The aforementioned technique does successfully make the player feel small in the world, which somewhat adds to the tension. On the other hand, the mechanics used in representing \"child-like\" movement certainly misses the mark. Yes, the idea of crawling along the ground (giving the player faster movement) is somewhat effective - in combination with the ability to sprint, which should the player do so for too long, ends in a tumble - but personally I think the movement is lacking and frustrating. I should WANT to explore the world around me, not be thinking \"FFS this is a chore\".\n\nThe game's conflict / puzzles consist of interacting with objects in the game world. Again, this should not feel tedious and inconsistent. If you plan to have the player manipulate objects in the environment there are some design elements that you need to consider.\n\nFirstly, don't include a Rotate Object input / function unless you use this effectively in the solution of your puzzles. I never used said feature in the game, but did find the need for the ability to \"Push\" and \"Pull\" an object towards me, for better environment navigation.\n\nSecondly, have the objects placement / speed match that of the player camera manipulation. Unforutnately, there were numerous scenarios where I found myself losing control of the object I was trying to interact with. You may say that this is the result of trying to model a child's lack of motor skills with objects, but that feels like a cop out for an unfinished mechanic. If you \"wanted\" the player to struggle with objects, thus increasing the tension of interacting with an object, then have more breakable / perishing objects that should the player fail their interactions, they have to \"restart\" the puzzle / interaction.\n\nAs far as the game's narrative tone and sense of conflict goes, quite frankly I don't think there is any. If you proceed along the linear environment's series of \"fetch quests\" without exploring, then the ham fisted reveal of the mother being an alcoholic may feel satisfying and provide some explanation for the events transpiring around you. Personally, I explored the kitchen environment (Chapter 1) and immediately found an abundance of bottles, leading me to think \"the family has an alcoholic in it, great! How creative.\"\n\nThe game's aesthetics also leave a lot to be desired. The majority of players around the world have an abundance of graphical power, begging to be used. If this game were to be released in 2006-2010, then maybe I would be more forgiving, but unfortunately that's not the case. It's my understanding that the game was developed at a time when Allegorithmic had released Substance Painter / Designer, with very affordable and reasonable pricing for said software. Given the budget / funding that you had secured, use of a PBR workflow would've substainlly improved the game's aesthetic appeal.\n\nAll in all, I'm mostly disappointed in this interactive experience. I would rather not use the term game when describing Among the Sleep, as it simply doesn't include enough variety and conflict to earn said moniker. Alternatively, I would've loved to have been taken on a linear experience, that was a feast for my eyes and made me feel scared. Unfortunately, the developers dabbled in both and came up short.\n\n2 out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1517728252, "timestamp_updated": 1517728252, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503875970840454102", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39736629": {"recommendationid": "39736629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030629945", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1617222613}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Toddler-hood is Creepy as Heck![/h1]\n\nThis game's been out a while, but with the enhanced edition, it's worth getting a second look.

The developers' overarching goal was to generate an atmosphere where the player could legitmately experience fear from the perspective of a 2-year-old. So they tweaked the environment enough to make everyday things become jarring. And, in some cases, not-so-everyday.\n\nQuestion numero dos: Is it survivor horror? Sorta. Chapter 3 and the Prologue (you're gonna play the prologue as an epilogue when everything else is done because...reasons) have a mysterious figure chasing you. It's reminiscent of that one chapter in [i]The Vanishing of Ethan Carter[/i]. Challenging? Meh. Scary? Oh yeah!\n\nQuestion the third: Is it worth it? Yep!

Checkpoints too few and far between, bugs that broke the game.  Recommend if you can acutally get it to work.\n\nNow then.  It started out well-adorable kid has a nice birthday with mommy, plays with a mildly disturbing talking teddy-nice way to do the tutorial, by the way-goes to bed with ONE BITE of cake!  NOOOO!!!!  Cue it was a dark and stormy night, and we're on our way.  The on-edge creepy feeling of being a 2 today year old during a thunderstorm was very nicely done.  I loved the \"monster\", which I only saw a few times, but it was charmingly child creepy.  I loved the setting-your house but with a dark and scary twist, and some nice impossible architecture.  I adored the magic paitings.  Sound was used very well, and the storm!  I LOVE when a game has good storm effects!  I got about 3/4 of the way through-yes i got stuck, hence my long playtime-and then it just fell apart.  At the very end of the closet level, it just bugs out for me.  I could not get past the trench coat man, no matter what I tried.  It was a disappointing failure in an otherwise enjoyable game.  So, I never got to finish it.  That was the good.  Now the bad.  \n\nLack of controller support put me off immedaiately.  My hands don't do so well with keyboard controls; they feel unnatural and uncomfortable to me.  Many times I curse the fact that crawl is Crtl, which is right next to the Windows key, and therefore had me hitting it by mistake at the worst times.  There were some notable graphical fails, which had me falling through the floor of the world.  It was too dark, and I had to blast gamma to see anything at some points.  And finally, the checkpoints are too far between.  It was good, could have been great, if not for these issues and the fact I couldn't finish the game.", "timestamp_created": 1514012465, "timestamp_updated": 1514012567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38523447": {"recommendationid": "38523447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971747902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1513930199}, "language": "english", "review": "It\u00b4s really a nightmarish feeling to go through this nice designed dark levels without having a gun or any weapons.\nSo I was even frightended 2 or 3 times.

Where this quirky game really excels is the execution of its unique storyline.\n\nYou\u2019re placed in the teeny shoes of a two-year-old toddler who must search for his mother after being thrust into a series of vivid dreamscapes that all encompass some warped vision of childhood memories and fears. Everything in the world seems massive and imposing - even the coats found hanging in wardrobes bear a resemblance to domineering adults in the eyes of a frightened and confused child. This exaggerated verticality isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll likely consciously notice at first, but it\u2019s a subtly effective way of making the world feel hostile and unfamiliar. The Unity-powered visuals won\u2019t win any awards for technical prowess, but the art and sound design do an excellent job at building the atmosphere.\n\nBut while the level design does a decent job at establishing the atmosphere, it does a much poorer job of giving it any significant payoff. There are only a handful of monster encounters in the course of the story, and it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find them particularly scary if you\u2019ve played any survival horror games before. Their behaviour is so heavily scripted and lacking in challenge that most people will find sneaking past them to be a cakewalk (In my case, I didn\u2019t end up dying once). There is an argument to be had that making a horror game too difficult can result in something more frustrating than scary. At the same time though, when there\u2019s no tangible threat to the player during these moments, it\u2019s hard for me to really take the monster chases seriously - particularly when I once ran the wrong way and was able to walk right past one without it seeming to notice.\n\nThe story however, is something I haven\u2019t seen done before in a video game - [spoiler]the portrayal of an abusive relationship as seen through the eyes of a young child. You eventually learn that the environments aren\u2019t merely spooky dreamscapes, but represent the fears and anxieties of this small lad\u2019s mind as he struggles to comprehend the emotional torment going on around him[/spoiler]. Among the Sleep pulls this off surprisingly well without having to resort to explicit images or gratuitous violence - instead, we\u2019re able to understand this childhood fear through symbolism and subtle environmental cues. It\u2019s a shame that the conclusion feels rather abrupt and ends on a slightly rushed note, but the game\u2019s short three-hour length at least means that the story never feels padded or overstretched.\n\nTaken as a whole, Among the Sleep is a somewhat variable survival horror experience - it\u2019s gameplay, while intuitive enough, doesn\u2019t really do enough to connect the player the the narrative itself, which I suspect might lead some people to label the game as little more than a walking simulator. Despite this, the story Krillbite has conjured up, while not always coherent, is unique and interesting.\n\n[b]TL:DR: If you\u2019re looking for a substantial gameplay experience, then you might be better off with one of Among the Sleep\u2019s many horror contemporaries. If you\u2019re looking for something a little special, then this is still worth picking up on the cheap.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1504022121, "timestamp_updated": 1504022121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34532600": {"recommendationid": "34532600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354043040", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 230, "last_played": 1490415383}, "language": "english", "review": "This games was good.

I had a few frustrations with the controls and the saving system, I played on a gaming laptop, with just a touchpad and no mouse. Mostly, the controls were okay, but there were a few places where you have to wind things and it took me a while to work out how to do that on my touchpad (for anyone else having the same trouble: hold down the left touchpad button and then draw circles on the touchpad, rather than the more expected swiping in the direction you want to wind). There were also a couple of times where I needed to throw items, but there was no linked key. I had to come out of the game and edit the controls before I could throw anything.\n\nI was also confused by the saves. Every time I picked up a drawing, it said my game was saving. And if I died, I seemed to go back to set check-points. But if I exited the game part way through a chapter, I didn't re-enter either at my most recently collected drawing or at somewhere that had been a check-point after dying. Instead, I seemed to wind up back at the start of a chapter, which was a bit frustrating.

The game its self is an Idie, Adventure, Horror.\nI would say that it's pretty good. It all starts with a simple uninteresting start (I would say), but very atmospheric and cool looking. The game leads you into a interesting puzzle-ish, nightmare \"thing\". You are being followed my a mysterious man who wants to catch you, and as your supporter you have a teddy bear that has been given by your mom on your birthday. You go through puzzles to find memories that you collect to go through the whole game, so that you can find out...\n\nMy final thoughts are that I really enjoyed the game. I got it for 2.99$ and played 3 hours of it. For me it was totaly worth it.

There is a big, colorful, full of surprises yet at the same time scary and all-consuming world for a young mind to explore for the first time and the game conveys that feeling in a superb way. Among the Sleep has very little dialogue but manages to create a wonderfully frightening setting for you to play through.\n\nYou play as toddler and as you'd expect you'll find no shotguns or laser weapons to defend yourself. Just good old fashioned running and hiding. The world around you is big and scary as it would probably seem to a defenseless child without his parents and yet upon closer inspection you'll realize that appearances can be deceiving as nicely presented in the first moments of the game which will set the tone for what's to come.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective the game offers a short 2-3 hour run (including the free 'Prologue' DLC) but has a really nice and open to interpretation story to tell which I will not spoil here. The main focus of the gameplay is basic puzzle solving which range from easy to extremely easy. There's nothing really challenging here which in the context of the game feels like a natural expectation. In fact the hardest thing for me for the entirety of the game were the really awkward controls and handling of the main character, but again you'd not expect a toddler to be able to run and jump like a ninja so even here it fits within the theme of the game.\n\nYou are also accompanied by your talking teddy bear which will assist you through your journey. There were a few great moments between the toddler and teddy which make for more character development than I've seen in AAA titles with 10 times the gameplay duration.\n\nGraphically the game is not something I'd praise; nonetheless it succeeds with the simplicity of the Unity engine to create a very fitting atmosphere to get lost into. Ambient sounds and music merge well with the gameplay and what little voice acting is there, is excellently done. I'll truly say that there are several moments in the game where you will feel scared and alone and that's something that is the result of the excellent work the developers did by intertwining several simplistic concepts.\n\nDespite its short duration, lack of replayability (besides getting the collectibles) and how easy it is, Among the Sleep has charisma in its presentation and a fascinating albeit polarizing story for the player to interpret.

Soon you'll be on your own to explore a distorted version of this toddler's house and dream world, armed with your new Teddy as sole companion.\n\nThe developers obviously have no idea how a 2-year-old sounds like (hint: it's not a baby anymore) and they repeatedly make small realism mistakes that might briefly irk real parents, but controlling such a young character is decidedly refreshing and well done for the most part.\n\nThey added some nice touches, such as the inevitable stumbles when running for any length of time, or hugging Teddy for some comfort with the added benefit of producing enough light to partially see in the dark.\n\nMoving chairs to reach higher places normally not accessible to a young child introduce simple puzzles, though interactions could have used more variety as a whole. These physics-based challenges would be infinitely complex for a toddler but are very simple for an adult, so breezing through the game is done with relative ease.\n\nThe game is only scary if you let it be. Your decidedly creepy talking Teddy keeps saying we should be quiet but there's absolutely no danger until the latter half of the game, when your toddler finally comes face to face with his nightmare in screeching distortion and static. A lot of tension rises from that moment, when you must rapidly crawl to safety under a table or bed to escape the hazy creature unseen.\n\nUnfortunately, that tension soon dissipates once you realize your character always easily awakens a few meters away when caught, with any danger gone. It only temporarily halts gameplay and diminishes the fun in crawling to safety just in time to hide.\n\nCollect memories as main story progression and optionally drawings for extra achievements. Beware that the game does not track progress of such collectibles, if you are into that sort of thing, nor do they add any value to the story or gameplay.\n\nProgress does not save at all mid-chapter either, despite a very obvious mention of the game being saved at different checkpoints.

It is put together really well. The challenges and obstacles  in your way are thoughtful and excellently designed to get you interacting with the world. I was never frustrated or confused. The level design is masterful in that sense. You are propelled further into this well crafted world where every object has meaning. Krillbite have put a lot of love and care into this experience. \n\nHowever, while the concept works on paper, I found Among the Sleep to be a little lacking in its narrative punch. My conclusion is that it is hamstrung by the protagonist being a toddler. Krillbite do a great job of bringing to life the world through a child's eyes. All manner of everyday objects loom large and will make you double take as you see monsters in coatracks and end tables with cloth draped over them. But you're also limited to having exposition be given by your teddy bear companion. You cannot read or talk. At times it feels as though you are being very forcibly spoon-fed the narrative, and it comes off a bit clunky. The concept works as both a fantastic creative constraint, but also a difficult barrier to overcome. \n\nI'm a great fan of suspense, interactive storytelling, and adventure. Maybe it's unfair to compare this to Frictional Games' Amnesia series and its successor SOMA - but that's precisely where this game sits. The same interaction methods, the same obstacle, narrative, obstacle, narrative beat - the same horror/suspense theming. Among the Sleep's contemporaries have hit some pretty high notes. They explore deep philosophical questions in great detail. Among the Sleep's message, which I won't spoil here, just didn't land with the same weight. \n\nI don't regret my time with Among the Sleep, but I can't recommend it over other, similar titles.

How many games have you play through the eyes of a toddler? This is certainly the only one I am aware of.  I can give bonus points for originality here and in a horror title no less, which is no easy thing to do these days.  \n\nAmong the Sleep does a terrific job at immersing you into the world because of its engrossing atmosphere and ambiance. I will admit I was pretty spooked at certain points.  The mechanics are reminiscent of Frictional Games' Amnesia and Penumbra titles; you can interact with items in the world but there is zero puzzle solving that you will find in the aforementioned games.  It is more so a matter of finding and interacting with objects that help you progress through the game. \n\nYou cannot fight the few enemies encountered, instead, you must avoid them at all costs and make your way past them.  This characteristic of horror games I have found is either absolutely loved or hated typically.  I personally enjoy it because it puts the player in a helpless state and gives you all the more reason to be scared.  This is, after all, the effect all horror games should invoke.  But there are those who are annoyed or frustrated by this and I can understand that.\n\nAmong the Sleep unfortunately suffers from a few issues however.  My biggest problem with it is the technical issues I have experienced.  The amount of stuttering I encountered was surprisingly bothersome.  Considering the very short length of the game (anywhere between 1 and 4 hours depending on your playstyle and if you are hunting for achievements), you would have expected it to be significantly more polished.  The stuttering and major fps drops are distracting and certainly take away from game's immersion.  I could have 150 fps for a moment then suddenly it drops just below 60 and it is awfully noticeable.  My rig also is running on an 6600k, gtx 980, and 16 gb of ram, way above the game's recommended requirements.\n\nThe last but smaller problem I had with the game is the save system.  Throughout each chapter, as you play, the game will notify you that it's saving which is all well and good if you die because you will restart from your last save point.  Unfortunately though, if you quit a chapter mid game, you will have to start that chapter from the very beginning.  Not a huge deal given its short length but misleading because when you see the game autosaving, you assume you can just quit and return at the moment of the auto save, not the case here.\n\nAll this aside, Among the Sleep is a unique experience and is definitely worth adding to your library.

Siguiendo la estela de juegos como Amnesia o su precursor Penumbra, en Among the Sleep no podemos luchar ni defendernos de los (escasos) enemigos que pululan por el t\u00edtulo, sino que s\u00f3lo podremos huir o escondernos. La sensaci\u00f3n de vulnerabilidad se ve a\u00fan m\u00e1s acentuada teniendo en cuenta que, al encarnar a un ni\u00f1o muy peque\u00f1o, todo nuestro entorno adquiere unas dimensiones colosales, resultando en que tareas tan sencillas como abrir una puerta o recoger un objeto de una estanter\u00eda se convierten en una odisea. \n\nEl juego pone toda la carne en el asador en su ambientaci\u00f3n, digna del mejor Tim Burton, o de la macabra Alicia de American McGee. Nuestra madre ha desaparecido, y nuestro \u00fanico compa\u00f1ero es un osito de peluche bastante desgastado y viejo, al que podemos abrazar para alumbrar el camino. Los escenarios saben aprovechar muy bien la perspectiva de un ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o, convirtiendo entornos familiares y dom\u00e9sticos en territorios hostiles y apabullantes, y los inquietantes efectos de sonido ponen a\u00fan m\u00e1s de su parte para inyectarnos esa dosis de indefensi\u00f3n y vulnerabilidad que atribuimos a la edad del protagonista. Estos escenarios no tardan en mezclarse con entornos irreales y on\u00edricos, donde la l\u00f3gica se desvanece y la imaginaci\u00f3n del ni\u00f1o los transforma en mundos de cuento oscuros donde sus mayores miedos cobran realidad. La perspectiva de un personaje infante se ve reforzada por detalles como que todos los textos del juego son un galimat\u00edas sin sentido (con 2 a\u00f1os todav\u00eda no sabemos leer), lo que ayuda a crear la atm\u00f3sfera perfecta que este t\u00edtulo requiere. Quiz\u00e1s en algunos momentos los escenarios se sienten repetitivos o desaprovechados, como que la premisa hubiese dado a una mayor explosi\u00f3n de creatividad visual. \n\nA nivel jugable estamos ante un t\u00edtulo sencillo que no reporta un gran reto por lo general. La mayor\u00eda consiste en deambular por los escenarios en busca de objetos que recoger y puzzles bastante sencillos que resolver. No es hasta m\u00e1s o menos la mitad del t\u00edtulo cuando nos toparemos con el primer y \u00fanico monstruo que hay en todo el juego (sin contar el del DLC), el cual, pese a su sencillez y a sus mec\u00e1nicas simplonas y predecibles, consigue arrancarnos muchos escalofr\u00edos en cada una de sus apariciones. Yo, en lo personal, lo pas\u00e9 MUY mal, debido a que me trajo recuerdos traum\u00e1ticos de mi infancia, donde mi padre tuvo la genial idea de aleccionarme a que me portara bien cont\u00e1ndome con pelos y se\u00f1ales el cuento de la perversa Bruja Curuja, lo que provoc\u00f3 en m\u00ed un ciclo de pesadillas constantes en los que la susodicha me visitaba todas las noches y me hac\u00eda sufrir de lo lindo.\n\nEl t\u00edtulo es bastante corto, y muchos encontrar\u00e1n esta escasez de adversarios de los que huir un poco desalentadora para darle la oportunidad a este juego. Pero yo os animo a que le d\u00e9is una oportunidad. No es hasta el final cuando toda la historia en su conjunto cobra sentido, m\u00e1s a\u00fan una vez superado el DLC gratuito [u]Prologue[/u].\n\nSPOILERS DEL FINAL A CONTINUACI\u00d3N.\n[spoiler]A medida que avanzamos en la aventura descubrimos dos elementos que aumentan gradualmente su aparici\u00f3n: cajas de ropa y art\u00edculos varios, y botellas vac\u00edas. Hacia el final nos encontramos una fase que consiste enteramente en esquivar montones de cajas y de botellas, procurando no derribarlas para no hacer ruido y alertar a la malvada bruja sombr\u00eda que nos acecha. Es entonces cuando tenemos nuestro \u00faltimo encuentro con mam\u00e1... y a medida que intentamos avanzar hacia ella, se aleja m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s de nosotros, dejando paso a la perversa bruja.\n\nDespertamos en nuestra habitaci\u00f3n, donde podemos o\u00edr el llanto de nuestra madre. All\u00ed est\u00e1, sentada en el suelo de la cocina, con una botella en la mano. Si intentamos recuperar el peluche que ella nos arrebat\u00f3, nos responde con agresividad, y podemos entrever a la bruja. Nuestros pasos finales nos llevan hasta la puerta de la casa, donde el que intuimos que es nuestro padre nos recoge y nos consuela en un fondo blanco que resulta demasiado neutro para ser un final feliz.\n\nNo es hasta que jugamos y superamos el DLC cuando descubrimos la verdad sobre un matrimonio roto, erosionado por el maltrato y por causas que nuestra mente pueril no alcanza a comprender, que poco a poco altera el espacio en el que vivimos hasta hacerlo sofocante e insoportable. Nuestro \u00faltimo reducto de esperanza son nuestros mu\u00f1ecos, que por alguna raz\u00f3n est\u00e1n dispersos por la casa, y que s\u00f3lo cobran vida cuando manipulamos ciertos objetos que representan aquello que arranca una sonrisa en nuestro ni\u00f1o. El \u00faltimo de ellos cae fuera, al jard\u00edn, y nos vemos obligados a seguirlo, en medio de una funesta tormenta de nieve. No podemos evitar sufrir por nuestro pobre protagonista mientras andamos torpemente hacia nuestro fetiche de felicidad... pero antes de poder cogerlo, nuestra madre nos agarra y nos sostiene en brazos, llorando desconsoladamente. \"It's too much\", son sus \u00faltimas palabras.\n\nEl juego se convierte entonces en algo m\u00e1s que un simple survival horror on\u00edrico. Es una representaci\u00f3n de la realidad a trav\u00e9s de los ojos de un ni\u00f1o, en este caso de una realidad demasiado terrible y demoledora para lo que una mente tan inocente es capaz de asimilar. En un mundo visto sin la lente de la l\u00f3gica, son las emociones las que lo rigen, y \u00e9stas se retroalimentan de lo que tienen a su alrededor. El ni\u00f1o depende fuertemente de sus padres en sus primeros a\u00f1os de vida, y las emociones que \u00e9stos destilen en la casa ser\u00e1n los que el peque\u00f1o asimile. \u00bfEs acaso inesperado que, en un entorno tan duro y azotado por la tragedia como en el que este ni\u00f1o se est\u00e1 criando, el hogar se convierta en un lugar inh\u00f3spito y aterrador?[/spoiler]\n\nAmong the Sleep es una experiencia breve, pero muy contundente. La sensaci\u00f3n de vulnerabilidad es constante, y el final no te deja indiferente.

Concept of being a toddler was new and interesting. The rest was mostly old news. The scare factor comes mostly from 2 things for most of the game: loud random bg noise, giving the impression you are not alone; and scripted jumpscares. While I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st factor, the 2nd one became boring really fast, to the point where I wouldn\u2019t feel threatened at all. The addition of enemies (which felt mostly scripted too) solved that issue in a way, at least for me.\n\nFirst off: SAVING MECHANICS LIE TO YOU. You see all those dandy \u201csaving\u201d notifications in the bottom right corner? Yes, they are saving checkpoints. For when you *die*. If you close the game mid chapter and reload, you\u2019re forced to repeat the whole chapter. It isn\u2019t fun, especially on longer chapters where you might want to take a break, and where the checkpoint system makes it look like you\u2019ll be dropped where you left off.\n\nGraphics were ok. Some strange clipping if you actually pay attention but nothing too major. You can use the demo to check them for yourself, I barely noticed a difference.\n\nNPCs push you out of the way (which is awkward when the main NPC is so small). Detection for the \u201cclimb up\u201d command is really awkward in the last chapter where you have to walk into slightly higher places, not tall enough to be climbable, but I was unable to simply walk towards the 5cm higher place and get on it. That whole chapter had weird collision to think of it. I couldn\u2019t get under furniture that I could get under in previous chapters.\n\nSound was nice and scary. A bit overdone, sometimes?\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to the story but then again you\u2019re a toddler, your life isn\u2019t expected to be super complicated anyway. It made sense in the end, wasn\u2019t terrible or anything, but also isn\u2019t going to stick with me.\n\nOverall it was interesting.

I can hardly think of a more vulnerable protagonist than a two-year old child, which makes this aspect incredibly strong here. If you have trouble even walking, trying to hide and run from a threat becomes almost unbearable.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, there are quite a few very scary moments, and I loved the minimalist story telling that says so much by telling so little.\n\nOn the negative side the game is sometimes very dark, so much so that some places are just pitch black and it's easy to get disoriented/stuck. Also the main threat loses some of its potency once you've seen it a few times and have figured out how to avoid/get away from it. But at that point the story has revealed itself enough to take over as the driving force to find out where things are going.\n\n If you have a basic grasp on FPS controls/movement the game takes about 2.5 - 3 hours to finish.\n\nAll in all I warmly recommend this game, not only to seasoned horror fans, but to anyone looking for an outside-the-box experience from a new perspective.", "timestamp_created": 1491304359, "timestamp_updated": 1491304485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785579323768615723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30908416": {"recommendationid": "30908416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965493252", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1491159762}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an interesting idea to play as a small child, unable to do most things, with a fantastical view of common events.

Este juego llam\u00f3 mi atenci\u00f3n hace tiempo y solo puedo deciros que no pasa desapercibido.\n\nPrincipalmente porque interpretas a un beb\u00e9 justo en el d\u00eda que cumple 2 a\u00f1itos, tu madre te est\u00e1 haciendo pasar un d\u00eda genial mostrando mucho amor y afecto. De repente alguien llama a la puerta, no puedes entender bien lo que ocurre a continuaci\u00f3n porque eres un beb\u00e9, pero tras algo parecido a una discusi\u00f3n, tu madre aparece con un osito de peluche que se convertir\u00e1 en tu compa\u00f1ero durante toda la aventura. Mam\u00e1 te deja en tu habitaci\u00f3n y sale a atender el tel\u00e9fono, en ese momento y tras unos minutos de un breve tutorial, el osito se te presenta como Teddy y te dice que hay que buscar un lugar oscuro y decid\u00eds meteros en el armario.\n\nTeddy es tu amigo y estar\u00e1 siempre contigo.\n\nEsta historia tiene mucho mas fondo del que puede parecer en un principio\u2026\n\nCuando abrazas a Teddy, se ilumina.\n\nNadie pod\u00eda imaginar que despu\u00e9s de un d\u00eda que estaba marchando tan bien todo fuera a ir tan tenebrosamente mal. Al entrar en  el armario Teddy te dice a modo de tutorial que si tienes miedo puedes abrazarle ya que la oscuridad se ha hecho con el ambiente y todo empieza a ser retorcido y con formas abstractas.\n\nMam\u00e1 te saca del armario con una frase muy particular \u201cdeja de esconderte de mam\u00e1\u201d cosa que junto con lo que vi al principio, me dej\u00f3 un poco extra\u00f1ado. Tras este peque\u00f1o episodio, mam\u00e1 te manda a dormir y en este punto es donde realmente empieza tu aventura.\n\nMe gustar\u00eda deciros que me vi atra\u00eddo por el juego porque no hab\u00eda visto nunca nada parecido antes \u00a1un juego donde interpretas a un beb\u00e9! los detalles y la ambientaci\u00f3n est\u00e1n muy cuidados, incluso el juego te recomienda ir gateando a todas partes ya que, como todos sabemos, los beb\u00e9s son mas r\u00e1pidos gateando que andando adem\u00e1s de mas estables claro est\u00e1. Destaco como detalle que cuando pulsas Esc para ir al men\u00fa de pausa el beb\u00e9 se tapa los ojos para no mirar.\n\nLos chicos de Krillbite Studios lanzaron este proyecto gracias a la financi\u00f3n de varias empresas y a Kickstarter, donde tuvo buena aceptaci\u00f3n por parte del p\u00fablico y tuvieron muchos Backers que colaboraron para que esta joya viera la luz finalmente en su versi\u00f3n completa y final en Mayo de 2014\n\n\nEstos son los controles que necesitaremos durante el juego, un ejemplo de que una buena historia no necesita tener complejos movimientos.\n\nLlegados a este punto tengo que avisaros, si no hab\u00e9is jugado el juego y quer\u00e9is sorprenderos por vosotros mismos, no sig\u00e1is leyendo, ya que abordar\u00e9 temas que pueden ser considerado Spoilers y no quiero reventar a nadie esta experiencia.\n\nComo os comentaba, despu\u00e9s de que esa noche Mam\u00e1 te dejase en la cuna, escapar\u00e1s de ella y despu\u00e9s de salvar a Teddy de ahogarse en la lavadora, la buscar\u00e9is juntos por todas partes. Tanto es as\u00ed que llegar\u00e9is a una especie de mundo paralelo terror\u00edfico donde hay una habitaci\u00f3n con unos objetos que os dejar\u00e1n continuar en la b\u00fasqueda de nuestra mami.\n\nRecuerdos felices es lo que abrir\u00e1 esta puerta que nos impide ver a nuestra madre.\n\nA lo largo del juego iremos pasando por diferentes zonas perfectamente reconocibles, pero todas ellas con un aspecto bastante t\u00e9trico, donde tendremos que resolver unos puzzles bastante f\u00e1ciles.\n\nTirarnos por un tobog\u00e1n ser\u00e1 la manera de pasar a otra zona.\n\nNo obstante la cr\u00edtica del juego ha sido bastante buena, los usuarios han sabido valorar el encanto que tiene el juego pese a su facilidad y a lo corto que es, ya que no dura mas de 3 horas, eso si, es un proyecto mas que interesante con una historia oculta dentro de la propia historia del juego que iremos descubriendo nosotros y no el beb\u00e9 a medida que avanzamos el juego.\n\nEn este parque no querr\u00edas que se hiciera de noche.\nHan colocado una serie de dibujos hecho por el ni\u00f1o que funcionan a modo de coleccionable para los logros y que junto a la frase que no me son\u00f3 muy bien de la madre que os coment\u00e9 antes, me fu\u00ed dando cuenta de que en esta familia hay problemas, el hecho que finalmente hizo que me diera cuenta fue la aparici\u00f3n de muchas botellas de alcohol a lo largo del juego.\n\nY es que ese parecer ser el fondo del juego, los enemigos que nos encontramos no son m\u00e1s que la madre de nuestro protagonista tratando de encontrarle para hacerle da\u00f1o de una manera u otra y que el ve a trav\u00e9s de figuras distorsionadas en lugares terror\u00edficos haci\u00e9ndote escapar de ellos una y otra vez.\n\nEste monstruo en camis\u00f3n intenta darte caza en varias ocasiones.\nLos recuerdos felices que hay que encontrar el juego para poder continuar siempre est\u00e1n en sitios con ambientes c\u00e1lidos y acogedores, el sitio donde un cr\u00edo puede pasar un buen rato en compa\u00f1\u00eda de alg\u00fan ser querido.\n\nFijaos en el detalle de la sabana cubriendo el castillo de madera.\nY es que los creadores del juego han cuidado cada detalle de manera minuciosa para nuestro deleite y consiguen que la inmersi\u00f3n en el juego sea muy buena, tanto es as\u00ed que cuando descubres lo que est\u00e1 ocurriendo en realidad, un sentimiento extra\u00f1o te recorre el cuerpo, y ese hecho es el que me ha llevado a plasmarlo en el blog, porque considero que va mas all\u00e1 de lo que un juego normalmente te hace sentir.\n\nMam\u00e1 no quiere que la molestemos ahora.\n\nTanto es as\u00ed que muchas escenas me dieron mucha tristeza, como cuando te est\u00e1s acercando a tu madre pero ella no tiene tiempo para ti, prefiere dedicarlo a otra cosa y una y otra vez te esquiva y se pierde en la oscuridad.\n\nCuando por fin encuentras a Mam\u00e1 vemos una escena muy dura, est\u00e1 en el suelo de la cocina, bebida, probablemente sinti\u00e9ndose culpable porque en un forcejeo ha roto a nuestro amigo Teddy y lo tiene en una mano, suena la puerta y es tu padre, que se interesa por el osito y te dice que puede arreglarlo.\n\nLlorando y sentada en el suelo de la cocina encuentras a Mam\u00e1.\n\nSi os gustan los juegos diferentes os recomiendo Among the sleep encarecidamente, est\u00e1 disponible para Steam (Windows e IOs), PS4 y Xbox One, yo lo jugu\u00e9 en la versi\u00f3n Steam.\n\n\u00bfY t\u00fa? \u00bfTe abrazaste a un osito de peluche cuando ten\u00edas miedo por las noches?\n\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1Nos vemos pronto!!!", "timestamp_created": 1486409489, "timestamp_updated": 1486409489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29746993": {"recommendationid": "29746993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074058002", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1524759763}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but wonderfully creative game that sets you in the eyes of a two year old child, and as a young kid things may not look as they seem in this in home adventure on the search for mommy.

Among The Sleep is a refreshing change to the usual games we all have. Not only does this one throw you into the world of a 2 year old, it shows you just how a child may view the world and the life around him in a very unique way. \n\nThis game plays it's horror cards perfectly as it slowly reveals the child's life in a very dark and disturbing way. You start off in a world full of colour and brightness - how a child's view should be - but this quickly changes to the darkness that a child should never have to experience. \n\nThere are simple challenges that compliment how a child may solve it and this in no way makes the game silly or frustrating. Everything works in perfect unison. Even the environment itself as you navigate really makes you feel so small in the big wide world you woddle around in. Speaking of woddling, the developers really captured the movements/sounds/actions of a 2 year old child. \n\nUnfortunately there are some issues in this game. You may find a few bugs and glitches as you progress, even to the point where you get stuck and cannot move. I was able to wiggle myself out of any areas I got glitched/stuck into. Be aware the saving function in the game does NOT save your location, only what you've collected and the chapter you're up to. If you exit out of the game you will start back at the beginning of the chapter. \n\nNearing the end of this game I really craved familiarity and pretty colours and brightness. Having delved into this poor child's dark life for so long I couldn't wait to get out of it and see what I saw at the beginning. Overall a brilliant game in its portrayal, message, story and feeling.

Yes, there are a couple of jump-scares down the road, but that's it. It doesn't play with your anxierty like Outlast: Whistleblower does. \n\nWhen I first started Among the Sleep, I didn't like it that much, but I continued playing it anyway. It wasn't until the middle of the game (the forest part) that I started getting into it. \n\nWhat's brilliant about this game is that you don't know if the toddler is just having a nightmare or he's actually living it! You suddenly find yourself in a twisted reality while you're looking for your mom, who is nowhere to be seen. You don't know if something took her or fs she's still alive. Also, you have a creepy talking bear guiding you to your death. I actually didn't expect that ending, it's an interesting mature twist I didn't see coming.  It gives it a whole different meaning to the game, and makes you want to play it all over again to get all the references/hints you didn't at first (but that's just me, you might not want to play this game twice). I wanted more to the story, a more conclusive ending, but it was okay I guess. \n\nThat's why I recommend this game. I love misleading storylines. It's a very short game, but it's worth it if you don't mind solving puzzles and avoiding shadowy figures.

If you buy this game, look for my name in the credits!\n\nIf you like horror games, this certainly isn't the scariest game I've played. What I like about this game, that most other horror games do wrong, is that there is mostly atmospheric horror on display. This isn't Outlast, where you need to run, hide, fail, and do it again. There aren't any jump scares (well, there's one, but even great horror films succumb to this trope). Most horror games have a lame gameplay loop that often feels like you're simply waiting for the scary bits to come to light. It's impossible to enjoy a horror game if the fear raised is higher than the players will to continue/enjoyment of the story. Among the Sleep is more like your classic Haunted Mansion ride at a carnival; thrilling but not spooky.\n\nThe main draw to this game (at least on the surface) is that you play as a toddler.

Hardly any game mechanics to speak of, it's just one of those games you can play in around two hours, but if you could actually walk without falling down all the time and move a bit smoother, it would take around 30minutes to run through this game(yeah, I know it's meant to be like this, you're a baby after all, just putting it out there that it's short with almost no content). I like to look around and find items or funny things, but there is hardly anything of that either, just a few childrens paintings to pick up. Extremely easy, not even once did I have to stop and think \"what should I do to proceed?\", everything was obvious and you just picked up everything you needed on the way forward. The only good thing is that I didn't notice any real bugs, it flows on fairly well. But no real story to speak of whatsoever.\n\nIf you're really, really, really, REALLY bored and can get this on a sale and you have nothing else to do whatsoever, give this a try and it might help you burn 2-3 hours. I guess it gives what it says it does, you're a baby with super problem solving powers(for a toddler) crawling through a house while seeing illusions created by an infants mind, and I guess it could be considered somewhat creepy, but it's not scary in any way, every time a monster showed up I just ignored it and went on my merry way, when the monsters finally started chasing after you, everything you had to do was hide under a table or something, and usually you didn't even have to care even then as you could just crawl to your goal without minding the \"monster\", as it hardly aimed at you anyway, while disappearing in just a few seconds. \n\nI respect the idea of this game, but I just found it really boring in the end, there is absolutely nothing to keep you hooked and care what happens, as there is really nothing much that happens anyway, way too linear, you just walk through everything and solve a few ridiculously simple puzzles that are so obvious that a toddler could realize what to do instantly. Do yourself a favour and find something else to play, please, anything is better than this, read a book, watch a movie, play another game, this is absolutely not worth your money nor your time, unless you're into linear games with a screwed up atmosphere and no story where you just mindlessly charge through. Even if you get it for free, just play something else and let this game rot in your library, it's way slower than it should have been with the content given, just a waste of time. I have a feeling that most of the people that upvoted this is either one of those people that are \"neutral\" and thinks it's neither good nor extremely bad and therefore went for thumbs up, or the guys that are total pansies and get scared when they hear cracking in their house, or the people that upvoted it for being \"acceptable for the price\" or maybe those that didn't like it but thought that it was better than some other games. If this was a free game, I might upvote it due to similar reasons, but even 1 dollar/euro is too much for this.", "timestamp_created": 1482978296, "timestamp_updated": 1482978589, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434565454721450806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28772346": {"recommendationid": "28772346", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977624764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482971888}, "language": "english", "review": "starts out interesting enough and the baby aspect is new, but in the end it was just a hide-and-cover exploration game where the srhieking noise eventually annoys you", "timestamp_created": 1482971959, "timestamp_updated": 1482971959, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495049923658370972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28766031": {"recommendationid": "28766031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164663168", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1584282173}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game.

It only took a couple of hours. I mean, the length was good with the storyline, but I just wanted more! I'd be interested to see if they make more games like this from a child's perspective.\n\nOVERALL:\n9/10 (minus one point because of the game length)\n\nThis is a good starter game if you are new to the genre of horror and aren't sure if you will enjoy it.

None of the puzzles are hugely challenging but thats okay as really its the atmosphere and the progression through the creepy environment which is really the point of the game.  \n\nAlthough the game is short it is tight gameplay and I would much prefer a game which is a few hours long but is consistently entertaining for those few hours than have a game which puts in a load of grind just to build up time.  The story is fairly predicatable especially around half way through the game but again, as the story progresses at a nice pace and the game is fairly short this isnt really a problem.  In any case the lead up to that conclusion and the final scene are very well done and while you will have been largely expecting it, its a perfectly timed and very imaginative way of bringing it about.\n\nI would say make sure you explore the nooks and crannys as you go as there are pictures on the walls which help to give the story more context as well.  \n\nFinally for the Linux users I can confirm that this game ran superbly well on my machine.

The child's perspective makes even common objects like swings or coats huge and menacing. This is a visual experience that will not soon be forgotten.\n* The atmosphere is enhanced by the soundscape. There are bumps in the night, rumbling drones, and a haunting melody being hummed far off.\n* Without spoiling anything, the subject matter is interesting and well paced.\n* The voice acting of the teddy bear is another high point, being playful and surreal without becoming corny.\n* This is a very imaginative experience. It felt like reading a storybook, in a similar vein as the movie The Babadook.\n\nCONS\n* The game is extremely linear. It almost felt like a straight line going through each area.\n* When the monsters are introduced, it detracts greatly from the experience for me. The nightmarish environment lets your imagination run wild, so when the game becomes a hide-and-seek horror trope, the experience suffers.\n* The monsters become constant by the end. Less really would have been more, both for scares and for letting the environment keep the spotlight.\n* There's no story. There is a *situation* which you come to understand throughout the game.
