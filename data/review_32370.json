The story seems straightforward but has a few plot twists you may or may not see coming depending on how much attention you pay to what is going on.\n\nI liked that your attitude does not only influence the story, but also your character : there are different powers for Light- and Dark-aligned characters. (I'd say Light has more utility and Dark more DPS, but let's not forget the ultimate Light power : droid destruction. Absolute game changer.)\n\nAnd well, at the time there weren't that many Star Wars games, especially if like me you're only interested in Jedi and lightsabers XD So being able to play a Force-sensitive lightsaber wielder was a great experience at the time.\n\nThe one criticism I have is that Jedi powers and lightsabers are so powerful that it's hard to justify taking any non-Jedi companion over Jedi ones, limiting your options. But the game is not too difficult so you can probably succeed with any party composition.\n\nI fear the game has aged a lot (as I haven't touched it in the last 10 years), and it's not as deep as more recent RPG, but I think it's worth a try if you like the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1699216352, "timestamp_updated": 1699216352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149612022": {"recommendationid": "149612022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055621359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 4818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4818, "last_played": 1656880200}, "language": "english", "review": "An all time classic and one of my favorite games of all time.

I'm not joking when I say it's iconic. The few downsides to this game are just from the fact of how old it is (2003 aka 20 years old).

Despite a few hiccups, this game stands as a testament to the magic of a galaxy far, far away.\n\nOne of the game's undeniable strengths lies in its ability to recreate the immersive Star Wars atmosphere. From the moment you step into the vast, intricately designed worlds, you are transported into a universe filled with the iconic sounds of blaster fire, the hum of lightsabers, and the epic musical score that has become synonymous with Star Wars. KOTOR brilliantly captures the essence of the franchise, making every moment a nostalgic delight for fans.\n\nThe characters and side missions in KOTOR are nothing short of exceptional. Each character is beautifully crafted with depth and personality, making them more than just mere companions. The side missions, too, are a highlight, offering players a chance to delve into the diverse stories and histories of the galaxy. These elements contribute to a gaming experience that goes beyond the main storyline, enriching the overall narrative.\n\nThe combat system in KOTOR is both fun and engaging. The strategic elements of turn-based combat, combined with the thrill of wielding a lightsaber or firing a blaster, create an experience that remains true to the spirit of Star Wars. The variety of Force powers and skills add layers of complexity, ensuring that combat never becomes monotonous.\n\nAt its core, KOTOR is undeniably a true Star Wars game. The narrative weaves a tale of epic proportions, filled with twists, turns, and moral ambiguity. The choices you make as a player shape the destiny of the galaxy, mirroring the impactful decision-making seen in the Star Wars movies. The main story is a captivating journey that fans and newcomers alike will appreciate.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge the game's shortcomings. KOTOR does suffer from a few bugs that can occasionally disrupt the flow of gameplay. The user interface, while functional, could benefit from improvements to enhance the overall gaming experience. Additionally, the game's pace can be a bit slow, especially with a fair amount of back-and-forth walking, which might test the patience of some players.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, KOTOR remains a highly entertaining experience. With its captivating Star Wars ambiance, well-developed characters, engaging combat, and an epic main story, it earns a solid 8 out of 10. The imperfections do little to diminish the overall enjoyment of a game that successfully captures the magic of Star Wars in a galaxy of its own.", "timestamp_created": 1696274866, "timestamp_updated": 1696274866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147521221": {"recommendationid": "147521221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047384777", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 978, "last_played": 1696299224}, "language": "english", "review": "it runs like hot cock.", "timestamp_created": 1696273293, "timestamp_updated": 1696273293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147518622": {"recommendationid": "147518622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073039425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3855, "last_played": 1695925481}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved it.

It took me a long time to get around to this game but I'm glad I finally did. My only major complaint is one that is shared amongst most fans and critics of the game: the combat. Even for early-2000's standards, the combat is pretty wonky, but it is something you can look past in the grand scheme of things. Otherwise, the game is perfect and still feels engaging this many years later. Every single character is written so well and they all have such unique and interesting stories, making the long stretches of dialogue feel worthwhile and important, with every conversation carrying choices with outcomes that can impact the story in several ways. The environments you can explore are diverse across the several planets and ships you'll have access to, and you even have the freedom to choose the order in which you complete them, making each playthrough that much more unique. With these characters and worlds, the game presents its best and most celebrated aspect: the story. KOTOR's campaign can be experienced in a multitude of different ways and lengths, with areas being filled with side quests you can do to enrich the story and learn more about your companions, and different engagements whether you are taking the light or dark side path.\n\n(SPOILER ALERT)\n\nPart of this story includes not only the best part of the game, but one of the most iconic moments in video game, or even storytelling history. This moment I'm referring to is the climactic plot twist. Throughout the whole game, your character suffers from amnesia and cannot remember who they are. In the background, 2 fallen Jedi (Revan and Malak), wage war on the Republic. In the climax of the story, the player is revealed to have been Revan the entire time.

Many consider it to be the greatest Star Wars game that currently exists, and I am inclined to agree. While not perfect, Revan's original adventure across the galaxy far away told an even longer time ago stands the test of time, and remains a must play for any Star Wars enthusiast.\n\nThe story told in KotOR is a captivating one.  It's a simple tale; an amnesiac awakening into circumstances far beyond their understanding eventually learning their role in the greater story and taking their destiny into their own hands. The actual contents of the story aren't necessarily original in concept, but the game's execution of this plot is what makes it so powerful. KotOR exceeds in building an enticing mystery around Revan's identity and history that you get to see unfurl alongside your character in play. Furthermore, the game offers an interesting and often fun supporting cast to experience the adventure alongside you. This, alongside Revan's history with the main antagonist, helps the story gain a sense of personality and personal stakes that elevate the whole experience. It's no wonder that the story, alongside the major additions to Star Wars history this game developed with the Infinite Empire, pioneered an entire era of lore for the series expanded upon by various later media. So iconic is KotOR's story that the Old Republic is an easy third to the Imperial and Clone Wars eras in terms of media focus, and for good reason.\n\nThe roleplaying mechanics of KotOR were also ahead of their time, with letting players sway their moral alignment outcomes of conversations with what they say and do. Although fairly primitive compared to later games in this field, KotOR set the major groundwork for such choose-your-own-adventure style gameplay that Bioware themselves would continue in later Old Republic games and their iconic Mass Effect series. Given Revan's history as both Jedi and Sith, allowing the player a chance at either redemption or descent plays a huge role in the power of this game's experience. This is especially powerful since your moral choices directly impact the effectiveness of abilities available to Revan as you grow. Though, as a Dark Side enthusiast myself, I wish some of this game's evil options felt less comical. Some options within dialogue and quests can get pretty goofy with how openly ruthless you're allowed to become, and generally the Dark Side experience can feel lackluster compared to the more canonical Light Side one, which likely received significantly more focus. This can be a bit dissuading from the feeling of choice the morality system is intended to provide, but that doesn't diminish what replayability and variety it gives each playthrough.\n\nKotOR's combat and leveling should feel quite familar to tabletop fans. Heavily relying on 3.5 D&D rules for stats and leveling, KotOR might be a bit intimidating to progress in for those less experienced in the style of play. Personally I feel this combat is the game's weakest aspect, as in most fights it becomes very easy to just let the combat automatically play out while you occasionally activate abilities at opportune moments and just pray they land. hitchance and round-based combat can work well, as shown by more concurrent smash hits like Baldur's Gate III, but I don't think KotOR managed to do this system much justice. Particularly on the Steam port I ran, I also had frequent issues with whichever character I was controlling just stopping mid-movement and refusing to progress until I swapped characters, occasionally even in combat. It's a workable system overall, but definitely lacking compared to other focuses of the game.\n\nRegardless of all that, however, there is a key factor that I think is why KotOR really stands as the best Star Wars game. By far, it succeeds the most at recapturing the feel of the Original Trilogy in a video game format. Through a combination of its fun writing, orchestral backing music, charming visuals, and more, KotOR feels like it truly belongs in Star Wars, in a way few other games in the series ever could. Words can't really do this point justice, so just experience the game yourself to really feel this point lmao.\n\nOverall, KotOR is a certified classic. It has a solid amount to offer to RPG fans, and much more for Star Wars fans. If you have any interest in this game whatsoever, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

All of the characters are interesting and what I like is that none of them were irrelevant or forgettable to me. I enjoyed about 80% of the game, then for the last 2 or 3 areas it feels like everything is rushed, watered down, and worse quality. I felt unsatisfied at the end of the game and was thinking \u201cthat\u2019s all?\u201d.  The combat is alright, it\u2019s nothing special and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that fun since it gets boring to just click spam the entire time and watch your characters miss every 2 seconds. This made the last dungeon miserable because it\u2019s literally full of endless enemy waves.\n\nHowever, I cannot in good conscience give this game more than a 5/10. I have only one word to describe my experience in this game. CRASHING. The game will crash at any time. Before or after scripted cutscenes, or for no reason at all. It wasn\u2019t that bad for most of the game, some crashes here and there but not much. But oh boy, toward the end it was crashing and bugs galore. Be prepared to save every 5 mins or less because you\u2019ll risk losing your progress and maybe even corrupting your save like what happened to me. My save got corrupted so I had to spend 20+ minutes killing the same enemy waves all over again. Also, sometimes you have to reload saves to redo some parts because the game won\u2019t progress like it\u2019s supposed to. The mouse is also bugged which makes interacting with the UI and things in the game really annoying. Sometimes you can\u2019t even move. \n\nIt felt like finishing the game would literally be impossible. Yes I know this is an old game, but come on. Toward the end it was barely playable and downright infuriating. So, beware if you want to play this game. I was hardly enjoying it by this point. This is an average RPG minus the technical issues, but it really gets set back by its performance issues which is sad because I really wanted to like this game.

I've played this game many times over the years, from my first time when I'd meet my friend at the bus stop and we'd talk excitedly about how far we had gotten, to now when I like to just boot it up, swing my lightsaber, mess with Carth, and listen to HK-47 call me a meatbag. \n\nAlso I HIGHLY recommend playing as a female. The banter and romance with Carth is just infinitely more entertaining than Bastilla.

I hope to convince you of it, though it still might be worth playing if it's on sale.\n\nLet's start with general overview. This is an RPG using DnD's dice throw systems, these happen automatically whenever player preforms an action behind the scenes with random number generators.\n\nI think I shall list the positives first as the list is quite short. Note that these are positives without reservations.\n1) game is inovative in the genere. Mainly due to the camera system.\n2) there seemed to be a generaly well meaning attempt to immerse player into star wars\nThat's it for the positives.\nNeutral things\n1) soundtrack is quite good (for the most part) however not very cohesive and can sometimes feel all over the place\n2) visuals while not excelent (and certainly not using the engine to the fullest potencial as attested by the sequel) are still pretty good for 2003 game\n3) combat system is serviceable (with addendums in negative section)\n4) not terribly difficulit but not completely mindless either\nNow onto the negative list and oh boy there's lot\n1) B U G S all over the fucking game. On my disc I managed to permanently glitch the big shark to the other side of the bridge. On steam the game started to crash around star forge and several times I just got stuck on geometry and had to reset.\n2) story is garbage. 1 counted them, 1 good character (Jolee my man). Rest of them are confusing mess, unfurfuilled potential or unintentionally self inserts of anyone with even a sliver of critical thinking (looking at ya Carth). The worldbuilding is as broken as they come with groundbreaking technologies that fuck up the continuity of the universe and plot that relies on galaxy being in fucking stasis to make any goddamn sense.\n3) morality system is garbage. It's be such an angel you are compromising everything for no reason, or be the dastardly saturday morning cartoon villain. What a joke.\n4) HIDEN FUCKING STATS. Oh you were building your character expecting lever 35+ because we gave you almost no indication where the lever cealing is? Well fuck you now you're at the endgame with level 20 and no usefull combat stats for the final fight. Fuck you. Oh you were building blaster character, well have you considered that wrong you are jedi and get less point for your traits. Better luck next time bucko. This is omnipresent and annoying as shit. In turned based RPG I need to know what my stats are BIOWARE!!!\n5) Inventory is hard to navigate lunacy made by someone who really likes inventory management simulators.\n6) most builds barely viable\n\nI could ramble on but in general.

The story of KOTOR takes place 4000 years before the movies, following a young republic trooper who learns they are capable of using the force, learning to become a Jedi and facing a galaxy wide threat. This premise is perfect, and really makes you feel like you are a part of the universe. When you first crash on Taris you are a nobody, you share a small hideout with a surviving officer, and stepping out onto that first planet is truly jaw dropping. Everything in this game makes you feel truly immersed, the music, the world building, the minor npcs that you interact with on each planet, its all just perfect. Speaking of planets, the game strikes the perfect balance between old and new, letting you explore beloved planets from past movies while also introducing you to brand new ones. The plot is also spot on, showing your characters journey from a simple soldier to a hero of the Jedi order- or its doom. KOTOR lets YOU decide whether you want to be a hero or a villain, letting your custom character make various light and dark side decisions that will effect those around you, forcing you to make a major decision towards the end of the game. All I can say is avoid spoilers at ALL COSTS, because you will not want to have your experience of the amazing storyline ruined by spoilers. The only thing I could critique would be the combat system, it can feel pretty dated at times and you shouldn't go into KOTOR expecting combat like The Force Unleashed or Fallen Order, but once you get used to it (if you even had a problem with it in the first place) then you should be fine. And at the end of the day, the story, world building and pure immersion make up for any tiny flaw that you may encounter while playing.", "timestamp_created": 1691418489, "timestamp_updated": 1691418489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580419540405273438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143549625": {"recommendationid": "143549625", "author": {"steamid": "76561199501681104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1691712511}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite game of all time and I am still playing it in 2023", "timestamp_created": 1691356732, "timestamp_updated": 1691356732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143546450": {"recommendationid": "143546450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395929940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2579, "last_played": 1691352893}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent storytelling and characters.

It's got issues here and there, but all classics do. Taris might drag a bit, but once you're up and out of there, it's so worth it. The worlds are excellent, the characters are great (especially HK-47, my favorite droid), their storylines are so fun (and as a side note, I'm so glad that there is canon queer representation in the form of Juhani and FemC, especially in a Star Wars game this old) I enjoy the combat system more than I remember, and it is absolutely gorgeous despite the outdated graphics. Additionally, I love the soundtrack. I always love hearing the character creation/main theme and it's different forms, the intense opening music onboard the Endar Spire, the unique themes for different planets, especially that absolutely gorgeous track for the planet Manaan/Ahto City, and when everything is tied up and you face Darth Malak, I'd go nearly as far as to say it's as good as Duel of the Fates.\n\nThe lore is absolutely amazing and I've always loved the Old Republic era. From Force Bonds to the Mandalorian wars to the Rakatan Infinite Empire and the Star Forge. (And I will always appreciate how much SWTOR builds on the lore of KOTOR, but that's a story for another review that's way too long.)\n\nKOTOR may look and in some areas feel outdated, but comparing the negatives to the positives is like comparing a piece of coal to a diamond.

The well-written dialogue and exceptional voice acting bring these characters to life, making every interaction a memorable and engaging experience.\n\nThe game's choice system is a groundbreaking feature that sets KOTOR apart. Players' decisions throughout the game have significant consequences, shaping the story, alliances, and ultimately determining the path of the main character. This level of player agency adds depth and replayability, encouraging multiple playthroughs to explore the various outcomes and experience the game from different perspectives.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics in KOTOR strike a perfect balance between strategy and action. The turn-based combat system, complemented by a robust character customization and skill progression system, offers depth and tactical decision-making. Players can choose from a variety of combat styles and abilities, allowing for personalization and adaptation to different playstyles. The gameplay flows seamlessly with the narrative, creating a cohesive experience that never feels disjointed.\n\nVisually, KOTOR showcases its age, but its art direction and iconic Star Wars design endure.

However, first let me gush. This game is an excellent romp in the Star Wars universe giving a real sense of agency as you navigate dialogue and quests in what may be one of the best executed video game stories ever to be created. I would suggest that playing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic feels a bit like playing a Star Wars tabletop RPG with a really great DM. Battle is adequate and, though I'm not a fan of turn-based combat, the queuing system in this game is a big improvement over games that stop all the action while you navigate menus. It was a nice touch to allow a player to pause the game if they need more time to strategize. Leveling and loot are handled well, though I found myself having a hard time finding what item I just picked up in my inventory as it got more and more full throughout the adventure. Music and environments are more than adequate and thrilling at times but the characters are the real stars. With few exceptions, I found the supporting cast to be a joy to interact with. Now, let's be honest, this game is getting long in the tooth and the graphics don't always hold up that well. Animations are pretty clunky and reused models for NPCs can cause some confusion as you begin to question how many identical twins there are in the galaxy. Overall, I do not hold this against the game as it is a product of its time, but new players should be prepared. I opted to play the game with no mods, in a lower resolution and in 4:3 as that felt more authentic to me and the UI scaled better to the game. Even still, with a more than capable PC, I had frequent issues when cutscenes would play. Strange stuttering, long loading, resolution cycling and even crashing occurred. Thankfully, this wasn't something that happened every time and usually only at the outset of major new sections of the game. Probably the most annoying thing I found was that the game's music would cut out while the loading screen to a sub-area was up and it always felt jarring. A nice crossfade of the music would have been so much better. I liked being able to play with the mouse in this game but, for new players, I would probably direct them to something like the Switch's port of this game if possible. Knights of the Old Republic is a fantastic game that deserves to be on a list of must-play video games for every gamer.

Though I was daunted by the many RPG elements (character creation is one of my weakness when starting a game), I did want to push through the game. I dropped the game eventually because it felt a bit grindy and I wasn't used to the slow pace the game had compared to the more modern action games I've been playing like Hollow Knight or Borderlands 2.\n\nNow with a spark of Star Wars fever, I decided to give it a try. Admittedly, I really just wanted to play Jedi: Fallen Order but KOTOR was all I had for the moment. Getting through the tutorial, I found the combat more and more enduring. I realized that the story had more depth to it once I got used to the old interface and having to playing the game windowed.\n\nAfter finishing the game two times, both with the light and dark side playthroughs, I can confidently say that KOTOR is one of the finer RPGs in the video game industry. I'd say though that it does not excel in its flexibility in its roleplay. One of which is my standards for quality RPGs but I will say that it makes up for its story pacing and rich lore in the world.\n\nKOTOR's strengths honestly its bite-sized everything. Every encounter for me was exhilarating no matter how small or easy it was. Most encounters last a minute or two while boss battles never go past five (unless you are under-leveled or have a bad build) and I think that's what I find endearing about KOTOR. Compared to other RPGs, KOTOR makes the most out of every battle and makes it short but exciting. You have full control of your character's move set bounded by the turn-based combat of course but you do not have to wait long for their actions as it executes in real time.\n\nThe way it presents its plot and its lore isn't them shoving it in your throat or at least that's what I felt like. For all I care, I can just skip dialogue and mow down characters and I would still have fun without the game telling me otherwise. Consequently, I can talk to all the characters and learn more about the world and find advantages from the information I'm getting.\n\nFor me, Bioware really made the right choice in choosing an unknown period of the Star Wars canon and making the most out of its worlds and characters. All the planets I've visited were full of life and they always felt like they were there unlike other RPGs. Another point for KOTOR is that I always felt like exploring their environments. And whenever I get bored, the planet usually wraps up everything before I get sick of the planet.\n\nOkay but the plot twist with Revan was so satisfying. I honestly did not see that coming. It didn't feeling forced and I was genuinely shocked and delighted to know that. Maybe it was because I was immersed by the world but props to the plot Bioware made.\n\nIts obvious flaws is the outdated interface and bugs. I think that's just standard for old games but I would really want to see how the remake fares. Though I don't really see why I should revisit the game a third time besides the lightsaber combat (hehe), I think remaking the game would actually make the game perfect and solidify itself as the best RPG I believe.\n\nAnother flaw of the game is in its roleplaying. Of course the game has small choices you can make that you can use to roleplay but often, the choices are light side favored. Plot-wise, it heavily implies that you'll always pick the light side which is jarring and the plot feels dysfunctional when you play as a psychopathic dark side character. I would've hoped for a flexible approach in its roleplay as I think there is so much potential in making decisions as a Jedi or Sith.\n\nOverall, I just love Star Wars. Better yet, I love lightsabers and lightsaber battles. I would've wanted to play Fallen Order more but KOTOR has given me a world to get lost in, a riveting and exciting plotline, short but sweet combat, and a lot of bugs. I think KOTOR joins New Vegas as niche games I really like and obsess with once in a while. I would rate KOTOR a 8.5/10. If it had a more satisfying lightsaber combat and more flexibility in its roleplay, I can see it being a perfect 10. Maybe the remake (or remaster?) can fix these problems for me but for now it remains the cult classic everyone knows and loves (and occasionally hate).", "timestamp_created": 1688071011, "timestamp_updated": 1688071011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140918651": {"recommendationid": "140918651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308443271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2318, "last_played": 1683975685}, "language": "english", "review": "Statement: This is one of the best Star Wars games, Master.", "timestamp_created": 1688062138, "timestamp_updated": 1688062138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140903144": {"recommendationid": "140903144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048162500", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 7216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7216, "last_played": 1655016424}, "language": "english", "review": "in STAR WARS\u2122 Knight of the Old Republic\u2122 you play as a knight in the Knights of the Old Republic during a STAR WAR", "timestamp_created": 1688043598, "timestamp_updated": 1688043598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140899791": {"recommendationid": "140899791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056279528", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 3961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2695, "last_played": 1688321927}, "language": "english", "review": "I miss you Bioware", "timestamp_created": 1688038764, "timestamp_updated": 1688038764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140889685": {"recommendationid": "140889685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198441465847", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1639, "last_played": 1687771268}, "language": "english", "review": "It was pretty good overall, but nothing exceptional. Good enough to be worth a playthrough at the very least.\n\nKOTOR's biggest strength is definitely in its writing. It managed to present a much more interesting and nuanced view of what the Force is and the battle between the Jedi and Sith than any of the actual films ever managed and did so largely through an appropriate means. Each location in the game is exploring these large issues through a somewhat different lens and each has its place to understanding the bigger picture. While I still wouldn't go so far as to say the writing is great, its still much better than most of the other Star Wars related media I've seen.\n\nBut on other aspects, the game fares a lot more poorly. Combat is extremely simple and once you've gotten past the introductory area its pretty trivial to get through all of the game's challenges without really needing to think too hard. The way equipment is handled is pretty awful. You will almost never pick up gear that is superior to what you have already, meaning its only real value is to be sold in exchange for better stuff. But the inventory for equipping and selling stuff is atrocious with ever single item confined to a single column you have to scroll through that only shows a small handful of entries at a time. And you have to sell each item individually along with a confirmation prompt every time you sell something even slightly valuable. And even once that's done, whatever equipment you can buy is only marginally better than the gear you have already. Honestly, you just shouldn't engage with the gear system at all unless you're struggling to progress because its not worth the effort otherwise.\n\nAnd probably the most notable issue is technical performance. While its to be expected of such an old game, its definitely aged poorly in this regard. Lots of loading and stuttering, characters getting stuck in the level geometry, freezing/crashing, and other little bugs here and there are common throughout the experience. Even playing with a patch that's supposed to fix a lot of the issues the game still wasn't in great shape. While it was never bad enough to ruin the experience (Its no Cyberpunk 2077 or anything), it did mean my experience was constantly brought down by a plethora of little things that eroded away at my immersion.\n\nOverall, KOTOR is still a good game. It never reaches the kinds of peaks that elevates it to a masterpiece and its flaws are apparent enough that I couldn't warrant such a title even if it did have fantastic writing. But the things that it does well are still quite good and its flaws aren't terrible.

It has a high replay-ability, going light side one time, dark another is just the beginning.  Also whether playing for the first time or during a replay make sure you save often and with multiple slots, you never know when you will run into a bug or miss out on a quest. It\u2019s a good way to keep the game\u2019s age from crashing down upon you.\n\nThe community is still large which is a HUGE factor for playing older games. i.e. if you have problems there are still lots of people willing to chime in on how to fix it, etc. And there are a large amount of mods that greatly enhance gameplay, including restoring content that was cut from the game before release. It's glorious. I still highly recommend giving it a go, just be prepared to lose hours of your life to it. \n\nIf you\u2019re here\u2026 You\u2019ve taken your first step into a larger world. It\u2019s going to be worth it. May the force be with you\u2026 always. \n\n1000/10", "timestamp_created": 1687983590, "timestamp_updated": 1687983590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819766998291015625", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140857409": {"recommendationid": "140857409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213384092", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 12400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12400, "last_played": 1579665882}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the 2003 graphics this game still holds up surprisingly well!

The biggest issue when running on a Steam Deck is that skipping cutscenes tends to cause the game to black screen or get caught on an infinite loading screen. Another major issue is that the game requires a community made control scheme in order to be playable - it has no native controller support as it was released back in the early 2000's. That said, I was able to play through the entire game from start to finish with relative ease!\n\nThis is probably the best way to play KOTOR 1 in the modern era, at least on the PC Gaming front. You can play both KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2 on Steam Deck with very few modifications on the player's end, bar community control inputs. The games are also available on the Switch, where I imagine stability is a tad bit higher than on Steam Deck.\n\nTL;DR (if your attention span is that short): Game works great on Steam Deck, with some minor issues.

I went through the game in the original version, so I didn't make my life easier by installing mods ( even for resolution ).\n[h1]The Plot[/h1]\nAs this game is almost 20 years old, I will describe that I consider to be important. Starting off, the beginning of the game, and the starting location is a spaceship and a large Ekumenopolis (city-planet). But what I like most about this prologue is that we're not a powerful Jedi or Sith, we're just an ordinary person, so we only use grenades, blasters, and vibroswords. This is a nice change from other Star Wars games. The general idea of the game is that the Republic is at war with the Sith, led by the Dark Lord and a former war hero; Darth Malak, who had previously killed his master; Darth Revan. Or at least that's the Jedi's version of the story. It's an interesting concept because it's more of a civil war than a conflict between empires like in SWTOR, so we can meet old Republic soldiers in the ranks of the Sith. A big part of the game is discovering our potential in the Force, which gives us the opportunity to train on Dantooine to become a Jedi. Even though it's a short segment of the game, I thought it was important because the concept of playing a game where we learn in Jedi academy is very interesting, and personally, I would like to get a game like Hogwarts Legacy, only in the Star Wars universe, which would give us the opportunity to learn at the Jedi and Sith academies. I think such a game would be a great success, and a lot of fun. But getting back to the main thread, it's our job to find maps to the Sith main base, which will take us across the many movie planets and beyond, each with original stories to offer. Probably the most interesting planet is Korriban (the home planet of the Sith) because we have so much opportunities to study at the academy, and funnily enough, we learn so much more philosophy and interesting, ancient history than on Dantooine with the Jedi, and it's just amazing. However, we also have dark and light side mechanics here. Each of our decisions in the dialogues has different consequences, and the world around us will react to them (the corruption of the dark side can even be seen on our face). This has no great consequences, and the decision at the very end of the game, whether we side with the Sith or the Jedi, remains the same. To be honest, the fact that this game allows us to completely go to the dark side, become the Dark Lord of the Sith and murder Jedi makes it the best Star Wars game in terms of story. As for our companions, they're all great, and they add a lot of life to the world/main plot.\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nStarting from the beginning, i.e. from the character creator. We have some options here, but personally I think they are a bit few. When it comes to appearance, we choose a face from a few already available, and they are not the best, especially since our hero during fights and short comments (because we are mute in dialogues) sounds a bit too young for my taste, and speaking of skill points , powers and attributes, that's enough of them here, although it's a bit hard to experiment here due to the not very balanced system of gaining experience with the class skills already selected for us. We now move on to combat, and it's a very outdated system because it's a turn-based system where we choose a hero and companions and give them orders, then all we do is sit and watch until the fight is over. It also doesn't help that the animations are very meh. Blaster duels are as thrilling as mushroom picking, and vibrosword/lightsaber duels, although they have their own animations, are wooden, sometimes too slow, and the blades often don't even touch each other, so it looks more like a mime duel. Power skills aren't very flashy, but there are a lot of them, so there's some variety here. The maps we are moving through are varied because, as I said, we are moving on many planets here. However, these are quite large maps, divided by zone loading screens, and with the slow movement of the character, walking from one point to another is torture, especially since the game does not have such a thing as markers (only journal entries), so you have to figure everything out by yourself. But apart from that, the locations are really interesting, and the equipment we find in them is not very diverse, but there is enough of it to be satisfied. However, what bothers me in the game are the strange decisions made by the developers. To give examples: on Kashyyk in the Shadowlands there are monkeys that make noise (and they fucking don't stop), the most annoying sound in the history of games, on Tatooine we are molested by desert people who attack us every now and then, in space we move so slowly that in the meantime, I could go and make myself dinner, and in the final location, there are whole swarms of enemies literally thrown at us from the air, and it drags on terribly. It also doesn't help that our character loves to get stuck on every object. And one more thing, but this is a subjective opinion. I know there are a lot of races and languages in Star Wars, but the amount of \"languages\" that the characters speak is unpleasant, we often see dialogues and cutscenes where aliens growl at each other, groan, etc, and it's really hard to focus on the dialogue, especially that these languages are extremely painful to the ears, even more so when we hear the same thing for the hundredth time, and speaking of repetition, the disadvantage of this game is also the fact that the characters tend to repeat themselves, and explain unnecessary things.\n[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]\nLike I said, it's an old game. It works on very low resolutions, it broke my save game once, and to be honest, when it comes to graphics and effects, it's bad. For some reason, the game also has graphical bugs and I personally had to turn off the grass to fix it, not to mention that in some locations the game, despite its age, simply runs terribly on higher graphics settings. The music is not typical movie music, but it keeps a high level. The voice actors did a very good job, but I think in some scenes they didn't quite know what they were reading, so the intonation is a bit weird at times.\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nAn amazing game with the best storyline in the Star Wars universe. It's a classic, and despite the outdated gameplay and technical issues, it's a great product that gives the player a lot of amazing fun. I hope the Remake will keep the high standard (if it ever comes out).\nhttps://youtu.be/OagQ818xZXo", "timestamp_created": 1687458921, "timestamp_updated": 1687458921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663997173309326172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140511059": {"recommendationid": "140511059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800233416", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2452, "last_played": 1693769041}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game!", "timestamp_created": 1687458757, "timestamp_updated": 1687458757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140471888": {"recommendationid": "140471888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064158531", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13219, "last_played": 1695795588}, "language": "english", "review": "it was a fun game while it lasted but it doesn't seem to want to run in Windows 11 and is unstable in Windows 10.", "timestamp_created": 1687398243, "timestamp_updated": 1687398243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140463861": {"recommendationid": "140463861", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989260017", "num_games_owned": 972, "num_reviews": 184, "playtime_forever": 4021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3672, "last_played": 1687636761}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing Game", "timestamp_created": 1687384035, "timestamp_updated": 1687384035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140460243": {"recommendationid": "140460243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083539901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 792, "last_played": 1688514258}, "language": "english", "review": "star war make brain make happy juice", "timestamp_created": 1687378726, "timestamp_updated": 1687378726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140455634": {"recommendationid": "140455634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095949479", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4239, "last_played": 1686944682}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game until you ineviteably run into one of the many game- breaking bugs if you run windows 10 or higher.", "timestamp_created": 1687372690, "timestamp_updated": 1687372779, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140443942": {"recommendationid": "140443942", "author": {"steamid": "76561199513193703", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 279, "last_played": 1687287992}, "language": "english", "review": "any star wars fan would love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1687358071, "timestamp_updated": 1687358071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140425669": {"recommendationid": "140425669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070617505", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 11610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9924, "last_played": 1687569098}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah it's good.

Flawless Widescreen is a must for this game imo, I have a 2k monitor and no resolution exists for this game without an external application. I had crashes happening 5 times on occasion when loading into my save just to play the game, and had a few instances of corrupted saves ruining my playthrough. Sometimes you'd just load in and textures would bug out when changing areas and when you try to save (so you can quit and reload), the game crashes and then sets you to 0 hours played. So if you buy this game, make multiple saves and ensure you are updating them throughout and before changing areas. Just make sure the saves you're overwriting aren't your most \"current\" save because if you save onto that one, it gets corrupted which will waste your time.\n\nNow onto the actual gameplay itself:\n\nBrilliant RPG game, really good story telling as a whole and your companions all have their own neat stories that make them more interesting than in other games I've played, I'm not the kind of person to explore the side quests to do with companions in games because usually they are a waste of time and bloat. But I really enjoyed the side missions here. A lot of the side content in this game is actually pretty good which is something I don't find to be the case in most RPG games, it adds a lot to the feel of the game. The amount of different choices you can make can offer the opportunity for multiple playthroughs if you so wish as you can do a light side playthrough and dark, and they will produce different results at almost all points in the game. The story alone makes this game WELL worth the time to play it.\n\nGameplay is a weakness of this game however as it is basically turn based D&D combat. There are also quite obviously OP abilities and feats you earn which just make it so when you get in combat you're just spamming the same attack until the enemy is dead which gets stale. Overall though it's a great game and I would recommend to anyone who would like to know more about the republic era and Revan/Malak. If you can deal with dated combat mechanics this game is well worth it, just like Morrowind in that sense if you've played that.", "timestamp_created": 1687085005, "timestamp_updated": 1687085005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140261344": {"recommendationid": "140261344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049205271", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 13948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13394, "last_played": 1688230429}, "language": "english", "review": "Greatest Star Wars game of all time.

I never had a PC, and when I owned an Xbox the \"gameplay\" never made me want to play it. I recently decided to finally touch this game because I love star wars, and I am mad at my younger self for not playing this back on the Original Xbox! This game is a masterpiece! The story is phenomenal, and the characters are incredible! The gameplay itself is perfect to me, you never had to use your keyboard once (besides the shitty space shooting sections)! It is your typical Si-Fi party based RPG but with the star wars twist! Go ahead and do yourself a favor, buy this game and play it! This game goes on a crazy sale, but even without the steam sales this game is worth the $9.99 price tag! The only negative I can give this game is that you have to mod it to even play it! Be sure to download the community patch, a improved UI mod, and you unfortunately have to mod the game to even get 1080p, but once you mod it the game runs fine. This game is riddled with crazy bugs, many times I would get stuck on a wall, or stuck on my companions with me.

Don't fear the age of this game, because it has an amazing gameplay with an above average storyline. The graphics is not awesome (20 years old game) but isn't bad also, it fulfills the goal and to be realistic it is good for the age. You will need careful with the salve game? Of course you will, because autosave is trouble sometimes, it's similar for games that old. You will need to save the game before heat times, but you get used to. It has minor bugs? Yep, but it's not a big deal. Besides that, I absolutelly recommend to give it a chance.

I fully completed this game because of all the praise. There is a reason why a remake was in the making. Because this game feels like actual work. The only positive things I can think of are the Star Wars aesthetics and multiple ways of playing but is irrelevant because I would never go back and play again. \n\nIf you love this game then that is great. Play your heart out, but this is not the greatest Star Wars game of all time as some people act like it is. It has many flaws that people do not mention. You can tell Bioware slapped a Star Wars environment onto an rpg without thinking about a good gameplay loop beforehand. Even though Jedi Academy is a different type of game and is old with issues as well, it plays surprisingly well today. Not Kotor.

Once you have explored the main planets in your quest you are sent to the final area to confront the final boss. This area is unbelievably cheap with it's combat focus, with infinitely respawning enemies and a corridor dash filled with some of the toughest opponents in the game that constantly spam grenades. This isn't even mentioning the final boss which is a 30 minute endurance test if you haven't invested experience points correctly. I wouldn't be so annoyed with this decision but it kind of makes characters builds that focus on speech or force powers completely useless as you will have virtually no chance of beating the game fairly unless you spec into a tough Jedi/Sith Warrior. \n\nOn my first playthrough I tried to make a smooth talking mercenary ala Han Solo, but this is completely nonviable as soon as you reach this final section of the game. This sucks as there's nothing worse than spending 30 odd hours in a playthrough only to find out it was all pointless because the final boss is immune to virtually all force attacks and no way to beat him other than direct confrontation. \n\nSomething to note if you're just starting off with this game, I wish someone told me this before I invested so much time for nothing. Still more than worth playing though, maybe just quit right before this really annoying and drawn out ending.", "timestamp_created": 1684102602, "timestamp_updated": 1684102602, "voted_up": true,

I've sunk hundreds of hours into this game, although few of them have been here on Steam.\n\nKoTOR is an RPG in the truest sense, with several phenomenally unique worlds, cultures, and characters. It plays a lot like Dragon Age Origins, though obviously sci-fi instead of high fantasy, in that you build a character from a class, select the attributes and skills you want to build and use, and your actions and game play choices have actual impacts on the plot lines and characters. There are many sequences you'll never see unless you take enough Light or Dark side actions, which gives the game plenty of replay value. If you want to be so good that Sith characters will turn to the light and forsake the Dark side, and you become a paragon of light and goodness, taking down evil big corp and the Sith menace? Go for it! If you want to be so evil your allies turn on each other, flee from you in terror, or try to kill you as you seize power? Have at! If you just want to see the plot through and lean a bit in whatever way suits your fancy from situation to situation? You're free to do so! It's all up to you and what moral choices you want to make, assuming you have the skills (or resources) to back up your actions.\n\nIn addition to all that, the writing is amazing, witty, and memorable, with some of the coolest and/or funniest quotes I've encountered in games. Each world has an ultimate goal you need to complete, but how you get there and what bridges you build or burn is entirely up to you.

Liea/Han and Padme/Anakin have nothing on the romance in this game and the characters/relationships in general are so much deeper than anything else in SW, even inspiring Bioware to make its own outstandingly successful IP, Mass Effect.\n\nThere is an outstanding sequel with its own set of philosophy about the grey zones of good and evil, which was left on a cliffhanger as a planned trilogy, but they both rely heavily on the story and events of this first game.

One that respects the original, and improves upon it wherever it is necessary.\nI do believe that by incorporating a combat system like the one in Jedi: Fallen order (granted I do not really know how the team mechanic could be kept in), starship combat as the one in Star Wars Battle front 2, and updated graphics, reworked VA, and dialogue it could claim the title of the best Star Wars game of this generation as well.\nI hope Aspyr does a good job with the remakes.\nIt was nice to see what the origins of Bioware were, before jumping into the spotlight with Mass Effect and Dragon Age.

Originally released in 2003 on Xbox, it was the culmination of everything the company did up until that point, but streamlined (in the best possible way) for consoles and due to that (and the Star Wars setting) it managed to cover an audience so huge no \u201cwestern\u201d RPG covered before. It kickstarted the rise in popularity of morality systems, romance options, \u201chome bases\u201d with companions to choose from\u2026 All of it existed in games before, but KotOR became a template for lots of games to follow. All while also being, arguably, the least controversial and most beloved Star Wars product from the whole prequel period of the franchise.\n\nI played this game a lot back in the day, but after the sequel (which I loved so much more), I revisited it less and less and the last time I\u2019ve played it was more than 15 years ago. Now that the game is turning 20, I\u2019ve decided to finally revisit it and see how it fares.\n\nBioWare made a very smart choice when creating the game in an established universe \u2013 they chose a time period where they had full freedom of writing. So, KotOR takes place 4 thousand years before the movies and is thus free of all the story and character baggage that would\u2019ve implied. Which even in 2001 when the game was first announced was a lot. And now after the stupidly crazy amount of products Disney churned out, all dancing around the original trilogy (including the sequel trilogy), the story of the game feels especially fresh. Lots of the familiar concepts and ideas are here. Some things are just being established, some are only hinted upon and a lot of the ideas are new or at least were new for the time. For how dreaded the prequel period of the franchise seems to be with lots of people, the lore building it inspired in talented writers led to a world that was far more exciting and interesting than the constant circling around the Skywalkers that used to happen before that.\n\nThe core of the story and its big twist, are still excellent. They might no longer surprise people in this day and age, but BioWare crafted a really good adventure for its time and, also being smart about it, only ever attempted to repeat a twist of this kind with Jade Empire (their next project). A lot of the writing is wonderful, the planets you get to visit along your path to save the galaxy from the Sith led by Darth Malak are varied. BioWare continued with their usage of \u201cThe Four Map Pieces\u201d structure from Neverwinter Nights, except this time it was literally four map pieces, just like in Monkey Island 2. Visually the game was impressive and even today it looks very good, though, sadly, it does not natively support high resolutions or widescreen ratios. And the music is fittingly \u201cvery Star Wars\u201d in the best way. So much of the experience of the title remains impressive and wonderful even 20 years later.\n\nYet, so much of it aged so poorly or haven\u2019t been great in the first place. The companions, for one, are among the least memorable characters in the whole BioWare history. People tend to love HK-47 for a reason \u2013 he\u2019s possibly most amusing character in the whole game. The rest of the crew ranges from \u201coh, I forgot you\u2019re here\u201d to \u201coh no, I have to talk to Carth and Bastilla again\u2026\u201d All characters (except for T3-M4) have optional dialogues and even side stories you can do, but some are there seemingly just to exist and some end before you can blink an eye and the character has zero impact on the rest of the story. It\u2019s weird to think that even in NWN1 or BG1 characters had more personality and charm, even though in the first they were used more as tools and in the second almost all of them were skippable and killable.\n\nAnother thing that has been a problem since the day the game got released, is the way pathfinding and action queue constantly breaks. You and your companions, despite being directly controllable (which was an option in NWN1), constantly get stuck on nothing or queue up actions in a bizarre order or ignore things they shouldn\u2019t ignore. Except now, 20 years later, I\u2019ve experienced the game breaking even more spectacularly. Cutscene triggers teleporting me into other locations, items duplicating inside my inventory to ridiculous numbers, cutscenes that refuse to start or fade the screen to black and never unfade it\u2026 Game can also crash while saving corrupting your save file or crash at some other random spot. The game used to be frustrating, but now the problems only multiplied.\n\nAlthough, even if all issues were to be fixed and the title would work as designed without issue, you\u2019d get extended sections of genuinely boring gameplay. For how cool in ideas and stories some planets are, the level and encounter design is horrible. The entirety of the last act in the game is at times insufferable with how much combat there is and how boring it gets at the character levels you\u2019re at. Given that BioWare essentially adapted a simplified version of D&D rules (from their previous BG and NWN experience) into Star Wars universe, it means that sometimes you\u2019re just watching characters dance around missing each other because invisible dice just rolled that way, and sometimes you critical hit your opposition into oblivion before the fight even starts.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a lot of great stuff about the original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic that BioWare would continuously revisit in their later games\u2026 Which is also damning to this title. Original Mass Effect trilogy, for example, repeated basically every single aspect worth repeating across the games with new twists, turns and often better gameplay and more nuanced stories. All the character traits from this game were revisited, but improved in every way, in future titles. With only Light/Dark vs Paragon/Renegade being handled better in KotOR (as Mass Effect motivates you to grind those points). Though at the same time, it\u2019s not like they didn\u2019t revisit this idea with a twist in Jade Empire as well. And the non-linear choice-driven main character personality shaping gameplay was done far far better in the first two Dragon Age titles. BioWare cannibalised KotOR so much, it almost loses relevance\u2026\n\nBut I still think there\u2019s an audience for this game. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic still has plenty of cool ideas and elements worth experiencing. As long as you can solve the technical issues with the game. Would I revisit this game again in the future? Probably no. But I\u2019ve already played it many times before. If you haven\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s still a game worth checking out. And if nothing else, it\u2019s still a game worth remembering.", "timestamp_created": 1681321900, "timestamp_updated": 1681321900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136567889": {"recommendationid": "136567889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383944443", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3036, "last_played": 1688990358}, "language": "english", "review": "Peak fiction.

A lot of nuances are lost when it comes to making moral-based decisions in this game, and instead of the occasionally morally grey ambiguity of the choices you can make in the sequel, which I also highly recommend playing, your character in this game is either a bastion of righteousness or a completely unhinged sociopath- I highly recommend playing the game more than once, which I would say takes roughly 16-20 hours, depending on how many side quests you do, to see where each path leads you!", "timestamp_created": 1681004604, "timestamp_updated": 1681004604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136373575": {"recommendationid": "136373575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930524115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4181, "last_played": 1684271909}, "language": "english", "review": "colddddddddd\n", "timestamp_created": 1680991055, "timestamp_updated": 1680991055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136334440": {"recommendationid": "136334440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335820321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6502, "last_played": 1685096586}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Star Wars Games out there !!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1680956044, "timestamp_updated": 1680956044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136330210": {"recommendationid": "136330210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190839107", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1682795713}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute classic", "timestamp_created": 1680950227, "timestamp_updated": 1680950227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136321405": {"recommendationid": "136321405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268475744", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2939, "last_played": 1681341884}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played a it a little bit for over 20 years.", "timestamp_created": 1680936440, "timestamp_updated": 1680936440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136298340": {"recommendationid": "136298340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045594747", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3797, "last_played": 1656457732}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Star Wars Game.

With that said, it's not perfect and it shows its age in several ways. Even though the game ran fine for me, I encountered enough bugs to feel encouraged to get a [url=https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1258-kotor-1-community-patch/]community patch mod[/url]. Even after I installed the mod an encounter that had its own cutscene and everything didn't spawn in. Old game is old, basically, something that is worth keeping in mind.\n\nAnd yet, the minor issues I had pales compared to what the game has to offer. I played it for the first time this year, so I can say that it wasn't just great for its time, it is great period. It's not an unusual sentiment, but I'll try to unpack some of why that is \u2013 together with some obstacles along the way.\n\nTo start off, this game is very, very Star Wars. As in, the game makes an effort to include as many aspects of Star Wars as possible. There is the normal fair of Jedi, Sith and various bounty hunters and freedom fighters, but there is also pod racing, turret space combat, gambling in form of a card game and even galactical politics. The planets are also reminiscent of what we see in the movies, sometimes featuring the same ones (like Kashyyyk or Tatooine) or ones with a similar theme (a city planet, an ocean planet). There are familiar scenarios as well, like escaping an enemy ship after being captured. Basically, if you've seen it in the movies (the first six, anyway), there is a good chance that you'll see it in this game.\n\nThis could have felt derivative and cynical, but it's expanded upon and spun in enough of a different direction that it ends up being referential instead. Every aspect is well thought out within the limitations that the game is working with and, more importantly, you can feel the enthusiasm that went into each element of the game. Pod racing is not just a cutscene or something that happens in the background, it has a fully fleshed-out minigame attached to it. Combat has extra animations where fighters lock swords, each planet have their own culture and politics that influence quests, encounter design takes into account where you are and who is attacking, if they're even battles at all. There are options for diplomacy or brute force throughout the game, which again takes into account who you are talking to and why. Everything in this game feels hand crafted, basically, and I really appreciated that when I played.\n\nSo, how does it play then? Well, that's where we return to the age thing. Don't get me wrong, the game plays pretty well. You select an enemy to attack them, then you have a number of special attacks and abilities that you use on top of that. The UI is quite clear once you get used to it, enemies are fair and there is some variety in the combat scenarios, even if the main gameplay loop can get repetitive. However... I could never quite shake the feeling that KotOR's systems are just an infancy version of Dragon Age: Origins. Which is exactly what it is, of course; this game was the progenitor to a lot that DA:O mastered. The party AI behaviours, the real-time-with-pause, the spell queueing and focus on crowd control \u2013 they're all there, but simpler, less developed. Is that a fair criticism? No, but yet it matters for a modern audience that has access to both games. Not something to blame it for, just a reality of getting old.\n\nWhat I can blame the game for is the controls. Again, it's an old game, but you get stuck on [i]everything[/i] in this game. You get stuck on random debris, you get stuck on doors, you get stuck in corners. Most of all you get stuck on your party members, who seem to enjoy seeing you try to squirm and squeeze your way past them while they stand around like statues, given that they trap you as soon as they get the chance. And the targeting is far from great either. Clicking the right character in combat can be quite frustrating when everyone is close to each other, which isn't helped by the fact that your character can decide to start attacking a different target as soon as you're not directly controlling them. Looting is also a chore, since half the time the targeting system gets waylaid by one of your party members stepping on a corpse, leading to you having to run around in a big circle to reset it. This also applies to containers that are too close together, or active grenades overlapping with items on the floor. It never ceased to annoy me throughout the whole game.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's end with a positive. It's a big one: the story. Nothing in KotOR ever falls below good in the writing department, with good characters, great main and side quests, fantastic world building and amazing story structure. The dialogue is maybe where you can criticise the game a bit, it's built around a Light vs Dark narrative which shows in the dialogue options. Where this game really shines however is in its set up and pay off, which is among if not the best I've ever seen in a game. The game's first half is extremely good in hindsight, something you will probably end up reflecting on before the end, and the rest is pretty great as well. \n\nIf you enjoy storytelling in games, then this alone is a reason to experience KotOR, in whatever form you deem fit. The fact that there's also a very good game attached, well, that's quite the bonus on top.", "timestamp_created": 1677629554, "timestamp_updated": 1677629554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133830866": {"recommendationid": "133830866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039550885", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1147, "last_played": 1673787416}, "language": "english", "review": "Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is a masterpiece of modern video game storytelling. From the moment you begin your journey in the vast, sprawling galaxy of the Star Wars universe, you are completely immersed in a world that is both familiar and completely fresh.

The game is filled with interesting and complex characters, each with their own motivations and backstories. From the charming rogue Han Solo-esque smuggler to the wise and powerful Jedi Master, the cast of characters is diverse and engaging.\n\nThe world-building in Knights of the Old Republic is simply astounding. From the bustling cities to the desolate wastelands, every location in the game is meticulously crafted and filled with detail. The architecture, the landscapes, and the characters themselves are all inspired by the rich tapestry of the Star Wars universe, and the game does an excellent job of capturing the feel and atmosphere of the films.\n\nThe game's narrative structure is also a standout feature. The story is both epic and intimate, with a host of twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. The game's main questline is engaging and well-paced, but the real strength of Knights of the Old Republic lies in its many side quests and optional content. Each quest feels like a unique and compelling story in its own right, and the game rewards you for exploring its vast world and engaging with its characters.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Knights of the Old Republic is a classic role-playing game with deep systems for character customization and combat. The game's turn-based combat is engaging and strategic, with a host of abilities and tactics to master. Whether you prefer to engage in combat with a lightsaber or a blaster, the game gives you plenty of options to play the way you want.\n\nOverall, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is an incredible achievement in video game storytelling. It's a game that can be enjoyed by both die-hard Star Wars fans and newcomers to the series alike.

There is an old strategy guide on my shelf that I purchased when the game first released back in the day. I broke it out for my latest playthrough that just ended on February 10, 2023.\n\nWhat can I say? I love the setting, the characterizations, voice acting, galactic conflict, and universal themes\u2014not to mention the lightsabers and Wookies, man. When I first played the game, I was blindsided by the plot twist that is all too well known now. I did not see it coming.\n\nAnd yet, this review would be remiss without mentioning the things that plague my playthroughs; that is, the galling space battles and laborious swoop racing.

Do you love a good story with satisfying gameplay although it is starting to show its age? Then look no further than Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic! 9.5/10 [/h1]\nWow, just what an adventure. If you're a fan of star wars and D&D, chances are you will enjoy this game. It has some issues that show its age, but if you give it a chance, you will be in for a treat. \n[h1] First, the bad [/h1]\nThe pathfinding. Oh dear lord, the pathfinding. Much of the difficulty comes from ordering a command and watching the ai struggle to find a route to the enemy. At which point you just manually control and move them to the position yourselves. Another annoying feature comes mostly to force characters. Whenever the ai retargets to a new enemy it resets all the commands on the bar for me. Unsure if this is normal, but it was annoying when my force characters would constantly spend points haphazardly when I needed them the most. These two issues are the only thing imo that is holding back this game. Minor inconveniences most of which can be solved if you enable the pause after every combat round feature in the options menu.\n[h1] Now the good [/h1]\nEverything else. From the story down to the numbers of a blaster this game does it all very well. The combat is so D&D and I'm here for it. If you have played that classic tabletop adventure game then stepping into KOTOR will feel natural to you. The story is just *chef's kiss*. It poses a good ethical or moral quandary to the Jedi and the force that will make even seasoned star wars vets pause the game and go, \"You know, it's got a point\". If you're not in it for the massive thought bomb the game won't hesitate to drop, then you can follow a really simple plot that leads to a satisfying twist. If you ever played Bioshock, think about that in terms of gratification. \"Would you kindly?\"\nAwesome side quest design. They are simple but effective. Multiple different ways to approach them.

shit out of my laptop rip my hair out light my laptop on fire take a piss on it bury it in my back garden and dance on it's grave and take a shit on the previously mentioned grave.\n\nSTORY: No spoilers but the story is amazing and it's the only reason I kept playing, if the character interactions and the story-line were just OK I would have begged steam for my money back, you may favour some characters and their stories more than I did but that's neither here nor there. My favourite characters were Carth Onasi and Bastila Shan the two most important characters in the game so I lucked out but Jolee Bindo is a close third. The protagonist surprisingly has a bit of depth and isn't just some rando there's something more to them that even they aren't aware of. The ending or at least the good ending kind of falls flat to me, you don't get to say goodbye to the characters you've grown to really like you just get talked to by two characters that you probably wont give a fuck about I wanted to say something or hear a few words from them at least or an epilogue for you to play through.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The idea of taking a turn based rpg format into a 3d space sounds like a good idea on paper but in practice it is the most frustrating thing about this game. Occasionally when you run away to heal yourself your character will stop in place to wait for the enemy to hit you and if you are underleveled you are going to be dying a LOT and it really pissed me off when the dark jedi started coming in with moves that choke you it's an iconic skill don't get me wrong but it's fucking annoying to deal with. The skills are pretty neat you can upgrade your mind trick but if you funnel all your skill points into persuade then you'll be using mind trick like when everything fails. The movement can be pretty janky it relies on tank controls which may or may not be a bad thing to you but I got used to it pretty quick so you should to.\n\nGRAPHICS: The ps2 era graphics look pretty good to me I like it a lot, it's not mind blowing but it gets the job done word of advice though, the graphics for grass can go absolutely nuts sometimes and can make the experience almost unbearable so turn that shit off the moment you get a chance you wont miss it at all.\n\nGLITCHES: First off random invisible walls that will stop you in your place one moment  but when you turn and go back you can walk through just fine there's the aforementioned grass glitching to high heaven, and then there's the VERY irritating glitch where the dialogue will just skip right to the end this isn't an option in game it just does this randomly, and I'm counting my lucky stars that that didn't happen during an important character moment.\n\nOverall if you can swallow the god awful battle system then you're in paradise overall a 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1675375838, "timestamp_updated": 1675375838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132078256": {"recommendationid": "132078256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085745698", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1675363386}, "language": "english", "review": "deez", "timestamp_created": 1675363393, "timestamp_updated": 1675363393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132069345": {"recommendationid": "132069345", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966095290", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1923, "last_played": 1691680830}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite and greatest game of all time, ever, the end.", "timestamp_created": 1675352705, "timestamp_updated": 1675352705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132062827": {"recommendationid": "132062827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414066722", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3001, "last_played": 1675978481}, "language": "english", "review": "Great storyline, some bugs in the gameplay but those can be overlooked (or fixed).", "timestamp_created": 1675345441, "timestamp_updated": 1675345441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132060260": {"recommendationid": "132060260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119545161", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 642, "last_played": 1675422021}, "language": "english", "review": "did it take me like four hours to make it work on my computer?

The combat itself isn\u2019t very engaging, it kind of just revolves around clicking the move you want and waiting. There is some diversity in what you can do but it is mostly either ranged or close attacks with a few stuns and such, each fight is pretty much the same with difficulty decided by the standard d20 system. For the most part, combat is pretty minimal and as such is pretty bearable, it does ramp up immensely towards the very end of the game becoming a slog and not very enjoyable. Aside from combat, there are two other minigames those being a card game that I never played and a racing one that I played once for the story requirements. Most of the rest of the gameplay is walking around and talking with others, luckily this aspect is very good. There are a number of companions that can be recruited some of which fill different archetypes to fill out the party, each of them are interesting though. There are several different planets that are visited throughout the game each with unique environments, some are better and more full than others and with interesting quests that enhance the story, while others are more lackluster. The stories with minimal combat are the best ones as the stories and characters become centerpieces. The length of the planets is very varied with the first one being much longer than the others and aside from the very last area is the least interesting of them. There is no traditional alignment system but there is a simple light and dark system, light of course being good and dark being bad, not too complex but it does fit with the Star Wars universe. The game features a class system that works pretty well, however pretty far into the game the character will switch classes and get a whole new set of abilities and useful stats which makes the first few levels not as effective, on subsequent playthroughs the level ups could be saved or built to better accommodate that future class but for a first time playthrough this wasn\u2019t very enjoyable to have happened.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nWhile the story is very simple it is pretty engaging after a certain point. It starts on a ship that's been attacked and crashes on a planet, from there the player seeks out Bastila, a Jedi that was on the ship, as well as a way off. This first planet is focused on getting to Bastila and getting off the planet. For much of the early game, the only option for a companion is Carth, a republic soldier who isn\u2019t very trusting and quite frankly is very annoying, after enough time more companions who are much better will be added. Following the departure of this planet is another tutorial to teach about the new class you get and from there the main plot revolves around stopping the Dark Lord Malak. Malak is not a very interesting villain, he is pretty evil without any real redeeming qualities or things to make him stand out, just a typical villain who wants power, as this fits with the main theme of Star Wars it isn\u2019t too much of a negative.\n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe graphics are from 2003 so they are pretty outdated, however, they look nice enough for what they are despite some areas being very barren.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is really good, it features a few classic Star Wars tracks and overall great additions that fit well into Star Wars.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is just ok. While it may have been good in 2003 20 years later it is a bit rough, not having the nostalgia may affect it more but the combat is rather boring and there are some design choices that don\u2019t work well. All that being said the story and companions(for the most part) are very good and the music is good as well, if you\u2019re able to get past the poor gameplay the game is alright but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d recommend it, perhaps the remake if that ever happens will be more enjoyable.\n\n[h1] Score: 5/10 [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1675310920, "timestamp_updated": 1675310920, "voted_up":

Sure, it's aged, the graphics are even worse compared to today's standards, but if you treat this like a story, an adventure, it's worth looking past the aged visuals and getting into it.  The plot is good, with a few twists, the voice acting is impeccable, the characters are fleshed out enough and rich, and the gameplay is pretty diverse too. In short, this is an excellent RPG. Play it once. It's well worth it.  I installed the community patch and the ultra widescreen to play it at 1920x1080, I also installed a mod that fixed the HUD items, which I recommend doing.

The space combat is a chore, the swoop racing later requires perfection for trivial rewards, and pazaak, well, I want to love lazy Star Wars blackjack but it's pretty boring. And for a game that was lauded for taking Star Wars out of the usual tiny part of a grand universe, it sure has a lot of connections to the movies. The trip to Tantooine is the most obvious, but there are items named after Calrissians, Fetts, Organas, etc. too. I guess they weren't willing to make a full break.\n\nAll that being said, I still loved it. The characters are fun, the story is grand and it feels like a great Star Wars adventure. Combat is simple but doesn't drag until the very end (when it gets repetitive), and I learned this time that the ending doesn't depend on your dark side/light side rating, rather on one choice you make near the end of the game, so you can be an awful human being who decides to save the world at the last minute and bam!

It's the original Mass Effect but with a different combat system and a fixation on the Star Wars setting (or rather Mass Effect is KOTOR but with an original IP and therefore less Star Wars baggage). \n\nIts biggest strength is that it is very easy to simply play and make progress. Questing is clear and combat is approachable. It's also fairly dense and there are a decent amount of options in various narratives and systems. Though the gameplay isn't especially interesting in the moment, there is room for different builds and a persistent difficulty slider which allows for some nice leeway in case character builds don't turn out as effective as they should.\n\nThe downside is that the Star Wars universe's light side/dark side binary tends to rob the plot of a lot of complexity it should have otherwise. Characters can have interesting moral dilemmas, but framing those dilemmas as falling to the darkside defangs the interesting ways they could react to those problems. As well, despite the gameplay's capacity for depth, the in-moment choices aren't especially enthralling. \n\nThat said, this is an easy game to just spend time with, especially if Star Wars aesthetics are sought after. Nothing about it is extraordinarily enjoyable and the characters aren't given as much love or focus as a game like Dragon Age: Origins, but it doesn't put too many negative elements in the way either and still manages to have some quality rpg elements to work with. One major recommendation though: invest in Force Speed.

I did play old bioware games before and in particularly love Baldurs Gate 2.\nThe three most interesting thing about this game are, the main story, the characters and the main characters dialogue choices. \n* The main story is interesting and very well told. \n* I feel that the characters are real and natural. Characters react to what you say, and it's delightful to know that they might not like what you say. In most game, there is not a reaction for what the main character says. In this game, the other characters will have a different impression of you. \n* And at last the dialogues that you can chose to say.

KotOR introduced some of the most iconic Star Wars characters outside of the movies. The game certainly shows its age in 2022, however. Environments are often blank hallways and generic corridors, fields, forests, and caves. But, its old school Dungeons & Dragons game mechanics are engaging and the characters and storyline are more than enough to make up for it. KotOR excels at providing the quintessential Star Wars experience hitting all the tropes you love about the series with enough twists to keep it feeling like its own thing and creating an engaging and entertaining story. If you like Star Wars, D&D character sheets, Bioware writing, and MMO-like combat, KotOR is a must play.\n\nAT LEAST IT WOULD BE if it worked. KotOR wasn't the most stable of games on any platform, but in 2022, on Steam, on Windows 11, it is hopelessly broken that I can't recommend even bothering. Between a crash-on-start bug, broken story triggers, graphical glitches, and random crashes, I can't get the game to work long enough to even beat it again.\n\nIf you are going to try playing it, you're going need one of if not all these fixes:\n- Run in Windows XP compatibility mode\n- Turn on Vsync\n- Turn off frame buffers\n- Turn off grass\n- Install KotOR community patch\n- Open swkotor.ini turn fullscreen to \"=0\"\n- Write \"AllowWindowedMode=1\" under graphics options in the ini file\n- Make several saves in multiple different save slots for emergency back ups to combat broken triggers\n- Open swconfig.exe and disable movies if still crashes when trying to start new game; bye bye cutscenes\n\nThere's more fixes you can try to find with a google search.

However, today, if you have AMD graphics card, I can't recommend this game. \n\nThe game crashes constantly at certain points in the game, points that even prevent you from advancing in the story. After researching for hours and trying hundreds of solutions, I gave up. Apparently, it is very common for the game to crash on AMD cards.\n\nIf you don't use AMD, the game is great and will give you many hours of fun and a great story of one of the best Star Wars characters. But if you use AMD, it's not worth it, at least for now. Buy the game on Nintendo Switch or Android. Unironically, it runs better there than on AMD.

The game itself is more or less everything you could want in a Star Wars RPG, provided you can look past some of the jank that comes from it being a nearly 20 year old game. Definitely a recommend from me.\n\nHowever, the Steam version is just not good in my experience.

This was definitely a defining game for the console and the times and even today remains one of the best games you can find.\n\nIf you love star wars, have never played the game (shame on you), or have played it before and want to jump back into it (who wouldn't) than this is definitely a great choice for a game and the price is really decent for the amount of content you get.", "timestamp_created": 1668087925, "timestamp_updated": 1668087925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580218076705932617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125218341": {"recommendationid": "125218341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198907862370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1088, "last_played": 1665525217}, "language": "english", "review": "I got banned from a planet for killing their god", "timestamp_created": 1668027221, "timestamp_updated": 1668027221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769610941410064697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125216802": {"recommendationid": "125216802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132591734", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3003, "last_played": 1669151870}, "language": "english", "review": "Replay value is 5 Stars!

Not only does it provide an excellent insight into the old republic, and how both the jedi and sith have changed over four millennia. The absolutely BANGING experience of going through this game's story, even spoiled, was a journey some could describe as \"an epic that sucked my cock and re-affirmed my prejudice against hutts\".\nThe good:\nThis game's story is a beast, with 30 hours of fucking around and interacting in the environment in a comfortable matter that will satisfy most players. All characters are likeable in some way and have a specific role in mind, serving a grand purpose in your playthrough. Although there is no way to influence the companions' alignment, I think that's for the best, because then i would just tailor my playthrough to manage dumbass numbers, and i hate that shit. Malak himself also get's extra points for being camp as fuck, i love that shit. The game also forces you to make meaningful choices with the planet quests as well, including the order of progress.\nThe bad:\nCombat involves mainly slaughtering trash minions until you fight a unique enemy or tactical puzzle, which doesn't bother me all that much. it's always that battles against jedi or bosses that get me, especially because i dislike playing as soldier. Battles are unfamiliar to new players and i find it hard to recommend this game to people who want an action RPG rather than... whatever this is. \nThe worst part of this game has to be getting a decent resolution to play it in. Since steam encrypts the EXE file, some end up cracking their game and causing many more problems down the line. This game hasn't had much help in terms of compatibility, unlike it's younger, edgier twin, so expect there to be problems on launch with the UI and other issues brought about by the buggy ass modified odyssey engine which this game relies on.\nIn conclusion: \nif you want to experience one of the classics that comforted me as i developed my autistic power, which i planned to use to summon my father with that coke cherry, you must heed any and all tutorials you can find, but beware, for if you are even a step off, the game WILL be off centre of your screen, and you will need a fresh install. my personal advice is to turn on winxp mode, run it in 800*600 ratio, run with admin and hope that your game doesn't decide to stop showing you that cutscene. \nMods are not recommended, but that's up to you.", "timestamp_created": 1665934005, "timestamp_updated": 1665934005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123867957": {"recommendationid": "123867957", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098885990", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1673916446}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep playing and near the beginning my controls quit working", "timestamp_created": 1665840204, "timestamp_updated": 1665840204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123845379": {"recommendationid": "123845379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052758931", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3013, "last_played": 1665810464}, "language": "english", "review": "great classic star wars game\n", "timestamp_created": 1665800185, "timestamp_updated": 1665800185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123814303": {"recommendationid": "123814303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198989093954", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3874, "last_played": 1665743389}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun WRPG really.

I've been coming back to this game for nearly two decades now and it never gets old. Combat feels intuitive and you have a plethora of options on how to handle each encounter depending on your build/party composition. The cast is colorful and gives you plenty too chose from ranging from a hairy wookie to an assassin droid with a penchant for malevolence. The story is absolutely fantastic and stands head and shoulders over anything Disney has done with the franchise in the last decade. Ever if your not big on turn based games I'd still give it a shot as it's a very satisfying experience that doesn't demand much strategy if you just want to cruise through the game and enjoy the experience. Despite it coming out in 2003 it's aged very well, the graphics are a little dry compared to today's standard but the environments and character models still retains charm thanks to the simple semi-realistic art style. For 10 dollars or less the game is an absolute steal and you''ll get a good 20-30 hours of fun out of it.

Just with dice rolls. The leveling system is one of BioWare's most fluid and functional but you can, regrettably, get yourself stuck in a corner with bad decision-making.\n\nI loved it!\n\nAlso, it says that one playthrough takes about 45 hours as a completionist but it took me almost 67.

Although it is old, its graphics didn't bother me. I enjoyed playing it until the final battle of the game.\nIn the final battle of the game, our main villain uses tubes containing other force users to not die and to regenerate both his health and strength. No matter how hard we hit, when the final boss is about to die, he immediately regenerates and there is no end to it. It's impossible to break those tubes with a lightsaber. Throw lightning, use force push, throw your lightsaber, it doesn't matter. Tubes do not break. The only way (if I remember correctly) is to use the Stun Droid power. This power is also a power that can be obtained very easily. You can get this power at the beginning of the game if you want. But since this game is rpg and I didn't want to use this power in the game, it was one of the features I didn't get in the game. The save files of the game also belonged to the final war, so it was impossible for me to level up again and try to get that power. And those tubes just break with this stupid feature! \nThat's why I couldn't finish the game... I watched the finale on Youtube... I tried for about 2 hours, I threw lightning bolts, I threw a lightsaber, but in vain. If you want to finish the game, get the Stun Droid feature at the beginning of the game.\n\nIf someone passed without the stun droid power, please let me know. Even in Dark Souls boss battles, I didn't have such a hard time.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-T\u00fcrk\u00e7e Yorumum-\n\nBenim gibi Star Wars hayran\u0131 birisi i\u00e7in bu oyun muhte\u015fem.

I barely heard this game even exist ever, as I never grew up with an Xbox or PC. So a friend of mine bought the game while back and played it for a few hours just for the trip down memory lane. I was super interested in the game for the first few hours, as I noticed how interesting it was. Specially the Wizards of The Coast Third Edition of Dungeon & Dragons was heavily implied into it, which for a D&D nerd myself. I had to get the game as well. \n\nSo for a 2003 game, it still holds up for its name. Though yes, the graphics and combat are a tad bit janky, of course outdated. Alongside the bugs that anyone could experience, some it would be worse and some would be bad. But for my experience sometimes when a cutscene begins; it just simply kicks me out of the game onto the windows page but it still runs. So I  had to open the tab back up for it to rerun the cutscene again. Sometimes there are bugs that happen, as if you run the game too long. Sometimes the dialogue goes mach 5, as if you are skipping through it. In reality, you didn\u2019t touch anything for it to skip literal paragraphs of dialogue and expect you to answer right off the bat. Which would take a quick restart of the game to fix it. \n\nBut for going into this game completely blind. The story is fantastic, as I was 100% blown away at such an interesting and original story with a huge arc and twist into it. Making me fall more in love with Star Wars (as I only watch the films and played the original battlefront games). The characters are really well thought out and interesting, as it is an RPG style game. Where choices do matter if it affects your character in both good, bad or just neutral. Though don\u2019t expect much out of it, as you are either fighting for the good or the bad. The game itself is challenging and at times difficult, such as if you don\u2019t focus on the right class or perks. You\u2019re going through a tough time, such as my friend picking a scoundrel (rogue based stealth and thief) and consular (force focused jedi, who uses mainly the force than lightsaber combat). But he forced his character into combat and died non stop. \n\nVs me, I did Soldier and Sentinel who was a dual wielding opponent who blew through certain levels like it\u2019s nothing. But you can do whatever, such as being a jedi who uses a blaster all the way. So my official rating for it would be 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1663922744, "timestamp_updated": 1663922744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51215970516204834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122659485": {"recommendationid": "122659485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105397067", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2002, "last_played": 1665189561}, "language": "english", "review": "Great for anyone who enjoys Star Wars, specifically for immersing yourself into the world and having a character that has the story develop by your choices. \n", "timestamp_created": 1663895021, "timestamp_updated": 1663895021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122656833": {"recommendationid": "122656833", "author": {"steamid": "76561199221231940", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1870, "last_played": 1675569420}, "language": "english", "review": "KOTOR has an amazing story and is definitely worth a try if you like RPGs regardless of if you are a Star Wars fan. Since this game is set 4000 years before the events of the movie, the developers had almost complete creative freedom when it came to this game. The game also presents it's age really well, like for example the protocol droid has the same familiar design, but you can tell by the time of the movies, it had really progressed in its design. However, one complaint I do have is the combat system. I get what they were trying to do, a real time strategy type game but still an RPG. While the Combat system is unique, it's a little dumb. Like, I want to throw a grenade, but the character (If they have a melee weapon) would first go up and hit the enemy? I wanted you to throw a grenade from range not up close. \n\nOther than the combat system, solid 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1663890562, "timestamp_updated": 1663890562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122647669": {"recommendationid": "122647669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089706274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1695550289}, "language": "english", "review": "Oldy but a goody", "timestamp_created": 1663877020, "timestamp_updated": 1663877020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122615462": {"recommendationid": "122615462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002374897", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 419, "last_played": 1554172691}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really good if you like Bioware games like Mass Effect.
