I wish I didn't finish the game, but I did due to being a completionist. This purchase is the one that I regret the most. It hurt, it was painful, and it was a huge waste of time. \n\n    I get that the MC is a depressed loser, that cheers up for like 1/5 of the game, and is decent maybe another 1/5 of the game or so, but the parts where he is just a depressed loser that doesn't take any action are some of the most frustrating parts of the story, you'll probably ever come across. The game is kinetic with only a choice represented with making a drawing in every chapter. \n\n    First, I'll speak about the translation. The English is so bad that unless you're good at deciphering puzzles, you'll likely be lost for a lot of this. It had to have been an auto-generated translation, but it was so bad that you'll find yourself staring at a line for several minutes trying to understand what it means. A fair amount of it is decent, but hardly any of it is well translated. Another thing about the writing is that it goes on and on and on and on and on and on etc. etc. etc. So much of it is useless lines about how the depressed MC feels or something else that I eventually just started skipping a lot of the inner monologue. If not for all of that, this would be a much better and quicker read. The writing is mind-numbing. \n\n     The MC is so depressed that he is unable to do anything unless his childhood friend is there. She is the only thing that brightens his day, and then a transfer student comes. She may seem quite good and pretty, but take it from me. Unless you want more frustrating depression-related stuff to deal with, do not do her route. Her ending is the worst and completely dissatisfying. The childhood friend's ending is so much better. It's bright and cheerful, and she's a good person. It's by far the superior ending. \n\n   Okay, so... mind-numbing and terribly translated English writing. A depressed loser MC that only does well if you choose the childhood friend's route, and even then it gets really rough at times. Also, the pain and depression. If you actually like a VN like this where you're just surrounded with depression, and have to fight not to join it or at the very least smash your keyboard and mouse because of how frustrating it is, then I don't know. But hey! It's got okay art, cute girls, and an okay soundtrack that you forget about pretty easily. Also, if you're an aspiring artist that is getting downtrodden, you could probably relate with the protagonist. \n2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1698964011, "timestamp_updated": 1698964011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574696183204650879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149166577": {"recommendationid": "149166577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198813284033", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1581781053}, "language": "english", "review": "\u4f60\u5c31\u70c2\u6284\u5427\uff0c\u5f53\u5e74\u8fd8\u6709\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u771f\u6076\u5fc3", "timestamp_created": 1698627307, "timestamp_updated": 1698627307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517647087574005127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149143453": {"recommendationid": "149143453", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446613496", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1683476102}, "language": "english", "review": "damm feminism", "timestamp_created": 1698601205, "timestamp_updated": 1698601205, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410013884305953979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149103770": {"recommendationid": "149103770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398348221", "num_games_owned": 1360, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1624908695}, "language": "english", "review": "hape\u8fd0\u8425\uff0chape\u516c\u5173", "timestamp_created": 1698560580, "timestamp_updated": 1698560580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499435305595397949", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149072665": {"recommendationid": "149072665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070593334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 803, "last_played": 1524838275}, "language": "english", "review": "\u81ed\u505agalgame\u7684\u7ba1\u73a9\u5bb6\u7c89\u4e1d\u53eb\u50bb\u903c\u8748\u877b\u662f\u5427\uff1f\u90a3\u4e0d\u597d\u610f\u601d\u8bf7\u4f60\u53bb414", "timestamp_created": 1698520214, "timestamp_updated": 1698520214, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491343021392822266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148936323": {"recommendationid": "148936323", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971098718", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 328, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1609155643}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the English version..\nAnd the English translation and sometimes the way it's worked don't make sense.", "timestamp_created": 1698352235, "timestamp_updated": 1698352235, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51445084810256958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148690635": {"recommendationid": "148690635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381569714", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1594022349}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend I play with said that if I post a review about the game and it gets 200 likes and 50 rewards, he'll buy me a bag of chips and a RTX 4090.

What is the trend you may ask? The MC is the stiffest guy I've ever known. I've read 3 VNs with the similar \"abused by parents\" plot and Either I got really unlucky, or it's just like this every time.\n\nI was expecting it to happen here too, but I just can't go on with this murderously bad english translation. Please tell me someone that it's just an MTL... First of all, the translator decided it would be a good idea to LOCALIZE chinese names. LOCALIZE. CHINESE. NAMES. WHY? But also 70% of the lines are so UNREADABLE, you have to re-read them several times to at least UNDERSTAND what is being said. Pretty disappointing where in a game the most fundamental aspect is flawed beyond belief. Not recommended even for a discount. In order to really enjoy this, I suggest learning Chinese first.

"language": "english", "review": "[h1]Plot & script[/h1]\nThe plot of this visual novel is a school life drama. Ashley experiences friendship, hardship and conflict as he interacts with Daisy and Violet. Working with Daisy and Violet, Ashley discovers something about himself and unlocks his full potential. However, misunderstandings and tensions occasionally surface leading to difficult moments.\n\nThe scriptwriter behind this visual novel has done a wonderful job crafting individual backgrounds, behaviours and relationships for each main character. It boasts lengthy chapters filled with intriguing plot hooks and meaningful events that span multiple months, making for an emotive journey.Unfortunately the English version of this game is plagued with a number of flaws that detract from the overall score. The Chinese translation fares better in terms of errors, although some still remain between displayed text and spoken dialogue in earlier stages.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe visuals of this game are of a high quality. The backgrounds, CGs and opening/ending themes provide much detail and plenty of variety. Even small elements such as banners and weather effects have been captured accurately. The opening theme does a great job in introducing characters, while the ending theme features an animated slideshow with vocals for each outcome. However, there is one criticism on the character sprite for Violet - it appears to be unrealistic compared to the others.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe quality of the voice acting and background music was remarkable.

They elicited varied emotions to make fun of characters, admonish or rebuke them, apologize, scoff or refuse them, whisper softly, sob aloud and demonstrate love, friendship or surprise; it all came through brilliantly!

It seems like the devs took the the original Chinese script, drag and dropped it into a translation app, from 2010 and just used the direct output as the \"Official English translation.\" It's so bad, that it feels like your playing an English puzzle game on top of reading a visual novel. Example: Moments where the game is clearly talking about a 'girl' but keeps using the pronoun for males, \"he\" \"his\" and \"him\" or clearly talking about a guy and the pronouns \"her\" \"hers\" and \"she\" are used.\n\nAnother issue with the translation, which I can't fault the devs for, too much... The OVERLY INSANE use of the word \"Alas.\" I don't know why but for some reason, China teaches English with this word as a focal point. I have met many Native Chinese, and they literally use it in every day English speaking. It drives me crazy. I have read this word more times in the 4 hours (time played as of writing) of reading this VN than I have heard it in my entire life. (Mid 30's as of writing)\n\nAside from cacophony of English issues... The visual novel is very pretty, and the story is... 'okay' enough. \nFor some reason the MC was (my own dramatic interpretation) \"chained in a cellar of oppression forced to study and nothing else, and in turn has the analytical skills, and real life memory of a rock.\" If you can make it through the English puzzles, this will make sense. It's the only idea that makes sense to why the MC can hear something, immediately forget about the topic, to ask about it in the next scene as if he never heard it before. Or, do something that any normal person would say \"that's not a good idea.\" \n\nAnd while I haven't played many visual novels, the art style of this one surely knows how to make some fun use of camera pans and stuff to set atmosphere of the scenes. Which is pretty enjoyable, and the voice acting is pretty good as well.\n\nTLDR: Visuals are great, voice acting is great, story is 'okay,' translation is 11 ways to horrible. All in all.

As far as I can remember, this only costs less than half a dollar on sale (I bought this 2 years ago and just finished around the time this review is posted).\n\nStory & Plot-wise, It's decent I guess.. Common tropes are there, but you can have some good takeaways such as lessons and stuffs. (8/10)\nArt is really good (10/10)\nPacing is great. (9/10)\nCharacters are somewhat relatable (they're common tropes you can see everywhere in stories). (7/10)\nChoice Matters. (1/10) [you don't get to choose; you can only chose what path you would take]\n\nAll in all, I could give this game a good 6/10.\n\nMY GAME REVIEW:\n- I have to stop and process a lot of information because of the bad translation but I managed to survive. (It took me around 2 years to complete all routes because I just can't continue it like how I would on other Visual Novels because of the atrocious English translation).\n- Based on my on experience, It seems to me that wherever route I chose; the game favors only one girl but still separates the both of them.\nfor example:\nI choose girl A [the favored girl] = you make this girl yours and leave the other one, but you only feel pity for the other one.\nI choose girl B [the other girl] = you make this girl yours and leave the other one, but it looks like you made the wrong choice LMAO.\nBIG DIFFERENCE (this is a bias review BTW)\nAnyways, If you can understand Chinese, then definitely buy this on sale or not; depends on what you want.", "timestamp_created": 1663574826, "timestamp_updated": 1663574826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61895596981048584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122173873": {"recommendationid": "122173873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816518410", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 417, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 142, "last_played": 1663053691}, "language": "english", "review": "english translation needs some fixing\n", "timestamp_created": 1663053779, "timestamp_updated": 1663053779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671686470508575439", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121944182": {"recommendationid": "121944182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204807088", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1663929929}, "language": "english", "review": "UwU", "timestamp_created": 1662666514, "timestamp_updated": 1662666514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496774196624755859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121943955": {"recommendationid": "121943955", "author": {"steamid": "76561199261352953", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1662644817}, "language": "english", "review": "So good!", "timestamp_created": 1662666131, "timestamp_updated": 1662666131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121735442": {"recommendationid": "121735442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387923714", "num_games_owned": 983, "num_reviews": 99, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1662302371}, "language": "english", "review": "I just could not get myself into it and spent nearly 3 hours just fast forwarding the game.

Not a full review)\n\nI dunno if this only applies to the \"Completed Edition\" (a dlc which optimizes the game engine and allows the game to be finally operable). But this game is basically an exercise book for future translator/editor. Yes it is understandable, but u are forced to translate 'English' to English. Guys...I don't know who you hired as a translator, but fire him. PLEASE. I can see that it is a rich game and had it been translated properly it would have been even better. I mean there is just so many things that make it hard to immerse into the story :repeated use of the same vocabulary, poor grammatical construction, misuse of proper vocabulary (\"Propaganda\" and \"Promotion\" are 2 different things and I am pretty sure latter was the word u were looking for), and the list goes on for so long I can literally write an essay out of it. I mean for the first time in my life I regretted not learning Mandarin, so u guys might want to seriously think of establishing partnership with Duolingo in the near future. I mean the guy literally translates \"Wo xing ding\" (which means \"My last/family name is Ding\") as \"My first name is Ding\"....Jesus...how is it possible for anyone to **** that part? \n\nThen again I do realize that it is a cheap game and that u guys might not have had any translators in the first place. So here is an advice for u if u want to stick to that route. Translating programs tend to go haywire when u chunk an entire script all at once. So what u want to do is to break it apart one by one (smaller the better) and then translate them pieces by pieces. U would be surprised how accurate it can get. Of course....normally ur translator and editors are supposed to smooth it out afterwards....but if u have none this is the best u could do.", "timestamp_created": 1642883409, "timestamp_updated": 1642883409, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677853643894195557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "108174583": {"recommendationid": "108174583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798753272", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 627, "last_played": 1660967162}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice story", "timestamp_created": 1642379771, "timestamp_updated": 1642379771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "107469070": {"recommendationid": "107469070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247967992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1308, "last_played": 1555128635}, "language": "english", "review": "Long, surprising story, abit melodramatic but still really worth playing.

However, this game might not be suitable for all VN fans, as I think there are some translation problems that spoil the player's experience: \n- No French translation (it's not so bad if you master English or Chinese)\n- Pitiful English translation (the game being released in Chinese, the translators didn't make the effort, and literally translated from Chinese to English without using a real \"human\" translator...) \n\nNevertheless, the story is really captivating, accompanied by an excellent artistic style of the OST, the characters and the landscapes. The game duration for this VN is more than enough to have a good time.

on one hand, i absolutely love it. the characters are (almost) all really good, the art and music is amazing -- like most VNs i've played -- and the entire story is really good, if just a high school drama. on the other hand, i didn't like parts of it. some of it is my personal preference and bias, but not everything; the translation is godawful. i hate Violet. Ashley is a goddamn idiot. Green is an asshole. the game actually crashed on me once. such a roller coaster of emotions cannot go un-explained. so, reader beware, i am simply going to talk about this game for a long time, to properly voice why i'm giving this game the score i gave it. go to the last paragraph to see the TL;DR, and the rating i give it, if you don't want to be spoiled.\n\nFirst off, the good things.\nthis might go without saying, but this game is very cheap: $2.30 CAD with tax. just thought i'd say that first.\neveryone, even the other side characters are still good for their purpose. the main cast has dynamics; they all grow, they all interact with each other amazingly, they each have a distinct personality, they all have their problems and skills, and they all have intricate relationships with each other. Daisy is Ashley's best friend and secret admirer for 10 years, having an abrupt breakup because of Ashley's parents, and his subsequent attempt to \"protect\" her. she is serious but extroverted. quick to anger, but infinitely forgiving, and hides her emotions expertly, until provoked too much. her dynamic through both paths show this amazingly. even when Ashley makes fatal mistake after fatal mistake, she still helps him; she still forgives him. imo, she is a bit dumb in that regard, but do i care? daisy is, without a doubt, my favourite character in this game. i would go and explain each character like this, but frankly, i don't have 80 hours or enough space. just know that Lushen and Sunny are tied for second place, Green in third, Ashley in fourth, and violet in fifth for the main characters.\n\nI'll get to the last two later, but now onto another good thing: the art and music.\nfrankly, I can't tell the difference in quality between the various VNs I've played -- albeit only 5 -- but that is to say, the art is amazing. I'm not an artist of any visual kind, so i can't say much more than holy crap do I love it. the music, though, I have at least a better say; I love it as well! each piece spoke volumes for the scene, and each piece on it's own is amazing. I'm partial to \"Excuse me?\" because it's just so energetic and fun.\n\nnow, the story. in a word, i love it.\ni can't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure that most high school drama VNs aren't this long, or this good, or this intricate. Ashley's and Daisy's backstory is both heartwarming and heartbreaking; fuck Ashley's parents with a goddamn anchor. the first four chapters are all full of turns i was not expecting (and ones i was expecting, but they were still done well). unlike in ATRI, the antagonist play an actual role. i still love that game, but the antagonist is really its only short coming, along with the way the good ending ended. in Tricolor, the antagonist, in both paths, ends up helping Ashley, and is a much more vital piece to the story, instead of just a guy really only being in one scene. i do realise that Lin does come out of nowhere to suddenly be the \"twist villain,\" if you will, but it was still done in a good manor. anyway, this was a long section, so now lets get onto the next part...\n\nthe bad stuff.\nfirst, the translation. OH MY GOD IS IT TERRIBLE! the \"worst translation yet\" award, must go to this game. everything that can go wrong, went wrong. missing words, mixed up words, wrong words, missing letters, double letters, double spaces, no space, bad formatting,a literally broken script, wrong names; has anyone proofread the script!? any tense, emotional, or comical scene was almost, or entirely, destroyed be utterly confusing me or annoying me. i like to read the dialogue aloud to really get into the game, but that's impossible if i don't understand exactly what they're trying to say! furthermore, i feel stupid shouting broken English -- because it's a fighting scene -- because it's supposed to be intense and serious, but it can't be if what I'm saying is downright nonsensical! do you need me to fix your script for you? because holy crap was it bad!\n\nonto the subjective criticism.\nI. Hate. Violet. i absolutely loathe her. worst part is, i can't properly explain why. Maybe it's because i sympathise, am partial to (i.e like) and strongly prefer Daisy; maybe it's because Violet is the second reason that everything around Ashley, Daisy, Lushen and Green crumbles, the first reason being that Ashley is stupid. Maybe it's because her ideals do not align with mine; maybe it's simply that she reminds me of the psychopath Yandere herself, Yuri from DDLC. (though, i liked Yuri a lot more than Violet, i still wasn't fond of her) I don't know fully. I just know that i had a terrible time playing through her chapter. i could not bear seeing her destroying her's, Ashley's, and everyone else's lives because she has issues. nor could i bear the absolute heartbreak, desperation, and continuously -- and painfully -- sweet actions of Daisy. i also hate Ashley, simply because he's an absolute dumbass who constantly ruins his own life.\n\nwow, that took a while too. well, now for some general thoughts.\nthis game took me a long time to play; the longest of any VN so far. but don't let my profile fool you; i just kept forgetting to close the game when i needed to do other things (school, chores, etc.) so, it actually took me about 60 hours to play the game, not almost 77. granted, it still took me 11 days. it might take a normal person about 50 hours or less if they are going at a good speed.\n\nthis game's relationship with sexualization is weird. there is a scene where Ashley apologises to Daisy on the phone for seeing Don Mahone alone. after the call, the CG turns into a censored scene of Daisy touching herself. but, when you go to the gallery and find those CGs, they didn't censor it. i like not being in jail; why did you even draw that part of the CG? keep in mind, they are all 17 and under! worse, though, in chapter 4, after the pool party, in the ally, there is open talk about the troublemakers raping the three girls, including Sunny, who is FUCKING 14! still, in the epilogue for Daisy's route, they censored the word \"sex.\" really? characters have openly sworn, talked about masturbation and rape, and general sexualization, yet you censor the least harsh of these words? what?\n\nI've ran into a few weird bugs as well.\nthe episode descriptions of the Daisy chapter, are replaced by the Descriptions of Violets episodes. and, as I've said, the game crashed on me. Twice! once because i clicked the drop-down menu by accident, and again when i quick-saved. and, once, the script literally broke. the pool scene, Violet was supposed to say something, but instead i got the script code or something.\n255) 2Ime=8 200spine+true  \"[X] [X] path=\"(0--Ahh?\"\nthat's all i could decipher from the screenshot i took.\n\nwell, TL;DR, i both love and hate this game. it's insanely cheap, it's a great visual novel in almost every aspect, but the translation is garbage, Violet and Ashley are bad characters, the way the game uses sexualization is very inconsistent, and the game itself has broken on various occasions. it honestly took me getting to the end of this review to actually give it a rating, so you know i was going at it with the intention of rating it fairly.\n\n8/10, fuck you, Daisy's mine\nand, sorry that this is so long. i might just put this onto the community or something.", "timestamp_created": 1632451138, "timestamp_updated": 1632451138,

"review": "Honestly, if you're a native English speaker I don't recommend this. Most of the writing is nonsensical. Like listening to a drunk person tell a boring story.\n\nFor example: (main character, about male art teacher)  \n\"Although I hate that the people I don't hate hating me for guys I hate, I don't give a damn to whether he hate me or not.\"\n\n\nIt seems to take much longer than it should to read, because you are constantly having to reread sentences to try to make sense of them. It's hard to pay attention when the story is all over the place and only a few sentences make sense.\n\nI stopped reading the story after 12hrs of playtime and just started skipping it.\nThe story wasn't going anywhere - a teen boy from an abusive family secretly joins an art class. His parents find out, and threaten to make him leave his school and move back in with them - unless he can score high enough in an art exam.\nHe has two romance interests - his (female) childhood friend, and the cute girl in his art class.\nHe has two male friends, and sometimes the group looks after his classmate's little sister.\n\nThat's all that happens in the first 12hrs of playtime.\nAfter autoplaying and skipping, it still took an additional 12-13hrs to complete the game for all achievements.\nI think if you didn't skip, it would take weeks to read this story. Which would be fine if the story was worth reading.\n\n\nPros:\n- Good art, both the background art and the character art.\n\nCons:\n- The English is very bad. Most of the words are real words, but they don't make much sense together. It is hard to follow what is happening, and a lot of the dialogue doesn't make sense. I suspect the words sound more poetic in the original language.\n- There are all the usual issues with poor translation - typos, spelling mistakes, people being called by the wrong name, sentences which are ambiguous due to double negatives and/or mistakes between whether a word should be negative or affirmative.\n- Frequent flashbacks to abuse could be upsetting to some players.\n- Extremely tedious. The story does not make up for the bad writing, or the dialogue which is mainly filler and has no real importance.\n\nOther:\n- Amusingly, the school he attends is called \"The Second Normal Senior High School\".\n- For some reason the characters occasionally say \"whirr\" for no given reason. Clearly a mistranslation of some sort.\n- There's a distinct air of \"no homo\" after descriptions of male characters.\n\nHe talks a lot about the character \"Lucien\"... but I cannot figure out what he's trying to say about him, other than that Lucien is handsome-no-homo.\nLike, he is REALLY into Lucien's looks (no-homo).\nHe's a god (no-homo).\nHis smile is so sunny (no-homo).\nHe has a glorious smile (no-homo).\nHis hair is so fluffy (no-homo).", "timestamp_created": 1630275815, "timestamp_updated": 1630275815, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.79187464714050293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "98443770": {"recommendationid": "98443770", "author": {"steamid": "76561199065874257", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 71, "last_played": 1630240712}, "language": "english", "review": "I was very much looking forward to this VN when I first bought it.

This is a long game. The story is really dense and goes up to 5 chapters, each consisting of usually 5 episodes inside of them. You don't really make much choices in the game, but when you do it goes with the theme of the game:Drawing. Taking place in China, around 2004 there are 2 main heroines, Daisy your childhood friend and Violet, your deskmate in class that just transferred into the art class same as you. You gain a couple of friends along the way and they are pretty cool. The game really places them inside of the world. You as the main character have a very difficult time sorting out your feelings, because you've always suppressed them as a result of your parents' abusive rule. It's crazy, I'm talking desk throwing and glass shattering. Your goal is to try to figure out the \"color\" of your life. Very philosophical premise on what makes you, you. Now, I have 2 main problems with the game. It would be the English translation. Not going to lie to you, it is terrible. I had to stop and translate it myself in order to continue enjoying the story. Sometimes the translation per line got so bad I had to scroll up to see the context to understand what they were talking about. At one point near the end of the game the translation messed up so bad it switched around the names of everybody. Like one of the characters, Lucien was talking, but his name was replaced with his sister. At that point of the game though I was completely used to the translation errors and could figure out what was going on. I can forgive it because near the beginning they just mixed up hes and hers and threw a couple \"the\" when it wouldn't make sense. I can go on and on but you get what I mean by now. The second would be that the game really has no mercy for one of the heroines. Like holy shit man, she never gets a break. At the end of the game I was too tired to play the other route. Other than that, the story sucked me in for a while. For the sale price I got it at, it was really well done. The soundtrack is pretty good too and it's put at the right spots. The artwork is very well done and has a bunch of minor differences in terms of scenes like smiling, sad face, blushing and all that good stuff. I think the only reason why this game is sorta hidden and at such a low sale price would be purely because of the translation. I want to continue the story past the route I ended up on but that's not going to happen because that's the end of the game. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience!

The translation is simply terrible. Much of the text consists of idioms and literal word-for-word translation of the original language. I was able to get a sense of what was happening, but I feel I missed at least half of the potential impact this game is capable of delivering.\n\nAll else aside, Tricolour Lovestory is a bit of a hidden treasure and a rather intricate slice-of-life tale that packs an unexpected emotional punch. We are introduced to a protagonist who had suffered a lifetime of emotional, verbal, and physical abuse at the hands of his overbearing and controlling parents. The story begins with the MC recalling a fierce confrontation between himself and \"them\" where all ties his world outside the home are viciously torn away from him and burned before his eyes. An emergency at the factory where his father works forces \"them\" to move far across the country and leave the MC to fend for himself. We follow through his daily life as he explores the meaning of concepts previously foreign to him, such as love, friendship, loyalty, and freedom.\n\nThis is a very long visual novel. It takes its time with world building and developing its main and supporting characters in deep and meaningful plot-lines. Emotional struggles suffered by the actors seem genuine and in-line with character flaws and experiences set up during the story. I found myself cheering for the MC's victories and grieving his defeats and missteps. Though there are only two main routes, I did find the manner in which the routes are selected (drawing memories of the heroine on a sketch pad) to be clever and endearing. Truth be told, I found myself emotionally exhausted by the end of both routes -- but not in a bad way.", "timestamp_created": 1616636488, "timestamp_updated": 1616636488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670974433422088623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "89034013": {"recommendationid": "89034013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976787271", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1616785304}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good story so far", "timestamp_created": 1616634224, "timestamp_updated": 1616634224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88764554": {"recommendationid": "88764554", "author": {"steamid": "76561199120963230", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1616322954}, "language": "english", "review": "Daisy is really out of the world!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1616245305, "timestamp_updated": 1616245305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88541262": {"recommendationid": "88541262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198824181030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1653927914}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the story has something to do with art and sports, I am not really sure. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1615909757, "timestamp_updated": 1615914862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88215518": {"recommendationid": "88215518", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094537393", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1023, "last_played": 1617657749}, "language": "english", "review": "oh no wow", "timestamp_created": 1615418256, "timestamp_updated": 1615418256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526113152503967285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87763348": {"recommendationid": "87763348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250511092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1611734721}, "language": "english", "review": "\"SHE IGNORED ME FOR 8 TIMES\"\n\"'they' hitted me\"\nenglish bad, game funny\ngood purchase for funny time\nbig booba", "timestamp_created": 1614746843, "timestamp_updated": 1614746843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5226249098777771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87710893": {"recommendationid": "87710893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415003723", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1614667136}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible english traslation \n\nWanted to keep playing... but, man...!

The quality of this VN is pretty high and the story is decent. Nothing groundbreaking but a good read nevertheless, but only if you can stomach the meal the publisher served.\n\nIt is a fairly straightforward (no story twists really) romantic triangle with some drama and two happy endings. The choices leading to each ending are pretty obvious so charts required.\n\nCharacter sprites are good and there is a lot of them (emotion variation mainly). Decent number of nice CGs and backgrounds make the visual aspect pleasant. There are also opening movies for each chapter.\n\nThe number and variety of music tracks is satisfactory, but considering the length of this VN it could be better.

As long as you are a native English speaker, it's fairly easy to still grasp what's going on, even if there is a botched translation here and there. All the characters are very well done, and the voice acting and music really drew me into the story. Just know if you're looking for something super casual, this may not be it - I found it to be much more dramatic than the description led me to believe. Don't get me wrong, it's very cute at times, funny, and heartwarming. But I also found it to be heart-wrenching, heartbreaking, stressful, and unrelentingly tugging my heart strings in every direction. So if emotional roller coasters are your thing, hop on and give this one a ride. Only other minor complaint would be the length - it felt a bit overly long @ 40 hrs to finish one route.

To fully appreciate the game though, I believe its essential to know Chinese and a basic background of Chinese society, so you could get the references and jokes they made. ^-^\n\nComments:\nThis game have a very long common route Chapter 1-4, and only the last one is the route for one of two heroines. Even so, the 2 heroines are both active through out the game, which is unique imo, considering the other games I played where the routes split off early, and characters are basically isolated from each other.\nThe side characters are excellent, they all serve their purposes and makes the story more fulfilling and dynamic.\n\nEnjoy this game too !\nP.s.

I am an American who is going to university in China. I am quite lonely right now due to the Quarantine, and I was watching a lot of anime, and I decided to pick up a visual novel to help make me feel better. \n  I did not expect this game to be in Chinese, and I was quite skeptical when I saw its 2 dollar price tag, but I immediately bought it when I could see this being great Chinese practice for me. I then thought to myself \"is this game's quality *really* that good if it is 2 dollars?\" Now, having played through the game, I have been absolutely amazed at how great of a visual novel this is, there was obviously a lot of care put into this game.\n\n[h1]Story, Writing, and Length[/h1]\n\n  First, the meat of the game, the story and writing. The game follows a troubled main protagonist who gets caught in a love triangle between his Tsundere (or \u50b2\u5a07 in Chinese, hehe) childhood best friend who has an unrequited love towards him and a mysterious new girl who shares many similarities between the main character and has definitely caught his eye. The main story involves these three characters, but there are three additional side characters who make frequent appearances, and they are very well done as well. The characters are well fleshed out, and the story is expansive and displays many simple dialogues and situations between the main characters. The story has a wide expanse of both intense, emotional moments, and simple, slow, relaxed, day-to-day moments, which are both what really make a romance a romance, and they all contribute to get you really caring about the characters.\n  Furthermore, the story plants a lot of hints and foreshadowing throughout the story and leaves you guessing on a lot of subjects, but at the end everything is resolved, which is quite satisfying to say the least. I love stories that take you seriously and give you rewards of foreshadowing if you're paying attention. It's obvious the writers were taking this game seriously when writing.\n  The love triangle between the two girls is also really well done. The girls are, as I stated before, very well developed throughout the game. At the start of the game I was dead-set on going for \u58a8\u5c0f\u83ca(Daisy), the childhood friend, and did not really expect to change my opinion on the matter as I played, but even as Daisy's Character was developed really well, \u6587\u82b7(Violet) was developed just as well. By the end of my of episode 4 when I had to choose between the two, I was actually really sad to have to let \u6587\u82b7 go, although then the game does a great job to make everything have a good ending, and overall just does a great job. It was definitely a riveting love story that was very focused on the romance, as this game is really not that lewd at all. The lewd jokes are very, [i]very[/i], few and far between. Not that I don't appreciate a few of them here and there, which they do have.\n  The game's story is also incredibly long, I started off in Chinese and it took me about 5 hours just to finish the prologue, to which then I began to play in English and finished it in 45 minutes of a lot of skipping due to already having read it. The chapters I read after that, which were all in English, took about 2 hours a piece, even if I was going fast, and my English level, as I assume most of you all reading this' English levels are, is pretty high, so I read fairly quickly. Each Episode has 5 Chapters and each chapter is about (about being a key word here) 2 hours long, sometimes more, sometimes less, so each episode takes about 10 hours to thoroughly read, which is pretty good for a game that costs only 2 dollars.\n\n[h1]Voice Acting and Chinese[/h1]\n\n  I was extremely satisfied with the fact that this game is Chinese. Now that I've played through this game, I'm a bit disappointed that I don't I'll be able to find any other Chinese visual novels (if any of you reading this know of one, please let me know). The Voice actors for all the characters do their parts really well. I thought that every single one of them did an amazing job reflecting the personalities of their characters, and it proved to be spectacular Chinese listening practice for me. \n  Onto the Chinese part, for those of you interested in that. There is an option in game to save certain lines to hear them later, and I used this function to save any line that caught my eye, it allowed me to go back and listen and practice even more. If you are learning or interested in learning Chinese, I absolutely recommend this game to you. There is plenty of common, simple Chinese phrases as well as complicated as hell sentences, so it's good for learners of any level. I'd also like to mention the Chinese version of the game is in simplified Chinese (THANK GOD), so it is great practice for anybody who wants to practice their simplified character knowledge. It is so rare to find a Chinese game in the Western market that has simplified characters rather than traditional, it is a blessing this game is like this, I really want more like this.\n\n[h1]Music and Art Style[/h1]\n\n  One of my favorite parts of this game by far is its soundtrack. The music in this game, at least coming from someone who isn't the greatest music connoisseur, is spectacular. Whether it's just the normal, slice-of-life scene music, the awkward, comedic music, or [i]especially[/i] the emotional, romantic music, it's all amazing, and I just can't get it out of my head. I really wish I could find the theme song of this game, Tricolour Heartbeat, on the internet. I found that song to be absolutely riveting to listen to. At the very least there is an option in-game to listen to the music, so I use that whenever I want to hear it, but the version on the music player is not the full version of Tricolour heartbeat, which disappointed me a bit.\nI really liked the art style of this game as well. It's in the standard anime art-style, but I found the way that the colored in the characters and most of all their eyes really made the style stand out from other drawings of the same type. I really loved the CG's, especially the cutesy ones, and overall was satisfied with the design in general.\n\n- My review is too long so I am going to make a comment finishing it up", "timestamp_created": 1586092558, "timestamp_updated": 1586092558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797067940235137939", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66598495": {"recommendationid": "66598495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821811068", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 716, "last_played": 1586316828}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice game\n", "timestamp_created": 1586013447, "timestamp_updated": 1586013447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66148122": {"recommendationid": "66148122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269030767", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1622437928}, "language": "english", "review": "nice story", "timestamp_created": 1585558489, "timestamp_updated": 1585558489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65588701": {"recommendationid": "65588701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329420098", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 666, "last_played": 1604323274}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is great, the price is great, the characters are well developed.

Even when selecting the Daisy route, the fact that \"Ashley\" is still so hung up about BHM causes one to regurgitate. All \"Ashley\" thinks about are those big jugs. The one good thing that happened is when he got in a fight with Green when he was about to kiss Ashley's girlfriend.

Ashley was finally paying more attention to his childhood sweetheart and spending more time with her. Still can't help feeling annoyed that Violet is brought up so many times in their conversations but it was much better than the first 40+ hours of the story.  Love how at the end, he calls Daisy \"my Daisy\". That was really sweet. I really liked this last chapter, as for Violet's route... it will remain locked.

Im not that fan of chinese voice acting, tho i got used to it later in the game. Thats just my opinion tho. The subtitles are not that good either, because the english is not that good, but you can still understand whats going on at all times. And the last thing is, near to the end of the game. There the main character kinda fucked me up, because i already made clear which \"way\" i wanted to go and he still remained kind of \"unaware\" of his own feelings. But thats about it. The Rest of the game was insanly good. The story was never boring, but exciting at all times and i loved one of the two girls you can choose between. -> Daisy! <3 The happy end you get, when you finish Daisy's route was freaking wonderful.

And it subverted my expectations.  Not in the way TLJ did, i.e., by being inconsistent, but by peeling away layers of a person until you reach their core.  I can say that the heroine I was less interested in at first - no contest - became the one I was much more emotionally attached to in the end.\n\nThe strongest theme is under what circumstances should one live for one's self, and under what circumstances should one sacrifice for the sake of others.  The VN explores this theme with different events from different perspectives, and it doesn't give you the answers.  Both options have consequences.  I think it demonstrates the meaning of sacrifice, which is giving up something good for something better.  But which is good and which is better?  Not easy choices.\n\nThe bad:\n     1. Terrible English translation, probably machine-translated\n     2. It is too long in places; the protagonist keeps making the same choices over and over and you are along for the ride\n     3. The four player choices don't lead to 16 endings; it's the same story with a choice of two endings in the final chapter.\n\nThe good:\n     1. It was heart-wrenching until the resolutions, enough to make a grown man cry.  Characters you care about get hurt.\n     2. The voice acting from the cast - especially the two heroines - was excellent, even if not in English.\n     3. The main characters were well-developed and you get to know and understand them more as the story progresses.\n     4.

The English translation is horrible. Yes, you can understand the meaning and you can get used to it to certain extent. But in a game where reading is all you do, this is inexcusable and it's the main problem with the game for me. For example, the auto page turning is a great feature if you want to eat or something while reading, and you can adjust the speed to your needs. However, you would need to have a reading speed close to a constant value, which is not the case, when every now and then you have to read a sentence three times to understand what it says. Also, due to the poor translation, humorous or emotional moments can be wasted sometimes. Also, even when you understand what you read, it is often served with an unnaturally formal or otherwise not suitable language. Also, there are times when the names of the two main heroines are mixed (probably only in English version), which can be confusing. ...And there is this thing, where they probably wanted to change the spelling of a name of one of the characters, but they were so careless that every word that had had this name as a substring is now misspelled. \"Replace All\" FTW.\n2. Also the game is ecchi at times (yes, I know it's a Japanese term and the game is Chinese) and that would be fine. One thing that bothers me though is that one of the characters is a (supposedly) 15 year old girl who behaves and is voiced as if she was 5. The combination of the two is where the problem occurs.

The best way I can describe Tricolour Lovestory is this: it's a VN that has some things going for it, but ultimately is just a predictable story with an awful translation.\n\nYes, I understand that it's a Chinese VN but the fact that it was released like this is unacceptable in my opinion. I could understand if there was a mistake here and there, but there are spelling errors and grammar mistakes throughout the entire game and because of it, not only does it make the story confusing at times, but it can really bog down the pacing and enjoyment. The developers desperately needed a proper translator. I've read several reviews where people offered to help them fix it and from what they've said, they didn't want anyone to do so. I guess they're content with having this awful translation in their game.\n\nOther than that, the story is really predictable and all of the characters (including side characters) are kind of forgettable and lackluster. The only character I even remotely cared about was Violet but even she couldn't save this VN. Daisy was alright, but I found her route to be weaker compared to Violet's.\n\nThe only redeeming qualities for me were two things: the OST and the artwork. That's it. But those things don't make a good VN; the story needs to come first. I really wanted to like this VN but couldn't. It had an interesting story but the way it was written was just not executed well in my opinion.\n\nSure, you might get a lot for only $2, but it isn't always about the money, but the enjoyment you get from that experience. I can safely say that after playing for over 43 hours, this VN is not worth playing.

It is also one of the BEST chinese long-drama VN you can find on Steam. The price honestly is too cheap for the amount of content this game have, it worth much more comparing to other VNs on Steam. The game have only two routes of the main girls you can persuade but unlike other VNs it is not based on character interaction, you just get to choose after completing a chapter of the story and based on your overall final chapters choices you unlock the path of one of the two story chapter endings to the story's conclusion.\n\nThe story is long and divided into chapters, each chapter is also divided into episodes which is based on in-game days. Anyway, the story is very well written, heartwarming, hilarious, suspenseful, and yet relatable as you played through with many plots and drama and strong character development, it may feel generic and clicheic at first but it is very unique and mature which you can understand.\n\nVisually the game is superb, the voice acting is top-notch and also the soundtrack have a very strong emotional and relaxing impact.\n\nThe only bad thing is the game feels ''kinda'' unfinished, there are some bugs like unmatched voice acting and scripts at final chapters and the translation is pretty bad but you can follow up to finish the story, at least is a good tranlastion from native chinese.\n\nOverall it is a very good top quality VN especially if you're interested in romance stories of high-school or just to escape reality. It also have sidestories DLC but I suggest to read them after you finish the main story.", "timestamp_created": 1548205569, "timestamp_updated": 1548205569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599890053272247314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48436774": {"recommendationid": "48436774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165332963", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 659, "last_played": 1548069156}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute <3", "timestamp_created": 1547972249, "timestamp_updated": 1547972249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48392365": {"recommendationid": "48392365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385356065", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 231, "last_played": 1525186609}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1547770929, "timestamp_updated": 1547770929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48352786": {"recommendationid": "48352786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371621200", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1564631589}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me just say, I loved Tricolour Lovestory. It is definitely one of my favorite visual novels. The graphics, voice acting, and soundtracks were outstanding. Not to mention that it probably has one of the best UIs that I've ever seen. What's more, I really can't believe the price for this game is 1.99 without any sales. The value of this game is worth so much more. Not only does it gives 70 achievements which are easy to get as you progress through the story, but the quality of this visual novel was beyond what I expected. The story was honestly heartwarming, hilarious, suspenseful, and relatable as I played through. I think what I really enjoyed about this visual novel was the fact that it was hard choosing between Wen Zhi and Mo Xiaoju. Even though I did prefer Wen Zhi more, it was hard to also not choose Mo Xiaoju.  As for the downsides, the only one would be that sometimes the English subtitles are a bit weird. Even then, the subtitles are still understandable, especially if you can understand mandarin like I can. Overall, this is a spectacular visual novel, and it's truly worth the bang for your buck.

Unlike the Telltale series of games you do not get to make many choices in the game overall, the game itself is a visual experience, but the few choices you do make will take you down the path of one of the two story endings to the story's conclusion. Because this game is primarily a visual experience, it may not be for people who desire more interaction with visual novels. \n\nOverall the story is wonderful. It is well written and the animations of the characters, the locations, and the time shifts all fit the theme of the story. These things have the feel of even being a character in and of itself among the supporting cast. The soundtrack is beautiful and wonderfully done - with the songs changing to fit specific story beats as a wonderful overall compliment to the entire experience. \n\nThe only drawback to the game for an English reading audience is the translations from the native Chinese to English are very poor. In some places it seems as if  an automated program did the translations and in others it seems as if someone who was not a native English speaker did their best.  But the translations are good enough to follow the story and, to pun, nothing serious seems lost in translation.\n\nLastly, the additional content for the story, via DLC, is a wonderful compliment to the overall experience. But I recommend viewing the sidestories after one finishes the main story. \n\nIf you like visual novels or even just a really good romance story, this is a worthwhile experience.

But I was proven wrong, very wrong. After completing both Daisy and Violet's route in about 60-ish hours, I can say that this is probably one of the BEST Chinese made visual novels you can get your hands on for a relatively cheaper price to the Japanese counterparts.\n\nQuality-wise, the game does feel a bit \"unfinished\" since there are a lot grammar and vocabulary mistakes within the English version of the script. Some of which don't even match what the characters say in Mandarin. In some scenes, the script and the voice acting doesn't even match at all, which I do believe is a bug. Despite the flaws, visually this game is very top quality with it's character art style and auditorily, has a very beautiful and relaxing soundtrack to listen to. Not to mention, the Chinese voice acting is also very top notch.\n\nThe story plot is pretty well written and executed with very good character development. However, it does feel a bit generic and cliche like literally every school/drama anime TV shows. In terms of picking routes, there isn't much option around other than the 3 sketch book scenes. If you choose the picture of Daisy, you'll proceed down that route and vice versa for the final chapter.\n\nPros:\n- Visually stunning\n- High quality voice acting\n- Great and relaxing OST\n- Great character development\n- A very cheap price tag for the amount of content given\n- Easy to gain Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Vocabulary and grammar issues throughout the English verison of the game, which I do believe it was translated by a English Second Language (ESL) student.\n- Somewhat \"unfinished\" with a few bugs relating to unmatched voice acting and scripts, most notably in some scenes in Chapter 4.\n- Lack of \"route choosing options\" within the game. The only major decision you make is literally the 3 scenes with the sketch book.\n\nOverall, I would give this game an 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1542934633, "timestamp_updated": 1542947280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765418887138366699", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46441177": {"recommendationid": "46441177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092396476", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1527407540}, "language": "english", "review": "\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1542917208, "timestamp_updated": 1542917208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492476075887680054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46421274": {"recommendationid": "46421274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031944104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 813, "last_played": 1542960734}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story and artwork", "timestamp_created": 1542912852, "timestamp_updated": 1542912852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492476075887680054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46372802": {"recommendationid": "46372802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193365605", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1550000105}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good \nAm I a fragile man if I play that game?\n", "timestamp_created": 1542904327, "timestamp_updated": 1542904327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492476075887680054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46344144": {"recommendationid": "46344144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029828885", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1924, "last_played": 1594227960}, "language": "english", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1542899925, "timestamp_updated": 1542899925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492476075887680054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "46206211": {"recommendationid": "46206211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063150931", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 569, "last_played": 1535202064}, "language": "english", "review": "Time flies and never comes back.

Unfortunately his parents doesn't like the idea and after a series of unfortunate events and conflicts, his relationship with his best friend Daisy Mo got strained. At the start of 2nd year, his parents are away and he took this chance to rebel, he attend the Fine Arts class. From there he meets Violet Wen, a new talented transfer student. From there the story proceeds as the three main characters sturggling in their relationships.\n\nNow, the game itself have AMAZING visuals, no doubt about it. They're all pretty, colorful backgrounds. The characters are very well drawn and expressive,  the chibis are cute as heck. Nothing much to say about this. Transition between days and some small animation are pretty nice touch\n\nSoundtracks are nice, the atmosphere and vibes are on point and gives you the right feeling. I never found myself getting bored with it. The OP song is sung in Chinese, it feels awkward at first since i don't really listen to Chinese music (i like their traditional music though) but it grows on me and i'm loving it now.\n\nCharacters are seemingly well written, and pretty funny too at times. But i can't comprehend what are they on about at times because of the weird translation. Though i find Ashley to be a bit irritating since he always got depressed (Like hell, cheer up man), but then that's probably his trait so i can't really say much. And it's kinda weird that they're all refering to each other with full names, i mean they are friends right? Maybe it's a Chinese thing, but in that case they should've used their original name (Wen Zhi, Mo Xiaoju, Luo Ye etc.). I can't say much about Voice Acting because it's Chinese and i'm not familiar with it, but it grows on me so i'm not having problems with it, At times it was really captures the moment though and it's really great.\n\nThe story itself is pretty simple if we look at it, it's a struggle of Ashley Chiu to find his 'calling' and his so called 'grey' life while dealing with his relationship with his 2 friends Violet and Daisy (which are represented by their own colors, in case you didn't realize until now, , the triangle in the title logo represents three of them). But what makes it great are the factors that leads to their struggle and the story takes place in a Chinese society, something we don't see everyday. We can see some culture in it, I mean look at the school system, it looks really stressful and full of hardwork, no wonder the streotypcal Asian Smartasses exists. Some joke reference to the boys are the future of China and Communism, and of course, some case of tiger parenting.\n\nOverall, the only major bad thing is probably the translation, if they have a good translation then maybe we can learn and understand the characters and story more. And the price of the VN is sooooo cheap despite being great.\n\n7/10, i would love to see more of this. the score would be higher if the translation is good, and honestly i think this VN deserves more

I got to say that how the game developed and trascendenced a clich\u00e9d genre such as slice of life/romance shit, ended up making me cry a few times xD.\n\nThe music goes pretty well with every aspect of the game and each scene is conjugated with a terrific soundtrack that comes to disolve the tension, happiness or sadness vibes that this game gives.\n\nTherefore the only thing I can criticize is the awfull translation into english. Even someone who is not a native english speaker (ME) can realize the mistakes in some paragraphs, if you have some common knowledge of chinese you can realize how they mess up things like the pronouns (considering the he/she his/her pronouns in chinese are neutral and it doesn't refer to a specifc genre unless you clarify it and is a thing that the game does) therfore making it \"his\" when refering to a female or viceversa. It only makes me realize that the translation was done by machine on some google translate bullsht or the translator was very inexperienced. Some parts are not even taken into consideration leaving a vague translation into english while a character speaks and speaks therefore not matching what the text says.\n\nIn conclusion I believe the game is beautiful and should be bought by any visual novel fan. The faults in translation doesn't make it unplayable and of course you will understand what a paragraph is trying to say.

Didn't know what to expect of this one besides a love story at first.\nUnlike some other visual novels, this one won't be completed in a night becaase it is quite extensive in its story. It does not rush to the conclusion, but rather engages in several conversations per chapter. One day at school and the evening may take 1/2 hour alone to get through the story. Some may think that tedious, but this is a story being told so I am encouraged to see the emotions and reactions of all parties considered before it moves on to the next \"drama\" I have not completed this  \"game\" yet as I am several hours in and stilll not near the conclusion. \n\nOne warning I will give is that the English translation is tedious to understand at times, so you will have to wink at that once in a while and just try to catch whatever original meaning was there. A \"pinky swear\" is \"make a hook with me\" for instance and one title you will see often says \"lazily the sun shines.\" Hey for the amount of dialog here, it would take a while for someone to go through fixing it all up perfect so maybe an update one day? Until then, either learn Chinese or put up with it. I'm doing ok and have a good laugh once in a while too.\n\nIt took me about the first hour of it to get into the story and now I want to see how it all ends.

It is the best visual novel so far... Let's start with the negative point, the english subtitles. Although there are a lot of mistakes, if you have an average english level you can easily comprehend and follow the story. In my view, this is the only negative point of the game, so let's talk about the positives.\n\nA lot of visual novels here in Steam take about 5 hours to complete, what makes you don't feel connected with the characters and the game, beacause you don't have time for it, you barely started playing and it is already over. This game is different, I have finished it in 53 hours... I know it seems a lot, but you don't sense the time passing and in the end you wish you could play more 100 hours of the game. All this time playing and being immersed in the story made me feel very attached with the characters and develop feelings for them, it really changes your experience.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous, I loved the style of the drawings, the scenarios and the detailing. The facial expressions of the characters fit exactly in the kind of discussion and situation you are on. They don't keep the same expression during the hole dialogue, they flow according to it.\n\nThe soundtrack is perfect, wonderful... It improves A LOT the gameplay/reading, the sad music can bring you down in the bad moments of the story, as like as the happy ones can makes you feel relieved after moments of tension (by the way, there are some tense music also). Since I'm talking about the audio now, I feel that I must speak something about the voice dubbing. It is quite good, I think I couldn't spend 53 hours just reading without hearing a voice or just hearing generic phrases repeatedly as how it occurs in other visual novels, in this game all the dialogues are completely dubbed (except Ashley's). Although I don't understand chinese, is good to hear the dubbing.\n\nAnd the high point, the plot... It is not an usual visual novel plot which impossible and nonsense things happen in the story (saving some facts in the last two chapters). This plot could be someone's life, it is not a fanciful and fictional plot. It was another reason to make me feel connected with the game, because i felt that it could be me in the role of the protagonist. Even being not fictional, the story is always changing and passing through turnarounds, what plays with your feelings... Playing this game I got happy, deeply sad, hopeless, angry and experienced various feelings many times.\n\nSumming up, bringing all this points together, it was the game/visual novel which most touched me and played with my feelings. It is veeeeery moving! I've never felt this way playing something, it is surely a special visual novel and a great story. I loved playing it and didn't want to finish it hahaha. I recomend the game for everyone and wish that you have a beautiful experience!", "timestamp_created": 1528860986, "timestamp_updated": 1528944549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850523233413696289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42669316": {"recommendationid": "42669316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261754510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3013, "last_played": 1545718530}, "language": "english", "review": "getting past the translation, this manages to shoot me in the gut way too many times throughout the story, there are your funny moments here and there but primarily this VN focuses on \"freedom\" and Art, and how Ashley, the protangonist achieves that throughout the story, the story is fantastic at what it tries to tell and managed to make me take a break, calm down and continue to read further ahead, another thing this VN did to me was make me feel genuine pain as the later parts of the story as it gets really feels heavy in both pathes, again the problem is that the translation really sucks and its a shame because underneath its really good, oh and the OST is great, bought the vocal album and the ost, oddly it was worth more then the game..", "timestamp_created": 1528786217, "timestamp_updated": 1533276180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42446615": {"recommendationid": "42446615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157922444", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 9238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3308, "last_played": 1643356777}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is just well done, i hope that this game can fix several issues like the English grammar and various of missing text but overall i would recommend this visual novel. ps. the music is fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1527944704, "timestamp_updated": 1637952198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42303763": {"recommendationid": "42303763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083404359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 786, "last_played": 1624634047}, "language": "english", "review": "Give me some contents to imagine about when im not doing anything.\nSolid chinese voice acting.\nGreat soundtrack.\nWill dig for more chinese visual novel in future.", "timestamp_created": 1527410455, "timestamp_updated": 1527430780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42274638": {"recommendationid": "42274638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009620313", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3022, "last_played": 1591390340}, "language": "english", "review": "well... finally..

The feelings of the characters feel real and their whole situation is very touching and moving. This is rare. Romance in this novel is not cheap and easy it's gritty and true.\nHowever in this you can also find some weaknesses. \nI have read almost every word of the 5 chapters for both choices, yet i found myself skipping text at the end. The reason for this is that the story focuses intensely on the hardship of relationship of the 3 main characters. This in itself would not be a problem, as the feelings between the chracters are described beautifully, the real problem are the external circumstances of the story. The whole setting is used to put more pressure on the romance. This is overdone in my opinion. There is enough drama in the topic of a 3 sided lovestory. Do you really also need bullying that exceeds physical abuse, parents that treat their children like slaves, confuse ultimatums, oppresive teachers, indecisive characters that can't figure out what they want to do after hours and hours of soul-searching? In my opinion you don't, and this waters the great core of the story down a lot. As a result the final endings also leave a lot to be desired.\nIn part this is a regional problem. Society and child-parent-relationships are in general not that unforgiving and harsh in western countires. Also drama is a very big thing in asian entertainment. However, as said, i think there was enough substance for a great novel in the realtionship between the 3 main characters. I wish they would have focused a little bit more on that.\n\nThat aside (as well as the awful translation) it still was a very good and moving read and i would still recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1524316459, "timestamp_updated": 1524867975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608648061752319336", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41560689": {"recommendationid": "41560689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355631366", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1577583190}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, seems good, visuals are nice, UI is also nice, I'd say this is a good VN for its cheap price. but the thing that bugs me is, this game isn't japanese.

It doesn't require the player to interact at all during the chapters, but they need make some decisions that will determine the direction of the story. It's mostly reading basically and each episode takes at least 1h if you set the game to automatic progression(It's annoying to keep clicking after a while, trust me).\n\n[b] [u] Characters [/u] [/b]\nEach one of the characters is written well, and the game actually takes the time revealing the problems around each one of the characters. You end up getting attached to the characters by the end of the story(also because the story is long per se and so after a while of reading you feel really immersed in the story). I feel like there's nothing to complain about them\n\n[b] [u] Artwork&Music [/u] [/b]\nWhat really attracted me of this game at first were the visuals: they're well detailed and you get to see most of the enviroments in 3 different ways: during the day, during the sunset and during the night. There's enough enviroment to make you imagine how's the city the story is set in.\nThe soundtrack is awesome, I even bought the OST as I love the different soundtracks used in the different situations and the actual songs used in the opening and in the endings.\n\n[b] [u] Other Pros [/u] [/b]\nYou can view the CGs in the gallery, listen to the soundtracks, watch the ending videos again, view the characters in the different poses and outfits in the game over backrounds as if you were creating situations.\nThere's also a really nice sidestory placed in the game for 2 more CGs and for some really good laughs \n\n[b] [u] Cons [/u] [/b]\n1. First of all, everyone here must have mentioned it already, but the english translation is really poor and from what I've read after all this time they still refuse to update it. You get used to this sloppy English after reading for a while and get what's actually meant, but it's still annoying.\n\n2. Incoherent mechanic. As I mentioned before, you need to face decisions to determine the direction of the story, and that's still true but there's a problem: The game asks you to make those decisions chapter by chapter but by the point the story is ready to diverge into the route it will actually ask you to review your decisions and this is enough to change the switch the route. This is plain stupid and doesn't make sense, in fact whatever you did to get into the route you were trying to get into is denied in the instant you decide to switch route with no lingering effect whatsoever.\n\n3. Poor story writing in a particular route. I won't say too much about this as it's a spoiler, but I'll tell that the story looks more fluent and natural in one route, while the other feels like an artificious route that makes no sense and has thrown drama in it for no apparent reason.\n\n4. The achievements spoil some things, especially towards the end. The description of the achievements almost gives away what actually happens in that situation and I personally think that leaving a plain ???????????? would have been enough there.\n\n5. Half-baked characters gallery. I actually love this feature as you can place the characters in different pose and outfit in different situations but I personally feel that it's half baked as it has the great potential of giving the player the ability of create situations on their own but doesn't give a hide the tabs option or an option to save the screen, or even to place multiple characters on screen, which is a shame.\n\n[h1] Conclusions [/h1]\nDespite all I've said, it's actually an awesome story that's worth reading, I feel like it's worth more than that but needs to be fixed in various parts.

It seems more like a poorly developed anime than a game. The story-line is not rich, either. \nThe characterization is superficial and cliche.

First off, to get some shit out of the way; yes, the game is considerably lengthy and the English translation isn't perfect by any means. I personally didn't mind it. Alrighty, now then, I'd like to extend my congratulations to this game, as it's easily made my top three favorite visual novels. In my 30+ hours of gameplay(overtaking my playthrough of \"If My Heart Had Wings\", which is my number one favorite), I learned some crucial things that I'm still digesting. There are parents that don't deserve to be parents. Yup, this just got heavy. Whether by accident, regretting at the last second/unpreparedness, pure incapability, or whatever; parenting, and subsequently children, can be complicated. However, when a child of fucked up parents succeeds and comes out in the end as a good person, that proves that there's hope and that is truly admirable. Second thing: traditional Chinese culture, or at least the extent that's presented here, is fucked. Authority figures are super strict, and there's a lot of sexism. China ain't the most liberal of all places, but I just kept thinking \"sheesh, it's certain lovable characters against the world\". Third thing, the biggest thing: love can be a real bitch. Not unheard of that love remains one of the most complex, mysterious, and powerful concepts ever experienced by mankind. It's in scenarios like the one throughout the game that conveys just how confusing, unpredictable, and even damaging it can really be. Whatever people say, love will probably never be understood entirely, but it's glimpses of personal accounts that can act as pieces to solving its puzzle. In addition to being given more things to contemplate yet again, the features and aspects of the game stand out individually. The soundtrack, though shorter than what I'm used to, makes a stunning impact. Every transition, cutscene breaks in between chapters, and videos at the beginning and end are absolutely wonderful. The other thing worth mentioning is the implementation of bookmarks. They are super convenient, in case you forgot to save or reach the point where you want to switch routes(full version of the game is available as of the latest update, if I remember correctly). I can really appreciate games like these, because they end up being my favorites, despite lacking patches for adult content. I'm kidding, in all seriousness, if the amount of content and its nature can entertain consistently, then it's no wonder that this game does what it's suppossed to do, and so well, I might add. Those are the ones people are looking for and that should represent the genre.

Ashley grew up together with his childhood friend, neighbour and middle school classmate Daisy Mo/Mo Xiaoju\uff08\u58a8\u5c0f\u83ca\uff09and a fellow middle school classmate and good friend Green Luo/Luo Yan\uff08\u9a86\u884d\uff09 where they both currently attend the same school as Ashley at a neighbouring class.\n\nAt Ashley's arts class, he is introduced to his class president Lucien Chih/Chi Yao \uff08\u8fdf\u8000\uff09, a fellow transfer student Violet Wen/Wen Zhi \uff08\u6587\u82b7\uff09, his teachers Ms. Ding \uff08\u4e01\u8001\u5e08\uff09and Mr. Chu/Zhu Te \uff08\u6731\u7279\uff09. Ashley's parents have never supported Ashley's ambition to practice his drawing or to pursue studies in an arts class and his transfer to the arts class was being done in secret with the support of Daisy's father Mr. Mo \uff08\u58a8\u53d4\uff09who regards Ashley as a godson. Lucien knew of Ashley's artwork pieces designing class posters during his first year at the school and assigned him a task to design the class posters for all 9 second-year classes at his school in time for the school's open house festival in return for helping to pull some strings to delay the school from checking with his parents to confirm if his enrolment and transfer had their consent. At the festival, Ashley was also introduced to Lucien's younger sister Sunny Chih/Chi Guo\uff08\u8fdf\u83d3\uff09.\n\nAshley would form strong friendships with Daisy, Violet, Lucien, Green and Sunny as Ashley comes to terms with his own weaknesses and insecurities due to pressure from his parents and his arts teacher Mr. Chu. Ashley would realize his life as the grey side would require the mutual love, understanding and support from his best friends Daisy as the orange side and Violet as the purple side in order for his artwork quality to improve and meet the expectations set by his teachers and parents. Along the way, Ashley and his friends would encounter a few additional supporting characters and antagonists. Ashley would also draw either a picture of Daisy or Violet after a noteworthy event in his life.\n\nAfter spending nearly 50 hours to read and listen through 4 chapters, 2 romance routes with Daisy and Violet in chapter 5, a free sidestory Winter War and a paid DLC Chapter Zero in the Chinese version of this game, I decided to give this game a score of 9/10(8/10 in English version) based on the following factors\uff1a\n\nPlot and character backgrounds: The story and plot is written as a school life drama with romance, parody, tragedy, comedy and fan service. As a school life drama with romance, this visual novel describes many challenges and difficulties students face as well as many aspects of human interaction as Ashley form friendships with each main character, encounter hardship, challenges and conflict and resolve them together as a team while also developing strong feelings of love with Daisy and Violet which would lead them to discover something special themselves and unlock their full potential while also leading to many sad and difficult moments as misunderstandings and tensions also frequently appear.\n\nEach main character in this visual novel has their own unique background, behaviour and relationship to the protagonist. With the long length of this visual novel, the scriptwriter has done an excellent masterpiece in creating a detailed background of the protagonist, Daisy and Violet with interesting plot hooks at the end of every chapter with plenty of different significant life events and emotional moments over the course of several months throughout the story. Unfortunately, there are also many errors in the English version of this game where I have to give it a lower score for those who are playing it in English. There are considerably fewer errors in the Chinese version although there are still a few errors between the displayed text and the voiced dialogue during the earlier chapters.\n\nArtwork, backgrounds and CGs: The background art, CGs, opening and ending themes, Steam trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile backgrounds in the game are top-notch. There are plenty of CGs showing small movements and facial expressions. The background scenes have sufficient variety where different places will show the place during the morning, afternoon and night with weather effects. The school will display red banners during the school's open house festival while Ashley's apartment may show the television being turned on. These minor details in the background art show a lot of attention and hard work has been placed into making the visual novel dynamic, believable and interesting. The opening theme does well in introducing the cast of characters featured in this visual novel, while the ending theme will feature an animated slideshow of different CGs depending on the ending obtained, each with a different song with vocals. The only complaint I have is that the character sprite for Violet Wen is almost laughable as being unrealistic and there are a few reviews which mention this part.\n\nVoice acting and background music: The voice acting, background music and soundtracks are top-notch. The tone and pace of delivery from all the voice actors and actresses in this game are top-notch in matching each line of spoken dialogue in the game. Whether to make fun of a character, to admonish or to chide a character, to express apologies, scoff at or rebuff someone, to mutter something very softly, cry outright, show feelings of love, friendship or to make a punch line grab the attention of the listener; the voice acting was excellent. The background music is also pleasant and appropriate to match  the multitude of emotional moments in the game with great theme songs in the opening and ending movies. \n\nMy favourite song with vocals is Tricolour Lovestory\uff08\u4e09\u8272\u7ed8\u604b\uff09 that is played during the opening movie and at the end of chapter 2. My favourite BGM is Resolute\uff08\u51b3\u5fc3\uff09 that is played during many appropriate segments towards the last few episodes during each chapter and near the last part in Winter War sidestory. The soundtrack DLC only has the shortened version of the song Tricolour Lovestory instead of the full version while there are a few BGM and song with vocals in the Daisy route and Winter War sidestory that are not included with the soundtrack DLC. The Perfect Vocal album DLC is a great complement to the soundtrack DLC by having 7 song with vocals which include the full version of the song Tricolour Lovestory.\n\nOverall, this visual novel is highly recommended with soundtrack and Perfect Vocal DLC for anyone looking for an excellent visual novel as a school life drama with romance, comedy, tragedy, fan service and parody in the form of brand spoofing on a few large brands in modern China with a few minor faults here and there for those who can read Chinese or don't mind many errors in the English version. The Chapter Zero and Cosplay Album DLC are recommended at discount only for those who like the story enough to support the game and developers or to qualify for the free visual novel key promotions by

I get it sounds weird or different but the chinese VA sounds and synics in fluidly with the scenes and setting. As exaggerations and off pitched and toned moments are directed in a subtle and appropriate manner compared to other vns where it feels a bit too forced. Now the Music score is wholly splendid as it is use harmonically to between to characters in a calm but bright scene and heavy and rapid in high tension setting. Heck if you want a soundtrack stay calm and drink tea, coffee or wine to this soundtrack is melodic enough to fit the mood. Now the characters are quite diverse enough to watch as they have their flaws and shines in thier personalities. The protagonist Ashley is not some guy who would get first place in a mediocrity contest or is some ultra nice guy or a cardboard cut out shaped guy that somehow has some significance at school. He is someone with insecuries and problem with getting himself somewhere in life as his past led to the current him. If I was to say what he is realistically he would be that guy who only knew and felt getting belt beaten by his parents and see his efforts and achievements burn right infront of him while trying to escape in the most miniscale way realistically. But he is competent enough to get something done when it needs to be. Aside from that your heroines are a cold but aloof and shy rich girl and a energetic, big mouthed and harsh childhood friend with a complicated  realationship. The art is cool and vibrant on its settings and props while the characters are drawn distinctively with emotion and detail to thier body and face to express their mood.

Joder yo soy bien puto para poder llorar pero este juego me saco unas cuantas lagrimas masculinas de macho espalda plateada jajaja. \n\nSolo queda decir historia aunque algo cliche sabe atrapar le doy 9.5/10, traducccion 5/10 y es mucho pedir, Ambientacion 9/10 Apartado Tecnico 8/10 tiene algunos errores en unos dialogos y voces que no se reproducen. Denle una oportunidad hagan a un lado la pobre traduccion al Ingles y que no este en Espa\u00f1ol, pero joder si nunca han jugado novelas visuales que solamante estan traduccidas al ingle y a veces de una pobre manera, no son el tipo de gente que juegan Visual Novels.\n\nUna ultima cosa Violet Best Waifu duela a quien le dueal bueno a Daisy le dolio jajaja, Spoiler Alert: Disfrute mucho la parte de vivir junto a Violet no se me parecio jodidamente cautivador esa experiencia digamen cursi si quieren, pero mierda gue de los mejores momentes de la novela.", "timestamp_created": 1512169569, "timestamp_updated": 1535920343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60120844841003418", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37977458": {"recommendationid": "37977458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284761952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 65, "last_played": 1512137548}, "language": "english", "review": "NICE", "timestamp_created": 1512138108, "timestamp_updated": 1512138108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37971643": {"recommendationid": "37971643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121073376", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 147, "last_played": 1551914885}, "language": "english", "review": "After hours of gaming, I think it's my pleasure to recommend this galgame to my friends, so as foreign galgame lovers.

Former Japanese gals' influence is so powerful, thus creating an embarassing atomsphere among the dialogues. For example, some modal particles, which are common in translated Japanese works but rare in Chinese, made the texts unnatural somewaht. These shortcomings are hard to overcome, because the dominating Japan galgames has imposed a strong,maybe tremendous influence on other developers. Defects in the script have also pulled down it's grades. The routine part is good, but when you moving into main part, you may find that charactors' motivation has not been explained sufficiently.

It has its share of humor and romantic encounters, while also exploring abuse.\nThe price to playtime ratio is incredible (especially if bought on sale). I'd say that if it was properly translated, and the bugs in chapter 4 were removed, it could be sold for $20-30. If you are able to live through the translation, and you actually play visual novels for the story, I'd say it's worth a try.\n\nThe game's story is still unfinished, because it is delivered in chapters. The good thing is; the chapters come as free updates. Each chapter has several hours of gameplay. My current 30 hours come from completing the first four chapters once.

For only 2 dollars you get around 20-30 hours of story along with plenty of nice sprites, CGs, and a decent soundtrack. If you are fluent in Chinese and like visual novels, buying this game is an absolute no-brainer.\n\nThat being said, the value proposition becomes less clear if you don't understand Chinese. The English translation is very poor quality, and since the vast majority of your time playing a VN like this will be spent on reading, this will obviously have a major impact on your experience with the game. The translation often reads awkwardly, and there are many errors such as the constant misuse of pronouns (her instead of his, you instead of I, etc.) and the inconsistent subsitution of character's Chinese names with English ones. Bafflingly, several instances of the letters \"Ju\" have been replaced by \"Daisy\" when they should not have been, and several other cases have been left as \"Ju\" when they should have been replaced. This is related to the fact that the Chinese name of Daisy is Xiaoju, but in the script we get clearly incorrect substitutions like \"Daisyst\" and \"Daisydged\" in place of \"Just\" and \"Judged.\"\n\n If you are a decent context reader, then none of the errors in the script should prevent you from understanding the story (there are a lot of errors though) and I fully recommend the game.

Most of the event just feel like they need to happen so they happen without any reason but only to serve the development of the story.\n\nCharacter 4/10\nThe MC is a fake dark character, his is so childish that does not match his history, n again he is supposed to be a shy, depressed, quite, weak character, but changed only in 3 days.

The twintails is just a stalker tsundere, nothing special.\n\nArt 7/10\nArt is good for a VN, but the movement of the characters are repetitive and not natural. The heroine always hold her hand below her breast to emphasize them (which seems like a scheming bxxxh IRL). The tip of the skirt of the heroine always blew by KAMIKAZE for some reason. \n\nVoice 8/10\nThe voice acting is pretty good for a chinese VN + all characters are voice cast.

chinese visual novel with chinese voice acting, which made it more interesting for me.\n\nArt is really good, its comparable with top notch japanese VNs. \n\nStory is interesting enough. It features protagonist with serious family problems, who is trying to overcome his problems and anxieties with help of his chindhood friend and new genius transfer student ... who are both in love with him. Yes, high school love-drama only in chinese version this time. Even tho protagonist's family situation is so desperate, i coudnt even imagine what it would be like in his shoes. It kind of makes it hard to connect if you know what i mean.\n\nTranslation is really bad, its not machine translation, someone actualy made effort to translate it, but its just ..... not english. Even then, text is still understandable, if you make the effort.\n\nWhat suprises me most is price for this VN, i mean i bought it for 1,2\u20ac with release discount ... for that price you get VN that could easily sell for 20 - 30 \u20ac (if the translation was good). Its only first 3 chapters of the story (rest should be added later as DLC?) but its still over 20 hours worth of reading material.\nIf i bought it for 30\u20ac i would whine about translation and gave it negative review but for 1,2\u20ac there is really nothing to complain about.\n\nSo final verdict.

A high school story of rebellion and friendship.   Of betrayal and loss.   All seen through the eyes of an Asian perspective.   It is not all that common (as it is in America) for teens to openly defy their parents.   So the very beginning of the story sets you up for a shock... and then gives you the foundation for what is to follow.  I don't want to say to much... because it really is worth reading through.\n\nThe English is a bit off.... there are words that even I had to look up (Sequelae ?????)  but for the most part it's understandable.   I would say that the English really does need to be re-worked overall though, if they really want to reach the American market.  A bit more explanation of the Asian school system, some better word choices, clearer indication of when Ashley is thinking.... or talking.... that sort of thing.   But for the price, it's still worth getting.\n\nOn a 10 star rating system, I would give this a 6 star rating for sure (above average).

The character design looks really good, the main reason why i bought this game is because on how good the art looks.

A good seiyuus/VA can make a good VN imo.\nMusic is pretty generic SOL/Romance type, i would say its quite weak since i've played VN that has music far more memorable than this one.\n\nTranslation: Probably the weakest part and a huge turn off of this game. The English translation were AWFUL. English is also not my first language, so understanding everything is really hard for me.\n\nConclusion: A VN with fantastic visuals for such a incredibly low price, unfortunately got ruined by the bad translation (unless you can read Chinese).

I have to say it is a wonderful galgame.\n       As you see it is a pure love visual novel. Maybe it is about love triangle, and this theme is not fresh for us ,such as [i]White Album2[/i]. But,[i]Tricolour lovestory[/i] happens in China in 2005.That's not similar to Japan or other countries.\n\n      12 years ago, most Chinese parents and teachers were strict to students, and students need a high score in tests. after a 3-year hard-working ,students need to attend NCEE (the National College Entrance Examinations). (There are other ways to enroll students for colleges but the quota is limited and the requirement is not easy to meet. Most students are admitted from NCEE) Generally speaking, NCEE is a fairest way to choose the excellent students. And a high degree from a good college is a guarantee of your ability .So that the NCEE is important and competitive. That is also the reason why most parents require their children to study hard. Even there exists a phenomenon that some parents think spending time on art or anything else is a waste of time and money because they are \"useless\" in study and work. In [i]Tricolour Lovestory[/i], Ashley's parents are just like that. This phenomenon is rare now because more and more people understand that it is harmful to children. But 12 years ago or earlier, many parents did not realize that.\n      The voice performance is in high level. The paintings and BGM are also satisfying. The game with this quality is worth more than the price in Steam. If you are interested in visual novel about lovestory ,[i]tricolour lovestory[/i]is a good game for you.\n\n      By the way, there are homages and catchwords in [i]Tricolour Lovestory[/i].You could find when you are playing. There is an interesting thing I have to explain for you. That is something about episode related. It is not important for the whole story but if you want to enjoy the game well, you can read the hidden information after finishing the first chapter.\n\t[spoiler] Green Luo takes charge of the commentator of the E-Sports(Here is playing War\u2162). In the last round between Daisy and Ashley, Green thinks Ashley is going to win and he judged that Daisy can never beat Ashley in that round. We could call the situation \u201cDestoryers Ride On Her Face\u201d. However, Ashley lost the match finally. This part is a homage to a StarCraft\u2161 game between Toodming and Alicia. (WCS 2014 America Group F). Toodming is at an advantage in the round 2, and he has a lot of mutalisks. (Mutalisks Ride On One\u2019s Face). And the rebroadcast of this game in China is commentated by Xudong Huang. He judged the situation that Toodming is going to win. The details are as fellows.\n\n\u201c\nTooDming has 180 supplies with mutalisks, easy to win Alicia.\nAlicia dares go out, his 3rd base is still building.\n180 supplies with mutalisks confront 120 supplies how to lose, tell me.\nHitting his face can win, failure is impossible\nJust having base trade is going to win, hitting his face also win, how to lose, impossible, Impossible to lose.\n\u2026\u2026\nRush rush rush rush ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuush\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\nLet's see what is a professional commentator .\nMutalisks ride on Alicia's face, what is mutalisks ride on your face?\nAppropriate Force field brings no help. \n\u201c\n      Well, Toodming finally lost the game.\n\n      Now you can know the commentator ,XuDong Huang ,from the new broadcaster SCBOYS in StarCraft\u2161 .He is a professional commentator. However, there are many times when he judged by professional analyzing situation, the match became uncertain, and even the situation changed at once. So that Xudong get a nickname\u201d Xudong, the jinxer, Huang\u201d(Just a joke. He is professional enough but it seems that players always perform as his expectation\u2026)\nThen each time he is sure about something and judge, people may think that event will be uncertain even be contrary to his judgement. (Only joking)\n      In[i]tricolour lovestory[/i],you may see Green is a a jinxer. When he is certain about something, that thing usually does not happen as his expectation.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1506487544, "timestamp_updated": 1506774664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35233239": {"recommendationid": "35233239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325034943", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1538310678}, "language": "english", "review": "You show me the boobs, I give you the money.

Instead of the developers giving a story that conforms to your own speech patterns, they give you a story that stays true to the roots of where it as made, so it has a sort of \"peek,\" into others culture.  If that doesn't interest you, and you need everything to sound like normal English standards, I wouldn't recommend it.  (honestly it's 4am where I live, so I don't know if I'm writing on the level of \"Normal English Standards,\" myself lol.) \n\nHOWEVER, if you are looking for a story, and can forgive the non-English friendly translations, then buy it.
