It is a bit of a puzzle game, but puzzles are bit different to what we usually have in adventure games or classical puzzle games (like Myst, Uru ect). Inside also looks like a standard side-scrolling game. We move from left to right. Puzzles dont require running around and spending time on stupid traveling - most of the solutions can be found on the very same screen we are at. Sometimes it is a matter of moving few screens around, which is actually very good. I never enjoyed spending most of the time in adventure games just walking between points. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy - once you learn how simplified mechanics works in this game, you just know what to use, and how to use. Most difficult puzzles require bit more thinking, but again: if you understand how game works, you will solve them relatively quickly. Funny thing is that while puzzles are not very hard, or even very easy at times, they are not stupid. They all seem to be a proper element of the world we see.\n\nGame is very short - it can be easily finished within some 5 hours, plus some more time to deal with achievements (I guess these are most difficult part of the game). While 5 hours dont sound as a lot of fun it is really okay. This game is bit more than just a side-scroller or puzzle game. It really has this something inside. It is grim, dark, sad game, even bit emotional at times. Those 5 horus were pretty much okay for me - I enjoyed them fully and loved the game.\n\nOne more thing - game doesnt communicate with us. We get no introduction, no story is told. We start just like that... and we also end just like that. Everything is just shown to us, but in most cases it is our imagination that has to build a full picture.

It's essentially a left to right scroller with a jump and an action key - that's it. You will complete it in between 7 & 8 hours game time - that's it. There's no spoon fed narrative, only the one you build yourself and a not totally defined ending. But IT IS BRILLIANT!\n\nThe developers have produced a wonderful, pathos filled game, which builds towards the game's surprising final chapter. The visuals are dark and foreboding - recognisably similar to our world but chillingly 'wrong'; like something from Simon Stalenhag's mind.  The puzzles are compelling and the scenery and gameplay are surprisingly varied given the practical limitations of the setup (up, down, left, right, & action is all you get!). They all combine to build an eery suspenseful narrative arc; the story however is completely, unapologetically, defined by the player. Whatever you take from it; how much is metaphor, literal, allegory, post-apocalyptic, dystopian, a fever dream, a coma patient, the insides of the mind of an amorphous blob...whatever you take from it is simply the developer holding up a mirror - you the player do all the narrative work.

From the little chicks and the unsettling sound of marching to the [spoiler] snoring and breathing of the slaves in and out of the huddle. [/spoiler] Paired with some of the most visually striking and vast imagery, INSIDE grabs you by the head and pulls you down and down into it\u2019s cold, grim world, leaving you on such a bittersweet, yet momentous finale, as well as a bunch of questions and interpretations that are personal to you.\n\nSo many people have their own answers and theories and I applaud PLAYDEAD for creating a game that is so ambiguous and open ended, despite how linear the actual gameplay is. So many feelings and ideas are communicated to the player without a single bit of text or dialogue, yet everyone's conclusion and experience is different\u2026\n\nSpoilers (conclusion below):\n[spoiler]From the chicks to the dead bodies and limbless slaves, the theme of control and sacrifice is abundant. All of these people have gone through all of this suffering and death, yet they still are there to help you progress, whether they want to or not. The horrors in the depths and the floating slaves are initially scary and a threat, yet they are still there to help you, to free you, until finally to free the huddle, this horrific, deformed tortured group of people, you have to join them and become one. \n\nNo one can go through this hell alone. The world is a cold, unforgiving mess, but together, no matter how hard it gets, no matter how many sacrifices you make, you will get through it. There will always be someone to help you. Someone to make sacrifices for you. \n\nThere are hints that perhaps the entire game is an experiment or the boy is being controlled (the secret ending explores this). The hill you roll down at the end has a diorama in the lab. The forest at the start might just be a part of the lab and the whole thing was a test. Throughout the entirety of INSIDE, you are pulled to the right, towards the huddle, until finally, as you become one with it (was it controlling you the whole time) you head left instead, finally \u201cfree\u201d.\n\nWas the ending real? Was the huddle free? It doesn\u2019t matter. For that moment in time, they are free. You are free. And there is peace. As the sun lights up these tortured souls, they can finally have some peace\u2026 [/spoiler]\n\nINSIDE is an experience I can\u2019t take my mind away from, and I doubt I ever will.

From the makers of Limbo, I would expect nothing less. I know I'm mega late with this one but I just played through and finished it and wanted to give this game yet another glowing review. \n\nThis game has a lot to offer, but its all very subtle. There's no dialogue, no action per say, you spend the entire game running from things trying to kill you and its kind of scary. It plays on a lot of suspenseful fear rather than unrelenting jump scares that plague the horror game community right now and I much prefer this style of fear since it more closely mimics how we experience fear in the real world. \n\nSay what you want about games like Five Nights at Freddy's or The Mortuary Assistant for example, but when the jump scare is over, I never felt any sort of fear, and once you play through the game over again and you have experienced every jump scare there is to offer, its pretty underwhelming, at least for me. Very rarely does the average night guard find himself attacked by rogue robots or the average mortician surrounded by a demon infestation. Its hard to immerse yourself into a genuinely terrifying experience with that. However, fear comes to us in much more subtle ways. Like a sound at the end of the hallway that is too dark to see whats out there, or a sudden shift in the energy of a room that makes the hairs stand up, THAT is fear. \n\nI'm not even sure if Inside does this on purpose, but they do this very well. I wouldn't necessarily call it \"subtle\" however, its definitely very obvious what is going on and why you should be afraid. To avoid spoilers I wont necessarily go into detail but most of the fear comes from running and hiding from things that are trying to kill you and where the fear comes in for me personally is how brutal it is if you fail. If you fail to run from things or hide successfully or if you zig when you need to zag, its really dark and the child that you are playing as gets brutally murdered in front of your eyes. Other than the horror however, the game is pretty much just a basic platformer and puzzle game, which is pretty fun. None of the puzzles felt really impossible and incredibly challenging, but the platforming and puzzles don't really feel like the point of the game. This is definitely a more story focused game. \n\nThe story itself however is super confusing. This is one of those things where you will play the game and be combing through the game in your mind to try and come up with a likely answer as to what has just taken place on your screen. Its interesting, but I guess the only criticism i have is that its too shallow. I dont feel like there is enough world here for the story to be incredibly entangled in mystery. \n\nTo be incredibly clear, I think the reason this game is so \"mysterious\" in its current state is simply because nothing is explained. Which, yes, thats how a mystery works, but Its like trying to make a riddle about a flat tire and saying it was a mystery when in reality, you just got a flat tire. Yes, it could be a mystery to someone who doesn't know what happened, but in reality its an extremely basic and simple occurrence that could be easily explained with a 10 second conversation. To sum up my critique here, this game is purposely left really open ended as to what the plot is, What exactly is the boy running from, what the ending means and so forth and trys to display how evil the opposition (to keep it vague for spoilers) is so that the player can draw their own conclusions and their own lore. But I think the game is so shallow in its current state and the mystery isn't deep enough to really come away with many conclusions. For instance, imagine watching American Psycho and you watch the scene where Bateman kills Paul Allen, and then you skip right to the scene were Bateman talks to his lawyer in person. While its not clear what is really happening, the only real two outcomes is that Bateman did kill Allen, or his lawyer is covering for him. Its not really that deep. \n\nI think the story COULD be one of the most enthralling mysteries in gaming if they put a little bit more world building and effort into it, but thats not to say what we have here is bad necessarily, it just feels like a smidge of lost potential. \n\nPutting my basic, super nit picky takes aside, I think this is a great game and I loved Limbo and I think this is definitely a step up from that game.

It took me some time to trust the developer again and try INSIDE - Glad I did.\n\nThere is no cutscene, no introduction, not a single word presented in the game, but it gets the meaning straightforward using graphics and music. A horizon-scroll horror game, where you control a boy solving well-made puzzles, always running forward and into the unknown. Can't say I'm a horror game lover but I enjoyed the early and recent RE games, Outlast franchise and so is this one, as long as there's no jump scares nor disturbing gore it's alright.\n\nThe puzzles are well-balanced both in difficulty and in quantity, keeps me interested all the time, and the way of presenting is impactful, things give me an immersive feeling. The favorite goes to the part where you mimic mindless people walking forward, jumping and facing the right rhythm and direction to fool anyone to believe that you are one of them, then escape. It's smart as well as creepy. INSIDE is not always about survival, you also gotta appreciate the arts like the bodies floating in water like kites in the sky, or in that anti-gravity place where everything is upside down. It's interesting to look at the world from a different angle and INSIDE showed me.\n\nThe last part of the game was unexpecting, I liked the idea of making the protagonist into [spoiler]what people feared and seeing everyone scared and fled[/spoiler], brilliant the game also asked the player to go from right to left after the change, in chaos I panicked and picked whatever path that was open. There's no boss fight nor difficulties I can't pass - a bit challenging for the water witch, the walkthrough feels smooth, creative, and gives insights.\n\nWould love to see more games like this one.\n\n[u] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WelcomeWhyNotGames] My curator page[/url][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1697190499, "timestamp_updated": 1697190499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697629094123840332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148053258": {"recommendationid": "148053258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123873055", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 384, "last_played": 1697071212}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran idea.

The puzzles are still engaging, just not infuriating.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game drew me in. The visual storytelling that occurs in the background really sets the mood as you try and understand why these people are after you, what did these people do, and what are they doing now? It\u2019s jarring to see faceless masked people watch streams of mind-controlled humans slowly walk by. In one scene to see adults, children, and even a newborn wearing a white mask covering their faces. It\u2019s creepy and adds to the world.\n\nAs to the \u201cstory\u201d, it\u2019s up to interpretation and the ending leaves with more questions than answers. As for my interpretation, I felt that at certain points in the story you are being controlled by one of two entities, the scientists, or the experiment. The sirens unplugged you from the \u201cMatrix\u201d only to have you under something else\u2019s control. Unplugging all orbs in the game unlocks a secret ending that does seem to indicate this as well.\n\nWas I blown away? No. Did I enjoy the time I had with the game? Yeah. More than LIMBO?

I am happy to say that Inside made big improvements for me in nearly every way. \n\nFirst of all, the game once again feels beautiful, especially on a smaller Steam Deck screen. It's not completely black, white, and grey like Limbo is, but the colors are still pretty dark and cold for the most part. The environments and the animations pulled me into its moody world. It's a very long shot to say that there is a story here, since there is no dialogue, text boxes, or explanations of any kind, but there are enough things going on in the backgrounds of the levels that give you hints at what's going on. You play as a young boy again, and this time you're on the run from what looks like the government, or maybe some kind of corporation, who is doing sinister experiments. For whatever reason, they are after you and your job is to escape. You need to piece together much of the story yourself in your head and fill in some blanks, but things get pretty twisted and even disturbing towards the end.\n\nThe controls are similar to Limbo. You can move from left to right, jump, and grab on to things to push/pull/turn them. This time the puzzles revolve more around stealth. Usually I don't like stealth in games, especially when its an automatic fail if you don't do it perfectly, but in this game I didn't mind it. You don't need to sneak up on anybody or turn off alarm systems. You mostly just need to hide behind pieces of the environment and time your movements correctly. There are a few parts during which you are chased by things trying to kill you, mostly dogs. I hate being chased in video games, it absolutely terrifies me, and in this game it was no different. Every time I heard the dogs barking I got mini panic attacks. There are some clever puzzles that force you to distract these enemies while you try to break pieces of wood that block your path, and things of that nature. A large portion of the game also takes place in a vehicle under water which adds variety to the gameplay.\n\nUnlike Limbo, in which I felt that the game never really established it's puzzle rules very well, I felt much more comfortable with the puzzles in Inside. The game has a mechanic in which you attach yourself to some kind of head gear that allows you to control people/corpses in the background or around the level, and these puzzles are as simple to understand as they are challenging to complete. I very rarely thought \"wow, I didn't know that I could interact with this thing\" like I often did in Limbo. The game does not hold your hand, but it also doesn't waste your time by being too cryptic. \n\nOverall Limbo was a fairly enjoyable and not very long game. I completed it in 3 sittings over the course of one day. It didn't blow me away and I didn't exactly have a blast playing it, but it made me scratch my head a few times as I tried to figure out the puzzles, and it was a cozy experience on a rainy day.", "timestamp_created": 1697002843, "timestamp_updated": 1697002843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148006801": {"recommendationid": "148006801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178263063", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1672089146}, "language": "english", "review": "Got stuck on a turbine box puzzle for an hour and a half but it was fun.", "timestamp_created": 1696991489, "timestamp_updated": 1696991489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148000929": {"recommendationid": "148000929", "author": {"steamid": "76561199553439161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 480, "last_played": 1696378368}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy playing it so much.

Both are fantastically well-received indie puzzle-platformers where you play as a nameless young boy in a nameless world, with unique art styles and zero spoken dialogue (other than grunts and whatnot). The story is told through atmosphere, sound design and visual cues. \n\nI\u2019m hard pressed to choose between the two. For me, Limbo is more instantly recognisable, and whilst it has some fantastic unique mechanics such as rolling the world through degrees, Inside takes the pip, with gorgeous visuals, more story, a real feeling of dystopia and more memorable mechanics such as the mind control, stealth scenes and one particularly memorable section where you imitate one of the mindless zombies. \n\nPuzzles strike that perfect balance between challenging and requiring thought without ever feeling unfair. Limbo would often require you to die first to understand what to do, but Inside never does this. Some of the larger puzzles still require trial and error, but more in a way where you will have to walk back and rethink rather than being killed. The puzzles which would kill you can be figured out on the spot before you die, and add to the tension. \n\nSound design is once again sparse but a triumph, using dynamics to really make you notice it. Headphones are recommended to really suck you in. \n\nInside is one of those games that everybody should experience once. At three and a half hours to finish and grab all of the achievements, it isn\u2019t a significant time investment, but it will stay with you.", "timestamp_created": 1696759444, "timestamp_updated":

With its understated brilliance, it's a game that lingers in your mind long after you've put down the controller.\n\nOne of Inside's most striking features is its visual design. The game's dark and monochromatic palette sets a mood of eerie unease right from the start. The attention to detail in the environments is nothing short of remarkable, with every element carefully crafted to enhance the player's immersion. Lighting plays a pivotal role, creating stunning contrasts and shadows that add depth to the world. Inside's visual storytelling is a lesson in subtlety, conveying the game's dystopian narrative without a single word of dialogue. Instead, it relies on the environment, character animations, and the player's own interpretation to convey its enigmatic story.\n\nThe gameplay in Inside is deceptively simple. Players control an unnamed boy who must navigate through a series of increasingly complex puzzles and obstacles. While the gameplay mechanics are straightforward, the challenge lies in the execution and the way the game introduces new elements seamlessly. Inside maintains a perfect balance between puzzle-solving and platforming, making sure the player is always engaged without feeling overwhelmed. It's a testament to the game's design that it never resorts to hand-holding, allowing players to experiment and learn through trial and error.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of Inside is its sound design. The eerie, ambient soundtrack perfectly complements the game's somber atmosphere. The absence of a traditional score allows the environmental sounds and the boy's footsteps to take center stage, creating an oppressive sense of isolation. This choice reinforces the feeling of being trapped in a dystopian world where you are constantly being watched and pursued.\n\nWhat truly sets Inside apart is its narrative ambiguity. As you progress through the game, you are presented with a series of enigmatic events and encounters that leave you with more questions than answers. This open-ended storytelling approach invites players to form their own interpretations and theories about the game's meaning, encouraging discussion and speculation long after the credits roll. Inside is a prime example of video games as an art form, using interactive storytelling to provoke thought and emotion.\n\nIf there's a criticism to be made about Inside, it might be its brevity. The game can be completed in a single sitting, which may leave some players wanting more. However, the concise experience can also be seen as a strength, as it ensures that every moment is meticulously crafted and essential to the overall narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, Inside is a masterpiece of minimalist gaming. Its hauntingly beautiful world, engrossing atmosphere, and thought-provoking narrative make it a must-play for anyone looking to explore the artistic potential of video games. It's a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and a reminder that sometimes less is more. Inside is an experience that will stay with you, leaving you pondering its mysteries long after the journey ends.", "timestamp_created": 1696511937, "timestamp_updated": 1696511937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147671442": {"recommendationid": "147671442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385811620", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1696451254}, "language": "english", "review": "buen juego que te los pasas en 3 horitas sin prisas", "timestamp_created": 1696498959, "timestamp_updated": 1696498959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147662847": {"recommendationid": "147662847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098444278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1696482549}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing story and atmosphere.

It was not as similar as I expected but it kept me engaged and I was able to complete the game within a day (with the help of a walkthrough every now and then \ud83d\ude05)\n\nI'll start with what I liked. The little chick creatures at the beginning of the game were the highlight of my day, I want to carry them around with me everywhere to be my little helpers :3 I also enjoyed the [spoiler]mind control concept of using the people around me to do things I wasn't able to do; the mind control inception/recursion was particularly amusing and a clever mechanic.[/spoiler] The colour scheme, the unexpected allies that came from enemies, and the atmosphere were all very engaging. The utter fear I felt from some of the chases had my heart leaping out of my chest!\n\nOne thing I wasn't a fan of was the controls. The arrow keys + the control key directly to the left of my left arrow button made it difficult to play as both my hands were on the same side of the keyboard. I attempted to change the key mapping in the settings but it wouldn't let me. I don't know if I'm just too silly to see how to change them, because if changing them is possible then this whole comment is now irrelevant, but if there is no way to change the keys then I maintain my opinion that the controls were my least favourite part of the experience.\n\nAnyways, that ending was so unexpected my face was gaping for a full five minutes as I was processing what the heck was happening. I'm not saying this was a bad part of the game though, if anything, the unpredictability was comical for me personally! I wish I knew more about the deeper meaning of this game, but it is up to the player to draw their own conclusions. There was a lot of symbolism I could pick up on, but ultimately the ending left my brain scrambled and less sure of what I originally thought was going on.\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes, but be prepared for a wild ride! I am going to attempt to find all the collectables so I can play through the secret ending and see if I can form any new opinions or thoughts on the meaning behind Inside.\n\nThanks for reading my review!", "timestamp_created": 1694860951, "timestamp_updated": 1694861511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146389476": {"recommendationid": "146389476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198976065881", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1694155651}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Inside [/h1] \n[h2] One of my favorite games I've ever played [/h2] \nFor those who don't know Playdead's Inside won 2 different Game Of the Year titles in 2016 and was in the top five in many other titles [i] INCLUDING THE MAIN TITLE OF GAME OF THE YEAR.

check out my reviews to see all the games i have completed!\n\ninside is a puzzle platformer developed and published by playdead, a danish indie developer based in copenhagen. the studio was founded sometime in 2006 to develop limbo, their first game released in july 2010. it was a massive success, not even just for a small indie studio from denmark, but it was considered a massive success on a national scale/level. later in 2010 they started development on a second game named \"project 2\" where they would flesh out all the things the developers liked about limbo and make a new game that wasn't a true sequel. they even got a million dollars in funding from the danish film institute, a agency responsible for supporting and encouraging film and cinema culture, and for conserving these in the national interest. early in development playdead changed engines from a custom built engine to unity after they figured out it would be more efficient and reduce the workload greatly. during e3 2014, playdead announced their second game as a spiritual successor to limbo, with a 'early 2015' release date. after a delay to 'mid-2016' and demo coming in august 2015. a xbox one release came first in late june, while a pc version released in early july, and a PS4 version released in late august. additionally, a release on mobile devices came in december 2017, and a nintendo switch port came in 2018.\n\ngameplay wise, it is a massive improvement over limbo, which was already great when it released in 2010 especially. the main thing that jumps at you right away in the improved art style, but as you dive into the gameplay you'll realize there are intricacies that weren't in the first game, such as collectibles that actually become a huge part of the game's plot/story. i won't delve further than that into the story but it's also a big thing that is great about inside, but in a subtle way that is no doubt biased by me being a completionist and going for 100% on my first run of the game. the deaths, that forced the ESRB to give limbo a teen rating, have been fleshed out even more, which earned inside a mature rating. there are deaths that are a little more graphic, especially with the much-improved art style. \n\nIGN had played a new exclusive demo at e3 2016 and called the game \"super limbo\" and compared limbo & inside to the NES & SNES. i agree with the sentiment for the most part, but i really feel like inside does enough to stand out on it's own and separate itself from any potential shadow cast by limbo. i think limbo is a solid game, but limbo, while being a similar size (i 100%'d both in under seven hours each), just doesn't match up to the great new ways that inside will provide similar gameplay elements. i am extremely excited for a third game from playdead, which was first teased in 2017 and as of late 2023 hasn't even been officially revealed in any capacity. \n\noverall, inside is short, which was also my biggest complaint with limbo. if you haven't played inside or haven't played either of playdead's games, i highly recommend doing so as soon as possible. they're short enough to where you could beat both in a single day if you really wanted to. and going from limbo to inside is a awesome experience and a huge upgrade while being unique enough to stand out on it's own, so it's fun to see the development of the developer. it's a fantastic experience that controls beautifully, making it one of the better games you'll ever play.", "timestamp_created": 1694678747, "timestamp_updated": 1694678747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146266901": {"recommendationid": "146266901", "author": {"steamid": "76561199152069220", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 268, "last_played": 1694708817}, "language": "english", "review": "King of the castle.

Reminds me of Superliminal or Untitled Goose Game. +1 Point\n- Tells a Tale without a Single Word, Which is Hard to do. the story is portrayed by the Environments and the Surroundings. +1 Point\n- The Puzzles Are Really Clever and Intricate, Took me a while to do it.  + 2 Points\n- The Subtle yet Somehow Prominent Score Makes this game so much better. + 3 Points \n- Complex and Thought out Story, Even though it's a silent story. + 0.5 Points. \n\nAnd now the Bad: \n\n- The Ending Kind of Dragged. it was rather anticlimactic. - 1 Point\n - it feels like a walking simulator at some points, but it gives me time Admire the Well Crafted Scenery, So \n i'm Only Deducting Half a Point. - 0.5 Points \n- Can be Frustrating, But that's a Skill issue on my Half. No Points Deducted. \n\n\nThis Game is a Great Experience with an Interesting Story.

This game is basically Limbo HD. If you loved Limbo, you'll love Inside. If you haven't played Limbo, I'd say skip Limbo and play Inside.\n\nIt's a beautiful puzzle game with a lot of attention to detail in the environment and animations. It's rare to find a platformer that flows so smoothly between states. It has a distinctly dark mood as I'm sure you've noticed, which can be interesting at times, but I personally found it at times a little unnecessarily macabre to the point of it being a gimmick. It's not super over-the-top or anything, but stylistically I found myself asking, \"did you really have to do it like that?\" Aside from those decisions, the game is expertly crafted and always keeps you moving through novel situations. The mechanics of the game don't get old as they reinvent new ways to keep you entertained.\n\nHowever, as I played through, I found myself struggling to keep interest in the game. There are interesting story points scattered through the game, but it has no depth that pulls you in. The game has an almost uncompromising darkness and I found myself asking, \"am I in the mood to watch a 2D child get violently killed today?\" whenever I booted up the game.\n\nAll that said, the game is a work of art with stunning visuals, impressive animation, seamless immersion, and creative puzzles.\n\nVerdict: GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1694053826, "timestamp_updated": 1694053826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145826470": {"recommendationid": "145826470", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387422053", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 365, "last_played": 1694052397}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1694052428, "timestamp_updated": 1694052428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145823815": {"recommendationid": "145823815", "author": {"steamid": "76561199404569038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1695387927}, "language": "english", "review": "Runs on Mac M2.\nAwesome game with incredible mood, love it!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1694048376, "timestamp_updated": 1694048376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145822583": {"recommendationid": "145822583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028538868", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2334, "last_played": 1694011762}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable to play, nice graphs, a little of gore, fun puzzles, not too long but i like more short games.", "timestamp_created": 1694046479, "timestamp_updated": 1694046479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145820179": {"recommendationid": "145820179", "author": {"steamid": "76561199537914337", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1696859589}, "language": "english", "review": "truly a amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1694042839, "timestamp_updated": 1694042839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145818378": {"recommendationid": "145818378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065405675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1694040134}, "language": "english", "review": "Weird but good.", "timestamp_created": 1694040244, "timestamp_updated": 1694040244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145815191": {"recommendationid": "145815191", "author": {"steamid": "76561199461027252", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 176, "last_played": 1696182046}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a work of art the sound design is amazing the animations are amazing the art is amazing.I couldnt recommend it enough.When i first played the demo i was blown away and when i finished the game i cried happy tears.This games is one of the most underated games of all time [in my opinion]", "timestamp_created": 1694036151, "timestamp_updated": 1694036151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145814476": {"recommendationid": "145814476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004911300", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 164, "last_played": 1694034910}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but in a good way.

Developed by Playdead, the same minds behind \"Limbo,\" this puzzle platformer exudes a unique and haunting charm that keeps players talking long after the credits roll.\n\nMuch like its predecessor, \"INSIDE\" boasts a distinct art style, shrouded in darkness both in tone and color. The characters are faceless, and the narrative is deliberately enigmatic. This ambiguity sparks conversations and keeps players engaged throughout its three-hour journey.\n\nThe puzzles in \"INSIDE\" aren't mind-bendingly difficult, but that doesn't matter. They strike a balance that keeps players intrigued, eager to uncover the mysteries of the game's world and their character's purpose.\n\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the discomforting theme running through Playdead's games. \"INSIDE\" continues the trend of portraying a young protagonist enduring brutal deaths, which can be unsettling. This discomfort serves to heighten the emotional impact of the game.\n\n\"INSIDE\" excels at creating a haunting atmosphere. The game raises questions at every turn, immersing players in its eerie world and its enigmatic narrative. The dark and moody visuals, combined with a haunting soundtrack, deliver an atmospheric experience that few games can match.\n\nDespite its simplicity in terms of gameplay mechanics, \"INSIDE\" is a polished masterpiece. With only two buttons for controls, it relies on visual hints and experimentation to guide players, eschewing tutorials and explanations.\n\nVisually, the game is unsettling yet beautiful, with every animation conveying a poetic quality. From stumbling over obstacles to frantic swimming during chases, each movement feels deliberate and adds to the overall experience.\n\nIn summary, \"INSIDE\" is more than a game; it's an experience. While its puzzles may be straightforward, its story is outlandish and confusing in all the right ways. It's the kind of game that begs discussion, leaving players eager to share their \"WTF just happened\" moments. \"INSIDE\" is an unforgettable journey that deserves to be played and talked about.", "timestamp_created": 1693858162, "timestamp_updated": 1693858162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145673551": {"recommendationid": "145673551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097863161", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 747, "last_played": 1693858119}, "language": "english", "review": "Deep masterpiece...", "timestamp_created": 1693857975, "timestamp_updated": 1693857975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145673074": {"recommendationid": "145673074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152693079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1694479498}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Certainly understandable, and I view this game as being closer to a work of art than simply a video game. \n\nHowever, it makes me all the more glad I got it on sale, because $20, although modestly priced for such an amazing game, is steep for the length. I don't really see myself playing this game again anytime soon. I believe I replayed Limbo, but there was so much less choice in games back when I was young. I'm sure the game has little secrets to find (I found a couple), but I'm not the \"maximal achievement\" kind of guy.  It took me less than 4 hours to complete the first play-through. It certainly doesn't outstay its welcome, which, for this kind of game, is possible.

Se trata de un t\u00edtulo que combina g\u00e9nero plataformas con puzzles. \n\nLa historia desde el inicio del juego hasta el final es de lo m\u00e1s confuso. La mayor\u00eda de la informaci\u00f3n que te dan para entender la historia son elementos que aparecen en pantalla pero ning\u00fan documento, di\u00e1logo o cinem\u00e1tica que pueda esclarecerlo por si mismo. Una vez entiendes la historia, todo cobra sentido y te das cuenta de que cada elemento mostrado en pantalla tiene un significado relevante sobre el protagonista. \n\nNo hay soundtrack aun los efectos de sonidos est\u00e1n bastante bien hechos. Puedes sentir la profundidad de los lugares tan inmensos en los que te adentras, escuchas el sonido distorsionado cuando te sumerges, el eco de tus pisadas te ponen nervioso al mismo tiempo que te tranquilizan d\u00e1ndote una falsa seguridad.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n es muy interesante, dir\u00eda que el principal pilar de este t\u00edtulo. Presenta un mundo pos-apocal\u00edptico y como empiezas sin ning\u00fan tipo de contexto hist\u00f3rico es tu misi\u00f3n saber qu\u00e9 ha ocurrido. Los lugares que visitaras son cada uno m\u00e1s turbio, peligroso y oscuro que el otro. La soledad te har\u00e1 sentir tranquilo pero tambi\u00e9n te dar\u00e1 la sensaci\u00f3n de que algo malo est\u00e1 por pasar. \n\nEl gameplay es maravilloso. \u00danicamente puedes realizar movimientos de lo m\u00e1s simples como dejarte caer, saltar, agarrar cosas mientras te mueves de iquierda a derecha, muy similar a \"Limbo\" (por no decir id\u00e9ntico). Ahora bien, esa simpleza es lo que convierte este t\u00edtulo en una maravilla. No has de pensar en exceso para poder solucionar los puzzles ya que las acciones a realizar son limitadas. Las zonas secretas son relativamente sencillas de encontrar con solo utilizar un oco la l\u00f3gica. Es perfecto para centrarte en la historia tan enigm\u00e1tica que te presenta e t\u00edtulo. \n\nLos logros son extremadamente sencillos de conseguir, simplemente encuentra todos los secretos del juego y haz alguna que otra acci\u00f3n muy espec\u00edfica que no requiere de ninguna habilidad.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, \u00bfLo recomendar\u00eda? S\u00ed, sin lugar a dudas.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that it is one of my top 5 games of all time.  I consider this game to be a masterpiece, and a must-play if you like atmospheric or story driven games.  It is one of the few games that I have gotten all of the achievements for.  Also, it is the only game that I have seriously attempted to speed run, because I enjoy replaying it so much.\n\n\nMore:\n\nInside is fantastic.  It is thrilling and captivating.  From the very beginning, the game grabs your attention and never loosens its grip for even a second.  The audio, the visuals, the character design, the aesthetic... everything is perfect.  Of all the games that I have played in the past 30 years or so, it stands out as something truly special.  You owe it to yourself to play this game.  If you do, make sure that you are alone with no distractions, in a dark room with headphones on.  Fully immerse yourself into this game to get the most out of it.\n\nYou take on the role of a young boy who is traversing a strange and mysterious environment.  When you begin the game, you do not know what is going on or why.  There is no dialogue or text-crawl to explain what is happening.  You simply figure everything out as you go.  The player is left to use their imagination and observations to explain the world of Inside.  And what a world it is.\n\nIt is gloomy and dark.  The world is threatening and unsettling.  There is a sense of unease during the entire play-through that never lets up.  I was eager to see what was just beyond the screen horizon the entire time that I was playing.  Fully immersed in this world, I believed that I was the young boy in this game through and through.  \n\nMost of the time spent playing is spent solving puzzles and platforming.  The technical design of the game is fantastic.  It is so much fun discovering how to solve the puzzles in the game and progress.  They are very well done, interesting, and not overly difficult.  Truly there is joy in figuring something out that was right in front of you the entire time, and not obscured needlessly to artificially increase the difficulty.  You will have that 'aha!' moment multiple times while playing this game.  The proverbial light bulb in your head will turn on over and over, while you probably smile and eagerly finish the task at hand.\n\nEarlier, I described the world as unsettling.  The music plays a very large role in eliciting this feeling.  There are mostly quiet moments, peppered with ambient noise and sound effects of things happening in the background.  You hear every footstep that you take echo through empty halls and dark forests, as well as machinery clanging and churning within buildings.  When something truly noteworthy happens, the music kicks in, and it is glorious.  It is subtle and expertly composed.\n\nInside has a minimalist and almost low-poly art style.  For the most part, the game is very dark, and not well lit, so you can't actually see any topology on the meshes.  You won't notice individual faces on character models as they move about, or anything like that.  The boy, and all the other inhabitants of this world appear almost featureless in their faces, and only given enough detail to discern their job, their age, and their gender.  There is a pretty wide view of the entire world while you are playing, so this makes sense visually as well as thematically.  You wouldn't get a very good look at any characters face even if they were highly detailed, because they appear to be far away... and you don't really need to know much about them... and you probably don't want to.\n\nWhen I think about the time I spent playing this game, I feel like I watched an entire series of a TV show.  There is so much that happens in such a short time on this young boys journey, and so much is learned and revealed.  This is a game that I want more of, but also want to remain exactly what it is.  I would love nothing more than to have more 'Inside' content, but this game was so well done, and my memories of it are so precious that I wouldn't want anything to even come close to changing that.  Inside is as close to perfect as a game can get in my opinion, and I can't imagine any way to make it better outside of making more of it, exactly as it already is.  \n\nI consider this to be one of the greatest games that I have ever played, and I hope that as many people as possible experience it, and hopefully, feel the same way that I felt while playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1693268031, "timestamp_updated": 1693268031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145223239": {"recommendationid": "145223239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199261662476", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 183, "last_played": 1693258973}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Hermosa pieza cinematografica", "timestamp_created": 1693259054, "timestamp_updated": 1693259054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145221821": {"recommendationid": "145221821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198984175245", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 695, "last_played": 1693256557}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un juego de puzzles, muy bien hecho.

The striking visual design immediately caught my eye \u2013 the play of light and shadow, the meticulously crafted environments, and the subtle animations breathed life into every corner of this mysterious world. The minimalist yet impactful aesthetic not only drew me in but also immersed me in a narrative that relied as much on visual storytelling as it did on traditional exposition.\n\nThe game's puzzles are a testament to Playdead's ingenuity and design prowess. Each challenge is ingeniously integrated into the fabric of the world, seamlessly blending with the narrative and environment. The solutions often demand creative thinking, encouraging players to experiment and observe, while the absence of explicit guidance fosters a sense of accomplishment upon discovery.\n\n\"Inside\" achieves something truly remarkable in its ability to evoke emotions without overtly spelling out its intentions. The atmosphere is suffused with an uncanny sense of dread and wonder, creating a tension that's as palpable as it is mesmerizing. The hauntingly beautiful sound design, accompanied by the sparse yet impactful musical score, amplifies the emotional resonance, ensuring that every moment \u2013 be it suspenseful or poignant \u2013 lingers in the mind long after the game is turned off.\n\nOne of the game's triumphs lies in its storytelling approach, a marvel of ambiguity that invites players to construct their own interpretations. The narrative unfurls in fragmented whispers, leaving ample room for speculation and reflection. The final revelation is as perplexing as it is thought-provoking, and its open-ended nature only adds to the allure. In this respect, \"Inside\" isn't just a game; it's a catalyst for contemplation and conversation.\n\nFew games have ever left me as awestruck and introspective as \"Inside.\" It's a testament to the power of interactive art, a journey that extends beyond the screen and into the depths of the mind. Playdead's ability to convey profound themes and emotions through subtlety and restraint is a rare gem in the gaming landscape.\n\nIn the end, \"Inside\" isn't just a game I played; it's an experience that touched my soul. Its enigmatic world, ingenious puzzles, and evocative storytelling have solidified its place as a timeless masterpiece in my gaming repertoire. If you're seeking an adventure that challenges your intellect, tugs at your heartstrings, and lingers in your thoughts, \"Inside\" beckons you to step into its enigmatic embrace.", "timestamp_created": 1692646069, "timestamp_updated": 1692646069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489051073789596558", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144732588": {"recommendationid": "144732588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103277668", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1692640655}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game.

Los desaf\u00edos sin duda son todo menos eso, aunque reconozco que en alg\u00fan sitio me atasqu\u00e9 un poco m\u00e1s. Una vez controlas las mec\u00e1nicas, el juego es una cont\u00ednua resoluci\u00f3n de problemas bastante sencillo. \u00bfDesmerece esto el juego? para nada.\n\nNo se si catalogar este juego como Indie o no (yo creo que si), pero tiene un apartado art\u00edstico bastante notable, por la sencillez y la originalidad. La atm\u00f3sfera es totalmente acorde con la historia y pese a ser muy esquem\u00e1tico, le da una inmersi\u00f3n a la historia bastante buena. \n\nSe echa de menos empatizar un poco m\u00e1s con el personaje, que en los primeros compases si que se consigue  (supongo que quer\u00edan crear ese v\u00ednculo y mantenerlo), pero luego se va perdiendo poco a poco, convirti\u00e9ndose en una mera herramienta para solucionar el siguiente problema.\n\nLo mejor: La originalidad conceptual y la atm\u00f3sfera del juego (muy apocal\u00edptico/dist\u00f3pico)\nLo peor: Jugabilidad muy sencilla y... banda sonora y efectos sonoros escasos o nulos.\n\nDir\u00e9 que, un juego entretenido, sin m\u00e1s. Si constase 10 Euros, no lo recomendar\u00eda porque es corto y creo que no para todos los p\u00fablicos. A mi me ha gustado (los videojuegos y la comida me gusta casi todo), pero no lo repetir\u00eda y, pese a ser una bonita y una buena apuesta como juego Indie, creo que se queda corto en varios sentidos.\n\nUn saludo!", "timestamp_created": 1692327129, "timestamp_updated": 1692327129, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

Los gr\u00e1ficos en blanco y negro, con toques de color ocasionalmente, crean un ambiente opresivo y oscuro que sumerge al jugador en un mundo sombr\u00edo y desconocido. La atenci\u00f3n al detalle en la animaci\u00f3n y el dise\u00f1o de los personajes es impresionante y contribuye en gran medida a la narrativa silenciosa del juego.\n\nHistoria y Narrativa:\nInside ofrece una narrativa intrigante y misteriosa que se desarrolla sin una sola palabra hablada o escrita. El jugador asume el papel de un ni\u00f1o sin nombre que se aventura en un mundo dist\u00f3pico y peligroso. A medida que avanzas a trav\u00e9s de los niveles, descubres fragmentos de la historia que te hacen cuestionar todo lo que est\u00e1 sucediendo. La historia es abierta a interpretaciones y te sumerge en un mundo lleno de preguntas sin respuestas definitivas, lo que agrega profundidad y rejugabilidad al juego.\n\nJugabilidad:\nInside se enfoca en la resoluci\u00f3n de acertijos y la exploraci\u00f3n en un mundo 2.5D. La jugabilidad es sencilla pero desafiante, con una progresi\u00f3n natural de la dificultad a medida que avanzas. A medida que el ni\u00f1o se enfrenta a obst\u00e1culos y peligros, debes utilizar el entorno y la l\u00f3gica para avanzar. La falta de un tutorial y la ausencia de di\u00e1logos hacen que el juego sea a\u00fan m\u00e1s inmersivo, ya que el jugador debe descubrir todo por s\u00ed mismo.\n\nAmbiente y Sonido:\nLa atm\u00f3sfera opresiva de Inside se ve reforzada por su excelente dise\u00f1o de sonido. Los efectos de sonido sutiles pero impactantes, junto con una m\u00fasica ambiental minimalista y desconcertante, crean una experiencia auditiva que te sumerge completamente en el mundo del juego. Los susurros, los gritos distantes y otros sonidos misteriosos te mantienen en constante tensi\u00f3n y expectaci\u00f3n.\n\nDuraci\u00f3n y Rejugabilidad:\nInside es relativamente corto, con una duraci\u00f3n de juego de aproximadamente 3 a 4 horas. Sin embargo, su misteriosa narrativa y la posibilidad de encontrar secretos y coleccionables en cada nivel fomentan la rejugabilidad. Adem\u00e1s, la historia y los eventos finales del juego dejan una impresi\u00f3n duradera que te har\u00e1 reflexionar incluso despu\u00e9s de haber terminado.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n:\nInside es una obra maestra en t\u00e9rminos de narrativa y dise\u00f1o de juegos. Su estilo visual \u00fanico, su narrativa silenciosa y su jugabilidad desafiante se combinan para crear una experiencia \u00fanica y memorable. Aunque es relativamente corto, Inside es un juego que te dejar\u00e1 reflexionando sobre su significado mucho despu\u00e9s de haber apagado la consola. Si buscas una experiencia de juego que te haga pensar y sentir, Inside es una elecci\u00f3n obligada. Este juego es un ejemplo brillante de c\u00f3mo los videojuegos pueden ser una forma de arte que va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la mera diversi\u00f3n.", "timestamp_created": 1691774931, "timestamp_updated": 1693943093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586590111255645752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143904190": {"recommendationid": "143904190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062458627", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1691835517}, "language": "english", "review": "ONE OF THE BEST GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1691769404, "timestamp_updated": 1691769404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143897867": {"recommendationid": "143897867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138078774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1691765736}, "language": "english", "review": "feels like a slog. not interesting", "timestamp_created": 1691765887, "timestamp_updated": 1691765887, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502509415149688721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143871693": {"recommendationid": "143871693", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985974084", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1267, "last_played": 1694819290}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1691750366, "timestamp_updated": 1691750366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143866781": {"recommendationid": "143866781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043081412", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1690125114}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Nothing is as it seems.[/h1]\nFrom the makers of LIMBO, INSIDE sees you control a nameless boy in a bid to escape from... something. Having no dialogue, cutscenes, lore or any exposition whatsoever, you are left largely to draw your own conclusions as you progress through the game on the way to your objective.\n\nWhile not as eerie or haunting as LIMBO (which wins out in that category due to the stark use of black/white and no colours), it has a menace all of its own, especially the dogs. The environment also does not feel quite as lethal as the world of LIMBO, but in reality there are still plenty ways to die. There is still a strong puzzle element here, just a lack of obviously deadly obstacles such as buzzsaws, electricity, etc. Instead, these are replaced by sentient beings, such as dogs and humans - some of which are hostile, and some of which are indifferent.\n\nThe game raises philosophical questions about the nature of self, agency, and morality. What does it mean to be human in a society that strips away individuality and autonomy? How far would you go to escape from such a system? What are the ethical implications of manipulating others for your own survival or curiosity? Due to the \"clean\" nature of the game (very limited information input as mentioned earlier), it seems probable that most players will come to their own, unique conclusions based on their experience playing through the game. Then again, it may also raise the question of whether there is even a point in the first place.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for an adventure, story or something more introspective. Much like LIMBO, this is more than a game and comes closer to art or a thought exercise and deserves to be experienced.\n\nPlayed on Windows 11 Pro x64 without any issues.", "timestamp_created": 1691747058, "timestamp_updated": 1691747058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826950490474700928", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143845443": {"recommendationid": "143845443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198418006465", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1691731397}, "language": "english", "review": "That was reaxing game with some chasing moments but also have a deep story", "timestamp_created": 1691731447, "timestamp_updated": 1691731447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143809165": {"recommendationid": "143809165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168430646", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1691701418}, "language": "spanish", "review": "juegazo", "timestamp_created": 1691701445, "timestamp_updated": 1691701445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143806662": {"recommendationid": "143806662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121530834", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1691528599}, "language": "english", "review": "It has a little something for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1691699722, "timestamp_updated": 1691699722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143765522": {"recommendationid": "143765522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120879065", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1630514605}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game.", "timestamp_created": 1691651348, "timestamp_updated": 1691651348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143764666": {"recommendationid": "143764666", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103327225", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1691815043}, "language": "english", "review": "I Totally recommend this.

A mystery is a promise:  Patient and observant players will be rewarded with story and meaning.  This promise is undermined when the creator forces the player to create the story and meaning themselves.

If you're looking for your curiosity to be rewarded with a satisfying conclusion, keep looking.\n\nThe puzzles are good, neither too sinister nor too trivial, broken up nicely by tight platforming.  The atmosphere is sometimes tense and foreboding, sometimes wild and dangerous.  The art is beautiful, with curious and interesting sights from start to finish.\n\nThe game respects players' time.  Failure results in the ability to quickly reset and try again.  The \"load\" system allows players to go back and search for missed side areas without having to replay the whole game.  There's no unnecessary backtracking, and no scene, setting, or challenge wears out its welcome.\n\nMost every aspect of this game works well, so the way you feel about this game story will boil down to:  Do you want a mystery with a solution?  Or would you prefer to speculate on possibilities?

Frustratingly tedious experience, pretty unenjoyable. Not my type of puzzles. Only thing kept me going was curiousity. I don't think I can do anymore, I'm 2/3 thru and just got dropped in another long winded puzzle scenario that for some reason just feels like I wish I could hit a skip button to keep running through it all. I didn't enjoy basically any of the interactive stuff, and just holding right or left the entire game is boring as well. I'm not sure how to remedy this entirely.  All that said I thought Limbo was great.  I think this was a major step down. Also not a fan of such a vague story and setting.

Can't go into details because it is a spoiler, a large one I guess.. but it didn't fit with the game in my opinion and the ambiguous ending could have been achieved without it, from my perspective using the enemies tech and busting out.\n\nAfter finishing this I went and played Limbo, same developers and similar concept but different goals maybe. There are definitely parallels between both games, this one is noticeably more polished as should be expected as it released after Limbo did, similar to a sequel.\n\nGreat job developers, I recommend the game and the experience, the world with everything in it. Many people should try it, I commend what you've done but I don't like your plot device, it feels lazy and if it was just there for a segment or a few I'd let it pass but as it is right now I feel like it overrides a lot of what the MC wanted to do, not how he'd have done it too.\n\nIt is worth full price but not in regards to 1 playthrough content. Go for extra, do more, experiment more. Playing it for story or to see what happens next will take under 5 hours, maybe even under 4 so I encourage anybody trying to take your time, there is more to do.\n\nOh and there is a secret ending I will return to complete, this review will be updated after that.", "timestamp_created": 1691020660, "timestamp_updated": 1692042677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143287941": {"recommendationid": "143287941", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119690807", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1691185877}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so fascinating and cool", "timestamp_created": 1691015394, "timestamp_updated": 1691015394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143286688": {"recommendationid": "143286688", "author": {"steamid": "76561199406211611", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1690763044}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno", "timestamp_created": 1691013598, "timestamp_updated": 1691013598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143263130": {"recommendationid": "143263130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093396884", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 280, "last_played": 1690983894}, "language": "english", "review": "A bit confusing story, but great game.

It oozes with mood and style. For that alone, I would recommend it. It has incredible visuals (especially the dynamic lighting) and animation. The simplistic shapes and textures/colors give it an artful style, and it offers a very interesting world... \n\n...but you don't get to explore that world, and there are no answers at the end for anything you've seen and wondered about while playing. It's not a bad ending, per se, it's just... \"That's it? We're done now? Why did ANY of that happen?? What was ANY of this for?? Why did anyone do anything they did?? What are the motivations of ANY characters?\"\n\nThis side-scroller looks incredible due to being executed in a 3D space... but that leads to me wanting to escape the 2D plane the player character is trapped on. I did not feel that in Playdead's prior game because it rarely, if ever, implied any space to move into other than forward and back (with occasional up and down). Bringing depth into a 2D scrolling game concept made the game look beautiful and the simplistic environments believable, but it also teased of places you cannot go. This makes invisible walls worse than ever: the puzzle framing is so much more artificial and obvious, and irritating in several cases. I felt myself asking \"why would I go THERE, instead of going anywhere else?\" Oh, right, because there's only a 2D plane for this character to move in and all puzzles are carried out (and demanded) via an inevitable left or right movement (and sometimes up & down) on a mostly linear path.\n\nSome of the puzzles, if you can call them that, became repetitious, and that resulted in frustration. There were moments that I just wanted a certain type of action/activity to stop repeating (like the underwater monster pursuits, though that ended satisfactorily, despite only adding more questions and answering nothing... making prior action seemingly senseless, also therefore making it look more like puzzles than narrative). The game was a better experience while the activities required of the player were diverse. Speaking of... change...\n\nThe twist near the end was... something. I understand why people are bothered by it, but I would've been fine with the twist had ANYTHING AT ALL been explained by the end. I am NOT a fan of \"anything goes because it's sci-fi\" type of plotting. It has to make some kind of sense within its own context. In this game, nothing makes any sense at all. There's no suggestion as to the motivation of ANY characters or factions, nor what they even are. There's not even a sense that the ending fits into what's been given so far, other than \"outside is better/safer\", which was already explicitly made clearly NOT the case at the very beginning of the game. So, maybe it's \"outside... over THERE is better, because... reasons...\"\n\nI am not a fan of \"it's so open ended by the end that you can come up with whatever meaning or story you want\". That's not a plot or a story; it's meaningless performance art. I'm not here to create someone else's world for them. Tell me a story inside a world that you've already decided on. I hate doing other people's work for them and watching people excuse it with \"it's open to interpretation\". Yeah, a blank sheet of paper is also open to interpretation. Ultimately, we are given apocalypse/\"dangers of science\" tropes as magnetic poetry to throw at a wall. There's a little of this, a little of that... none of it forms a coherent world or plot, \"but it looks cool!\"\n\nA story doesn't need to be easy/simple, or spoon-fed to me, but it DOES have to be EXTANT. I can always tell when writers have no idea what they've created. Throwing random weird and suggestive content at the audience works up until it stops being possible to make sense of it as a coherent work, and then you realize you're just being fed random stuff because someone thought \"hey, cool mystery\". You really do have to figure it out as a writer, even if you don't spell it out to the audience. \"MYSTERIOUS!!\" is not more important than \"it makes some kind of sense, and is internally consistent\".\n\nI don't regret the experience of playing this game, but I don't feel strongly motivated to replay it in order to find several secrets I missed, or try to get the \"alternate ending\" everyone keeps talking about. Some of the game was too tedious to replay for what's likely to be more \"no answers mystery\", and likely just create more questions.\n\nIf none of this story/plot criticism matters to you in your entertainment experience, then I guess you'll be fine with what this game presents.\n\nAs for difficulty: It's sometimes frustrating, but I got through it fairly rapidly, and I'm not a hard-core gamer, nor a puzzle person. That said, it's not so easy as to be able to dash through it without any effort or thought. It's actually a pretty good balance, and, for me, as challenging as I can tolerate a game to be when playing it as one solid block of 7 hours.\n\nIn several ways (visual style and structure), this game reminded me of \"Out of This World\", but I felt zero connection to any characters here. There's barely a character to speak of, other than \"the boy\". The end of OOTW was emotional and it has stuck with me for decades. The end of \"Inside\" is... well, as I said above: it just ends, and I sat here asking \"Is that it? Really??\" The only thing that will stick with me here is the rendering tech... and the blob.", "timestamp_created": 1690164329, "timestamp_updated": 1690164329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142668596": {"recommendationid": "142668596", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467632173", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 290, "last_played": 1690147850}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game a very long time ago on Ipad and wanted to expirience this master piece again.

Thank you Pleadead for the beautiful game. Can't wait to play to your next game.\n\nPros\n- The gameplay. Simple and intuitive\n- The ambiance. We feel the oppression, and that the boy is scared (with reason).\n- The variety of the puzzles.\n- The thriller. This game is the proof we don't need gore and violence to be afraid and tensed.\n- The variation between tension and calm.\n- The possibility to do the chapters again.\n- No dialogue. And yet, the developpers managed to tell a beautiful story.\n- No downloads or breaks. It's linear... litteraly.\n- This game doesn not have a rich colour palette. Do not expect a side-scrolling game as colourful as mario. It's not. Some even consider the art style as monochromous. But it's actually a strength of this game, as it contributes significantly to the feeling of oppresion and dystopy.\n\nLimits\n- ?\n\nDepends of your tastes\n- There is a plotwist at the end. Some people thought it was genious. Because of the reviews and comments, my expectations were high. But once I got there, I told myself it was overrated. The plotwist changes indeed the tone, but it becomes absurb and does not fit with the rest of the game (in my opinion).

As with its predecessor Limbo by the same studio it contains ingenious puzzles, traps, and dangerous encounters against the backdrop of an even more beautiful scenery than Limbo. While I love Limbo in all its aspects, this game has an added depth that Limbo's missing. The atmosphere and ambience, the minimalist and suggestive brutalistic architectural world the player moves around in is sublime, the art direction is quite awesome and perfect, making this one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen and played. Many times I just walked back and forth just to admire the world around me. It's the weirdest thing too; as I progressed in the game I felt that although the world is quite the scary place to walk around in I at the same time felt a longing to go there, like I had some kind of connection to it. It felt very northen and seeing as I'm a swede I found many things eerily familiar, and the reason for this as it turned out in the end when the credits rolled I found that the studio behind the game, Playdead, is danish. No wonder I seemed to feel at home in certain aspects when playing this game; they've perfectly incorporated the visual sense of the northen scenery and then added their magic to it. They really managed to bring about the atmospheric melancholy of the northen people and I absolutely loved everything about it. The world is indeed cold and oppressively scary but it is really beautiful. Many times I just sat and looked at the visuals in complete fascination. My hat off to the studio for making this gem of a masterpiece.

I feel that the difficulty level of Limbo is much harder than Inside. The story of Limbo and Inside have similarities and differences. In both games, we play a silent and nameless protagonist who we do not know much about even after we have completed the games. Both games use environmental storytelling to allow the player to experience the game and the story that they intend to convey without the use of any spoken language. Both games provoke more questions than answers. In both games, we start off in the forest. In Inside, we get chased by both dogs and human beings who want to capture the player character. We are left wondering why did other humans want to capture the player character. Who are we playing as and what are we doing in the game? Where are we? As the game progresses, we observe strange happenings in the game world as we can see mind controlled animals such as pigs and other human beings which our player character can mind control using a cap that he wears on his head. [spoiler] Later, after a strange incident where our player character is drowned by a mermaid creature, our player character gains the ability to breathe underwater permanently and also can mind control other human beings effortlessly without the use of a mind control cap. [/spoiler] Why is our player character able to mind control other creatures and human beings? What does this mind control ability symbolize? What are those other human beings who move like zombies in the game world and who do they symbolize or represent? I feel that Inside is less disturbing than Limbo though because there is more \"humanity\" in the other humanoid creatures found in the game world. In Limbo most of the other human like creatures want to kill the player character except for one - the female character whom the player character gets to meet at the end of the game. In Inside, the player character can get many other humanoids to help him progress the game by mind controlling them. In Limbo, the player character is very much on his own, which exacerbates the feeling of loneliness when we, the player controls him to overcome the puzzles and challenges in the game world. In Inside, we can feel that our player character gets more powerful as the game progresses due to the abilities he gains while playing the game but in Limbo, the player character practically remains very much the same throughout the game, which gives us the perception that Limbo is a much more difficult game than Inside. Both games also have an open-ended ending which leaves the players wondering what happened at the end of the game.

The constant simplistic, yet ominous view of what's on screen, the phenomenal sound design that really did not have to be this good and the ambiguity of the story are what easily makes this game for me a 10/10.

With a decent, diegetic tutorial of the mechanics you're expected to use and the removal of objects that should follow patterns, but do not, the puzzles themselves are practically flawless.\n- Difficulty: Difficulty in games comes from them being 1 or a combination of 3 things: challenging, punishing, and bad. Inside is not hugely challenging, and not punishing at all. It's more or less about the difficulty a game like this should be. \n\nThe Bad:\n- Tutorialisation: Inside lacks tutorials, which is mostly not a real problem because there aren't too many mechanics but does get frustrating. The designers need to learn the difference between \"not holding the player's hand\" and \"not telling the player what the world is capable of or what is expected of them\". There is no tutorial, there is mostly no demonstration of mechanics (you're just expected to already know what they are and how to use them). It's the difference between tough-love and parental neglect. You are put into puzzles that I'm sure the solutions of are obvious to the designers, but are obtuse and arbitrary to a player. \n- Gameplay: The movement is not good. No, it's not an action combat game or a tight platformer where the ability to control the minute movements of your character is essential to being any good at the game, but the kid is awful to control. He's simultaneously floaty and heavy, it's like controlling a balloon filled half-and-half with water and air. Most of this problem could be fixed by just making him stop more quickly, but maybe that's a stylistic decision, maybe they really wanted to make you so irritated with this child that you aren't even disappointed when he gets eaten by dogs, who knows? But there is also several sections where you could really stand to benefit from being able to control him more precisely: there's some sections where the timing is quite tight, and making a small mistake risks an immediate death, but he doesn't control well enough to so you WILL die until you can do it perfectly, which just takes you out of the game's world and frustrates you (I'm talking about that last mermaid section).\n\nThe Rest:\nI don't really think there's a 'story', per se, because there is never any explanation as to why the things that are happening are happening, nor much environmental storytelling to explain what's going on, why, or how. Absolutely nothing about the scenario is explained, and that's a weakness for someone like me because I quite like games with a plot, and it's a great shame because the plot could have been fantastic if they'd put as much effort into it as they put into the jiggle physics of the blob at the end of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nYeah, it's pretty good.

[/b]\n\nINSIDE is a side view story game where you go through different obstacles to make your way through the story. It is more horror themed and makes you kind of question things during the story. It is psychological horror mostly, and some of the puzzles that you will experience will be so anxiety inducing that you may or may not pi$$ yourself. \n\n[b] Initial Thoughts: [/b]\n\n-\"Okay, okay cool controls.\"\n-\"OMG PIGGIES AND ANIMALS YAY\"\n-\"oh no....\"\n\n[b] Beginner Player Friendly?  [/b]\n\nThis game has very basic controls, though if you are not ready for a intense psychological horror with a lot gore and death. (So if you are sensitive to that I would not recommend this game for you as a beginner game.) If you are into the psychological horror in movies and such then this game may be for you! It definitely has an intense story. THOUGH some parts are kind of mentally challenging to get through and the puzzles can be very confusing at times, so if you are not ready to be mentally challenged then maybe this game is not beginner friendly for you.\n\n[b] Game Play: [/b]\n\nThe game play involves a side view of your character and loads of puzzles you have to get through as you consistently move forward to reach your destination. You don't really fight anyone or thing and its more you run away a lot of the time. You do have to swim, climb, jump, and bolt your way through this story in order to stay alive and get to the end.\n\n[b] Graphics: [/b]\n\nThe graphics are really interesting, as you will notice right away none of the characters have any faces really. It makes for an interesting plot line. The graphics are beautiful but still maintain pretty simple. This game will not run your computer/console to the ground if you play it for hours on end so that is also cool!\n\n[b] Community: [/b]\n\nThere is not much of a community, though the steam community for this game seem pretty friendly and have loads of helpful guides for the game!\n\n[b] How long can you play? [/b]\n\nThe story itself is around 3 hours long, maybe 4 at most, then if you would like to achievement hunt it may take you a little longer. Realistically you can play as many times as you want and for as long as you want.\n\n[b] My Opinion: [/b]\n\nIn my opinion this game is really nice if you want a quick story horror game. Though it may not be good if you want a game that will make you go into the 100+ hours and meet people and such. \n\n[i] Any edits that are made with this review will be added here: [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1686626075, "timestamp_updated": 1686626075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139975587": {"recommendationid": "139975587", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036632690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 236, "last_played": 1686007927}, "language": "english", "review": "So much nostalgia for this game as well as the similar Little Nightmares series, it's one of my favorite games and it's under 3 hours long.

I didn't enjoy this game. \n\nYou know what I did enjoy, back in 2010? A little indie game called Limbo. It was a simplistic, shorter game in which you played a scared little child running left to right in foreboding, shadow-silhouetted environments. It had a control scheme that only used a few buttons,  a minimalist soundtrack, and a pretty much non-existent story sprinkled with hints of pretentiousness.  You spent the first thirty or so minutes fleeing a giant demon-spider, followed by two hours of traipsing through dull, boring, insipid, ruined warehouses and factories. Honestly, if you stopped after the demon-spider died, you did yourself a favor. Oh, and every death animation was brutal and cruel. Said animations shocked you the first couple of times, but then lost all meaning as desensitization kicked in. \n\nLimbo pretty much kicked off the \"scared child in spooky nightmare land\" indie genre. A seemingly endless litany of similar indie games followed in its wake, each slightly more tedious than the last. Almost none reached the lofty heights that Limbo did with its freaky-deaky giant demon-spider. \n\nSo what did Limbo's developers do to follow up their success? This game, which would have been more aptly titled Limbo 1.5. You're still a little kid, running left to right in a big, bad world. Only, there's no demon spider hunting you through a big pine forest for thirty minutes. Instead, you run from some blokes and their dogs as they chase you across a small patch of forest and some corn fields. Then, the obligatory two plus hours of run-down, dimly lit, gray-colored warehouses, factories, and research facilities kick in. It's dull. Exceedingly dull, and the muted sounds and minimalist soundtrack DO NOT HELP MATTERS. On the plus side, the last ten minutes of the game veer wildly into a psychotic, non-sequitur blob sequence that makes no sense whatsoever, but feels like a generous reprieve from the afore-mentioned tedium. \n\nIt just did not work for me. The deaths lost all impact ten minutes in. The level variety left a lot to be desired. The story was non-existent and abysmally shallow (though that hasn't stopped hardcore fans from filling in the massive blanks with their empty conjectures and pseudo-theories). I was checking my timer 20 minutes in and praying that the game would end soon. Never crashed, ran fine, and seemed polished. Just not my cup of tea. This genre is clearly not for me. \n\nBut... if you're a fan of this genre, here's another one of them. It's made by the people who put this genre on the map, so you're going to get what you're looking for. If you're not a fan, I might recommend Limbo instead. Same developers, same ambiance, similar control scheme, and same general polish. It sells for a fairly low price nowadays and the first thirty minutes with the giant demon-spider are wonderful. Tense, freaky, and off-putting. Again, just make sure to stop immediately after you have bested the eight legged terror.  You'll have seen the best this genre has to offer and can move on. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1685839139, "timestamp_updated": 1685839139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139492050": {"recommendationid": "139492050", "author": {"steamid": "76561199480948348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1686171984}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything about this game is perfect.

With its haunting visuals, atmospheric sound design, and thought-provoking narrative, INSIDE delivers a captivating and unforgettable experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of INSIDE is its visual design. The game's dark and atmospheric environments, rendered in minimalist yet highly detailed graphics, create a sense of unease and mystery. The use of light and shadow, combined with subtle animations and seamless transitions, adds depth and immersion to every scene. The visuals work in perfect harmony with the game's narrative, unraveling its dark secrets and unveiling a dystopian world filled with sinister undertones.\n\nThe sound design in INSIDE is equally remarkable. The haunting ambient sounds, eerie melodies, and atmospheric effects contribute to the game's oppressive atmosphere, heightening the sense of tension and unease. The lack of traditional dialogue or exposition allows the player to immerse themselves fully in the experience, interpreting the story through visual and auditory cues, deepening the sense of mystery and intrigue.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of INSIDE are simple yet ingeniously designed. As the protagonist, players navigate through a series of challenging puzzles and platforming sequences, utilizing the environment and manipulating objects to progress. The puzzles gradually increase in complexity, requiring keen observation and experimentation to overcome. The fluid controls and intuitive mechanics make for a smooth and satisfying gameplay experience, ensuring that the focus remains on the exploration and the unraveling of the narrative.\n\nThe narrative of INSIDE is a masterpiece in subtlety and ambiguity. It slowly unveils a thought-provoking and metaphorical tale, inviting players to interpret its meaning and symbolism. The game's deliberate pacing and meticulously crafted set pieces create an unsettling and mesmerizing narrative arc that leaves a lasting impact. The lack of explicit exposition allows for personal interpretation, making each playthrough a unique and introspective experience.\n\nINSIDE's concise but profound storytelling is complemented by its impeccable pacing. The game masterfully balances moments of tension and quiet introspection, providing a captivating rhythm that keeps players engaged from start to finish. The gradual reveal of the world's secrets and the protagonist's journey through various environments create a sense of wonder and curiosity, propelling the player forward.\n\nWhile INSIDE's brevity may be seen as a drawback by some, the game's concise length is a testament to its focus and artistic integrity. It is a tightly woven experience, leaving a lasting impact in its relatively short playtime.\n\nIn conclusion, INSIDE is an atmospheric and thought-provoking masterpiece. With its haunting visuals, immersive sound design, and enigmatic narrative, the game invites players on a deeply introspective and emotionally charged journey.

Inside has you control a boy who seems to be running from the dystopian world that surrounds him.  Either the humanoids that he meets on his journey are slumped or under some type of control, sometimes yours, or they are after you knowing that you are not conforming to the rest that are slumped or under control.\n\nInside plays as a simple 2.5D platforming game with puzzles to help you move along the continuous level.  The games lasts about 4 hours, all while dodging enemy humanoid, dogs, and robots.  In order to solve puzzles you can control other enslaved humanoids to help you move heavy items, throw you to hard to reach areas, and more.\n\nThe palette for Inside is rather dark, not as much contrast as Limbo, there original game, but still quite a dark palette nonethless.  The main character is what has the most colors, everything else is a different type of grayish type of color.  This makes for quite a somber atmosphere which fits well in the Orwellian world that you journey through.\n\nThere was nothing difficult in this game that can't be figured out after 2-3 tries in the most difficult of areas, but the unnarrated story of the world you experience mixed with the smooth animated characters movement makes for a satisfying game to play.  The graphics are quite good.  The water effects of your every step, the bending of the boards as you cross over empty spaces, all add to a believable world that you are running around in.  The devs did a good job of the added details in the graphics and animations and really used lighting to its best of effects here.\n\nThe music matches the graphics, simple, somber, and dark while the sounds work well whether driving around in a submarine, or hearing the grunts of control humanoids falling off a high platform.  Overall everything matches well together to create a good sense of immersion.\n\nYou can easily play this game in one playthrough as I did, it is that good and that short.  No matter the length, I enjoy a game that provides all it can give and not stretch it out just by adding fluff, this game was perfectly paces and perfectly designed for levels that would increasingly be difficult, but not so difficult as to stump you.  If you get the chance, check this game out, I'm certain that you can get it for a great price, especially during some great sales.

I uninstalled the game and reinstalled, rebooted whatever and nothing worked still no achievement, not a single one. So I tried loading chapters after doing a full reinstall of the game but nothing worked so it left me a very sour note when I finished it. \n\nIf you ever get to play this game, it is a 3-5 hours game so i'd strongly suggest to do it in one sitting but on my part I couldn't even stop. Why? Because the game isn't like other games, it feels more like a movie than checkpoints .. I know what I mean lmao\n\nThe mystery in which it drops us  achieve to keep it up for the whole game. No scene in this game is similar, nothing is repetitive. The physics of our character is AMAZING, when he fears you see it, when he fall or tumble over something there's some falls that are unique it's hard to explain but it feels like the character we're playing has a life of it's own makes you drawn into the story even more. \n\nThe Artwork on this game coupled with fluid and amazing physics makes it one of the games.   LOL\n\nThe ending reminded me of a couple of sci-fi movie that goes from 1 to a 100 in minutes.

Could maybe have used a TOUCH more color.\n+ Most puzzles are tough enough to be satisfying, but even a tard like me didn't need a walkthrough. They all make sense and while they're very unique and diverse, they will probably be approachable if you apply logic from other video games.\n+ There's a real relishable weight to the movement and momentum. The player character has so many subtle little twitches and animations to interact with what's currently going on, and he usually feels good to control. The way your lobotomized followers bumble and crash around is fun to watch.\n+ Gameplay keeps changing itself to give you fresh new interactions. There's a submarine section that was particularly fun.\n+ Soundwork is great. Very minimal score, which suits the game. Foley work is very creepy, visceral, and great.\n+ The death/failure animations don't hold back. When the protagonist dies, he gets f*cking killed.\n+ A reasonably interesting story is told purely through the environment. I could have used maybe 20% less vagueness about some parts though.\n+ There seemed to be sort of a hackneyed dystopia element to the narrative at first especially being a vulnerable little boy in red running away from the industrialized, scary world... but that's revealed not to entirely be the case, and the final 1/4 of the game comes out of absolute nowhere and I feel cements this game's high reputation. It's not just a narrative reveal, it affects the rest of the gameplay too.\n\nBAD STUFF:\n- I really don't like to rate games by \"dollars per hour,\" but $20 is just way too much. It's one linear campaign that took me 3 hours, and nothing else besides some achievements. I think I got this for like $6 or something. Wait for a sale.\n- A couple puzzles were pretty oblique in their methodology, wherein a couple I got lucky from guesses and a couple more I tried the correct solution 2 or 3 times before it actually went through. \n- The complex physics and momentum don't always follow your inputs as well as they should. I screwed up the puzzles and died a handful of times because of this. This can be extra finicky in the otherwise great ending segment.\n\nGreat game. I've played these critically lauded 2D platformers before like Limbo and Braid, and didn't really find them super fun or impressive for someone not that into the genre.

I won't ruin it, in case anyone reading this still attempts to play this game, but it was like they got to a place in the story and didn't know how to end... so they just ended it and said, F-it.\n\nI'm glad I waited for this game to go on sale because I would be a lot more upset that I paid the original price for this garbage. This is not the quality of game I had expected from the makers of Limbo, which again, was a phenomenal game and I cannot say enough good things about that one. This one though, not worth the 3 hours. Not at all. I played through Limbo multiple times and there seemed like there were new things to see every time. I do not think I will ahve the same experience if I played through this again.\n\nI will give the Devs one good bit of feedback: the creepy water child was freaking terrifying and that was, hands down, the best part of the game. I really wish this game was better, I wanted it to be better than it is.

I found it almost impossible to put down until I had seen it through to the end. Each puzzle presented in the game was intriguing and didn't feel like a rehashed version of something I'd seen before. Every moment of the gameplay was enjoyable and managed to keep me engaged, making it a truly unique experience that I haven't encountered in ages.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Inside\" is an exceptional gaming experience that I cannot recommend highly enough. It is an amazing blend of atmospheric music, unique storytelling, and intuitive gameplay. This game is a must-play for anyone looking for a fresh, engaging, and rewarding experience.", "timestamp_created": 1683736467, "timestamp_updated": 1683736570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138087826": {"recommendationid": "138087826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095263665", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 395, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1683719123}, "language": "english", "review": "Inside is a 2.5D puzzle-platformer by Playdead, and it continues their tradition of having a unique look, a colored, low-poly artstyle this time. You play as a boy who is hunted by government agents. After running through dystopian streets filled with mindless people and empty fields, he would have to cross a mysterious research facility. It does raise the question, is this facility simply on the way, or does he have a greater mission? \n\nStory plays an important part, in fact this game is more story-based and less puzzle-platformer than its predecessor Limbo. The puzzles here feel natural, like how you must use the items around you to progress, instead of being puzzles for the sake of puzzles. For example, in some parts you can gather mindless people to progress. You can lead them and with their help, move heavy objects or reach higher ledges. There's no annoying precision platforming such as \"jump down the slide at the right time to reach next platform and avoid these unnaturally large saws\". And while timing-reliant stuff still exists, the timing is a lot more forgiving.\n\nThe level variation is another good thing, there are many, but they also feel real and natural. There are forests, farms, flooded labs, mines, etc. The enemy encounters, which are my favorite parts of Limbo, are also more common here and are fun to dealt with, like hiding from guards and running from dogs. It reminds me more of Little Nightmares, another great puzzle-platformer with a creepy atmosphere. There are also collectibles, don't forget to seek these mysterious orbs out for achievements and an alternate ending that might make things a bit clearer... even though its still confusing.\n\nOverall, I think Inside is a major improvement from Limbo, which to be honest I don't really like. The most important thing is that its easier and more story-based rather than puzzle-platforming, I never felt frustrated during my whole run. If you enjoy puzzle-platformers and story-based games you will have a great time with this title.

I had quite a lot of fun trying to figure out the solutions to the problems and obstacles found along the way. It is not a frenetic experiencie, it is not a guns blazin' experience, it is a puzzle game with some platorming and sidcrolling within it. [u]If you are looking for an assasins creed or a call of duty, this may not be your game.[/u]\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\nThis game has the simplest control configuration I have had the pleasure to deal with in a very long time. Only 6 buttons are required to play this game, up down left right and 'A' for grabbing or interacting and 'B' for jumping, almost reminds of the old NES and Gameboy games. This sentence alone should let readers know about the implicit simplicity of the mechanics you shall encounter in this game. Although do not be missguided into thinking that the game is boring.\n\n[h1]Atmosphere:[/h1]\nThis is one of the strong points of the game, the atmosphere is well developed and established although probably not the main focus of the game as it would be in a horror title. It sets the mood rather well for the environment it all happens in and is a piece of added flavour to the game.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThis game is for the kind of player that likes to observe, theorize and reflect upon what is seen, constantly, because nothing will ever be said nor directly implied. The lore of the game seems to be a big question mark and that may be a very good choice for this game, although I like to have my anwsers figured out, this game does a marvelous job in delivering a story masked as 'almost nothing really'. It does that in a way that creates questions, constantly, that drives the player forward for answers that only bring more questions.\n\n[h1]Graphics:[/h1]\nThe graphics are one of the positives aspects of the game. Although in many parts of the game the graphics and scene become extremely dark and you may want to increase your brightness against that. I loved the artistic style, it is very nicely executed, but it is quite a saddening thing that it was not more extensively explored within vivid colours. One may argue that for the sake of the atmosphere there could not be many vibrant tones, but being almost monocromatic, at times, may risk being repetitive, Nontheless, I truly enjoyed the graphics, the 'flaw' I mentioned, seemes to have had a purpose.\n\n[h1]replayability[/h1]\nClose to zero to be completely honest.\nI only mention this because of the alternate ending. To find it, it had me go through the game again, and look for the pieces of the game that i had missed the first run. Otherwise there is no replayability whatsoever,\nunless you want to figure out the story for yourself and theorize about what happened within the game universe. Also, good F***ing luck finding those collectibles you need for the alternate ending, there is one specific piece that had me sweat for a big while, then jump to google due to my frustration. Also, there is one specific puzzle, always within the replayability context, that i would have never figured out on my own, my low IQ may be showing here, but a little hint may be good for players. Feels like they expected people to google stuff out [spoiler] Me being salty [/spoiler].\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI truly enjoyed the game. Bought it for 2\u20ac and got 30 hours worth of fun. Passing around the controller when getting stuck was a nice experience with my wife. The type of gameplay, rather relaxing and head-scratch inducing, sometimes, turned up the speed and had you go in some sort of more action-like gameplay moments at others. Alltogether, the story, the atmosphere, the gameplay, simpliciy and pace resulted in a well developet product that deserves praise.

This, alone, is a huge reason as to why I like this game so much. INSIDE is clever with its puzzles, has fantastic escape sequences, it's unapologetic and gruesome. Even the narrative alone is this depressing, dark, wicked, incredibly-interesting yet terrifically-done tale on Class and Human Testing. (Of which, sadly I will not go into due to spoilers.) In summary - it's incredibly well made.\n\nIn large, the world-building is phenomenal - every scene means something and Playdead makes anything you may go through count. Watching the sleepwalkers mark in unison, realising what is happening in the factories and other places alike. It's disturbing but once again, so, so interesting. Especially on your first play-through. The puzzles are also fantastic. (As you would expect from a puzzle game.) They fit the world perfectly and it even 1-ups Playdeads previous game, LIMBO. INSIDE does what LIMBO did but just better; the lack of UI. Though, with INSIDE, it's cleaner and polished. The intricate use of colour design makes the experience as a whole even better. It clues you in better - it's straightforward as to what you can interact with but by no means does it give the puzzle away entirely. Plus, it's worth noting, how that when you mess up a puzzle, you can tell where you went wrong. Did I just get torn to shreds by one of the dogs? Okay, maybe I should've been more patient. Stuff like that.\n\nAnother large aspect I like about this game is just how well it flows. Going smoothly from one environment to another - gives you a large range of puzzles without it seeming abrupt or forced. It's honestly great. And, it's in this regard, that INSIDE's visual style and design are just on another level entirely. The enemies appear and you deal with them, and even how they progress and change throughout the game too is beyond amazing. It's such a simple concept when put like that but something INSIDE nails. Something I will quickly mention though (it's a part of the trailer so no spoilers here) - the sequence where you have to blend in with the sleepwalkers felt fantastic with the game's flow. It was unexpected but you just have to go with it knowing that one wrong move and you're a goner again. It happens but it's not abrupt. Again, something this game nails. Even despite it being one of the most straightforward parts of the game it's incredibly nerve-wracking. \n\nSomething I feel isn't mentioned enough though is this game's sound design. Every noise and crack and bang is finely tuned to immerse you further into the experience. The dogs barking, the jostling of a chain fence, it's silent when it needs to be, loud bangs fit, the no dialogue - all uninterrupted. \n\nIn conclusion, there are no UI prompts, no minimaps, no score, no timer, and no health or stamina bar - it's immersive and incredibly interesting. As much as I love the narrative of INSIDE and as much as I would love to see it more - it's something that shouldn't be replicated or copied. I'm glad INSIDE has its own, unique story and especially in the way it's presented to you. I just wish other video games learnt from this sort of storytelling. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683547610, "timestamp_updated": 1683547610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

INSIDE is a very well made and beautifully executed indie game, similar to Playdead's other game LIMBO, INSIDE is pretty much that game but everything done just 10 times better making it seriously one of the best indies ive played in recent years, the puzzle platforming is better then ever with the interactive gameplay still being simple but offering a great challenge to accomplish with alot more environmental objects to mess around with and manipulate. The presentation is 10/10 with 2.5D visuals, a very dark and depressing atmosphere that is way  more brooding than LIMBOs and a very obscure and non dialogue story that is executed at its best with set pieces and puzzle interactions.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic indie game to bash out in 3-5 hours and have a unique experience that's exclusive to this game, definitely check out INSIDE.

Maybe twice to get all the achievements (and to see the alternate ending which by the way is just as dark and unexpected as the regular ending), but any more than that and the game just doesn't have the same effect because you already know what's to come.\n\nIt's well worth the money though, even just to play it once.

Hinting at a story line ever so quietly as you navigate what the title suggests is it's namesake, a mirrored world between the spiritual one and the living. It was left to my interpretation by the end of 'Limbo' and left me theorizing for weeks about it's strange nature. Then, just the other day, I discovered yet another Playdead horror puzzle masterpiece- 'Inside.' 'Inside' spits you into a world that seems to parallel the one in 'Limbo' in many ways, the hint going so far as to shove a giant fallen neon 'E' letter right in your face as you explore a city not unlike the one in limbo- An 'E' that is seen as part of a 'HOTEL' sign in 'Inside's' sister game. With unlock-able achievements and thrilling puzzles and more hints at lore than I could have ever asked for, Inside is sure to leave me re-examining my theories on 'Limbo' and forming new ones from 'Inside' for weeks. The ending was ambiguous enough to leave anyone stumbling over theories- and it's hidden alternate ending hints towards some more than others. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves science fiction, dystopian thriller/horror games, and to anyone who can stomach a few notable less than savory levels. And of course, anyone with a good brain on them who loves a good puzzle, all of them thinkers, and plenty of stumpers that make you go 'a-ha!' Once you get them.
