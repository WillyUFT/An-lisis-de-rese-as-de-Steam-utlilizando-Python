The character design of our lead protagonist, kanata wielding, maid outfit wearing female combat android 2B, leaned into its anime roots with impressive conviction. Your mileage may vary, I was interested. The first hints of the plot were intriguing, and the frenetic combat system impresses with tight, reactive controls and a rich collection of scenarios and game modes. \n\nThe color scheme, on the other hand, limits itself to muted colors and sparse textures, giving the entire game world a worn, washed-out feeling. The choice of having about an hour of tutorial without the opportunity of a save point seems weirdly cruel and antiquated, especially because that first hour has a really steep difficulty curve. Said tutorial also neglects to introduce any of the RPG elements in the game\u2019s collection. So when I was finally let loose in its modestly dimensioned open world, I wasn\u2019t quite sold on it. \n\nThings improve at a slow but steady rate, though. A growing stable of weapons and other upgrades bring variety and novelty into the combat. The spectacle fighter mechanics click somewhat with the bullet hell shooter elements that show up whenever one of the enemies has a gun.  The plot picks up and maintains steam on its way to some very weird and intriguing places. Side quests surprise with quirkiness and and often surprising depth. \n\nQuestions remain, though: Why is almost every enemy a variation on the theme \u201crusty beer can\u201d? Why is our protagonist so cold towards her enchantingly naive sidekick? Why do I have the option to kill my protagonist by deinstalling her OS? \n\nOn the gameplay side of things, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t smooth sailing either: Over time, I settled on a combination of weapons and upgrades that broke the difficulty curve, and at that point, combat started becoming samey, except for the impressive boss fights. The dialogue seemed stilted and inelegant. The game kept its fast travel mechanics locked for a little too long and its ultimate gear upgrades were a little too grindy to obtain to bother with for me. \n\nAnd then the game ended with a moderately satisfying ending, dumped me into the main menu, winked at me and gesticulated towards the \u201cNew Game\u201d button. Which dumped me into the shoes of emo twink 9S, who had so far been the sidekick. \n\nAnd so I went through the whole story again, but with a lot more context this time. Also, there were instances in the first playthrough where 2B and 9S had split up, and the stuff 9S was up to during these times threw an entirely new light on things. Gameplay added a lot more bullet hell shooter elements, and the weird, impenetrable little plot kept growing and changing and turning into this epic greek tragedy, until a terrifying climax left me shaken, looking at the main menu and hitting the \u201cNew Game\u201d-Button again, impatient to what would be different this time. \n\nEverything, as it turned out: playthrough 3 hides the second part of the game. The plot keeps escalating and escalating, the existential dread is turned up to eleven. Time ceases to have any meaning. The fourth wall shudders and cracks. Several tens of hours filled with escalations and re-interpretations later, the game finds a suitably weird, thought-provoking and mind-blowing ending. \n\nAnd then, the god-damn end credits turn into a unique, sublime mind fuck of an EXPERIENCE I would on the pain of death not dare spoil, but which every gamer on this planet should experience.                                             Seriously, it\u2019s that good.\n\nAnd when I was done picking my chin up from the floor, something amazing happened: All the weirdness, all the inexplicably awkward design choices revealed themselves to be the outgrowths and consequences of a uniquely strong artistic vision. Seriously, I can practically see the contempt on Yoko Taro\u2019s face while he blazes past every fork on the road that would increase player comfort but even slightly tarnish the coherence and integrity of his creation. I mean, I realize this was a work of a small army of creative talents, but they must have had a mind meld going on in that studio of theirs, because I, at least, really felt like I connected to a person through this one, a visionary artist with a few blind spots in map and UI design, and maybe a bit too much into waifish maids. \n\nThe Credits. Man, those credits. \n\nTLDR: The story people have played this long ago, as every one of them should. The gameplay tribe should know that the offerings here are serviceable to good, but you\u2019ll get to be gobsmacked with the rest of us, and isn\u2019t that kind of experience the reason we\u2019re here, after all?

The worst of which is, and i kid you not, if you move your mouse in a circle you start petting your pod/droid which causes you to stand dead still for 4 seconds even if you are mid combat. This has happened HUNDREDS of times already for me and caused very annoying deaths, and there is no way to turn it off. I also really dislike the dodge being a WASD double click and can't change that either.\n\n2) The camera switches between 3D, top-down and side view. When this works well it can make platforming smoother but most of the time it just feels like the game is taking control away from you and makes it harder to look at what you want to.\n\n3) Bullet-hell gameplay sucks. I'm here for the story and combat. To me these sections feel like a boring and unforgiving mini-game.\n\n4) Tutorial is way too hard, long and contains no checkpoints. At the end there is a boss fight who has several insta-kill attacks that kick you back 30 minutes of grueling tutorial with unstoppable dialogue. And the strange thing is that it gets so much easier once the main game stars. The tutorial has literally the sharpest difficulty spike and least forgiving save system in the whole game for no reason.\n\n5) Your sidekick loves pushing you off ledges and getting in front of people you want to talk to and chests you want to open, causing you to speak to him instead.\n\n6) Melee combat is more fun, but the game heavily incentivizes you to just constantly run from the enemy while shooting backwards.\n\nAs I started out saying, I really want to like this game, the philosophical themes really resonate with me, the writing is clever and the world pretty. All in all I will probably finish the game for these reasons but for a AAA game that has been out for so long there are just a stupid amounts of annoyances.", "timestamp_created": 1700615643, "timestamp_updated": 1700615643, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150776550": {"recommendationid": "150776550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086710014", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2193, "last_played": 1688569979}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful storyline, brilliant graphics and a beautiful soundtrack.

I Heard good things about the game around when it was released but didn't play it. 6 months ago I started to listen to the game soundtrack and fell in love with it. A month ago I started playing the game and recently finished it. Now when I listen to the soundtrack, it's hard not to cry. This game is a gut-wrenchingly sad but beautiful tale that has left me to spend a good deal of time putting the pieces together, contemplating what the intended message of the story actually is. It's by now means a perfect game, and many of the \"flaws\" are a matter of taste or  opinion, but if you enjoy the opening act, chances are you'll enjoy the entirety of the game. \n\nFor me, the soundtrack alone would have made the game worth playing. I listen to a lot of music variety and the score from this game is very close to the top of anything I've heard.\n\n The movement and fighting mechanics feel very good but I think they are under-utilized. Given that the game has 4 difficulty levels, the majority of fighting mechanics feel superfluous and entirely unnecessary, though I only played the game on level 2 (normal). Mostly it comes down to whether you can evade/jump at the correct time to dodge attacks and how quickly you can button mash the same 3 basic attacks to hack through enemies. I enjoyed the fighting mechanics, but I don't see myself going back and repeating the game at a higher difficulty level. \n\nThe side content is interesting and often tries to hide some deeper meaning within, but is mostly unnecessary to the overall game. That's the curse of open-world style games, I guess. Most side quests have some amusing/charming elements to them, but sometimes they just feel like a slog and weren't very well polished. It sort of feels like the director focused his attention on the main quest and let the interns work on the side-quests, only ensuring that the writing agreed with the overall plot of the game. In other words, they are hit-or-miss. \n\nThe main factor that makes this game a massive hit is the plot and storytelling of the main quest line. It takes the ideas of many Western philosophers and presents them in a way that is emotional and entertaining. It tries to make you think about life. And death. And this is where you will either love or hate this game. I'm not even sure there is an in-between. The opening act should determine whether it's a game you'll enjoy. Obviously I loved it, and will be returning to play some of the director's other games...", "timestamp_created": 1700529433, "timestamp_updated": 1700529433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

The fast, fluid movement feels so satisfying to play. Hacking is also very fun!\nThe graphics are incredible and the music is god-tier\nThis game is so full of content, and there are secrets everywhere. Rather than putting out a half-baked, unfinished mess, PlatinumGames really put their heart and souls into making a completed game, and it definitely shows.\n\nThere are a few bad parts too:\nGetting all achievements is a grind\nSometimes this game tries to be too immersive. For example, there are many long sections of the game where the pause menu is completely disabled, so you cannot save or load data. Meaning your only option is to hard reset the game, which will cause you to lose progress! This is just poor game design.\nThe \"Hard\" difficulty is unbalanced. I chose to play the game on this difficulty thinking it would make combat more interesting, but really all it does is make enemies hit 3x harder. So for anything but the weakest enemies, you're basically a one-shot kill.\n\nOverall, the bad parts that I mentioned are extremely minor compared to all the good things about Nier: Automata. It's a well-rounded, complete game, and as someone who has never played a game like this before, I was constantly surprised with every new thing I saw.

This game has not been fully fixed with updates. The PC port had a lot of known issues when it was first released and when I originally started playing you had to download a MOD to fix the most basic issues (FAR). I was told the game has received multiple updates since that time that should fix the problems, but I still experience random crashes playing this game. I have zero stability issues with my PC and no issues with anything else crashing. Brand new clean install of Windows 10, Latest Nvidia drivers and the game still closes itself periodically. There are no error messages or any indication that anything is wrong with the game. I'm playing on a 12600K, 3060ti and gen4 nvme drive. The crashes happen at completely random points so sometimes I may get 20 minutes of playing in before the game closes and other times maybe i can play for an hour. Did I mention the game only lets you save and very specific areas and the autosave is very unforgiving? You will be replaying a lot of content, which brings me to the game itself. \n\n\n\nThis game gets in the way of itself. I do not find the repeated playthrough method of story telling very enjoyable. When I first beat route A and popped into route B to start playing 90% of the exact game again, but this time as 9S I almost immediately lost interest in the game. The new content was sprinkled so few and far between and was things like, you may see one 20 second cutscene you didn't see on your first playthrough and then are back to the same quests, the same horrible to traverse map, (the map system in this game is also awful), killing the same enemies and following the same main quest. I stopped playing for over two years because of this, but since I do enjoy many aspects of this game I decided to give it another shot recently. After beating playthrough B, playthrough C starts with a huge difficulty spike. I was level 40 upon entering the C playthrough and the lowest enemies I was encountering were 45. Many of the enemies were all the way up to level 60 and could nearly one shot me. The game floods you with extremely annoying tactics to inflate difficulty like making you lose the ability to move your character, lose the ability to attack, lose the ability to jump, lose the ability to see (98% of your screen a massive red blob of pixels while you're fighting huge mobs of extremely over leveled enemies). Even with this I still pushed through, because I was determined to beat this game. I am now quite close to the end and still can't finish the game thanks to it randomly closing. There is a lot to like about this game, the world is interesting, the actual gameplay itself is fun and varied, the characters are likeable, etc, but so much gets in the way of just experiencing the story. Many herald it as one of the best games ever because of this, but I do not find this an enjoyable method of experiencing a game especially in this day in age where I have very limited time to play games and an endless backlog. \n\n````` \n\nJust to be fair I am updating my review. I tried to continue the game since I was desperate to finally finish this on my Garuda Linux install through Steam and it actually worked fine without crashing. Not sure what the deal is with the quirks I was having on my Windows install. The game overall is pretty great and I am happy I was able to see it through to the end and experience the ending. I would probably overall still recommend playing the Xbox version though so you don't have to deal with these potential crash issues. The game is definitely worth experiencing. I am going to go ahead and change my recommendation to recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1699096298, "timestamp_updated": 1699654474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149498022": {"recommendationid": "149498022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198886742099", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1904, "playtime_at_review": 2244, "last_played": 1700789277}, "language": "english", "review": "I really, really like this game.\n\nYes there is more to it than android waifus", "timestamp_created": 1699084821, "timestamp_updated": 1699084821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149495278": {"recommendationid": "149495278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394126957", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1699160089}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego, muy buena historia, musica, jugabilidad. una joya", "timestamp_created": 1699080490, "timestamp_updated": 1699080490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149494346": {"recommendationid": "149494346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180448229", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 9154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "playtime_at_review": 9075, "last_played": 1699687389}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun adventure", "timestamp_created": 1699078895, "timestamp_updated": 1699078895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149494071": {"recommendationid": "149494071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829158038", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 811, "last_played": 1698655820}, "language": "english", "review": "greatest game ever made, straight up", "timestamp_created": 1699078439, "timestamp_updated": 1699078439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149492708": {"recommendationid": "149492708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190231398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 435, "last_played": 1699075933}, "language": "english", "review": "for 39,99\u20ac this is 100% not worth buying, maybe back in 2017 it would be, today its just not it. These type of games are dead imo with the boring gameplay that we've gotten from day 1.\n\nQuality is decent, gameplay is meh, story seems nice, overall I'd give it a 2/5 rating very close to 3/5, might change my mind later when I put more hours in it.\n\nthe only thing thats carrying the game and the rating 2/5 that I give it is the decent story, animation, design, quality and thats about it. Honestly the gameplay is just not it. I dont get how people can enjoy all the mindless grinding doing almost the same thing over and over against npcs, not fun. And on top of that you get like what, 1 ability? and to get other abilities you need to swap with your current ability? come on now what kind of bs is this.There's like no progression other than stats and passives, its just so boring and mindless.\n\nOther negative things I'd like to mention is how boring the characters are, honestly I couldn't care less what happens to anyone here. Their design might be cool but there's no personality. Also the exploring factor of the game was so bad... I understand that teleports were introduced but imo it came too late, it was too late to save my 3 hours of just going from a place to another. 3 HOURS of TRAVELLING to PLAY the GAME. Why must you do this to me..\n\nAlways wanted to try Nier Automata since I saw and listened to many topics on it, but damn the gameplay is so mid and for the people that disagree, Idk what to tell you. Keep clicking your mouse 99% of the game and call it \"having fun\" with a million potions to just never die.\n\nAlso, another thing. I am not over exaggerating, but I do promise you that I almost fell asleep in my chair 2-3 times playing this game which is insane that a game can get that boring for me.", "timestamp_created":

of slasher genre either, so I can't say if this game is great slasher. I haven't played any other franchise games. The only thing I can say that this game has great atmosphere which was achieved by good locations design coupled with great soundtrack. The game is great, the plot, voice acting, character design everything keeps the experience consistent till the end of the game. The only spoiler I can give, is that the plot is not so deep or difficult to understand as everyone was saying when this game came out. I'd recommend getting it if you haven't played it, especially after the price was dropped (~15$ here).", "timestamp_created": 1698868345, "timestamp_updated": 1698868345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

For that, it is worth playing. The combat system is very crisp and free-flowing. If the visual style seems dreary, it's because the style is part of the message. Even if there is some repetitiveness, it's worth playing to the end to see how the story unfolds. \n\nIt's also worth playing Nier Replicant before this game to get more of the story. There are some important references to that game in this one. Nier Replicant (the remaster) is not as crisp as this one - it's an older game - but I think it has a stronger and more emotional story. It depends on your preference. I consider Nier Replicant a masterpiece, and this one comes in second to the first as a very original, artistic and well polished game.\n\nDefinitely something different and worth playing.

Every battle you're in feels impactful, from the overall just stunning visuals, to the unique rising music. \n\nIt's a third person action-adventure RPG with bullet hell combat elements. Think Devil May Cry meets any of the dodge and shoot projectiles before they overwhelm you genre. \n\nBattles will go from your typical third person action combat to a top down camera where you must bullet hell, to then put you in a sidescroller style locked camera, to shifting you into a aircraft to do your typical bullet hell things, to then have that aircraft transform into a gundam to do the top down bullet hell again. \n\nIt sounds like a lot, but it's so seemless, it teaches you fairly well and exposes you do different elements early. Progression is fantastic. Bosses are absolutely immersive. There's an open world element. That's not even touching on the actual plot or story for the world, which is equally interesting and very unique. Combat is tight and fun. A fair amount of customization options.\n\nI waited way too long to play this. I've hit the 6hr mark, haven't even scratched the surface of the game and already see exactly why people hail this game as a masterpiece. It was crafted with love, with attention to detail, with depth that you'd only get from PS1-PS2 era JRPGs in which the world is shameless exactly what the creator wants it to be and a story to tell regardless of how niche it might be. It becomes very clear some of the commentary being made about various subjects early on. \n\nThe only advice I give is that you have to work for your first chance to save. Make sure you're committed enough to get there. It's not incredibly difficult (I'm on normal difficulty), but I definitely got careless thinking  I'd probably respawn.

There is also some customization that can be done with your equipment chips which felt fairly unique in that you can remove UI elements for some additional power.\n\nLastly, the soundtrack of Nier:Automata is one of the best among all the games I have played so far and really elevates the entire game to another level of quality. I really liked the Chaos language tracks of each location in the game. Some standout tracks I liked was the theme park theme and Weight of the world which plays at the end credits. \n\nIn summary, Nier:Automata is definitely a must-play for fans of unique stories with great soundtracks.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698471800, "timestamp_updated": 1698471800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149024335": {"recommendationid": "149024335", "author": {"steamid": "76561199248720735", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8423, "last_played": 1698420289}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1698468523, "timestamp_updated": 1698468523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149015782": {"recommendationid": "149015782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855174273", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 321, "playtime_at_review": 3825, "last_played": 1700259673}, "language": "english", "review": "good game yeah", "timestamp_created": 1698455836, "timestamp_updated": 1698455836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149012427": {"recommendationid": "149012427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117780914", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1698711008}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1698450612, "timestamp_updated": 1698450612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148988334": {"recommendationid": "148988334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398073219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1700645288}, "language": "english", "review": "Hehe", "timestamp_created": 1698423698, "timestamp_updated": 1698423698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456630915403366089", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148969582": {"recommendationid": "148969582", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059343353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4537, "last_played": 1682777189}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply beautiful, I don`t have sufficient words to describe how much I liked it, so just try it and convince yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1698405468, "timestamp_updated": 1698405468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491224169731140137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148956405": {"recommendationid": "148956405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046267077", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 726, "last_played": 1698823777}, "language": "english", "review": "Horrible combat system.

(Beat the game on the normal difficulty) Don't be mistaken. Normal difficulty is just as hard as the hardest difficulty. It just doesn't reset your progress when you die that badly. The hardest difficulty has you replay the WHOLE chapter if you die. Not just up to the last save. The story reminded be of GFL quite a bit. Had this game in my library for a while but ended up playing it finally as the anime was airing. Ended up finishing the game before the anime finished because of covid... The anime ended up being quite different from the game. \n\n[spoiler]It took me 15 hours to unlock fast travel... Being able to replay any chapter of the story to get to the parts I haven't done was such a nice QOL thing. Which made going through all the endings well worth it. There is even a merchant that sales you the achievements once you're past a certain point of the game. Which is nice since I didn't have to grind for those bad ones.

I know they are connected. But for my gameplay experience it didn't effect me or I didn't felt like I needed to play other games to get the context. Also I want to keep this review spoiler free as much as possible.\n\n[h2]Story[/h2]\n\nStory is basically you play the role of android 2B and her assigned partner 9S as humans try to take the Earth as they take shelter in Moon. Story on surface level feels really simple but the more progress in the game the more you start to see cracks on this premise. What NieR:Automata does very well is asking you philosophical questions and come to conclusions about the actions you make in the course of the game. Overall, the story was stellar and once of a lifetime experience I would say.\n\n10/10\n\n[h2]Setting and Environments[/h2]\n\nNieR has an post-apocalyoptic setting which has tinge of sad but haunting beauty behind it. While some areas can feel colorful and vibrant, some areas feel a bit empty and not as interesting as the other locations. [spoiler]Looking at you desert.[/spoiler] Eventhough this is an open-world game it didn't have to be an open-world. In my opinion linear world would fit this game more because sometimes world can feel really empty like you are just going from A location to B location without anything interesting happening.\n\n7/10\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\n\nNieR might be a story heavy game but still shines in its combat thanks to PlatinumGames experience in this genre. Combat more revolves around weapons and chips(character upgrades basically) while different weapons offer you different playstyles while chips make you empower those builds or if you are struggling with the game help you in certain scenarios. Personally I'm not a fan of the Bullet Hell type of games and NieR has a lot of those still I throughly enjoyed it. Only criticism I can give is you have to finish the game 3 times to truly finish it. Second playthrough takes away a bit of your freedom and limits your playstyle. If you don't like the new mechanic it can be a bit dreading to play. Also eventhough second playthrough has an important part in the story it feels samey and gets boring real quick.\n\n8/10\n\n[h2]Graphics[/h2]\n\nAlthough this game isn't groundbreaking on it's graphics I would say it looks still beautiful. And it shows you with it's environments and characters. Overall nothing gorgeous but nothing atrocious. [i]Also you can modify the graphics and models with mods to make it more beautiful[/i]\n\n7/10\n\n[h2]Music[/h2]\n\nIf have to summarize the NieR's music I would simply say 'hauntingly beautiful'. Keiichi Okabe's work on this game elevates most of the areas and boss fight and sometimes even taking the spotlight I would say. Making it an unforgettable experience. I still listen to it this and never get tired of it.\n\n10/10\n\n[h2]Overall[/h2]\n\nNieR:Automata is a great game that I will not forget. It was an experience filled with happiness, anger and sadness. Especially the ending section.

Although most androids are sort of set with their own personality (coded personality for every robot type thing) and as always for robots, no emotions. I feel like its pretty niche and common but its not bad for a medium to progress through and I rarely see this sort of medium for a story that goes really well and at the top of my head that I can think of is Neon genesis evangelion which has this man vs nature type of conflict (idk if you can even consider the angels in NGE nature but you do your own research what type of conflict it is coz i sort of forgot my language shit) and I can see subtle hints throughout the story especially during route C. My favorite part about the game is 9S' character development throughout route B and C and as you play through it, you'll definitely notice that he slowly changing and you would not even remember that he had this type of personality at the first few hours of route A/B.\n\nGameplay is OKAY I guess and I honestly have no issues except for the hacking minigame which is horribly optimized for KB&M and you're actually forced to play a controller. It gets easier once you get to a certain point of getting good chips and weapons but its alright for me since I mainly focus on the story. Graphics is not an issue lol I played the game with low settings and it still looked clean for me. One issue though is that there are certain times that the facial expressions of the character would not match the dialogue and that really bugged me out since I dont know if this character is mad or not.\n\nOverall a great game, YOKO TARO is a fucking goat in story telling.

Even though I began with the handicap of action RPGs not being among my favourite gaming genres, I love games like these where you start as a complete stranger to its world, and you start learning more and more about its meaning, purpose and philosophy as you progress. Playing though the game? Could've been more fun... but understading and realizing what Yoko Taro and everyone involved with the script and story wanted to convey? That's why, despite everything, I can simply not dislike this game despite its evident (in my opinion) flaws, all accompanied with a brilliant soundtrack worthy of its accolades and well-written characters, both main and secondary.

wasn\u2019t able to give this game the sort of time and attention it probably deserves. Nier: Automata is a very unique and intriguing game, with lots of great ideas, but you have to play throughout at least a couple of times to start seeing all that it has to offer. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a huge backlog of games I\u2019m trying to get through right now, so I\u2019m just going to have to settle for the one playthrough. \n\nAnd that also means I\u2019m going to eventually watch a YouTube video to understand the story. Thing is, with only one playthrough, you only get a small sliver of what\u2019s going on. And holy hell, do I want to understand just what the hell was going on. I am left with so many questions about the story mode that I am endlessly curious about, and I wish I had the time to replay the game to have those questions answered. The small tidbits that I did experience, I absolutely loved. I think the best way to explain the story through the lens that you get is this: this game will constantly make you feel uncomfortable. Suddenly robots and the various antagonists will begin doing or carrying out sudden bouts of insanity, or something really strange will happen that you know there\u2019s a reason for, but you just don\u2019t know what that reason is. The imagery that some of these scenarios present will honestly stick with me forever- most notably, the return to the Factory will forever be burned in the back of my brain, and the screams of the robots yelling \u201cWE WILL BECOME GODS\u201d are living rent-free in my head right now. \n\nThe gameplay is solid. It\u2019s your typical hack-and-slash, so you\u2019ll already know if you like that sort of thing or not. I never found any of it particularly difficult in the Normal setting. The game will often do this fun thing where it\u2019ll change the perspective, and you\u2019ll suddenly be playing a side-scroller or top-down hack-n-slash, which I found novel, though I would have preferred the perspective to just never change most of the time. I do love how the UI is sort of tied into some of the game\u2019s mechanics- little things like your Memory, which is how you add on new capabilities to your character, being directly tied into whether you see your health bar or damage numbers (and there\u2019s even Memory already being used for your OS, which is how you\u2019re alive in the first place). Overall, the combat was nice, but nowhere near my favorite part of the game. \n\nThe game is pretty, albeit a bit muted in its color pallet at some points. The voice acting is well done. The music does a fantastic job of setting the uncomfortable and disturbing mood at numerous points throughout the game. Although plenty of people will disagree, I am going to say that I\u2019m not a fan of the outfit designs for a lot of characters (especially, of course, 2B). 2B felt like a very strong and interesting protagonist, but her outfit really took away from it. It just doesn\u2019t make sense- why would they build these combat androids and have \u2018em wear high heels and short frilly dresses? I don\u2019t get it, but I know plenty of people don\u2019t need a reason for it. \n\nObviously, this game is very replayable. I believe there are four or five different \u201cmain\u201d endings and about 20 more \u201cextra\u201d endings to discover. If I had the time, I would absolutely want to play again, and if you can, you absolutely should. That being said, a single playthrough is going to be a lot of fun, give you a lot of great moments, and will be well worth your time. \n\nI\u2019m really glad I played Nier: Automata and got to say that I \u201cbeat\u201d it, even though I know there\u2019s way more that I haven't discovered. If you have the time, please give this game at least one playthrough, and I can almost guarantee you\u2019ll want to play through it multiple times to uncover its secrets. It was a pleasure to have discovered this world and some new awesome characters like 2B and 9S, and I hope to see \u2018em again one day. \n", "timestamp_created": 1698008101, "timestamp_updated": 1698008101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148686913": {"recommendationid": "148686913", "author": {"steamid": "76561199209319273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1235, "last_played": 1698979770}, "language": "english", "review": "amazoning game", "timestamp_created": 1697997116, "timestamp_updated": 1697997116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148686865": {"recommendationid": "148686865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859465738", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2060, "last_played": 1697979540}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty amazing.

The strongest part of this game is the story, which I will admit is cool and is probably the major reason I was able to complete all of the \"core\" endings. That being said, however, the story has its issues and like before, I can't understand why so many think it is comparable to the greatest literary works in our world. I'll even go so far to say that if you haven't played at least Replicant, half the story will have very little impact on you and you'll probably actually dislike it. I also believe that the story doesn't really pick up and get \"decent\" until the 3rd ending, and it doesn't get \"good\" until the last ending.\n\nThe combat has a lot of potential but it isn't realized that well. There are a bunch of weapons, different combos, pods, chips, and upgrades. This is all well and good, until you recognize that all of that is pointless because the enemies are bland and repetitive. They barely react when you hit them (if it wasn't a 1 shot), and increasing difficulty just makes the fight take longer because the enemies now have 5 times the health, with no new AI or movesets. Upping the difficulty also increases enemy damage to a ridiculous amount and until you have leveled up and gotten some good chips, everything will 1-2 shot you. The difficulty scaling in this game in general is weird to me. Easy is pretty much just watching cutscenes with some button mashing in-between when you have to fight something. Normal is still just watching cutscenes with some button mashing in-between when you have to fight something. Hard jumps into unfair territory where you either pay in the most boring way possible to stay alive, or you are dead.\n\nAlthough I said the story is good, a lot of the characters involved are pretty bland. I know it was a design decision to make them like this, but it wasn't a good choice in my opinion. Many people will say there is a lot of character growth in this game, and I would like to disagree heavily. A great deal of the \"character development\" for Automata is established outside of this game in side material like the books/manga. The game itself hardly contains any of this context, so we are left with a lot of dry performances between characters that have no personality or chemistry.\n\nFollowing tradition from Replicant/Gestalt, the side quests are absolutely tedious and horrible. If I wanted to do fetch quests I would play an MMO. There are some gems hidden in the heap of trash, but good lord was it not worth the trouble sifting to find them.\n\nThis all leads up to my biggest gripe with the game: rail shooter sections. I understand the desire this series has to change genres rapidly, but holy hell why are there rail shooter segments? Not only why are they there, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY OF THEM? Who likes these? I almost stopped playing every time one of these pop up, including right at the very beginning of the game.\n\nTLDR and my major takeaway: When they are on sale, pick up Nier Replicant and Automata. Play through all of Replicant's endings (better game IMO), and then try to get to ending E in Automata. These are good games and while they have issues I think they are worth a playthrough if you snag them on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1697864069, "timestamp_updated": 1697864123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148578966": {"recommendationid": "148578966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123120127", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2354, "last_played": 1607165035}, "language": "english", "review": "For the Glory of Mankind\n\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ef\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cf\u284f\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u285f\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u28b0\u2803\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2819\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2804\n\u2804\u28b8\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2859\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u281b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2838\u28ff\u287f\u28f8\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2808\u2846\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2859\u2833\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u28c0\u28c8\u2819\u2803\u2804\u283f\u2887\u28ff\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2847\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c6\u2840\u28fc\u28ff\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u28b9\u2858\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bf\u28f7\u2840\u2804\u2880\u28f4\u28fe\u28df\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u28b9\u28ff\u2803\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b7\u2858\u28bf\u28ff\u28ce\u28bb\u28f7\u2830\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u28c0\u28c0\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u28ab\u287e\u28b8\u285f\u2804.\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u283b\u28e6\u2859\u283f\u28e7\u2819\u28b7\u2819\u283b\u283f\u28bf\u287f\u283f\u283f\u281b\u280b\u2809\u2804\u2802\u2818\u2801\u281e\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2819\u2811\u28e0\u28e4\u28f4\u2856\u2804\u283f\u28cb\u28c9\u28c9\u2841\u2804\u28be\u28e6\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804", "timestamp_created": 1697859991, "timestamp_updated": 1697859991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148575073": {"recommendationid": "148575073", "author": {"steamid": "76561199195181209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2557, "last_played": 1697578910}, "language": "english", "review": "Devola!", "timestamp_created": 1697853806, "timestamp_updated": 1697853806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148569880": {"recommendationid": "148569880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203733501", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1516, "last_played": 1683326196}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: One of the most unforgettable experiences in all of gaming, a must-play for anyone who considers themselves a fan of the artistic medium that is videogames. [b]S[/b].\n\nNieR:Automata is my favorite game of all time. I'll admit it, I really love this game. It's been I think a year or maybe two since I first played it and my feelings have barely changed. \n\nThe gameplay is very reminiscent of the character action game genre, albeit it is also an RPG. The open world is there, but it isn't really a selling point as there's very little to do in it. Level design is on point at basically all times, even when levels are reused on subsequent routes. It's not too long either, even if you plan on achieving all of the game's major endings. There are a few points in the game where it is a little too difficult or too easy, at least on normal mode, but it never overstays its welcome. The hard mode's balancing is ridiculous and I don't really find it rewarding to play whatsoever, even though normal mode can get a bit easy near the end of the game. Overall, 9/10 in gameplay, it could be better but not by much.\n\nThe story is... excellent. I'd rather not spoil anything, but its a game that you will think about for years after playing it and the story is the reason why. 5/5.\n\nThe art is good, even by modern standards for a game that's already 5 years old. In a few places it isn't ideal, and the character designs are... a bit much at times, but there's a reason why 2B is one of the most iconic characters in modern gaming. 4.5/5, it has already aged very well.\n\nThey came up with an entire new language for the music, completely unnecessary and just a massive flex, but I'll respect it. 5/5, fantastic, some highlights are the first route's final boss theme and the end credits, as well as the title menu. Weight of the World is one of my favorite songs just period, and even though I prefer the Japanese version, which I don't believe is present in the English release, it's still fantastic.\n\nThe game gets a total of 23.5/25, or 94%, which gives it an [b]S[/b].

Everything felt so well crafted from its Incredibly beautiful and tragic story to its heavenly music, along with likeable characters and a beautiful world. The game also focuses on some though provoking topics like philosophy, existentialism, literature.\n\nThe game has 26 \"endings\" named from A-Z.

I can imagine many tried it, only to not get far because the port was just that sloppy. It was thankfully fixed in 2021, and I am personally very grateful for that because I very well might not have ever given it a chance otherwise.\n\nNier Automata is a part of Yoko Taro's Drakengard series, however it is so far disconnected from the trilogy that actually bears that name, and even the first Nier game (Nier Replicant), that it is a game that can be perfectly enjoyed on its own without any understanding of what came before it. Yes, Nier Replicant does kind of build the foundation for the world that you experience in Automata, but because Automata takes place so long after Replicant it isn't necessary to know the history of the world explained in the first game to enjoy the events of the sequel.\n\nWhat makes this game so special is how incredibly unique it is. You simply experience stuff you've never seen in any other game before, and it all works very well to enhance the gameplay and storytelling. Nier Automata's story was truly made to be told in video game form. Also, I do have to mention the music: it is simply incredible.\n\nWhatever negatives I can think of for this game are so minor compared to the overall awesome experience that they are not really worth elaborating on beyond a brief mention: side quests are generally not that interesting apart from a handful, combat is not very deep, and the visuals certainly are not terribly impressive even for 2017 standards. That really is, however, about all I can think of for my gripes with this game.\n\nGoated game.

2593, "last_played": 1699343687}, "language": "english", "review": "So, this is going to be a interesting review since i haven't done one in a good while after my Alan Wake review, but a lot's kinda happened so i haven't been able to do one yet, most of it's personal stuff I don't really want to get into, but before I start reviewing, I might as well state the reason why I got this game, two reasons why is because that first, I recently preordered Alan Wake 2, and that doesn't come out until later in October and second, because after I finished Death Stranding, my uncle recommended me to play this game, so after a few months, I did, and this is the result, as usual, Sections for Story, Music, and gameplay, and this time, World, trust me.\n\nStory: The story is actually really good, like specifically, when it comes to characters, you can really get attached to them, like say Pascal, the machine is a lovable character and just wants peace [spoiler]until the village gets attacked later in the story[/spoiler] and from what i've seen, the lore apparently way more deeper then I realized, not as much as say Destiny per say, but it's still deep, so I encourage you to check the lore in your spare time, it's complex as hell but interesting, oh, and let's not forget about how you progress the story, specifically, if you want to finish the game, you gotta beat it at least 3 times to get the full story, and how it does it, well, reminds me a lot of MGSV actually, because when you go through each playthrough, it feels like a free built in DLC that expands the story, where this game feels like it has something MGSV doesn't really have: Chapter segements.\n\nMusic: Beautiful and really good, It fits the world really well, and really dramatic, not much I can say here really, just loved the music because Weight of the World kinda made me cry after i finished playing\n\nGameplay: Loved it, It has the same feel as say DMC, oh and Pods are your best friend so try and use them when you can, and hell, even the sidequests themselves feel fun aswell, kinda shocking i know, but it's a first for everything, and when you die in game, the game will keep your corpse until you come back and collect it, which is pretty helpful despite this game not being a souls-like\n\nWorld: Best way I can describe it is that it's like a Ghibli film but darker and philosophical then Grave of the Fireflies, but also very peaceful (if you ignore the killer machines), and just that when you walk around the world, you can't help but feel, well, kinda sad for some reason, at least, that's how it felt for me.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Nier Automata is a game that has managed to make me cry after playing the game, and I personally think that's saying something, I love the story, personal favorite, and IS in the same level as Death Stranding in my opinion, and has themes in it that remind me of Everything Everywhere all at Once, the final thoughts are short because i realize that most of what I wanted to say didn't need to be censored, Honestly, doing this i thought I had to censor most of the story segment, but I didn't need to and only censored one part of it, which is...actually, you just have to see it in game to see what I mean, so, in other words, keep on keeping on for the glory to mankind.", "timestamp_created": 1695274498, "timestamp_updated": 1695274498, "voted_up": true,

But it sure ended low. I'll explain without spoiling. Game completed entirely on Normal difficulty. The tie breaker between good and bad was broken by technical problems.\n\n-The Bad-\n*Anything to do with the mini-game which is unlocked later in the game. It overstays its welcome by several magnitudes and becomes such a detriment that it actively sucks the fun out of the game. It breaks the flow of the game a lot. There is no way to alter the core gameplay through chips or weapons like everything else in the game. The first time will be the same as the last. What starts off as a novel and interesting idea for a game within a game, it is quickly shown to be shallow and repetitive. It's not bad. There is just way too much of it. You are warned. If you buy this game, by the time you know what this is it's too late.\n\n*I had this game crash 4 times total. 3 of those were at the final ending for the main story. Coupled with my frustrations at the mini-game sections, it totally robbed me of the joy of seeing the proper ending. Great port, SE. Well done. I also ran into what is known as the \"white screen of death\". It is a white screen only but button inputs still seem to work. I mashed buttons and got out of it somehow but it's still noteworthy.\n\n-The Good-\n*This game has a really fun combat system with several weapons that pair together in different move-sets. You can have a variety of attacks to dispatch your foes. There are also many ways to customize your characters through various chips. [i]Edit: This has a very big and obvious caveat that ties into the first main \"bad\" point I made.[/i]\n\n*There are many side quests that take you to all parts of the game's world.\n\n*Most of the characters are likable.\n\n*A very unique and interesting approach to story-telling and camera work.\n\n*Incredible OST.\n\nThe game is fine. I loved some aspects and not others. A literal mixed bag for me. However, it's entirely serviceable but I'm not sure I'll be revisiting this any time in the near future.", "timestamp_created": 1694990552, "timestamp_updated": 1695013166, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146477473": {"recommendationid": "146477473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308204186", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2809, "last_played": 1698552796}, "language": "spanish", "review": "For the Glory of Mankind", "timestamp_created": 1694962456, "timestamp_updated": 1694962456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60000002384185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146476654": {"recommendationid": "146476654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198806226811", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2534, "last_played": 1694961460}, "language": "english", "review": "I sacrificed all my save files for a good cause.

Within Nietzschean philosophy, this aphorism signifies the gradual erosion of traditional religious convictions, giving rise to a metaphysical void. As contemporary society distances itself from theological conceptions wherein God is the fount of meaning and values, an existential abyss and tormented existence emerge. In Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\" composed in 1883, the intricacy of the \"eternal return\" concept is meticulously explored. It posits that in an infinite and cyclical cosmos, every event, past, present, or future, inexorably repeats, bearing profound existential implications. The protagonist, Zarathustra, confronts the vision of eternal recurrence, initially overwhelmed by the weight of an existence perpetually echoing itself. Nevertheless, as the narrative unfolds, Zarathustra transcends this nihilistic perspective, embracing the notion as a challenge to live authentically and forge one's own purpose amidst the repetition of existence.\n\n[b]\"[/b][i]Everything that lives is designed to end. They are perpetually trapped in a never-ending spiral of life and death. However, life is all about the struggle within this cycle. That is what 'we' believe.[/i][b]\"[/b]\n\nThe contemplation of death lies at the heart of profound ontological inquiries within philosophical currents. Death, the most somber inevitability in human existence, bestows upon us the poignant capacity for reflection. The absurdity encapsulating death may not represent the initial definition of death proffered in Jean-Paul Sartre's 1943 magnum opus, \"Being and Nothingness,\" but it serves to underscore its logical primacy within Sartre's oeuvre. Sartre's conception of the absurdity of death embarks on a philosophical voyage, unfurling into a nuanced examination of the human condition confronted with its inexorable and inescapable terminus. For Sartre, death ascends to the zenith of absurdity because, despite our Herculean efforts to ascribe meaning to life, death remains the immutable event that terminates all our achievements and aspirations. It represents the ultimate and insurmountable divide that renders ephemeral our endeavors and struggles. Thus, the existential paradox is evident: despite our freedom to elect our values and purposes in life, death serves as an unyielding constraint, causing all semblance of meaning to dissipate in the face of finite existence. This dialectic between freedom and death begets profound anguish; even as we consciously select our actions and values, we are eternally confronted with the inevitability of ultimate annihilation. Hence, death, in Sartre's worldview, emerges as a pivotal element of human existence, not solely as life's conclusion but as an incessant reminder of the transitory nature of our endeavors. It stands as a mirror reflecting our ceaseless struggle to unearth meaning and purpose, even when confronted with the void of inherent significance.\n\n[b]\"[/b][i]A future is not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself.[/i][b]\"[/b]\n\nIn the work \"Existentialism is a Humanism,\" penned by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1946, a cogent apologia for existentialism is enunciated, championing the primacy of human existence over essence. Sartre underscores that human beings are fundamentally endowed with freedom, thrust into the world devoid of preordained purpose, thereby bearing the responsibility to craft their own meaning and values. Existence, he contends, precedes essence, and within this radical liberty resides the agonizing, yet transformative potential for each individual to mold their own destiny and genuinely embrace their human condition. The cosmos' void endows us with a unique quest to construct our essence.\n\nThe musical tapestry of NieR: Automata unfurls as a sublime labyrinth of harmonies, resonating within the very core of the game, surpassing the boundaries of mere convention.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jna9bvhdRE\n\nThe painstakingly crafted score by Keiichi Okabe materializes as a symphony of emotions, akin to rivers of consciousness navigating the tumultuous waters of hope and desolation. Each musical composition stands as a sonorous poem, rich in subtleties and hues that beckon profound, uncharted contemplations. The vocals, often ethereal in nature, transport us to an ethereal realm of human expression where words falter, and melodies assume the role of tacit narrators, revealing the depths of the characters' souls. The interplay of diverse musical genres, from classical to electronic, forges a sonic mosaic that reverberates with the intricacies embodied in every facet of this masterpiece. This musical arrangement is more than a mere backdrop; it is the very protagonist of the narrative. The music does not merely accompany; it converses, divulging secrets, voicing anguish, and echoing the profound existential questions permeating the narrative. Of particular intrigue is the unique lexicon employed within these melodies. The \"Chaos Language,\" conceived by composer Keiichi Okabe, materializes as an abstract tongue, devoid of recognizable semantics or syntax. Instead, it comprises vocal sounds that conjure emotions yearning for expression. The incorporation of such an exquisite language into the vocal compositions within the score engenders a sense of both peculiarity and familiarity, echoing the theme of communication and comprehension among disparate beings, whether human, android, or machine. This concept finds eloquent expression through this medium.\n\nThis endeavor to elucidate select facets of artistic expression within a video game, albeit a modest one, scarcely captures the magnificence of this universe and its interpretation within the crucible of human cognition. Nonetheless, this endeavor remains rooted in the pursuit of expression.

"review": "\"Do you think games are silly little things\"\n-Yoko Taro\nHave you ever questioned what games are and what they can be?\nThis is the best game to release in 2017, arguably the best game to come out this decade, and in my opinion possibly the best game I have ever played. People look at Zelda or Mario 64 and see them as games--while not perfect, as games that managed to set the standard and define what great games can achieve in the late 90's to today. Nier Automata is the game that will define both story telling and gameplay from 2017 and beyond.\n\nNieR:Automata defies expectations in both story and gameplay, combining them in ways I personally never thought to be possible. This is done by either straight up changing the genre of the game, hitting you with a heart-compelling character interaction, or a combination of both. The game plays the way you want it to. If you are feeling like it's too easy after setting it to hard mode you can remove HUD elements, increase damage taken, or dive into the combat system and learn 15+ weapon combos by combining your 4 equipped weapons and your pod. The game is meant to have you experience it the way YOU want to. If the game is too hard you can equip as many chips as possible and set the game to easy, basically having the game play itself by healing and fighting for you so you can experience the story the way YOU wish to.\n\nIn order to experince Nier:Automata fully, the game is designed to be played multiple times. After initially beating the game, you replay the game from another perspective. After that, the game opens up even more in a way you wouldn't ever see coming in a blind playthrough, opening the world up even more (quite literally). This idea of story telling may throw people off initially but can only truly be accomplished in this form of medium--as a game.\n\nI never really saw video games as an art. Video Games have defining artstyles, music, atmosphere, themes, and so on...yet I never considered them as an artform, just something that is there to entertain me. NieR:Automata showed me the light. The atmosphere is truly something else. When it wants to, Nier makes you feel part of it's universe, and then a moment later you are catching your breath and you feel something off. You then remember that you are playing a video game. This is done intentionally and happened to me multiple times. As someone who enjoys phycological elements in entertainment, while questioning the motives of characters and diving into the meaning of character interactions, cutscenes, and atmosphere, I ended up questioning what I was doing as a player experiencing Nier:Automata.\n\nAs I was questioning myself, I was also wondering what made me want to question myself as a player. I have no idea how to describe that feeling other as looking into your heart. NieR:Automata is a game meant entertain your heart and make you feel something. It will likely be different for you, but I ended up feeling something amazing inside me up until the end of the game and past the credits.\n\nAnd this feeling is something I wish for you, a potential player, to pick up and experience yourself.\nPlease play this game.\nEven if my words are meaningless\nI will sacrifice anything and everything if it helps even one person complete it, like I'm carrying the weight of the world.\n-Planter", "timestamp_created": 1694678684, "timestamp_updated": 1694725987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146262879": {"recommendationid": "146262879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819270371", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1690179905}, "language": "english", "review": "I like women.", "timestamp_created": 1694669132, "timestamp_updated": 1694669132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146259007": {"recommendationid": "146259007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355354397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 349, "last_played": 1696486634}, "language": "spanish", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1694660868, "timestamp_updated": 1694660868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146258883": {"recommendationid": "146258883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091446553", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9542, "last_played": 1694838738}, "language": "english", "review": "pov: the villagers do the funniest thing ever", "timestamp_created": 1694660675, "timestamp_updated": 1694660675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146257242": {"recommendationid": "146257242", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067852458", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1700772161}, "language": "english", "review": " holy crap this game is literally one of the best games I have played in my life play it I beg of you \n\nIt's got hot women and also story that makes me cry what is there not to love", "timestamp_created": 1694657713, "timestamp_updated": 1695087774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146256311": {"recommendationid": "146256311", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086708290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3311, "last_played": 1682564811}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo platine y no me aburr\u00ed.

Here, they regroup and counter-attack by creating the YoRHa, a military force of advanced androids with the mission of eliminating the invading force and reclaim Earth for humanity. In this virtually never ending conflict, the story follows 2B and 9S, a couple of YoRHa androids as they travel to Earth to complete missions and also learn about the world that is and was,, themselves as well about their supposed enemies. \n\nA little side-note: despite being related to the Drakengard series and Nier: Replicant, you don\u2019t need to have played or know about these games before playing Automata. It could help you understand a bit more some details in the game but in general, Automata is like its own story, son don\u2019t worry about that.\n\n\n=== GAMEPLAY ===\nThe game is a mix of action-RPG with Open World. \nCombat is your standard hack and slash; light and heavy attacks, jump, run as well special attacks. Stats automatically upgrade as you level up.\n\nSpecial attacks and weapons can be unlock/upgraded by completing mini-quests (collect certain amount and type of materials and money) or finding them during you gameplay (around certain area, quest reward, bought on store). There\u2019s a ton of options/variants to choose from but most of them aren\u2019t too distinctive one from another (especially when it comes to weapons) and in the end, you\u2019ll end up using just a few from all that bunch.\nCombat in general is nice but it can get kinda repetitive after a while.\nWhen it comes to the Open World part, the game offers a fairly decent map to explore around. You start in a main area that connects to the rest of the other areas, which you gain access as you progress in the game. Each of these areas have its own \u201ctheme\u201d sort of speak and does a good enough work to represent them, some more than others though.\n\nThe RPG element comes in the form of chips. These chips are divided according their function (attack, defense, support, etc.) and can help you create a build for your standard gameplay or for specific scenarios and even personalize your UI to some extent. You have \u201cmemory space\u201d which you can fill with these with each one using an X amount of space, depending their level (you can upgrade them) and/or rarity. You can upgrade the memory space later in the game.\n\n\n=== VISUALS & SOUND ===\nI think this is some of the strong elements of this game.\n\nOn the visual side, you can see they put a lot of work on each aspect of the game: the characters (especially the characters), weapons, environments, menus, etc. It\u2019s pretty cool to appreciate the details in each one. You can kinda have an idea of the character traits of each character when you look at it and their designs, same of the weapons (even the weapons have backstories so its look is not necessarily just because).\n\nAbout the music, the OST does a great job on help you immerse in the game. The fights, the story, dialogues, even the side-quests, the OST has the right theme to go along with the \u201ccurrent mood\u201d in the game. It hardly fails in this and I appreciate that <3. I haven\u2019t heard the OST alone yet but I can bet it must be awesome to hear it while imagine the scenes in the game.     \n\n  \n=== FINAL THOUGHTS ===\nLeaving aside the gameplay and visual/sound aspects for a moment, I think the core of this game are the characters and how the interact, learn, grow, get emotional, etc. and not just the protagonists; the support/side-characters, even most of the NPCs you\u2019ll probably know once are pretty interesting!  The gameplay is just a drive sort of speak to help you navigate in this broken world full of interesting characters waiting to be discovered. Interaction is the key word in this game and\u2026is just a fascinating experience.\nThe gameplay is good, visuals and sounds are pretty good but the story and characters will stick to you from start to finish. I think this a game everyone should try, at least once.\n\n\nSCORE: 8.0\n", "timestamp_created": 1694447163, "timestamp_updated": 1694447163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146117309": {"recommendationid": "146117309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340511970", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3925, "last_played": 1696720511}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La saga Nier lo mejor que puedes jugar, son mis juegos favoritos probablemente ser\u00e1n tus favoritos tambi\u00e9n", "timestamp_created": 1694441812, "timestamp_updated": 1694441812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146112293": {"recommendationid": "146112293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058324472", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2624, "last_played": 1694981709}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the perfect blend of action RPG and Shoot-em up. \nThe combat is satisfying.\nThe side quests are interesting and none of them felt like fillers.\nThere is no need for grinding.\nThere is a New Game + mode that is almost a must because it brings so much variety.

Story was a huge disappointment for me, which is an issue when it's the main selling point of the game. It's occasionally interesting, but lacks any real substance. For a game that's supposed to be deeply philosophical, most of the interesting topics aren't addressed much. The first playthough was actually pretty interesting story wise, but the second is not nearly different enough and the third is too edgy for my tastes. Combat is very brainless and is pretty disappointing considering other work Platinum has done. I had to really push through for the true ending, and while it's the best part of the game I don't think it was worth forcing myself through 20 hours of mind numbing gameplay.

The game really for me checks all the boxes and is Yoko Taro's masterpiece. Highly suggest this gem in any collection. I have multiple copies on different systems and I have loved every minute. The game does require multiple playthroughs to see the true ending so its got great replay value(also isnt too long for an action RPG). Could probably go on and on but I will just stop there.

But I feel somewhat obligated to write a review since I had such harsh words for the atrocious 'Nier: Replicant'.\nThere were three games at the end of the last decade that set new standards for interactive story-telling: 'Detroit: Become Human', 'Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice' and 'Nier: Automata'. The first and the last are similar in thematic scope and impact, dealing with the implications of independent A.I. and the question of them becoming sentient. 'Hellblade' is a devastating game about psychosis and auto-aggression.\nAll three are essential entries in the videogame library, recommended for almost any player, and well worth at full price. Some deliberate limitations in exploration and gameplay mechanics cut 'Nier Automata's achievements a little bit short. The greatest flaws are plot points which are sloppy and contrived as well as a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of tragedy. The story and its greater background are rather a series of calamities, nothing more and nothing less. Thus, 'Automata' does neither reach the emotional depth of 'Hellblade' (88/100) nor accomplish the relentlessness and replayability of 'Detroit: Become Human' (90/100). My final verdict is a very solid 86/100, a must-play with some regrettable and also unnecessary flaws.\n\nFor those still reading I'll break down the major points I have to make.\n**Spoiler alert from here on!**\n\nPRO\n- 2B is the main attraction here, fantastic character design\n- characters (A2, pods, Jackass etc.), story and world design; cool cyberpunk approach\n- post-post-apocalyptic inclinations: machines are at war while their respective creators have perished long ago\n- fun ending mechanics, except maybe for path B\n- good enemy variety\n- money is earned easily and the leveling mechanics is actually quite good\n- fast-travel system\n- cool 'Shin Godzilla' easter egg\n\nCON\n- 9S is a clich\u00e9 character, the curious young man setting out to explore the world - he is basically 2B's younger brother, his flirting with her and the operators is weird\n- 9S's maniac obsession and him becoming insane does not work, but rather give way to some cringe\n- tired and unconvincing revenge plot (branches C and D), degenerating basically into a man on a quest to avenge his woman - how troped can you get?\n- 2B isn't really the protagonist, the biggest mistake is the game getting rid of her too soon, take a note: never get rid of the girl, that's what made 'Chamber of Secrets' so terrible\n- allusions to the Drakengard/Nier background lore are way too cryptic\n- Adam and Eve are great when introduced, only to be finished off really quickly\n- many situations with A2 are contrived: her killing the forest king, 9S just arriving seconds too late, miscommunication or deliberate withdrawal of vital information between A2 and 9S\n- many unresolved questions: Why *are* machines imitating aspects of human culture? Why did A2 kill Immanuel, the infant forest king? (This required intel and infiltration. If she just wanted to destroy machines, why come here?) What did Adam want to accomplish by being killed - did his curiosity override his programming?\n- bad port: technical issues galore, somewhat remedied by the patch they gave us 4 (read: four, and in words: four) years after release\n- insanely bad controls in the PC port: hacking is an unplayable chore, and you can still not use debug mode with keyboard/mouse - what the heck?\n- annoying camera design in some places, especially the 2D-portions\n- jump mechanics are deliberately limited, making it quite difficult to reach certain spots, this just intensifies the grind\n- annoying 'stumble' mechanics breaking your speed movement\n- controlling machine lifeforms becomes an irritating chore\n- much unnecessary grind, there is a bunch of rare events improbable to achieve ever (e.g. tutorials at 85% after 70 hours, are you kidding me?)\n- side quests reset between branches\n- lame DLC arenas\n\nFinal words (interpretation). The main points of the game are: (1) Machines imitate human life - even the alien machines, that is - although it has no meaning for them. (2) Machines emulating human culture and human emotions is the only thing that will ultimately be left of humanity.

The hack and slash gameplay is solid but not complex or varied enough to stay interesting for the whole runtime, and the I'm 14 And This Is Deep plot doesn't make up for the just ok action. It's obvious within 10 minutes of starting the game that it's about \"What if robots became sentient, and what's the difference between AI and Human Intelligence?\" but the game has absolutely nothing interesting to say about these cliches because 20 hours into the game even though you regularly interact with an entire society of sentient robots the main characters still refuse to admit robots can be sentient, despite themselves being sentient \"androids\" which is totally a huge difference! The game's \"twist\" that Androids and Machines both have the same AI is comically transparent and unimpactful, and Bladerunner had more to say about the trope of an android questioning its own humanity 40 years ago in an hour and a half movie than Nier does in 45 hours of game plus tons and tons of shallow text logs.

It's not just some silly little game, it's a compelling narrative told in a distinctive style that fills in all the blanks as you get to know the characters and story. I never played a game by the creator, so everything was so odd in the beginning, but that obliviousness added unique touch of flavor that resonated with me at the end. The game's great storyline forces the player to consider their ideas and behavior. Teaches the player that there are various points of view and decisions that have implications rather than an objective truth or morality. Demonstrates to the user that life is not defined by a single aim or objective but rather by the experiences and connections made along the road. In a brutal and chaotic world, the game invites the user to discover their own purpose and value. There are many references to human culture, behavior, nature, and philosophies. The characters reference it either explicit or implicit from the perspective of not having lived in the modern human world, but in an post-apocalyptic world where our traditions seem absurd to them; reminding us to elicit gratitude of things we gotten used to. One of my favorite philosophical notions from the game\u00a0is that according to Jean-Paul Sarte, \"Existence precedes essences,\" meaning that a person's existence is shaped by their experiences and choices rather than being predetermined at birth. I believe in the universal scale, that everything is balanced in all aspects of reality, and that there is a certain amount of randomness that imparts some significance to our mere existence and suggests that our lives are not entirely predetermined. Our self-awareness gives the capacity for decision-making, which I like to refer to as constrained free will, allowing us to experience to degree of free-will. This is because experiencing is the ultimate objective of living things, which was likely foretold and deliberately carried out by higher sentient entities (god/gods) for what appears to be like an eternal of us. Holy cow i didn't mean to ramble on like this, i don't wanna go too deep into it;ANYWAYS! The game's outstanding visual and auditory experience\u00a0completely immerse the player in its world and feelings. Beautiful visuals, fluid fighting, and a variety of gameplay elements keep the player interested and entertained in this game. The game also includes a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly matches the atmosphere and tone of the game. The music in the game is dynamic and alters depending on the player's surroundings and position. It is a game that will make you laugh, a little horny[2booty], cry, think, and feel. It is a game that will stay with you long after you finish it.

I originally played this a few years ago for about 6 hours or so and got bored. Then recently I agreed on doing a game swap with a friend (I play a game they want me to play and they play a game I want them to play). While I wasn't particularly looking forward to playing this again, I'm glad I did. The game is basically one big artistic vision. There are some things I don't like but overall the game is good if you're into that kind of thing.\n\nFirst thing to note is that this game has several different routes/endings. The first 2 routes play in the same time period and essentially you have to play through those bits twice but with some differences in perspective. However, the whole main story is played in a linear fashion so you can't miss out on any main route or ending. Anyway, I'll start with the things I liked:\n\n\n[u]Positives[/u]\n\n-Graphics are decent for a 2017 game, nothing amazing but it looks good.\n\n-Sound effects are great.\n\n-Variety of \"plugin chips\" to customise your gameplay, though I kinda just kept one set on for combat: counter+, anti-chain damage, max hp and auto-heal and never died ever again and then I had another set for when you play as 9S for hacking+ stats and auto-heal.\n\n-The story from route C onwards was a lot more interesting than route A and B, though I will go into that more in the negatives part. The overall story was a great experience though and while route A isn't as good as the others, the prologue does start the game off strong. Some small details in route B are pretty nice and definitely appreciated.\n\n-The music is an interesting one. On route A I felt like the music varied from \"it's OK\" to good, but then from route B onwards they start playing several variations of the songs and damn they are really good. You can really feel the emotion in the music and it's amazing.\n\n-Chapter Select from finishing route C/D allows you to go back and finish stuff you might have missed.\n\n-Customisable settings for the standard gameplay camera. Really cool.\n\n\n[u]Neutral[/u]\n\n-I didn't really vibe much with the combat which was one of the reasons why I stopped playing in my initial attempt at playing years ago. The movement feels kinda \"floaty\" and I didn't really like experimenting with different weapons much because the beginner sword is fast and does decent enough damage anyway. Could just be a me thing.\n\n\n[u]Negatives[/u]\n\n-The Route A part of the game is mostly \"meh\". Although it gains more value after finishing the game, on your first playthrough it can feel rather... generic gameplay-wise. The map is absolutely terrible to navigate and look at before you unlock more of it from the teleport vending machines. Fortunately map and side quest progression is saved throughout route progression. The main story in route A is purposefully simple and because of that it's kind of confusing at that point while you're playing as people do rate the game's story as good. Another thing to note is that they play the credits after you finish this route... so some people might actually think the game ends there when it actually doesn't.\n\n-Route B is mostly the same Route A but with a perspective change, additional cutscenes and the ability to actually be able to finish some side quests you literally cannot finish in Route A. I already grasped what the story was going to be about 3 hours into route A, I didn't need to spend another 9~ hours in Route B to have it shoved in my face more. I wish they kinda cut this route down a bit and spent more time on route C/D+.\n\n-Side quests. Oh boy. Some of the side quests are interesting but most are basically just showing you the same repeated theme of the game even more and IMO felt like a waste of time (I do get that it's supposed to add to the setup though). I just stopped doing side quests after finishing Route B and started enjoying the game more.\n\n-Dynamic Camera -- I get that the camera being dynamic and changes angles is an artistic idea and it's kinda cool from an art perspective... But in some cases for the gameplay it sucks so much to play with and is frustrating.\n\n-Most of the world map is frustrating. The Abandoned Factory is extremely annoying to traverse for side quests but at least it looks cool. The main city area (outside of the hub) is badly designed where there are loads of edges that you have to perfectly time your double jump for to climb up. Also in the same city there are parts that feel pointlessly blocked off so it forces you to have to walk around the side. In the desert you are able to slide around, but it's annoying more often than not as it cancels your sprint momentum.", "timestamp_created": 1693109544, "timestamp_updated": 1693109979, "voted_up":

A trav\u00e9s de una narrativa magistral y una exploraci\u00f3n profunda de la filosof\u00eda, este juego se alza como una obra maestra que trasciende los l\u00edmites convencionales de la experiencia de juego.\n\nEn el coraz\u00f3n de \"Nier: Automata\" yace una trama que se desenvuelve en un mundo posapocal\u00edptico donde los humanos han sido expulsados de la Tierra por invasores mec\u00e1nicos. La humanidad, al borde de la extinci\u00f3n, ha confiado su supervivencia en androides de combate, creando una inquietante paradoja: m\u00e1quinas que luchan en nombre de los humanos contra m\u00e1quinas invasoras. La historia se desenvuelve de manera magistral, explorando temas profundos como la identidad, la existencia, la conciencia y la moralidad.\n\nLa filosof\u00eda se infiltra en cada rinc\u00f3n del juego. Desde el existencialismo hasta la \u00e9tica, \"Nier: Automata\" desaf\u00eda constantemente al jugador a reflexionar sobre el prop\u00f3sito de la humanidad, la guerra, la tecnolog\u00eda y la inteligencia artificial. Los personajes, en particular los androides protagonistas, 2B, 9S y A2, experimentan un viaje emocional y espiritual que refleja las luchas y cuestionamientos inherentes a la condici\u00f3n humana.\n\nLa trama no solo se presenta a trav\u00e9s de una narrativa convencional, sino que utiliza m\u00faltiples finales, cada uno de los cuales aporta una perspectiva \u00fanica y significativa sobre la historia en su conjunto. Esta estructura narrativa intrincada invita a los jugadores a regresar una y otra vez para descubrir nuevos matices y detalles en la historia.\n\nAdem\u00e1s de su narrativa y filosof\u00eda profundas, \"Nier: Automata\" ofrece una jugabilidad emocionante y variada. Las secuencias de combate son fren\u00e9ticas y satisfactorias, mientras que la exploraci\u00f3n del mundo abierto y la interacci\u00f3n con personajes secundarios enriquecen la experiencia general. La banda sonora, compuesta por Keiichi Okabe, es simplemente asombrosa y complementa perfectamente la atm\u00f3sfera del juego.\n\nEn resumen, \"Nier: Automata\" es una obra maestra que no solo desaf\u00eda las convenciones de los videojuegos, sino que tambi\u00e9n invita a los jugadores a cuestionar su propia existencia y las decisiones \u00e9ticas que enfrentan en el mundo real. Esta combinaci\u00f3n de una narrativa apasionante y una filosof\u00eda profunda lo convierte en una experiencia inolvidable que trasciende los l\u00edmites del medio y perdura mucho despu\u00e9s de haber completado el juego.\n\nRecomiendo comprarlo?

This is an action based game, with some sprinkle of RPG elements, where you play as 2B/9S, in a future Earth where Earth has been invaded and been taken over by machines and aliens.\n\nThe game itself has multiple endings. As the game itself is meant to be story rich and story heavy, in order to really experience the full story of the game, it is recommended for the player to go through each of the \"Routes\" to experience the full potential of the story. \n\n[h1] The Pros [/h1]\nLet me get the first two things before hand. NieR: Automata has one of the best video game OSTs I've heard in the last 20 years of gaming experience and the story, [b] especially [/b] if you know the context from NieR Replicant, is practically a gaming masterpiece. The story talks about strong themes about finding meaning in life, and the world building Yoko Taro has in the Nierverse is intriguing to say the least. The game does an excellent job in keeping you invested on what is going on, and there isn't really a moment in the game's story where you feel anything is being forced or unnatural. By the last credits in Ending E, you would really feel a giant hole in your heart, even more so if you have played NieR Replicant. Note: playing NieR Replicant is not required to understand the story for Automata (as you will be playing from the perspectives from characters that are not present in Replicant), but playing Replicant does add a lot of context that makes emotional scenes hit even harder.\n\nFor the most part, the combat itself is pretty enjoyable. The animations are fluid, and though the combat itself isn't that complex, it's pretty satisfying to say the lease. It's very satisfying to master your dodges in-game, while you bash machines with basic combos.\n\nGameplay note: Side quests in this game, unlike Nier Replicant, are completely optional and you can skip all of them if you would like. However, side quests in this game are a pretty decent way to also further experience the world building story portion for Automata. Overall, most of the side quests consists of fetch quests and combat with the occasional puzzle based ones.\n  \n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\nNieR Automata is almost a perfect game, but the PC port has some issues to take note of. The primary issue are the occasional graphical hiccups and texture pop-ins that does sometimes distract the players. Textures itself on the PC, vary from decent to something that looks like it's from the PS1 era. I've only experienced 1 lock-up during my 40 hours of gameplay (had to do a hard game restart, but only lost about 5-10 minutes of playtime at the time). Aside from that, if you could get used to the graphical hiccups, the base graphics itself for a 2016/17 game looks not bad.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nPersonal ratings:\nGameplay: 9/10\n-Simple but satisfying combat\nGraphics: 8/10\n-Graphics look aesthetically pleasing at times. Occasional graphical issues on the PC port.\nMusic: 10/10\n-One of the most memorable OSTs in any video games out there\nStory: 10/10\n-Amazing story. Masterpiece if you have played Replicant.\nUI: 8/10\n-UI and GUI is serviceable. Mini-map can be cluttered if you take on too many sidequests at once.\nOverall Experience: 10/10\n-Post-anime depression is real\n\nAlso note: the English dubbing in this game is very good. It is recommended to play this game in English first (if you do not know Japanese), as many dialogue can be missed during the middle of combat.\n\n[h1] Ending Notes [/h1]\nCame for 2B, stayed for existential depression, 15/10.

score, gameplay mechanics, and writing. It keeps changing expectations as multiple hooks increase your momentum as you approach the ending. \n\nNot many games have the credentials to call themselves industry-changing, and it's not a necessity to do so. However, every now and then, one stands out with fresh takes on the medium, but only in some fields. Maybe it's the gameplay, art direction, or some cinematographic script that turns a game into a memorable experience. And yet, Yoko Taro brings us an example that shows us how boundless gaming can be as a medium for storytelling. From the get-go, one could say Nier: Automata is another Japanese action game with exaggerated character designs and a convoluted story, but as the player makes progress, it reveals itself as something far more engaging.\n\nGameplay is cinematic and makes use of a little robot companion with auto-lock to make it as flashy as possible, because just using your melee weapons alone won't give you the feeling of slashing through mobs of robots. Minigames that in other titles may feel bothersome or gimmicky are crafted so that the player never loses synergy in combat. Bullet hells are designed into enemy attacks, and sudden camera changes transform this game into many different genres in a matter of seconds. Role-playing elements with some inclusion of text adventure dynamics force the player to carefully consider the effects of some characters\u2019 fates. There was no chance Nier: Automata could combine all these traits, and more, into its core without turning into a product held together with duct tape, and yet its formula finds a perfect harmony among all these elements to evoke all its themes.\n\nIf you\u2019re into philosophy, this will be right up your alley. The compact game world and quests convey a dark future where existence is constantly being debated by artificial lifeforms. Without spoiling anything, its main cast go through many different perspectives regarding the human condition of being by exploring multiple thinkers and their works. The player might not be aware of all this existential baggage, but the messages are embedded for easy appreciation and, eventually, further reflection. It also helps that the game\u2019s \u201croutes\u201d examine different angles on how to search for a purpose in life. Combined with a majestic soundtrack composed with perfect understanding of tone during gameplay, memories will be engraved into the player\u2019s mind for a long time.\n\nOf course, there are some flaws, as there are in every game. The start of the game is quite slow, maybe even sluggish. The map doesn\u2019t help that much in tracking side quests. The auto-lock is your best friend, but sometimes it will not focus on the bigger threats you want to tackle first. And yet, I can guarantee you will overlook the rough edges around this gem. Even when the pace starts to get dull, or the gameplay stale, Nier: Automata will throw something new to keep you engaged and, eventually, give you a reason to see it through. The reason behind this is that, even if the game depicts a sad and meaningless world, certain [E]nding will convince you that life, indeed, is worth fighting for and full of hope. \n\nI hope this title inspires further developers into being more disruptive, creative, and inspiring. This game had no right for being so good while being so experimental, as there are some titles\u2019 artistic visions that overwhelm their playability.

I love the game play and the story. It and works well on my computer and the Steam Deck.\n\nMy major complaint, which is why I am not recommending this game, is how cloud saves works: I had an issue once with my cloud save being wiped and had to restart my game. Goog thing I wasn't too far in my game. The other issue which is more irritating is that cloud saves carry screen settings between systems. This causes the graphics and screen size settings to change every time I switch between playing on my PC and my Steam Deck which have very different graphical settings. It is so annoying that this is something that was a choice by SquareEnix and/or PlatinumGames developers and even though in reality it is so small, it is annoying that they haven't fixed this already. I tried emailing their support to see if I could forward the issue and got this response:\n\n\"Thank you for contacting the Square Enix Support Center.\n\nWe understand you have concerns the display settings for NieR: Automata when changing platforms to play, and we'd love to help.\n\nUpdates in regards to the display settings being saved depending on the recent platform played is information that has not yet been announced and we are not able to comment at this time.\n\nWe do appreciate you bringing this to our attention, and rest assured that it will be forwarded to the appropriate party.\n\nFor now, you can stay up to date on our website (http://na.square-enix.com) for information on our products (both current and upcoming). We apologize we cannot assist further at this time.\n\nShould you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us and we'll gladly assist further.\n\nTake care and stay safe!\"\n\nHopefully this does get forwarded to the right someone, but this has been an issue for so long that I doubt it will ever be dealt with, especially for such an old game. If you are planning to play this game on only one PC and have the specs or only have the Steam Deck, it's a great game. If you want the flexibility of how you can play, I honestly can't recommend this game. Maybe if this changes I can give it the recommendation I would love to give this game.", "timestamp_created": 1692298107, "timestamp_updated": 1692298107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443548411130905151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144427889": {"recommendationid": "144427889", "author": {"steamid": "76561199041662419", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3309, "last_played": 1692295681}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Yoko Taro putisimo genio", "timestamp_created": 1692295756, "timestamp_updated": 1692295756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144391947": {"recommendationid": "144391947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316010333", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1617, "last_played": 1692113839}, "language": "english", "review": "WE LOVE UNCLE PASCAL WE LOVE UNCLE PASCAL", "timestamp_created": 1692258846, "timestamp_updated": 1692258846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144386483": {"recommendationid": "144386483", "author": {"steamid": "76561199491939049", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2387, "last_played": 1692729789}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice Game :D", "timestamp_created": 1692250857, "timestamp_updated": 1692250857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144385401": {"recommendationid": "144385401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198851566960", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1723, "last_played": 1696054842}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ven\u00eds por el porno y termin\u00e1s leyendo todos los libros de Yoko Taro.", "timestamp_created": 1692249327, "timestamp_updated": 1692249327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144375305": {"recommendationid": "144375305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335833053", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1550, "last_played": 1692295776}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1692235195, "timestamp_updated": 1692235195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144362541": {"recommendationid": "144362541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301048627", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1799, "last_played": 1692415643}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for android booty, stayed for sense of existence questioning...", "timestamp_created": 1692220097, "timestamp_updated": 1692220097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144359139": {"recommendationid": "144359139", "author": {"steamid": "76561199540425125", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2462, "last_played": 1692219499}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutly love this game and its pre game nier replicant.

I have finished route A and started B, dropped. This game should have been called NieR:Repetitive\u2122\n\nFor the most part, characters are extremely bland. I think majority of people actually praising this game are doing because they are horny for 2B and p much every other female android because it was critical to the story to make every single female character sexualized. \n\nCombat and camera are biggest offenders of this game tho. Weapons are painfully boring. Combat stays the same from start to finish. Enemies are sponges, literally. U won't feel impact of hitting them, and they sometimes take forever to kill. Combat is incredibely easy because you can just abuse perfect dodge constantly, and it's insanely easy to pull it off. Game loves to change between 3d and 2d ( 2.5d? ) and it SUCKS. Platforming is terrible. Your support character is stupid, and will constantly get in a way of you. O yeah, did I forget to tell you that your character will constantly trip on any rock/wire/bush? XD\n\nOST is good for the first time you hear it, but entering/existing zones automatically switches to their OST with no fade, it's insant. AND IT ALWAYS STARTS FROM THE BEGINNING. Boss OST slap tho.\n\nGame looks incredibely cheap, I get that they wanted apocalypse amotsphere but amount of reused and copy pasted assets is ridiculus for game of this \"quality\". A lot of invinsible walls. You see huge opening in building? Well no, you can't enter it. \n\nSaving system is atrocious but I didn't mind it that much because game was so incredibly easy, it was really hard to actually die after initial prologue. \n\nAnimations of character look amazing, and I never got bored of them. \n\nStory.. where do I start. I won't spoil, but you need to finish 2 routes in order to get to \"good part\". Keep in mind that route A has huge amount of bad sections, and B literally expands on them and makes them worse. Side quests for the most part are garbage ( there were few good ones, but sadly very little ). You can't fast travel until like first half of route A. And guess what, in route B you can't fast travel either until certain point in the story. Keep in mind that entire game is based on: start quest on X spot, run to Y, return to X. That's it. That's literally it. It's just running, running, bland combat, and running back. \n\n2/10 because of pretty animations and serviceable OST.", "timestamp_created": 1692020519, "timestamp_updated": 1692020519, "voted_up":

fantastic. Great variety, awesome ambience, beautiful and evocatively charged emotive works throught - makes you want to just pause and admire.\n\nVoice acting is absolutely stellar too. Every character, even machines you're meant to think are emotionless and soulless, deliver their lines with meaning and gravitas.\n\nCombat variety is wonderful and enemy types are very diverse, each giving you different types of difficulties, optimal approaches and flexibility in how you may choose to approach them. Sure, you may choose to just hack-n-slash them all to bits - but there's no \"if you don't follow the dodge-dodge-x-dodge-jump-y-dodge-x-(...)\"or whatever \"formula\" you lose without. Play to your strenghts and have your fun. This isn't a [with palpable derison] \"souls-like\" game...\n\nThe good:\n\nCombat is reactive, varied, fast paced and wonderfully creative with multiple modes (odes to 2d side-scrollers, to 2d asteroids-like's, and more general 3d hack and slash and others) with an often wide range of tactics and strategy available to employ.\nControls can sometimes be a bit finnicky and unreactive (utilizing certain moves or attacks may often leave your character static longer than the animation would make it seem necessary, and your commands - dodge, attack, move - in that state would be ignored -- equally some \"hold to complete\" moves can be interrupted and without any indication you will be holding the button to no effect and need to repress - sometimes more than once - to continue) but for the most part, controls are very snappy and responsive.\n\nThe story is... Well, the story itself may be a bit of a tossup - a lot of it is built up on games you may have never played (the original NIeR released in 2010 I think, and maybe other media) -- but the delivery is engaging and fantastic. Lore is drip-fed in a way that causes enjoyable \"I want to know more\" effects, but lets you pace your way in.\n\nCharacters, for the most part, are very deep and get fleshed out progressively over playthroughs, letting you form bonds and actually care for and about them.\n\nThe not-so-great:\n[minor SPOILERS]\nI mentioned \"playthorughs\" so, yeah: This isn't a game you beat just once and move on. Or even just twice.\nIn fact, the first two playthroughs - the second of which offers expanded lore and cutscenes and different perspectives and dialogue on what you knew of from playthrough 1 (\"A\") - are merely the prologue for the latter part of the game - which greatly expands the lore, the setting, and the emotional aspects of the game itself. There are technically 27 endings to the game, though only 5 really matter (and the 4th and 5th don't require a full replay).\n\nI got 6 endings (the most important 5, and a \"joke\" ending by accident) in around 36 hours so it's not that bad and while you may be asked to replay some dumb intro-fetch-side-quests, mostly the game remembers what quests you finished in the last playthrough and will not repeat them or let you start over where you were.\n\nThe bad:\nCombat can be a bit unforgiving early before you have access and use of \"plug-in chips\" which give you boosts to damage and defense, auto-use of recovery items when you're critcally wounded, and other boosts which will dramatically change your gameplay options.\nThe game doesn't do a very good job of explaining how to use them, how they work, or how you can upgrade them by combination and/or build your own multiple chip decks to switch by need and opportunity.\nBut once you get the hang of it and build a deck or two that suits you, it is night-to-day.\n\nIn conclusion:\nThis game was a sleeper hit when it was released, blowing everyone away by its depth and approach to storytelling.\nAnd with good reason.\n\nI loved almost every second of it and hold it in very high regard. It may not be for everyone, but I think almost everyone will get some degree of wonder and a cherishable and great experience with it if they last at least as long as ending B.", "timestamp_created": 1691969258, "timestamp_updated": 1691969258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144128119": {"recommendationid": "144128119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068280069", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2700, "last_played": 1691956988}, "language": "english", "review": "This game evoked in me interesting questions about consciousness and the nature of war.

Just beat the A campaign, and diving into NG+. Thankfully, this game still appears to have plenty of fresh content.\nI don't want to spoil anything, and I'm sure there's heaps I don't know yet. The campaign is really well paced, balancing reflective moments with crazy action. Although there were a few times where I dived into side content, every time I focused on the main missions I didn't want to put the game down. When the credits rolled it felt like the story was over, but I have so many questions.\nThe combat is amazing, and 2B's animations are some of the most fluid I've ever seen. Some games have difficulty balancing flashy animations with responsive controls, but this may be the best implementation I've played.\nAll in all, can't wait to dive in further and see what the rest

In that sense, this game is perfect for me, and has been perfect for me since I first played it in 2019. I'm not going to go into the specifics of the game in-depth, as this review is just going to be my love letter to this game.\n\nNieR: Automata is what I consider one of the two most important stories I've experienced with the other being Umineko. The main messages that both stories share is love, and embracing the future. That sounds simplistic, but the ways in which the messages are portrayed have struck a cord with me that I don't think I'll ever forget. Reflecting on this game as I was playing it for this playthrough I've realized just how much of an impact this game has had on my worldview. Feeling alone all the time as a kid, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, and all I ever really did was escape from the world. However, this game showed me humanity. The good and the bad, the beautiful and the ugly. This game is just so... human. The true ending of this game was eye-opening and showed me that others do care. It's humanist message has taught me a lot, and my future is more full of hope and love because of it. The world is full of fighting, and all manner of horrible things, but I believe in humanity.

There are also multiple parts where you have to walk extended distances while your character is injured, so you have to move very slowly. The first time I tried this part, I got punched behind some debris and got stuck for a while. Then I got punched down a hole I couldn\u2019t escape from.

I can't believe some people consider it to be a masterpiece. It's mediocre at best.\n\n1) Not a single character in this game has any personality. They are ALL so dull and ininteresting and their motivations make very little to no sense. I could not care less what happen to any character in this game.\n\n2) The story tries to be subtle and intellectual but it's actually boring and pretentious. Calling this a \"good story\" is like calling a banana duct-taped to a wall \"art\". And to the people who say \"You actually have to complete the game 3 times to have ending C to understand it and to make it good\" just GTFO. It's like saying \"You have to read all the Harry Potter books to make the first one good\", it's just bullshit. First playthrough should be good on itself.\n\n\n3) The open world is not ugly but it's not pretty either. It feels really outdated, even considering the game is from 2017. Everything is low-poly with mediocre textures. The only location that look \"good\" is the circus/fair. The world doesn't make you want to explore it. \n\n4) The combat system feels nice at first, but once you realise that you can be nearly invincible if you spam the dodge button, the combats lose ALL interest. Combine it with the fact that you can buy 99 small heals + 99 medium heals + 99 big heals for a fairly cheap price and you won't EVEN need to dodge attack. And finally, the combos and fighting possibilities lack a lot of depth and you fight every enemies in the same way.\n\n5) There are some questionnable game design decisions that make the game tedious. For example, the fact that retrieving your body triggers 3 pop-up windows. Or the fact that you have to reactivate some teleporter mid-game. Or the fact that 2B stumbles on pebbles and rubbles. And many other small things that make the game annoying.\n\n6) The \"side quests\" are nothing more than UPS quests: Talk to a NPC, go pick up 3 metal bolt in a field or talk to another NPC in the middle of nowhere then come back for reward. Some quests are a little more \"interesting\" like \"kill this group of enemies in less than 30s\" or \"reach this destination on foot before the NPC\" but that's about it....\n\nThe good things about this game are : \n-2b, you can clearly see that the devs spend more time on her than on any other characters or assets in the game. She has good design and she's well detailed.\n-The animation (combat, runing, etc) are GREAT. That's the reason why combat and movements are enjoyable at time, even though combat is button smashing.\n-All the mech phases/shoot'em up are good\n-The music and sound design is good, except for some dialogues that are not dumbed for some reasons.\n\nThe game is not trash, but it's really dull, lame and even annoying sometimes (regularly).\nI 100% believe that without the \"waifu\"/ \"sexelegant\" design of 2B, this game would have NEVER had that much attention and fanbase. People who worship this game have probably little to no cultural background to call that a masterpiece.\n", "timestamp_created": 1691230402, "timestamp_updated": 1691230402, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45150187611579895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143442201": {"recommendationid": "143442201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993251467", "num_games_owned": 600, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 3391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3391, "last_played": 1691169517}, "language": "english", "review": "I guess it IS playable, but during playthrough it annoyed me in so many ways, i would not possibly recommend it.

It was a breath of fresh air. On the other hand some other gameplay elements felt very repetitive after a while but it was also cool to see them.\n\nThis is a story driven game, though. Can AIs have something resembling a spirit or soul? Or will they always just imitate having one and never exercise their true free will. Do most people even do that these days? It's hard to say. I don't want to spoil too much because this game is best left to play blind. \n\nThe only other game that tackles these kind of questions (and better) that I know of is The Talos Principle.

By the end of Route B I got so sick of it, I built 9S around direct combat instead of hacking.\n\u2022 Difficulty balance? What difficulty balance? Normal difficulty is too easy, hard difficulty is too unfair (unless you enjoy getting one-two shot by an enemy that is not the most common class I suppose). I guess you'll be able to finish on Easy using only one foot. Feels like that there's supposed to be a difficulty in between but it's missing.\n\nAnd... that would be it, honestly. Oh, and minor spoilers but I feel like I definitely need to mention this - special thanks to dev team for letting us to finish and leave the game without burning ourselves out. When you finish Route C, you are given an ability to [spoiler]straight up purchase achievements you have locked with in-game currency. Story-related achievements are non-purchasable but you are able to pick up every misc. achievement you miss[/spoiler]. You are still free to stick around and unlock everything yourself, of course. However this is a great help if you feel that you are \"done\" with the game and developer doesn't force you to see everything (especially considering how grindy most japanese games are), they appreciate you for seeing Nier: Automata through the end and I absolutely love it.\n\nDo give it a shot if you are into \"watashi no kokoro watashi no tamashi\" games. You won't regret it, trust me.", "timestamp_created": 1690805300, "timestamp_updated": 1690805380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749847590923309326",

The story, characters and world building is some of the best I have ever seen. It might not be the most visually stunning game, but the world is beautiful and has a very unique feel to it. The story is extremely deep, multilayered and has a lot of emotional moments, its one of those games you still think about months after you beat it, and the developers leave a lot of secrets for you to figure out on your own without directly telling you what is happening, which makes the story more satisfying when you piece everything together. The side quests do a really good job of deepening the characters and world, and a lot of major plot reveals happen in these, which you might miss if you don't do them. The combat is simple but very fluid and fun and has a decent variety of weapons and combos. If none of that sells you on the game, 2B is hot af. This game is easily a 10/10 and one of the most memorable games I have ever played. Also the sound track is god tier and probably top 5 best game sound tracks of all time.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMw-DUnR10s&ab_channel=KeiichiOkabe-Topic\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsk3DTdTY3Y&ab_channel=KeiichiOkabe-Topic\n", "timestamp_created": 1690585376,

It was a sacrifice I agreed to. I could say that I believed wholeheartedly that I wanted to help another player, especially since said final challenge is deliberately near-impossible, and it was only because of someone else\u2019s sacrifice that I made it through. But in truth, I have no real answer as to why I willingly made the choice. The thought that keeps running through my head is a line from Matrix Revolutions: that the answer to why I persisted is simply because I chose to.\n\nThat ability to make carefully considered decisions that have no true purpose or meaning\u2014the very core of free will\u2014is a defining human trait, and the fact that this is something that cannot be taught or given to other living beings is a problem NieR Automata is almost pathologically fascinated with. It\u2019s a fact it dances with, argues with, screams at, cries about, and mourns from its first seconds until the moment its final credit rolls. No, director Yoko Taro doesn\u2019t have answers to the questions that the game poses, but he engages with what it means to be human in ways no game operating in AAA space has before, and certainly not one where you spend countless hours stylishly slicing up robots while dressed like the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at a FetLife dinner party.\n\nNieR Automata lets its anime-inspired freak flag fly in the early hours of the campaign, giving absolutely no indication of the depths it will reach. Taro knows that 2010\u2019s NieR was a thoughtful but mechanically uninspired game, which is why he brought in action-game savants Platinum Games to help assist with the sequel\u2019s numerous gameplay styles. Within this game\u2019s first hour, it\u2019s at once a scrolling-screen Gradius-style shooter, a full-3D hack-and-slash action adventure, a 2D platformer, a tactical RPG, and a large-scale mech-combat jamboree. Later, the ability to damage enemies through a Geometry Wars-style mini-game becomes a gameplay staple. Throughout NieR Automata, it\u2019s as if Platinum Games is showing off, and if they earn that braggadocio it\u2019s because the developer excels at every single genre field the game chooses to play in\u2014a rare jack-of-all-trades that masters all.\n\nMost of the game, however, is spent in 3D-action mode, exploring a city-sized open world that strangely alternates minute to minute between PlayStation 2-levels of graphical austerity and breathtaking, lush moments of natural beauty that weren\u2019t possible on that system. And all of it is bolstered by one of the most eclectic and evocative musical scores ever bestowed on a video game.\n\nThe game takes place 8,000 years into the future, where humanity has been supplanted by a race of deadly robots as the dominant species. Man\u2019s last hope of retaking the planet is in an army of hyper-powered, silver-haired androids acting under orders from our lunar-based government to cleanse Earth of the machines. We initially play as 2B, a leather-clad, cold-hearted, all-business soldier who ends up saddled with 9S, a hacker-model android with the personality of an awkward 14-year-old. Their mission is simple reconnaissance and errand-running at first, with a plethora of machine-crushing sidequests and plenty of the kind of varied, large-scale, multi-part boss fights that Platinum is famous for (and accessible here within a couple of playtime hours). The waters get muddy fast, though, once it turns out the robots may not all be the mindless killing machines humanity says they are.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious upfront that something might be off, as the supposedly lethal robots are redolent less of Terminators or the Borg than they are of the kindly robots from Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Castle in the Sky, only dwarf-sized. Most of them wander aimlessly, and many of them don\u2019t even attack when 2B or 9S wander too close. One particular robot, Pascal, waves the white flag the second he sees 2B, and invites her to a village where robots have discovered the futility of war, and have begun trying to figure out what to do with their sentience. Despite no physical resemblance or similarity to humans, across the world, the robots clumsily fumble toward humanity, savoring our joys, and dreading our mistakes in equal measure. One of the game\u2019s more bizarre, yet oddly affecting moments has our heroes coming across a hidden enclave full of robots trying to approximate human love by rocking empty cradles back and forth while chanting the word \u201cchild,\u201d miming sex acts on each other, and screaming out for someone\u2014anyone\u2014to hold them.\n\nDespite working in a genre whose ethos more or less relies on the concept of killing anything that moves, at any given moment, the game confronts the player with the shared values and ongoing personal development of the Other, and gives us multiple options, including flat-out murder, for engagement with it. There are narrative and gameplay consequences and advantages that result from every decision. Even the necessary fights against the deadliest of characters have justifications that require a measure of understanding and empathy from the player. NieR Automata is the first game to truly stand up and greet ludonarrative dissonance as a friend, and actually start the conversation about our bloodlust versus our empathy, while not short-shrifting the argument for either side.\n\nTaro employs every dirty game-design trick in the book to get his points across, up to and including some of the mind-trippy visual distortions in the game\u2019s user interface, and it\u2019s all in favor of story above all else, which never once takes the easy way out. Said story isn\u2019t afraid of offering up a high body count, indulging in non sequiturs, or laying a guilt trip on a particularly cool gameplay segment, and in general is utterly fearless at bringing us face to face with what it means to have latent humanity in a game genre that so very often holds empathy in contempt. There\u2019s power and glory to be had while playing NieR Automata, and perhaps the greatest testament to what\u2019s been created here is how much of that glory involves mercy, not murder. And that, coming from the developer whose greatest moment prior to this one involved a gun-slinging witch punching the face of God into the sun, is miraculous.\n", "timestamp_created": 1690562899, "timestamp_updated": 1690562899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504853427410125732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142963143": {"recommendationid": "142963143", "author": {"steamid": "76561199233174401", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 163, "playtime_at_review": 3527, "last_played": 1700477962}, "language": "english", "review": "To new players who see this - the game does not end when the credits roll, play the same save data next", "timestamp_created": 1690559136, "timestamp_updated": 1690559136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142959811": {"recommendationid": "142959811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198899060401", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2479, "last_played": 1692461585}, "language": "english", "review": "Life is meaningless", "timestamp_created": 1690555849, "timestamp_updated": 1690555849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142954856": {"recommendationid": "142954856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272687474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3734, "last_played": 1691110070}, "language": "english", "review": "When I heard that this game was a story-rich ARPG with 26 endings, I knew I had to completionist it, and coming out of the other side of it I'm both impressed and disappointed. \nOff the bat, the story is perfect for this kind of game, simplistic in it's story telling with a lot of subtext to be explored, characters comparable to the likes of studio ghibli, and successfully avoiding ludo-narrative dissonance. For the most part, the core gameplay isn't anything special but is robust and interesting enough to hold up across 60 hours without getting stale.

Between the gripping (and sometimes cynical) story, engaging gameplay, extremely iconic characters, and masterfully composed (and dynamic) music, there is something for almost anyone here. Give it a try, I truly believe it's one of the greatest video games and expressions of any story that has come to visual media. If nothing else, the opening mission is a great way to get a taste for the intensity of the story, atmosphere, and two main characters (extremely reminiscent of the opening mission from FFVII which is also a fantastic introduction) and it shouldn't last longer than 2 hours, in case you don't like it.\n\nThere aren't many downsides I have with this game but one of the only ones is the port. It was a game made for the PS4 rather than PC, and it shows with its performance. Though I've had one of the better experiences (from what I've seen), the game still drops frames occasionally and may not be great for lower spec PCs.\n\nI can't think of any other cons at the moment but if you're considering trying this game out, take it from a random internet person like myself: This game is amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1690445599, "timestamp_updated": 1690445599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142874948": {"recommendationid": "142874948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152760064", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1693809263}, "language": "english", "review": "Fucking awesome game with very similar tech to DMC.", "timestamp_created": 1690433729, "timestamp_updated": 1690433729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142872635": {"recommendationid": "142872635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021394237", "num_games_owned": 724, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2567, "last_played": 1690425392}, "language": "english", "review": "After finally finishing routes A, B, and C over a period of around 42 hours, I've got a pretty good understanding of the game's story, I think. But it's written by Yoko Taro, so who knows.\n\nI'll try to keep the spoilers minimal.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n- The story has some pretty strong themes of existentialism here, following characters as they struggle to find meaning in a world filled with tragedy and pointless conflict.\n- In the tradition of the first NIER game, the game plays with camera angles to seamlessly transition between genres. Get used to the game changing camera angles on the fly.\n- The combat in this game is satisfying, and can get pretty hectic--there's a lot to manage so you'll flex those situational awareness muscles.\n- The hacking minigame is lots of fun.\n- The final (Route C/D) dungeon/boss was awesome and I wish more games tried to use mechanics for storytelling and dramatic effect. Honestly most of Route C was fantastic.\n- Fleshing out some details about the first NIER and linking the two together was nice, considering how otherwise disjointed from its predecessor the game can seem.\n- Keiichi Okabe's music is top-tier--probably the best video game soundtrack I've ever heard. The only other thing that comes close for me is the music from the first NIER.\n- Character designs and just the art design in general is great.\n- Voice cast is great in both Japanese and English. Unlike so many Japanese games I've played--even ones from the same publisher--the dub is of high quality.\n\nTHE MEH\n- The story can feel pretentious; sometimes it beats you over the head with its themes when it doesn't really need to. This being said, sometimes the story wasn't all that clear either. It's a heavy story that doesn't always need the anime-style tropes that sometimes pop up.\n- Having to play through the first campaign again to get to Route C isn't great--I found myself blitzing through content and skipping cutscenes I'd already seen. Luckily Route B only took me about 4 hours.\n- For a game by a studio that prioritizes 60fps, having 30fps cutscenes was certainly a choice.\n- Not 100% sure why they reintroduced Emil into this game just to be a shopkeeper. I'd have hoped for a little more there.\n\nTHE UGLY\n- This game does not look amazing at high resolutions. Most textures (not all) were pretty muddy and the level of foliage was low, even by 2017 standards. I ended up using texture packs to clean things up a bit.\n- The port is better than it was in 2017, but still has some issues. I alt-tabbed during a cutscene and when I came back the game was stuck in windowed mode, even when using mods to fix graphics issues.\n- Speaking of that... PC games should not require modders to fix basic program functionality. I'm thankful they do, but they shouldn't have had to in the first place.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nNIER:Automata is an incredibly fun game that does great things with the medium and tells a solid story with heavy themes. I personally think it may be a tad pretentious and a bit overhyped, but it's still one of my personal favorites.", "timestamp_created": 1690429598, "timestamp_updated": 1690429598, "voted_up": true,

The game is constantly evolving in surprising ways much like the machine lifeforms you'll be combating throughout the story. All of this would be enough to make NieR:Automata a top-notch action RPG but what really makes this game important is the questions it asks you through the combination of all of these elements. NieR:Automata doesn't just ask what it means to be a video game, but what it means to be a conscious being in a godless universe. Yoko Taro and the PlatinumGames crew have used the medium of video games to tell a story that can only be told through the interactive medium. NieR:Automata is a showcase of the power of video games, not just as entertainment, but as art.

The game's character design is visually appealing and popular in cosplay and fan-art communities, and this is the content that sparks interest on social media. As a result, these characters have gained immense popularity among people who haven't actually played the game, leading to a superficial perception of the game, or worse still, complete ignorance of the games existence.\n\nSome individuals may approach the game with expectations of finding more visual, sexual stimuli, while others might be discouraged by the vacuous references they've encountered online, assuming the game lacks substance.\n\nHowever, once players delve into it, they will find a narrative and characters that are certainly not lacking in substance. It would be a disservice to spoil anything specific about the story, so I will leave my description vague. But I will say that the game blends exposition and implicit world-building and has an emphasis on thought provoking philosophical themes.\n\nThe music is exceptional. There is a running joke within the Nier community that these games are like buying a soundtrack with a game thrown in as an added bonus.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, while the games graphics may look a bit dated, with plenty of low resolution textures and few detailed models, but the art style is inspired and consistent. Many of the environments are able to be beautiful despite having a minimalistic design.\n\nThe gameplay is particularly interesting in the way it blends different genres. At first glance, the games appears to be a 3rd person action, brawler, but it cleverly incorporates elements of RPGs, shmups, bullet-hell, platforming, and more. Side quests, collecting weapons and upgrades, and a fishing mini-game further enrich the gameplay and replayability.\n\nOne aspect often overlooked is the game's general feeling of movement and combat. The developers specifically intended to create highly satisfying and enjoyable character movement, and they succeeded in this goal. Many other action games could learn from the techniques employed in this game.\n\nDespite its widespread popularity, Nier: Automata is such an excellent game that it could arguably be considered underrated.

As a seasoned gamer, I can confidently say that this masterpiece of a game is nothing short of groundbreaking in its execution.\n\nOne of the first things that struck me about NieR:Automata was its stunning visuals. From the desolate ruins of a post-apocalyptic Earth to the mesmerizingly beautiful cityscapes, every frame was meticulously crafted to immerse you fully in this dystopian universe. The attention to detail is awe-inspiring, and the juxtaposition between the vast open-world environments and intimate interiors is seamless.\n\nBut visuals alone do not make a game unforgettable; it's the depth of its narrative that truly sets NieR:Automata apart. Prepare to contemplate the very essence of what it means to be human, as the game delves into existential themes with an elegance rarely seen in this medium. The thought-provoking exploration of identity, consciousness, and the blurred lines between humans and machines will keep you pondering long after you put down the controller.\n\nAs for gameplay, NieR:Automata shines. Its combat system is fluid, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. Decimating waves of enemies with graceful acrobatics and a mesmerizing array of weapon combos feels utterly exhilarating, and the game's dynamic difficulty adjustment ensures that you are continuously challenged without being overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, what truly elevates this game is its hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, composed by the masterful Keiichi Okabe. Every note and melody is carefully woven into the fabric of the game, seamlessly blending with the visuals and narrative to create an auditory experience that transcends the boundaries of gaming.

This game is nothing short of a masterpiece, blending an emotionally charged narrative, breathtaking visuals, and exhilarating gameplay into an unforgettable journey.\n\nFrom the very start, Nier: Automata grips you with its captivating story. The plot explores profound themes like identity, purpose, and the essence of humanity, all while unraveling a mesmerizing post-apocalyptic tale. The game's characters are richly developed, each carrying their own burdens, and their struggles resonate deeply with players. From the enigmatic 2B to the quirky 9S and even the rogue-like A2, the protagonists' journey is an emotional rollercoaster that tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you pondering long after you've turned off your console.\n\nVisually, Nier: Automata is a breathtaking marvel. The world is gorgeously crafted, ranging from desolate ruins to lush forests, and each environment feels alive with meticulous detail. The contrasting landscapes complement the game's thematic depth, and the unique art style gives the game a distinctive and unforgettable look. Character designs are striking and complement their personalities perfectly, adding an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.\n\nHowever, the true brilliance of Nier: Automata lies in its gameplay. PlatinumGames' signature action-packed combat blends seamlessly with RPG elements, creating an addictive and fluid system that never ceases to amaze. The smooth transitions from intense aerial battles to ground-based combos make every encounter feel like a beautiful dance of blades. The variety of weapons, combined with a customizable pod that provides different abilities, ensures that combat remains engaging and satisfying throughout the game.\n\nFurthermore, the game cleverly implements multiple gameplay styles, ranging from intense hack-and-slash sequences to bullet hell-inspired shoot-'em-up segments. These inventive changes keep the gameplay fresh and exciting, preventing any sense of monotony from setting in.\n\nBeyond the main story, Nier: Automata features a plethora of side quests and optional content, each offering valuable insights into the game's world and characters. These diversions are thoughtfully crafted, contributing to the overall narrative and providing an opportunity to further connect with the beautifully crafted characters.\n\nMoreover, the game's soundtrack is nothing short of spectacular. The hauntingly beautiful melodies, coupled with hauntingly poignant vocals, further amplify the emotional impact of key moments. Composer Keiichi Okabe's work is an auditory marvel, enhancing the immersive experience and making it an essential component of the overall package.\n\nIn conclusion, Nier: Automata is a gaming gem that leaves an indelible mark on all who venture into its world. It deftly combines an emotionally charged narrative, stunning visuals, and exhilarating gameplay to create an experience that transcends the confines of traditional video games. This is not just a game; it's an emotional odyssey that will stay with you long after the credits roll. If you are seeking a profound, thrilling, and emotionally rich gaming experience, Nier: Automata is an absolute must-play.", "timestamp_created": 1689953756, "timestamp_updated": 1689953756,

And if you've played any of his other games to completion, you'll know pretty much what to expect from this one. But if you aren't familiar with Yoko Taro, there are a few things you should know about him before listening to the hype. Bear in mind that none of these things are intended to dissuade you from playing [i]Automata[/i]--to the contrary, I very much think that you should!--but setting some expectations ahead of time will prepare you to have the best possible experience with this game.\n\nThe first thing you should know about Yoko Taro is that he is out to troll you. He knows what the average gamer will expect from a video game, and he will absolutely take full advantage of that knowledge to mess with you at every turn. Some of the ways he messes with you will be fun, subverting your expectations in an enjoyable way. Others will be frustrating beyond belief, but constructed in such a way that you will either feel compelled to overcome them or give up and throw the game on your backlog to gather dust. Be forewarned, this is true many times over for completionists--the man has no compunctions whatsoever about wasting your time, and it's easy to imagine that some of the decisions that made it into this game, did so solely because he thought they would be funny at your expense. None of them will prevent you from completing the story, but many of them will crop up in incredibly annoying ways if and when you go for 100% completion.\n\nThe other thing you should know about Yoko Taro is that he is weird, and his games reflect that. He is a man that wears the head of one of his characters over his own head at all times in public. (His answer changes every time someone asks him why.) He includes attractive women in skimpy outfits in his games, not for any purportedly thematic reason as some creative types do, but simply because he openly likes ogling them. (This should answer the all-too-common question of why 2B is wearing a maid outfit in [i]Automata[/i].) All of his games include outlandish (and often horrifying) plot developments and colorful characters who are all broken in a variety of strange and tragic ways. If anything, [i]Automata[/i] is easily the most grounded of all of his games up to this point, but those who have played the [i]Drakengard[/i] series or the original [i]NieR[/i] will know that isn't saying much.\n\n[b]So if [i]NieR: Automata[/i] is a weird game with trollish elements made by a weird guy with a fetish for maid outfits and spherical head-helmets, why should you play it?[/b]\n\nBecause it is very, [i]very[/i] good. It will surprise you in ways I can't explain due to spoilers. It will delight you with its [i]beautiful[/i] soundtrack and deliciously smooth free-flowing combat, courtesy of the character action masters at PlatinumGames. It will shock you with revelations that completely recontextualize earlier parts of the game, making the multiple playthroughs required to see all of the endings (and the all-important \"true\" ending) feel earned and worthwhile. It is one of those rare games where everything, even the trollish bits, were included for a specific reason to elicit a specific reaction, and that reaction lands damn near every time. It's a roller coaster ride of a game, in more ways than one, and it's an [i]experience[/i] you won't quite get in almost any other game.\n\nI talk in some of my reviews about intentionality in game design, usually in the context of a mediocre developer just throwing some stuff into their game because they thought it sounded good or because it's what other games are doing. [i]NieR: Automata[/i] is the antithesis of this way of doing things, down to the smallest details, like the options menu [spoiler]being structured like a console for the android you're controlling[/spoiler]. I can't think of a single thing about this game that wasn't incorporated for a reason, even if that reason is as silly as Yoko Taro wanting to mess with players by [spoiler]making it nearly impossible to catch a certain specific fish in order to complete a pointless log[/spoiler], just because he knows that will bother some people.\n\nTL;DR: Play this game. Ignore the hype, go into it with an open mind, and see it through to the true ending (which requires three playthroughs, but trust me, that's a good thing).\n\nADDENDUM (minor spoilers for a sidequest): A quick note to those who harp on about the \"deep philosophical themes\" in this game--[spoiler]remember the \"Jean-Paul's Melancholy\" side quest? The one with the haughty existentialist machine who is too good for his followers' gifts? Remember how that quest ended? That's Yoko Taro laughing at you.

There are dozens of other reviews for that. All I want to say is that, if you do plan on playing this game, I'd recommend playing NieR Replicant, the game preceding NieR:Automata, first. The knowledge of things and events that occurred in NieR Replicant enhanced so many moments from NieR:Automata for me and I can assure you that I would have enjoyed the game much less without the knowledge I had from NieR Replicant. Also, NieR Replicant is just a great game in it's own right, so it shouldn't be a chore to play it. And if you don't want to play it and just want to play NieR:Automata or you want to play NieR:Automata first because it interests you more, then do that.

Micro building feels like it actually affects gameplay, but if you don't care about that you can also just do whatever and still succeed. It's the perfect combo of the both. My only complaint is that heavy swords don't really do anything and that level kind of only exists. Apart from that every boss encounter is unique and feels like a passionately build level on its own. \n\n2.Story\nThis is by far the best story I have ever seen. Every little detail has a meaning from beginning to end, the world feels alive and very realistic in a sense that is hard to describe. The story also constantly evolves what it is about and the 5 main \"routes\" show that perfectly. One moment you'll be sitting here playing some random Japanese anime robot vs androids game and the next you'll be confronted with hardcore philosophical questions, that the game tries to answer. Nothing about the story feels manufactured and therefore it's immersive and very relatable. This is especially seen very near the end. I won't spoil the details, but be ready to have your mind blown multiple times and confronted with very intense dialogue.\n\n3.Music\nThis cannot go unadressed. If you thought all of this sounded pretty good just wait till you hear the music. Every song is a banger and perfectly underlines the tone of the game. Never in your life have you heard such a perfectly fitting soundtrack. \n\nConclusion:\nNieR:Automata is a timeless masterpiece and another perfect entry in the Yoko Taro game selection. It's sad the NieR story is over now and we won't see this world again. As for now this game is an easy recommendation and a 10/10 and the only game I would call nearly flawless in it's core.", "timestamp_created": 1689623296, "timestamp_updated": 1689623296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142285283": {"recommendationid": "142285283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199486974511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 841, "last_played": 1689632403}, "language": "english", "review": "I like everything.", "timestamp_created": 1689621190, "timestamp_updated": 1689621190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514925360679626465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142283583": {"recommendationid": "142283583", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168536334", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4933, "last_played": 1697327585}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just a masterpiece, I would recommend to anyone and everyone. The story, music, setting, and overall tone reminds me of Metal Gear Solid games (during their heyday back between 1999-2004) even if they gameplay and combat is rather different from those games. It's the sense you get when playing that you are taking part in a story that really, truly matters. The soundtrack is one of the best that I have ever heard in a game, I listen to it in my free time when I'm not even gaming and I almost never do that with any other games.\n\nThe way it plays is kind of a combination of a twin stick shooter (Pod mechanic) and a hack and slash/character action game but without an emphasis on combos. But there are also airborne sections which play like a mech style of game. It never got boring to me and I was really bummed when the credits rolled, not because the story was bad ...only because the story was over and I really wanted it to keep going. Luckily, I found out that the game has multiple endings and you have to play through it several times to get the true ending.\n\nThe voice acting and storytelling is top notch, it is better than many games with much higher budgets. There is a new Anime series that was recently released and it is equally well done. Yoko Taro (the writer/director of the game) is the greatest and I hope Square is working with him to make a sequel to this game, it would truly be a mistake not to. \n\nIf you see this game available for $20, by all means, do grab it.

It's simply incredible how well this world was constructed and expanded upon in NieR and NieR: Automata.\n\nThe game takes place several millennia after the first installment, which is why you don't immediately recognize the world. However, all the important locations, although completely devastated, hidden, or expanded, are still there. Through archive data and dialogues, you can also learn why the world has evolved in this way.\n\nThe story is also on its own level. By repeatedly shattering the worldview, it can be compared to Attack on Titan. But there are also numerous side quests that add even more depth to everything. Along the way, you are constantly confronted with moral questions that are not so easy to answer and leave you pensive.\n\nThe gameplay is perfectly executed, as expected from Platinum Games. 2B controls in a hack-and-slash manner, while 9S provides a good variation through machine hacking, which also supports the worldbuilding by allowing us to experience the emotions and thoughts of the machines.\n\nThe graphics, and especially the soundtrack, are beautiful as well. I haven't seen anywhere else where the OST consists of a mix of different languages, which is intended to represent a kind of future language.\n\nI've completed the game in its entirety for the second time now, including all the endings and side quests, and it has definitely made it into my top 10 games. I'm really excited to replay NieR: Replicant now.", "timestamp_created": 1689600649, "timestamp_updated": 1689600649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142261277": {"recommendationid": "142261277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984293050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1225, "last_played": 1691147077}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]NieR:Automata is a masterpiece[/h1]\n\n[i]Spoiler free[/i]\n\n[h2]Summary[/h2]\nNieR: Automata uses every element of a video game (gameplay, storytelling, perspective and character building, music, the enviroment etc etc) woven together to create a story and convey emotions in a way that can only be done through the medium of a video game. \n\nWhen I saw the screenshots and trailers of the game I did not want to play it. But years later I'm glad I finally did. And like any piece of art it might not resonate with you, but if it does... \n\n...well here is one of the best games you will ever play.\n\n[h2]The story[/h2]\nGameplay wise the game starts with a bang.\nThe story starts slow, but picks up and is a big part of why this game is a masterpiece.\n\n(slight spoiler ahead about how you engage with the story not about it's contents) \n[spoiler]When you think you first finished the game, but have so many unanswered questions know that this is the whole point of the game. You go through the story again (and quicker, and different) through a different lens and start unpacking the story bit by bit. It caught me by surprise how much I liked this aspect as I'm not one to replay singleplayer games.[/spoiler]\n\nYou will not understand everything at first.\nOne tip I can give is to keep going forward and don't waste too much time on sidequests (at first) that you don't like or stuff you don't understand. Keep going forward 2B.\n\n[h2]The soundtrack[/h2]\nIt's insanely good and I really mean 10 out of 10 good. It's not just that the songs are great and well composed. How the music fluently intertwines with where you are and what you're doing is something I have never seen before in a game. How does this work? Well: every track has multiple versions on top of that there are versions with and without vocals and if that wasn't enough most of them have an 8 bit retrofied version to fit a certain gameplay element.\n\n[h2]The combat system[/h2]\nThe combat system is very simple at first glance but is actually deep and intricate if you are willing to go for it. So it's really up to you if you want to engage in the beauty that the combat system has to offer. Different characters offer different playstyles and depending on the weapons you wield you open up more deviations and different combos. The combat is also as smooth as it can be.\n\n[h2]The RPG elements[/h2]\nThe RPG elements of building your character are light but set up in a smart way that really fits the theme of the game. I wont go into much detail and again you can choose to not really engage with the system but if you start doing so (for example later in the game) you'll have a lot of fun.\n\n[h2]Does it feel dated?[/h2]\nStylistically it's beautiful and the game does not feel that dated. \nA lot of newer games can learn from the action and RPG elements you will find here.\n\n[h2]Does it run on the Steam Deck?[/h2]\nYes, this game should be Steam Deck verified, because Proton was made with NieR:Automata in mind (no joke) and you'll feel that when you run the game.

The story is seen as absolutely incredible though, which it isn't, it's also fairly mediocre.\n\nI don't doubt that when the game came out the story was profound and revolutionary, now though, it's just your typical \"AI/human realises AI can be conscious\" story. You've seen stuff like this way more times already, and a lot of those times done far better. The characters are one dimensional and experience a very linear character arc. AI believes machines aren't conscious and they want to kill them all; AI faces proof that the machines are conscious, still doesn't believe they're conscious and wants to kill them; AI after a lot of proof realises that the machines are conscious but still kills them anyway; machines did something bad to the AI, now AI wants to kill all machines and believes they're not conscious; AI realises machines are conscious and no longer wants to kill them; THE END.\n\nThe characters also have additional character arcs involving them realising they like someone as a friend, in an equally linear way.\n\nSide quests barely have any story to them, it's mainly that they'll throw a random concept out there like idk a machine having a sister, and then just leave you with that concept without any real conclusion aside from \"they lived happily ever after\".\n\nFor the first 20h, basically no story is told at all, nothing profound, nothing really that interesting, there's a couple mysteries thrown around too, but we know literally nothing about them. Then for the next 10h or so you'll find out what all that story before meant, and then for the last 5h or so you'll get the conclusion to that story with some honestly fairly decent plot twists.\n\nI'd give this a mixed review if I could, but well steam doesn't have that. If you've never experienced any media portraying the same themes as this game, and or you don't really have any of your own opinions about this, then you'll probably thoroughly enjoy the story, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it, aside from just taking it out of your backlog.\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1689435447, "timestamp_updated": 1689438282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8,

I spent a lot of time on route A (32 hours) and mostly enjoyed it when I played but found it forgettable and it rarely stuck with me when I wasn't playing.  The combat is mostly combos and dodging and frankly I'm just not very good at that.  I found the opening hour impossible until I changed started playing on easy.  I often didn't know what I was supposed to be doing and there often seemed to be very intentional barriers to actually enjoying it.  \n\nAll of that changed toward the end of route A and the story really picked up.  Route B isn't a repeat AT ALL-  combat was suddenly a twin-stick shooter and it was much quicker (maybe 7 hours).  Routes C/D took another 11 hours and the story got really intense.  Ah- that's what people are  talking about.  I get it now.  \n\nIts a serious time investment but while the first half of this game did very little for me the 2nd half was absolutely brilliant.", "timestamp_created": 1689394916, "timestamp_updated": 1689395932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142104278": {"recommendationid": "142104278", "author": {"steamid": "76561199023181935", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1692064000}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great soundtrack.

Desde la deslumbrante blancura del desierto hasta los magn\u00edficos fuegos artificiales en el parque de atracciones, y luego sumergirme en la vegetaci\u00f3n que envolv\u00eda el castillo medieval. A medida que avanzaba, recopilaba informaci\u00f3n sobre los antiguos habitantes del planeta y estudiaba el comportamiento de androides y m\u00e1quinas a trav\u00e9s de misiones secundarias, intentando comprender qu\u00e9 tan cerca o lejos est\u00e1n de la humanidad. Otras veces, simplemente disfrutaba pescando junto a una cascada.\n\nDe vez en cuando, el juego parec\u00eda divertirse conmigo, en lugar de al rev\u00e9s. NieR alternaba entre ser un shooter, un juego de plataformas, un juego isom\u00e9trico e incluso un desaf\u00edo de balas infernal.\n\nUna vez que te abres al mundo y a los personajes de NieR, no hay vuelta atr\u00e1s. El juego, con su sofisticaci\u00f3n y acentos h\u00e1bilmente colocados, te conecta f\u00e1cilmente con sus h\u00e9roes, villanos e incluso personajes secundarios a quienes puedes ayudar en tus viajes. Sin embargo, te aplasta con un final inevitable que se revela en un drama lujoso y cruel, cada vez que completas una nueva vuelta (s\u00ed, porque debes jugar al menos tres veces para obtener el cuadro completo).\n\nAdem\u00e1s de los finales can\u00f3nicos de la historia, hay muchos otros finales, en su mayor\u00eda negativos, que encuentras en situaciones inesperadas a medida que avanzas. Aunque solo he descubierto un par de ellos por mi cuenta, a\u00fan sigo terminando el resto.\n\nJugar con cada uno de los h\u00e9roes (2B, 9S y 2A) muestra un nuevo lado de NieR, a veces sorprendente, y presenta nuevas mec\u00e1nicas de juego. Aunque solo hay un arsenal compartido entre los tres, es extremadamente diverso, con m\u00e1s de 30 tipos de armas cuerpo a cuerpo. Cada arma tiene su propia cadena de combos que se desarrolla a medida que aumentas su nivel. Tambi\u00e9n hay una amplia variedad de apoyo de fuego en forma de unidades t\u00e1cticas Pod, que tambi\u00e9n sirven como medio de comunicaci\u00f3n e intercambio de informaci\u00f3n con el B\u00fanker, la base de androides en \u00f3rbita.\n\nPara una experiencia de juego m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda, hay una gran cantidad de chips (en su mayor\u00eda habilidades pasivas) que puedes utilizar para personalizar tu estilo de juego seg\u00fan tus preferencias y necesidades.\n\nLas peleas en s\u00ed son din\u00e1micas y coloridas, y las r\u00e1pidas esquivas con cambios de espacio agregan un toque de elegancia cinematogr\u00e1fica, d\u00e1ndote la ilusi\u00f3n de inmortalidad.\n\nLa m\u00fasica en el juego es un ejemplo perfecto de c\u00f3mo complementar la experiencia visual y narrativa. Cada composici\u00f3n est\u00e1 llena de sentimiento y enfatiza lo que sucede en la pantalla de una manera impactante, haciendo que tus dedos se estremezcan de emoci\u00f3n. Llevo semanas escuchando las composiciones de NieR y es imposible elegir una favorita (aunque estoy obsesionado con \"End of the Unknown\").\n\nComo es evidente por todo lo mencionado anteriormente, me encanta NieR en todos sus aspectos y enfoques. Por lo general, cuando disfrutas de un juego, en alg\u00fan momento encuentras al menos una peque\u00f1a imperfecci\u00f3n. \n\nEn NieR hubo tiempo para maravillarme explorando un mundo lujoso, emocionarme con la m\u00fasica, re\u00edr, llorar, enamorarme y, finalmente, comprender que este juego no se olvidar\u00e1 f\u00e1cilmente...", "timestamp_created": 1689024934, "timestamp_updated": 1689025602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141788696": {"recommendationid": "141788696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361585329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1624, "last_played": 1690428623}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been years since the release of Nier:Automata and there's little to say that isn't known already; the art and music are top-notch, the combat and most game mechanics are correct -even great at times- but the narrative is all over the place, which at times can be quite obvious with the game not knowing what it wants to be, and as a result it brings the whole package down quite a bit.\n\nDo I recommend it?, yeah, it's a decent experience, but it's not the 11/10 that many people cream their pants about, a respectable 7/10 with some great ideas but questionable execution.", "timestamp_created": 1689024755, "timestamp_updated": 1689024755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141787569": {"recommendationid": "141787569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329375162", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1689955949}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best games ive ever played", "timestamp_created": 1689023598, "timestamp_updated": 1689023598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141787276": {"recommendationid": "141787276", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202823912", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2706, "last_played": 1698852122}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, didn't know I would be so in to it as I did.

Terrible things happen, and people suffer for what seems like no reason. Yes, this world is terrible, but it's also very beautiful, and it's worth fighting for. \n\nReal talk tho, the story is absolutely phenomenal. The graphics and music comp are beautiful (astounding, really), and the game play is satisfying and challenging. The game play switches between hack-and-slash. shoot-em-up, and even some bullet-hell type stuff, but it blends and seams together perfectly. To get the full experience of the story, you'll have to play through it at least 3 times, but I swear to you, it's worth it. Just stick through it to the end, listen to the different stories the game offers you. Each story is just as impactful and heart-wrenching as the last.\n\nSome spoiler territory following, but nothing too specific:\n\n[spoiler] I wanted to 100% complete the game. Get every single fish, item, pod, weapon upgrade, quest, every ending. And I got pretty far too. Maybe about 80% completion overall. But then I was left with one last decision by one of the final endings (E). And you know what? I might regret that decision in the future, but I came to the realization that nothing really lasts forever. And I realized that I was ready to part with everything I had worked so hard for in the game, so I did. And I hope it ends up helping someone in the long run, as others have helped me during my play-through. [/spoiler]\n\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played in my life. It is something that I will never be able to experience for the first time ever again. And I hope that this review can get others to at least give it a try.\n\nI also want to thank anyone and everyone who has ever sacrificed to help a total stranger, even one you might hate.

I was expecting dark souls difficulty, but I didn't really mind. The game is lovely; Yoko Taro's more lewd aspects are driven out with the self-destruct feature.

How foolish I was.\n\nI'd like to start with two 'negative' aspects of the game, in my personal opinion:\n\nYou can't run. The character we control is fairly fast, and we have a dash that we can spam. As we progress in the game, we unlock mounts that allow us to traverse the game map more quickly, but YOU CAN'T RUN in an open-world game. I'd like to know the opinions of people who have played the game, but this 'lack' bothered me a lot.\nThere's a lot of backtracking to be done. Often, we'll discover places or objects that we can't access unless we control a specific character. During the story or while exploring, we'll come across NPCs, crates, or similar things that we can't interact with unless we control a certain character. So, we have to keep in mind the uncovered points and return to them when we have the opportunity with the appropriate character. From an objective point of view, it's not bad; it's something found in many games. But from a subjective point of view, it's something that annoyed me quite a bit.\nI played and completed this game in 2023 (6 years after its release), and the only thing I have to say is that I regret not having played it earlier.\n\nThis game has a powerful story and lore. I finished it today, and I'm shocked by everything that happened. The characters are incredibly well done, as is the world-building, and it tackles several more or less profound themes, but it does so excellently.\n\nTo complete the base story of the game, you have to do 4 runs with 4 different endings: A/B and C/D.\n\nEach run is different from the others and only provides us with more information about what is happening, why it is happening, and parts of the game world will be modified as the runs progress... I don't want to go into detail because I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nI have no idea how many endings there are in this game (I'll find out later), but there are many to discover. Sometimes they are troll endings (very amusing and well done), while others add important pieces to the plot (so far, I've managed to unlock 4 or 5 besides the main ones).\n\nContrary to many open-world games from the old and new generations, here, exploration is almost always rewarded. You can find weapons, cosmetics, data that help us better understand the story, etc. It's not like in Assassin's Creed, where a chest might contain crap that could drop from a common enemy.\n\nIt's always worth doing ALL the side missions (based on my experience, the only other open-world game that gave me this feeling was The Witcher 3) because once they are completed, you will always discover something more about the game world, unique rewards will be given, things that we normally wouldn't have access to will be unlocked, or even alternative endings will be provided. So, doing them will NEVER be a waste of time.\n\nWithout taking anything away from other parts of the game, the one that personally touched me the most is Pascal's story. I couldn't hold back a tear at that moment.\n\nIn my opinion, this title should be one of the games that everyone should play at least once in their life. I recommend buying it at full price to support the developers, but it's up to you to decide whether to do that, wait for discounts to purchase it, or get it from a key website. The important thing is that you play it.\n\nMy biggest mistake back then was judging and underestimating it based on the first 2-3 hours of gameplay. I hope you won't do the same because it truly has a lot to offer.\n\nTo conclude, I'd like to talk about the 'E' ending. It was magical to be able to destroy the credits, and it's something I haven't seen in any video game since Devil May Cry.\n\nRating: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1688833471, "timestamp_updated": 1688833471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141610528": {"recommendationid": "141610528", "author": {"steamid": "76561199157744409", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1688831935}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me va de la verga.", "timestamp_created": 1688831988, "timestamp_updated": 1688831988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141606093": {"recommendationid": "141606093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120380549", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1697819429}, "language": "english", "review": "CAn a horny robot and her horny companion beat the cycle of death and rebirth?", "timestamp_created": 1688828172, "timestamp_updated": 1688828172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284441947937012", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141600650": {"recommendationid": "141600650", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097109463", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2682, "last_played": 1688823501}, "language": "english", "review": "After completing all the ending of the game i can finally watch the lore video's \nbtw 10/10 game", "timestamp_created": 1688823301, "timestamp_updated": 1688823301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677674591541290283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141598786": {"recommendationid": "141598786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079466252", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "playtime_at_review": 1550, "last_played": 1700105497}, "language": "english", "review": "Yoko Taro asks a lot from you as a player, but in return delivers one of the most unique story-telling experiences in gaming.

Though I have had a lot of fun playing through DMC titles back during the PS2 golden era, and I'm no stranger to punishing titles like Dark Souls or Hollow Knight, this game feels so bland...\n\nStarting with the superficial, it's not a very visually exciting world. Aside from the amusement park, the world is uninspired and devoid of detail. The character models look great and are very well animated, but they're in total contrast to the incredibly muddy and repetitive textures everywhere else.\n\nThe combat is fine, plenty of weapon variety and skills to choose from, but it's nothing special. Every encounter plays out essentially the same way.\n\nThe difficulty scaling is ridiculous. Normal difficulty level is boring, button mashing is all that's required to progress. Hard difficulty is absurd... the majority of enemies can basically one-hit kill you... and yet that's what 'Very hard' explicitly states - one hit to die. So then, why make 'Hard' difficulty essentially the same thing? On Normal difficulty, you can kill enemies that are 20 levels higher than you without too much trouble. On Hard, you get annihilated by enemies that are even 1-2 levels lower than you if you're not paying the utmost attention. \n\nWhat exacerbates the nonsensical difficulty scaling even more is the death system. People online seem to compare the death system to that of Dark Souls. That's just objectively incorrect. Dark Souls titles punish a death by potentially erasing any 'un-banked' 'exp/cash'. You [b] still [/b] have your equipment and your stats (stats that are baked into your character and have a much greater bearing on your build and the difficulty). Death in Nier is FAR more punishing. If you die in Nier, you lose all of your chips which cost a fortune to buy and upgrade. In Nier, your chips are by far the most important part of a build. Without those chips, you are [b] massively [/b] weakened, and should you die attempting to retrieve them (very likely on Hard difficulty), They're all gone - I hope you enjoying grinding mobs! It's just pointless and unnecessarily punishing...\n\nI will refrain from commenting on the story, as that is surely something that needs to be appreciated from at least one completion.\n\n[b] Climbing ladders was fun!

For these reasons, I can confidently say this is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest game ever made.\n\nFor being a sequel, it's presentation of its story is so well done you won't need to have played the predecessor Nier Replicant. Yet the way the story is understandable both with and without playing Replicant, it can usually drive you to play the first Nier just based on how good it felt to experience Automata. \n\nThe game-play balances hack-and-slash, bullet hell, retro mini-games, and a mix of all the former in a unique and incredibly fun way. On the surface, it may seem repetitive and uninspired with games like the Devil May Cry series or Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance being staples of the hack-and-slash genre. Despite, all that being said, Automata perfected hack-and-slash with other game genres in a rewarding and enticing manner done like no other game.\n\nThe design is simply impeccable. While the game depends heavily on a good operating system (namely your GPU), the landscapes, character models, areas, and effects are brilliant if your system handles it. \n\nThe voice acting of Automata is some of the greatest ever performed in both English and Japanese Every voice actor nails their role and the performance of 9S's English voice actor is genuinely the best video game voice acting performance ever.\n\nThe music is yet another fantastic part of the Nier franchise. Not only does it tend to fit with the story, it adapts to the game and evolves to your situation. The chaos language and having both narrative value and being beautifully composed make for one of the most gorgeous soundtracks across all MEDIA. Only rivaled to it's predecessor Replicant.\n\nThe game has tons of replay value with its various endings and three routes. It builds upon it's story with the fact so much is left up to player interpretation. Not in a confusing and disappointing way but rather an interesting approach that leads you to delve deep into the lore and full understanding of it's lore and narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend NieR:Automata. This game is one of the most emotionally touching and well written video games ever. \n\nFinal Rating: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1688430373, "timestamp_updated": 1688430373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499184310436248779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141253757": {"recommendationid": "141253757", "author": {"steamid": "76561199476902732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 638, "last_played": 1688429027}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no me esperaba que este juego fuera tan bueno al igual que 2b", "timestamp_created": 1688429230, "timestamp_updated": 1688429230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141246179": {"recommendationid": "141246179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802011515", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 174, "last_played": 1688410225}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for anime thighs, left with emotional damage and an existential crisis. 10/10\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ef\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c6\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u28fc\u2880\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28cf\u284f\u2804\u2839\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u285f\u28fc\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u283b\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u28bb\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u28b0\u2803\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2819\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2844\u2804\n\u2804\u28b8\u28a0\u28ff\u28ff\u28e7\u2859\u28ff\u28ff\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u281b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2838\u28ff\u287f\u28f8\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2808\u2846\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u2859\u2833\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u28c0\u28c8\u2819\u2803\u2804\u283f\u2887\u28ff\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2847\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28c6\u2840\u28fc\u28ff\u2847\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u28b9\u2858\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28bf\u28f7\u2840\u2804\u2880\u28f4\u28fe\u28df\u2809\u2809\u2809\u2809\u28fd\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2807\u28b9\u28ff\u2803\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b7\u2858\u28bf\u28ff\u28ce\u28bb\u28f7\u2830\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u28c0\u28c0\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u28ab\u287e\u28b8\u285f\u2804.\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u283b\u28e6\u2859\u283f\u28e7\u2819\u28b7\u2819\u283b\u283f\u28bf\u287f\u283f\u283f\u281b\u280b\u2809\u2804\u2802\u2818\u2801\u281e\u2804\u2804\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2819\u2811\u28e0\u28e4\u28f4\u2856\u2804\u283f\u28cb\u28c9\u28c9\u2841\u2804\u28be\u28e6\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804", "timestamp_created": 1688420427, "timestamp_updated": 1688420427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141244072": {"recommendationid": "141244072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070929939", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1688565374}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the original version of the game back when it first released in 2017 with a mere 1060 and while the PC port is horrendous and requires a bunch of mods to barely run the game at playable framerate, NieR:Automata is a rare but expected masterpiece from Platinum Games, boasting a soundtrack that once heard it's simply impossible to forget like the Halo or Destiny ones, an original story full of twists with 26 ENDINGS and smooth hack n slash with some different types of gameplay during certain sections, like side scrolling.

Play on normal, play with a controller, if you don't you'll have a bad time. That being said, once the 45 minute prologue section is over, it's a very fun ARPG, which already has a very interesting story about an hour in (it took me like 2 hours to beat the prologue because I hadn't connected a controller for my first couple of attempts). The KB&M controls are BAD, playing with a controller allows much better flow while fighting and much more precise movement.\n\nOK, first impressions guys, first impressions.\nI hate the prologue already, hate it with a passion. The first thing you have to do is complete a long 30 minute stage, which gets pretty difficult near the end, with no saves, not one. on top of that, a lot of it is just cinematics and easy fights with low level enemies. The ONLY part that's truly difficult is what I HOPE is the last part of the prologue (Edit: It wasn't), a big ol boss fight against two giant sawblade arm things. I've already died twice to that boss, and I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have to WASTE THIRTY MORE MINUTES GETTING BACK TO WHERE I WAS! Even Dark Souls hasn't annoyed me this much because they usually have a few campfires rather close to the boss, but nah. If I decide to play again and get past the prologue I'll edit the review to reflect my thoughts on the rest of the game, but I really am not happy with my purchase right now.", "timestamp_created": 1688345805, "timestamp_updated": 1688438117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141178304": {"recommendationid": "141178304", "author": {"steamid": "76561199106851089", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 805, "last_played": 1691893783}, "language": "spanish", "review": "vaya culo", "timestamp_created": 1688344831, "timestamp_updated": 1688344831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141177454": {"recommendationid": "141177454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262973051", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1693594982}, "language": "english", "review": "I recieved 2B's foil card after only 5 hours of playing.\n\n\nThe game is fantastic.
