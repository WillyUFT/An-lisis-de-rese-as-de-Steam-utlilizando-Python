Mais il le fait avec coh\u00e9rence, une direction artistique tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussie, un univers irr\u00e9sistible et en soignant le moindre d\u00e9tail. Bref le r\u00e9sultat est quasi irr\u00e9prochable.\n\nOn se retrouve donc avec deux phases de jeu :\n\n- d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 un Zelda-like (dans l'esprit du Zelda de l'\u00e8re 8/16 bits s'entend, la roulade en plus et une maniabilit\u00e9 \u00e9videmment plus agr\u00e9able), m\u00e2tin\u00e9 de rogue-lite mais de mani\u00e8re quasi anecdotique. On affronte ennemis et boss et on collecte des ressources.\n\n- de l'autre un petit jeu de gestion de sims - enfin de cultistes dans le cas pr\u00e9sent : il s'agit de pourvoir \u00e0 leurs besoins (mat\u00e9riels et spirituels) pour qu'ils g\u00e9n\u00e8rent en retour la foi qui va nous permettre de d\u00e9velopper nos capacit\u00e9s de combat. D\u00e9velopper son culte est un vrai bonheur : qu'il s'agisse des b\u00e2timents \u00e0 construire, de leur pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 manger ou de se perdre dans les nombreuses options cosm\u00e9tiques et la personnalisation de ses fid\u00e8les.\n\nEvidemment les deux phases de jeu se r\u00e9pondent, y compris sur un mode n\u00e9gatif car le temps est une ressource \u00e0 partager entre ces deux aspects et multiplier les revers dans l'un aura des r\u00e9percussions dans l'autre, principalement en raison du temps perdu en cas de morts r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es (les cultistes vieillissent et meurent et d'ici l\u00e0 il faut bien les nourrir).\n\nGraphiquement le jeu est tr\u00e8s mignon et il exploite \u00e0 merveille cet aspect (de nature \u00e0 d\u00e9dramatiser) en poussant le contraste avec son univers, certes parodique, mais parfois assez malsain dans les options propos\u00e9es.\n\nEn incarne ici stricto sensu l'agneau sacrificiel (le dernier de son esp\u00e8ce !) et on se retrouve sauv\u00e9 et enr\u00f4l\u00e9 par une d\u00e9it\u00e9 captive pour fonder un culte et lui venir en aide en contrepartie.\n\nEt s'il est un point que je n'ai volontairement pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 plus haut c'est l'importance de nos cultistes en tant que ressource : d'une part parce qu'on peut les sacrifier directement pour en retirer divers b\u00e9n\u00e9fices mais surtout parce qu'on va dessiner les contours moraux de notre culte tout au long du jeu via des d\u00e9crets mutuellement exclusifs (un peu comme les doctrines d' un Civilization), avec des cons\u00e9quences sur le style de jeu et sur sa tonalit\u00e9.\n\nAu final Cult of the Lamb est dangereusement addictif : des boucles de gameplay courtes (10-15 minutes) et des options de personnalisation qui cr\u00e9ent un fort attachement \u00e0 son culte et \u00e0 ses membres.

That's not to say this game is terrible, but there are big flaws.\n\nBattles feel repetitive, and it doesn't feel as satisfying as some other rogue-likes, primarily Hades, to complete a full run. Runs feel either too hard or too easy, and there just isn't any in-between. Controls in this game feel too simple as well. There's an attack button, dodge, and that's it. Fights in this game consist of repeatedly mashing the attack button and dodging the occasional projectile or lunge forward. Enemies, with the exception of some bosses, feel too easy to beat. Collecting food during runs can also be tedious even on normal difficulty where you have to constantly be collecting it as your main priority for keeping your cult alive. The perks that you earn in the runs feel too simple and easy to get.\n\nThe other half of the gameplay, which is actually taking care of your cult is alright, albeit serviceable, but it doesn't feel deep as I want it to be. That might just be because I haven't played much of the game. But I don't enjoy a lot of this game which makes me sad because I really wanted to like this game.\n\nCult of the Lamb just doesn't know the kind of game it wants to be. It wants to be many things, yet succeeds at neither. If you're looking for a rich rogue-like inspired by Hades that has inticing gameplay, Cult of the Lamb isn't it, and the other side of the gameplay doesn't exactly deliver either.

the devotion tree fill that role, but also having the fleece and doctrine skills. I enjoyed the combination of roguelike with building a base that has a little more room for individual variation, unlike something like Darkest Dungeon. The art style is cute, and there's something hilarious about the little lamb going into red-eyed murder mode\n\nDespite the fact that I liked it enough to play for several hours, I really can't recommend it for the shallowness of the game compared to the price of the game. When I think of games like Graveyard Keeper, which I picked up for 20 bucks, this game fizzles out fast. Each of the other areas you can travel to feel very empty, with very few things one can actually do in those areas. Sure, I can pick up new skins for my cult followers, but if you don't care that much about that (and I don't) then there's little else to do. Fishing can yield several varieties of fish, none of which matter because the cooking recipes treat most of them as the same fish. Much of the game feels like this: substantive at first glance, but very superficial when you go to see what you can \"do\" with it.\n\nThe game is also buggy, or just has design moments that are frustrating. My followers returning from quests bugs out their dialogue with some regularity.

Initially, I had no interest in playing this game, but my project teammates picked this game to deconstruct for an assignment. I already knew the strong visual presentation of this game, but the gameplay totally surprised me by being much better than I expected. The first few hours of the game were incredible, as I went through a mostly blind playthrough of the game. As much as I love the \"two games in one\" approach this game took, the magic kind of fell apart after that initial few hours.\n\nCult of the Lamb's job is already hard from the get-go, being both a dungeon crawler and base builder. If you have ever designed a game, you might have a clue how hard it is to develop and balance a few systems alone, yet this game has two separate big gameplay parts, with a good amount of systems in itself. My enjoyment of the first few hours of the game comes from this aspect of the game, both systems are equally important and they are so interconnected that you never feel like you are playing two games at once. Of course, maintaining this is hard and the connected nature of the game dissipates after those initial hours, making the difference of gameplay portions much sharper than it should be. Still, both gameplay portions never became boring altogether as they are well-designed on their own. Dungeon-crawler part always introduces new enemies, and as you master the game\u2019s controls your enjoyment of this portion of the game nearly matches that first few hours. I sadly cannot say the same for the base-building part, as it is very easy to master, and it gets more and more boring as you progress through the game. The balance of the time you spend on each portion also changes, as the game wants you to spend more time on the dungeon crawling part. Still, even with all the problems, I really enjoyed what the gameplay offered. Never in my playthrough, I got the urge to abandon the game, and for a guy like me who often struggles to finish playthroughs and this game being a 14+ hour game, that is an achievement altogether.\n\nThe presentation may be the strongest part of this game, especially for an indie game. If you have seen any promotional material, you already have a grasp of the strong art style of the game. But I never expected the sounds and the soundtrack to be this good. I was genuinely shocked when the music started to play. The soundtrack mostly consists of bangers, and the variation is immense. Sound design is also very strong, as you can get a lot of information on gameplay from just listening to sounds. Visuals are also designed to be in the same manner, but the focus on presentation sometimes clashes with that philosophy. For example, sometimes the game puts you in small rooms with a ton of enemies that shoot projectiles, cluttering your screen and making it very hard to dodge enemy attacks, thus hindering the flow of the gameplay. All-in-all, I was left impressed with the presentation of the game, even though the game could have done a better job with visibility.\n\nThat\u2019s everything I wanted to talk about, I guess. There is also a narrative portion of the game, but I never became curious enough about it to analyse it and form an opinion. I feel like a sequel could fix all the problems I have with this game and expand it in a multitude of ways as there is a lot of potential to do so. I\u2019m glad my teammates have picked this game; I do not think I would have ever played it otherwise. I am giving it a solid 8.5/10, as I start my wait for a potential sequel that I think is a given at this point.", "timestamp_created": 1699814365, "timestamp_updated": 1699814365, "voted_up": true,

Despite a lot of peoples opinion that the management aspect is tedious, I find it quite simple and relaxing. \n\nCombat wise the game lacks some level of depth tho. Most of the cards are just clutter and some things are just not worth upgrading at all. While the types of melee weapons play a little bit differently, all feel very similar in a way, because they basically just differ in their attack speed. They have different move sets, but when you try to avoid getting hit, its more like hit and run for every type of weapon and it doesnt really matter which one you get. Secondary Upgrades like Poison, Vampiric, Necrotic attacks doesnt really add up in a way that it alters the gameplay greatly. \n\nArt wise the game is gorgeous but it has some problems with \"design follows function\". The point of view in the game with a very small character makes the game hard to play on small screens like the Steam Deck. While the art design in combination with the diagonal point of view is very nice to look at, it would most certainly play better in a more traditional point of view. Getting hit by stuff you just didnt see properly happens a lot of time.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1699555123, "timestamp_updated": 1699555196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149826907": {"recommendationid": "149826907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064302852", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 478, "playtime_at_review": 1152, "last_played": 1700673949}, "language": "english", "review": "Never knew running a cult was this fun", "timestamp_created": 1699554989, "timestamp_updated": 1699554989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149826609": {"recommendationid": "149826609", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091215555", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 981, "playtime_at_review": 917, "last_played": 1700134758}, "language": "english", "review": "It's such a super cute and fun game, I highly recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1699554555, "timestamp_updated": 1699554555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149822766": {"recommendationid": "149822766", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024241661", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 823, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1699639311}, "language": "english", "review": "use the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet \nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse a deity's tear to get a new look\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet\nuse the tear of the deity to knock out the amulet", "timestamp_created": 1699549661, "timestamp_updated": 1699639650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149820632": {"recommendationid": "149820632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062465562", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1943, "last_played": 1682841063}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute silly animal game <3", "timestamp_created": 1699547110, "timestamp_updated": 1699547110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149819614": {"recommendationid": "149819614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847053801", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 239, "playtime_forever": 882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1699543518}, "language": "english", "review": "So spiritual and yet so devilish.

It is a pretty short game as it only took me less than a week of constant playing to finish after buying it during the Halloween sale 2023. That being said, I enjoyed every minute of this game. I can play for 8 hours straight without even realising and only having to put the game down to do real world responsibilities. It can get a little grindy at times but I wouldn't say it made it worse for me. \n--------------------------------\n[h3]TLDR Review - Detailed review below[/h3]\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Very cute art style and art in general\n- Fluid gameplay and combat\n- I'm so attached to my cult I don't ever want to sacrifice them :( \n- Story is simple, main focus is base building and rouge-like dungeon combat\n- Soundtrack is so catchy\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Game too short, some grindy parts can be cheesed through quick\n- Unbalanced difficulty; it can be too easy at times and too difficult at others\n- Game makes you feel like your choices do matter in the long run, and I suppose to a certain extend that is true, but for the most part I don't even think it would matter too much unless you're going to mega minmax the shit out of the game\n\n--------------------------------\n[b]NO SPOILERS HERE![/b] Some things to note about my playthrough, take into account I played at the recommended difficulty:\n\n[b]EARLY GAME[/b]\n- Early game base building was never too difficult as I've never struggled to keep my cult alive and well throughout my run. Difficulty usually stemmed from combat\n- The \"Faith\" bar was NEVER an issue for me throughout my playthrough so it's purpose was somewhat useless since I could always counter low faith with sermons and inspire \n- Early game combat was quite rough, having to die a lot before getting a good footing in the combat. I enjoyed the combat, it's very fluid and the game feels awesome. However, I've seen comments about how the combat isn't to everyone's liking and I can completely see that. Much like any rouge-like, I'd say the random weapon you get at the start of every crusade will make and break your run, so use RNG to your favour when you get lucky. \n\n[b]MID GAME[/b]\n- Early to Mid game grinding for resources is quite rough. I'm constantly running out of stone and wood. I tried all I could to grind, making those resource generation buildings and going on crusades but it never is enough. At some point to the Mid-Late game resources are in abundance so you won't have to care about it anymore.\n- Combat starts getting a lot easier after leveling up and I ended up breezing through crusades, rarely dying.\n- Prayers are generating at a steady rate and this is where I can see the game steam rolling through difficulty soon\n\n[b]LATE GAME[/b]\n- By late game, I've stacked up so many followers and I don't even feel an issue keeping all of them alive. The farming in this game basically sets you up for your followers to never die (exception old age)\n- I've maxed out my cult upgrades and combat upgrades by early late game and at some point the praying mechanic becomes quite useless. I feel like I've progressed the cult upgrades too quickly just by having so many followers, and having no penalty in doing so.\n- Towards the end of the story (around the last crusade world and final boss), combat starts getting a lot harder as I've maxed out all my upgrades and now it is up to RNG and skill to finish the story. This part here is where I struggled the most (maybe because I suck) but with patience and practice I beat the final boss in about 4-5 tries.\n--------------------------------\n[b]Last thoughts:[/b] \nI love this game so much and I am so sad that it is so short. I originally bought it for the art style but I stayed for the gameplay. I highly recommend Cult of the Lamb to anyone who likes Rouge-Likes or micro managing base creation. While the whole base building aspect is too easy at times, I still enjoyed it. It doesn't complicate information and you never really find yourself lost or unsure what to do. I will probably come back and finish up some achievements or start a new run in the future :)", "timestamp_created": 1699506251, "timestamp_updated": 1699506251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149794203": {"recommendationid": "149794203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197369101", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "playtime_at_review": 1118, "last_played": 1700611613}, "language": "english", "review": "hammer is bad.", "timestamp_created": 1699503948, "timestamp_updated": 1699503948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149793969": {"recommendationid": "149793969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212211976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1699499697}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game\n\nWorth buy", "timestamp_created": 1699503530, "timestamp_updated": 1699503530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149789664": {"recommendationid": "149789664", "author": {"steamid": "76561199067162259", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 247, "playtime_at_review": 1495, "last_played": 1700276311}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny sheep", "timestamp_created": 1699495737, "timestamp_updated": 1699495737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149789584": {"recommendationid": "149789584", "author": {"steamid": "76561199113620081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 359, "last_played": 1699529585}, "language": "english", "review": "maaaaaaaaaaan this game is fun", "timestamp_created": 1699495582, "timestamp_updated": 1699495582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149786554": {"recommendationid": "149786554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797894345", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "playtime_at_review": 1444, "last_played": 1699544070}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, has an awesome art style and interesting story with plenty to do. an overall good game.", "timestamp_created": 1699490364, "timestamp_updated": 1699490364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149786034": {"recommendationid": "149786034", "author": {"steamid": "76561199351144024", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3231, "last_played": 1699491980}, "language": "english", "review": "ALL PRAISE THE LAMB", "timestamp_created": 1699489536, "timestamp_updated": 1699489536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149784429": {"recommendationid": "149784429", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091744799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1700602406}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun game!

This game is like social media, trying to bind you to it with longer, unneccessary content, watching an ad every time before you can continue playing.\n- follower leveld up:gain their reputation-soul thingys!

For people like me who enjoy quick pick me up, do some runs, kill some mobs, strengthen your char kind of games this is not a right figt.

There are issues with the weapons and power balances.

Upon your death you are sent to the underworld where the \"One who is waiting\" (devil) grants you life if you agree to start a cult for him so that he can break the \"Bishops\" chains and be free again.\n\nAt first I didn't know what to think. The videos and images don't really give you a good feel for the experience. I saw \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" reviews, but that has happened with other games I had seen and didn't like.\nSo here it is in a nutshell:\nThis is like a single player RPG base-builder. \nFirst, I will compare this to other games I have played:\nDon't starve - It looks and feels like Don't Starve. I am only so far in the game but the main differences here are that you get followers to forage for you and it doesn't seem to be open world which brings me to my second comparison.\nGuild of Dungeoneering - It is similar to this game in that you go through a dungeon of rooms with different pathways that contain different experiences: Battles, Merchants Farms etc. You walk through these to collect items and resources and get closer to defeating the \"Bishops\" (bosses).\n\nThe experience is that of you fighting your way through dungeons collecting resources building up your village finding followers and having them perform tasks like praying so that you can advance in the tech tree and unlock other buildings and powers. The game auto-saves and seems re-playable. I would recommend trying this game out as you will know within the first 60 minutes if you like it or not. \n\nOn PC its the tab key to open inventory.", "timestamp_created": 1699293974, "timestamp_updated": 1699300792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149661970": {"recommendationid": "149661970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067927332", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1202, "last_played": 1695229957}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\udc11", "timestamp_created": 1699292699, "timestamp_updated": 1699292699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149661670": {"recommendationid": "149661670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237883542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1699248749}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought the combat was pretty weak.

It's a nice rogue-lite/ community maintenance game. It's a nice challenge trying to push through the story while taking care of your followers. Gameplay is fun, nothing too insane, but still a fair difficulty.\n\nRelics of the Old Faith, on the other hand, feels like a whole different dynamic. By this point, your cult is fully upgraded, and you likely have most of the fleeces and relics unlocked. This second story line feels like it's more about exploring purgatory and just making sure your cult doesn't wither now, as opposed to nurturing them constantly, as you go back through the 4 worlds to basically do what you did in the base game.\n\nGameplay and story dynamic aside, this game was a lot of fun with the art style, gameplay dynamics with the different equipment and abilities you have

I'm not finished with the game yet but I do want to write a review as the game deserves one.\n\nI was surprised by how well the mix of the roguelike aspect and managing your followers works for me, it's great to have some variety between gameplay. If I'm in the mood to fight I can, if I want to mess around in my base and make sure that everything keeps going well I can too. It's a pretty neat mix! There's also some exploring you can do in different areas, although definitely more limited. I do have to say the roguelike aspect can be a little bland at times but I wasn't expecting a hardcore roguelike from this game, I think it's great for what it is. It's certainly not bad by any means though! I just wish there was a little more to it.\n\nI do want to shine some light on the art style, it's amazing! For a game with such a dark theme it could have easily been a completely different look but this is fantastically done! In specific the 2D art in a 3D world is my favorite part of it :)\n\nI would recommend the game, it exceeded my expectations by a lot.

In the beginning, you have a limited number of attacks (3) to pass each dungeon phase. After those 3 attacks, you'll be empty and have to let the enemy kill you. If you clear a phase, your attacks do not reset, like in an old fashioned dungeon. If you kill enemies you can \"recharge\" your attacks as they drop \"fervor\", but clearing an entire phase and collecting this \"fervor\" only adds 1 additional attack. \n\n2.) The map and the freedom to move around it is locked until middle/late game. So, for most of the start you're attempting to pass dungeons which is tedious as you keep running out of attacks, waiting to die, respawning. There is no easy way to gain more attacks in order to pass more dungeon levels, like through side quests, so the pace of progression is limited.\n\n3.) Finishing the entire game looks to take 300/350 hours, which is a large time investment for a game of this nature IMO.\n\nIt's a different kind of dungeon and fun to play especially due to the unique art and soundtrack, but it is repetitive and slow to progress. Personally, I cannot imagine repeating the same formula for 300ish hours just to reach \"end game\". The farming and cult management aspects do nothing to distract me from the monotony of the dungeons. This game might be a cult favorite but I'm a dissenter.

the game isn't good because it is pretty fun starting off, it has a really nice art style and soundtrack. and the combat feels mostly solid but the game starts to feel more and more like a chore as time goes on\n\nYou have to constantly babysit your cultists otherwise they will either die from sickness because they refuse to clean up after themselves when I have 2 cleaning stations or be useless because you have to interact with them individually to do anything with them, the colony management is overall too simple to its own detriment\n\nAnd then there's the usual problems that come from roguelites with their randomness, which is also my main problem with the combat, The items you get while doing crusades feels completely rigged against you once you start unlocking new stuff, The Dagger and Sword are by far the best weapons in the game but good luck ever getting them because you will get nothing but the Claws, that require you to do a 3 hit combat to get decent damage with them since the first 2 hits are purposefully weak, which are out-classed by every other weapon, even the Axe and Hammer, which are at least consistent with their damage output even if they are stupidly slow to attack\n\nAnd I've unlocked a lot of different cards (They give you buffs during crusades) but I haven't seen even half of them because I rarely get anything other than the starting cards\n\nAlso, Your attack direction is influenced by both your mouse direction and WASD, which led to so many times where I would attack and even roll in the wrong direction because I pressed a movement key a little too early or moved my mouse at the wrong time\n\nI was really hoping I would like this game more because it didn't seem like the \"Hope for the least bad outcome\" type of game

but on the inside, the cult is dark and corrupt, and the same leader, you though is a friend or a father figure, can sacrifice you no matter how loyal you are. \nThe whole game art style is cute-looking, but with a dark undertone, it\u00b4s beautiful. \nMusic also helps create this atmosphere of calmness and harmony, but when the action starts, it can drop some great beats.\nCombat is swift and precise. Thanks to the DLC, the combat is even more harder and has many things to complete and gather, like bishops as your followers.\nThe only complaint I have is the end game with your followers and buildings.

(sign the contract/Recruit a cultist)\n\nNotes: \n- The game features negative achievements (like dying, sacrificing followers) achievements depend on these.\n- The last 10~ hours were spent grinding the final item from cards/follower skins/relics etc..\n- QOL Mods don't block achievements (like lock weapons or auto gather from chests...)\n   (somewhat spoilery)\n- the npc that sells \"the Intangible\" card is only found ONLY in Anchordeep [ The guides lie, he doesn't spawn everywhere ] - My advice is to keep 200~gold on hand and always buy all the card unlocks that are offered in random dungeon events.\n- Make sure to chose the \"resurrection\" dogma.  With the free update you can select the dogmas you missed but that's very late into the game.\n\nOverall the game was fun, It kept things varied between combat and base building just enough to prevent either from becoming stale.

forgiving, fun, charming, you never really spend to much time doing things.\nAlmost all the Achievements are gotten via playing the game, or discovering little secrets.\nThe game has such an off beat humor you can't help but to chuckle.\nSome of the random events you come across you can't help but to be surprised, shocked, and infatuated with the possibility of \"what if\"? \nThe action is forgiving, and fun.\nYes there are some \"OP\" combos, but you can use to help you with your achievements, then go back to playing however you like. The selection of followers is awesome, even if they are simply a sprite change.  But you can't help but to get connected to some of them. The actual interaction that happened between some of them was surprising. This game tries to challenge you with different emotions and thoughts. I think it does this in a light way, that it doesn't become over power. \nA must buy for those who like Action Rogue games.", "timestamp_created": 1698972963, "timestamp_updated": 1698972963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594202876091003418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149410887": {"recommendationid": "149410887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859989433", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 720, "last_played": 1699220167}, "language": "english", "review": "i get to murder my friends as a cute little lamb", "timestamp_created": 1698972864, "timestamp_updated": 1698972864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149409824": {"recommendationid": "149409824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879039335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 947, "last_played": 1699243234}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny cult game.", "timestamp_created": 1698971364, "timestamp_updated": 1698971364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149409495": {"recommendationid": "149409495", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039767401", "num_games_owned": 1544, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 536, "last_played": 1699030055}, "language": "english", "review": "boy i love the ost", "timestamp_created": 1698970886, "timestamp_updated": 1698970886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149409282": {"recommendationid": "149409282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083454249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 457, "playtime_at_review": 374, "last_played": 1700088338}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game already 6 hours in.

the Lamb[/b] es un t\u00edtulo que promet\u00eda una experiencia \u00fanica en el g\u00e9nero roguelike con una narrativa encantadora y una jugabilidad adictiva. Aunque el mismo cumple con muchas de estas promesas, lamentablemente, tambi\u00e9n tiene un aspecto flojo, sus dungeons.\n\nDesde el vamos, el juego se destaca por su pixel art de gran calidad y su mundo oscuro. La historia sigue a un cordero que, tras sobrevivir a un ritual, se convierte en el l\u00edder de su propia secta. Los personajes y las criaturas que vamos encontrando son \u00fanicos y llenos de car\u00e1cter, lo que hace a la narrativa atractiva y emocionante.\n\nLa jugabilidad es una mezcla de elementos roguelike y construcci\u00f3n de bases, convirti\u00e9ndose en un t\u00edtulo fresco. Tu tarea es la de construir y gestionar tu propia base, al tiempo que exploras dungeons y enfrentas peligros. La progresi\u00f3n es gratificante, ya que puedes mejorar y personalizar tu santuario y a tus seguidores. La combinaci\u00f3n de elementos de roguelike, como la generaci\u00f3n aleatoria de niveles y el combate desafiante, crea una experiencia adictiva que mantendr\u00e1 a los jugadores comprometidos durante horas.\n\nSin embargo, donde [b]Cult of the Lamb[/b] tropieza son como anteriormente dije, sus dungeons. A pesar de su encanto, estas \u00e1reas carecen de la misma variedad y profundidad que el resto del juego. La generaci\u00f3n de niveles puede sentirse repetitiva despu\u00e9s de un tiempo, lo que limita la sensaci\u00f3n de descubrimiento que se encuentra en otras partes del juego. Adem\u00e1s debo sumar que algunos encuentros y enemigos pueden resultar injustamente desafiantes, lo que puede llevar a frustraciones innecesarias.\n\nEn resumen, es un juego que brilla en muchos aspectos. Su narrativa \u00fanica, arte encantador y jugabilidad adictiva hacen que sea una experiencia que vale la pena jugar. Sin embargo, las dungeons, que son una parte fundamental de la mec\u00e1nica del juego, no alcanzan el mismo nivel de calidad que el resto del t\u00edtulo. A pesar de este \"defecto\", sigue siendo un juego que los amantes de los roguelikes y la construcci\u00f3n de bases deber\u00edan experimentar, pero con la esperanza de que en futuras actualizaciones puedan abordar sus \"deficiencias\" en este aspecto.", "timestamp_created": 1698773705, "timestamp_updated": 1698774193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

an AWFUL job at showing it. Don't let the art style fool you; trust me, it is still worth playing even if you hate it. I used to stay away from it because of the cutesy style, but then a friend convinced me to get it. When you see the environments and main bosses, they are actually REALLY beautiful. And the gameplay is REALLY fun. I highly recommend at least trying it.\n\nNow for the long part: \n\nThe gameplay is simple but effective. It is really fun. And the soundtrack is gorgeous. I'm not sure why this game doesn't have the roguelike or dungeon crawler tags because base building only takes up part of the game (especially if you don't care about base building like me lmao). It's mostly roguelike / dungeon crawling (called Crusades), which, in my opinion, is the best part about it.\n\nIf you're looking for lore / story, there's not much in here. It's solely focused on gameplay, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Again, the gameplay is super fun. It's just that there isn't much dialogue or lore to be read, which is fine. The small bit of lore it DOES have is pretty awesome. I just wish it had more for me to read about this universe.\n\nHOWEVER, sad to say, what could've made this game much better is more variety; something it REALLY lacks in. And the game is REALLY easy. I had a feeling that it was going to be easy, so I played it in Hard mode, and still I beat the base game in only 3 days. For $25, I think that is a bit expensive for what little is in it, and I'm glad I got it on sale.\n\nI hear they are still updating this game, so hopefully, they'll add more major bosses and stages. But otherwise, there's no reason for me to keep playing after I beat the base game and maxed out almost everything.\n\nIf you think you're a veteran / expert gamer in roguelikes, consider playing on the highest difficulty instead of just hard. Otherwise, you may just breeze through the game too quickly like I did.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a good game with a couple issues. Because of said issues, the game is an 8/10 in my eyes, maybe a strong 7/10. Good, but nowhere near perfect. But who knows, the problems may be fixed in future updates.", "timestamp_created": 1698595937, "timestamp_updated": 1698595937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149137295": {"recommendationid": "149137295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328665038", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 395, "last_played": 1698932631}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game highly recommend to everyone reading dis- wallahi very worth money", "timestamp_created": 1698595544, "timestamp_updated": 1698595544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149136764": {"recommendationid": "149136764", "author": {"steamid": "76561199001745475", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1699053318}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Genial el juego, muy bueno, me voy a a comprar todos los dlc de este juego", "timestamp_created": 1698595049, "timestamp_updated": 1698595049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149135530": {"recommendationid": "149135530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047134587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1059, "last_played": 1698597339}, "language": "english", "review": "A cutest satanic cult simulator ever.

After that everything felt stale. Managing the cult isn't really interesting and is more of a chore than anything. \n\nThe combat feels pretty bland, all of the weapons feel just about the same with slightly different swing speeds. \n\nThe curses you get are either a knock-back + damage, a straight line, or a cone. The only worthwhile added effects behind ghosts or ice. \n\nThe relics are boring. The only ones I can seemingly remember are the dice that give a 50/50 at health/invincibility. \n\nThe non-major bosses are essentially all the same. Bullet-hell-lite spam with adds spawned in. Not super difficult, just tedious. \n\n[spoiler]The purgatory mode is an absolute joke. My god that last achievement was just so tedious.

Every time you think you've seen everything you are blown away by a new fun and intriguing mechanic.\n\nAfter completing the game i stand true to what i said before, the style is amazing to look at and not once got boring to look at, having to maintain the camp also made sure you had something else to do if you wanted to have a break and instead focus on something more relaxed, the combat is great and feels polished while each boss was interesting, fun and all around amazing to fight against and lastly the story was great as it allowed the player to complete the game in their own pace while still allowing for an interesting story to give the environment you're in a purpose.

De canciones que hacen que el combate sea m\u00e1s intenso y din\u00e1mico. Yo dir\u00eda que le llega casi a la par de la banda sonora de Hades. \n\nLo recomendaria? Pues, no te voy a mentir.

This one doesn't even have different weapons. They're all the same, just with different damage and attack speeds. It really ruins the game's replayability, with the only different weapon being the hammer. It's cadence is different enough to justify being a different weapon.\n\nThe curses, essentially spells, aren't viable without a specific set-up. They don't have much variance either, being linear skillshots or hit-all-enemies automatically. It's not exciting. You can't control which ones you get either, making the more engaging spells even less accessible. It's a real shame since they have a lot of potential, yet aren't really utilized throughout the experience.\n\nAnother problem are the relics. You can't choose which ones you get, they aren't reliably attained, and they're not interesting. Once again, we're talking about a system that doesn't reward your investment, time, etc. It just wastes it. That's the problem with this game in general. 70% of this game is a flashy Idle clicker without any real interaction. Personally, that style of game doesn't mesh well with a rogue-lite at all.\n\nA roguelite usually revolves around high interaction gameplay, is usually difficult, and it has high levels of variance from the itemization/random generation. In this situation, the items are incredibly boring, with the most impactful one I recieved in my entire run just increasing my attack speed by 50%. All of the rooms are small, and have little environmental variance, geometry, etc.\n\nReally, this game is designed to not be a game while making you feel like you're playing one.

This was a bit sad for me because the developers did everything they could to deliver the aesthetics, writing, and worldbuilding, for all of which I had zero complaint and full scale satisfaction. Only if the gameplay was fleshed out, the game would have a phenomenal climax, but in its current state, I can't help but say the game feels rather anti-climactic. and labor-intensive.\n\nThat being said, I still do recommend this game for general audience, because it perfectly captures the gut-wrenching creepiness of cults in its art.

I like the dungeon delving a lot. It's got a snappy, sword-and-spell combat system with just enough delay so you know it's inspired by \"Dark Souls\" at least a little bit. You fight your way up to harder and harder bosses, and the combat keeps evolving. In between runs, you come back to your little cult and manage your flock. And it's silly and light and fun--you have to manage their beds, their food, their messes. Early on, when your cultists number small enough that you can count them on your hands, they feel like your chosen few.\n\nBut after maybe a dozen in-game days, the wheels just kinda fall off. :/ The dungeons start to feel repetitive, and the whole time you're being sent messages about how your cult is falling apart without you. As the cult gets bigger and bigger, your followers feel less like individual creatures and more like another resource you have to juggle. I've spent entire in-game days putting up beds, inspiring followers, rebuilding resource generators, giving sermons--bored out of my skull because I just want to go on another dungeon run. And that's not even getting into the tacked-on fishing minigame, the not-that-deep Knucklebones dice game, and the other two regions which are even less interesting...\n\nIt feels like the two halves of the game should play nice together, but they kinda... don't.

My problem is that the combat felt like something I've played many times before, a little bit of Bastion, a little bit of Hades, a little bit of 2D Dark Souls... all blended with Binding of Isaac but cuter visuals. You're rolling through attacks, punishing during openings, using the occasional special ability. This style of combat is really getting tapped out creatively. It's in the same place as WW2 shooters in the mid 2000s.\n\nAs for the base building and follower management, it felt so much like a free-to-play phone game that I was instinctively turned off. There are very few real decisions in the first hour, and when you can do something, you are railroaded through that single available choice. And the devs also made the weird decision to try and \"spice up\" otherwise boring tasks by including silly little reflex tests. Example: cooking berries from a recipe is boring, so they make you click \"cook\" while a slider is moving back and forth.

computer that can handle it, it's a fantastic game. This is one of my favorite games ever, but I honestly don't know why a game like this takes so much processing power. On windows, all upgrade menus are so laggy that they're nearly impossible to use. Still, I was an avid player since everything else ran decently well, until I was forced off of windows to linux. Linux performance is absurdly bad. For some inexplicable reason, there's no linux version, so you're forced to run it with Proton. Whoever says this game runs fine in Proton is lying to you. 99% of Proton versions crash on startup, and frame rates are below 1fps at all times. There are no settings to increase performance to any noticeable degree, and if there are mods to make it run faster, I don't know about them.

My favorite ? a bit of both and each path is rewarding and prolongs the games life in the short burst of interest my short attention span provides. It looks great, feels great and is fun can be as challenging or simple and story driven as needed. My favorite feature is the style in which it plays out, the camp is a safe place from the world it builds but the dungeons or minigames funcation as a break from the responsibilities of a cult leader. There is always something to do and its also possible to do nothing. I recommend this game for all kinds of genre lovers just start it with an open mind and it will grow on you and condition subliminals into your brain until you've eventually folded under its rule. 10/10 would play again but I cant handle the stress of my favorite villagers aging like 3 decades in 3 in game days.

So if we could get a new map that would be great (bonus a Christian can play your game).\nDespite everything, it's still an incredible game that totally deserves a crazy series with incredible music, surprising designs and an awesome community.

Not only are they effected by things like starvation and just general unpleasantness, but they're affected by the rituals you choose and if you say no to a follower request.\n- The fleeces (the cloak/cape things) not only look amazing but give you PERKS. \n- I've been loving the boss fights. I play on medium and they're CHALLENGING, but the fact you just return to your camp (HQ) and you can upgrade your crown or work on upgrading is perfect. \nI'm not too bad at combat, but I've beaten two of the four bosses so far. I'm halfway to the third one and I'm obsessed with this game. \n\nSomething that needs mentioning:\nThe doctrines. One of my absolute all time favourite things in this game is the AMOUNT of doctrines there are. There are so many different ways you could take your cult. It's just amazing, you could be ruthless and cold-hearted or be more lenient and heart-warming. It's completely your choice which makes this game SO replay-able. There's so many options to make each playthrough different than the last.", "timestamp_created": 1696549500, "timestamp_updated": 1696549500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The main challenge of the game is balancing growing your cult and beating the bosses, since if you go on an adventure for too long your citizens get angry and hungry. While at times this can be annoying, most of the time it's just a quick fix that is kinda like doing a daily chore. It's interesting watching the cult go from a inept to self sufficient\n\nThe controls are smooth and everything from the dashing to the combos attacks, the weapon system is simple yet effective in it's execution, making the player choose whether they want a fast weapon with low damage or a slow weapon with high damage was a good decision. It might have been better to give players the choice of a weapon before spawning in and not having it be RNG but it isn't a big issue.\n\nThe side missions are a bit of a let down in terms of fun factor. The first three you encounter in the game is \n\nThe juxtaposition between the cutesy art style and the blood and monsters in the game make for a nicely unique experience. It's hard to say that a games art style is unique in this day and age (Exceptions being Cuphead and Faith: The Unholy Trilogy) but this games art style might just qualify as a unique style as it's imagery is both disturbingly detailed and simplistic at the same time.\n\nThis is easily one of the best indie games to come out of 2020s and it is worth the price.

It\u2019s the mandatory thing in this game and it comes with an extremely terrible design. Even at the highest base level there are a ton of things that players still need to do manually. You can assign a follower to do the cooking but you still need to order each dish manually every day. You can let them do the farm thing but you still have input seed, collect fertilizer and put those fertilizer in a box manually.\n\nThere is a ton of work in the base but there is no work management system. You can\u2019t check which work is not assigned. And the worker in this game is a follower which can get older and stop working. But don\u2019t worry there is no management system that tells you about this, you just need to remember it all by yourself.\n\nThe time loop in the game passes quite fast which is really bad, it keeps you in a terrible loop so quick. By doing the base management thing it took more than half of the day in the game.

This is unacceptable because i am stuck throughout my run with the most quirky weapon that behaves so different and is the worst out of all agreed by the community. \n\nOf course i have the blessing of kudaai perk to help reroll though none seem to help with the issue, it just gives me another hammer that is one tier lower. Then what is the point of the whole perk? Yeah call it i suck with the weapon, and rightfully so it is the slowest when speed is paramount in the game is absolutely ridiculous. Even if the game gave me all swords which i love i would think something is wrong with the game anyway. \n\nI cant continue because it is a chore to continue, Its a bug undeniably and i hate it. This whole game is a waste because of stupid things that makes the last 1/3rds of the game shit, a complete waste when the game was good in the beginning in almost every aspect and falls lower and lower nearer to the end plus this. \n\nI dont recommend the game in the long run if you are going to be irritated to even finish.

From the farm-sim style cult management to the roguelite dungeon crawling to the demonic visual theming of the whole game, it was a blast.\n\nI found the difficulty maybe a bit on the easy side, save for the third major boss, who kicked my ass real bad for some reason. But the combat kept me on my toes enough for me to never get bored of it. The dungeon crawling aspect was very fun, though I kept getting stuck with the claw weapons for my runs, which I really hated using because I wasn't a fan of the three-hit combo they did. It's random chance which weapon type you get and I'm pretty sure I didn't so much as see a sword for the last two main areas of the game. It was all claws, daggers, and hammers for me. Just bad luck I guess. Loved the daggers and hammers though.\n\nAnother thing I loved was the game's aesthetic, which makes sense given I'm a big Binding of Isaac fan I guess. It just oozes personality and everything looks so crisp and vibrant. Pretty much everything you do in the game is also accompanied by very satisfying sound design and fun animations that just make interacting with the world and your cultists feel worthwhile, even if only for the sheer enjoyment of it.\n\nI think my one complaint (if I had to have one) would be that I felt like things started to drag a bit near the end for me, as upgrades began to feel superfluous and not really worth getting outside of checking off a box on my list, but I'm willing to chalk that up to me being too slow to grow my cult's size early on. I'd bet the progression feels a lot smoother when you focus the dungeon stuff a bit more heavily than I did.\n\nAgain, this is a really fantastic game and I can't wait to see what the team behind it does next!", "timestamp_created": 1695712267, "timestamp_updated": 1695712267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147046461": {"recommendationid": "147046461", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126991048", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1696991217}, "language": "english", "review": "another great game from these devs similar to deaths door but you can make a little town which helps you with your quest in the game", "timestamp_created": 1695711506, "timestamp_updated": 1695711506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147045041": {"recommendationid": "147045041", "author": {"steamid": "76561199027224228", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2152, "last_played": 1695876654}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es probablemente de los juegos mas adictivos con los que me habr\u00e9 topado en alg\u00fan momento.

Both sides of the game are solid and support each other well, but aren't particularly deep. That's not bad, it's very fun and smooth and has a good sense of metaprogression, but if you're looking for a hardcore roguelike, this isn't it.\n\nThe aesthetic of this game manages to stay consistent in how adorably horrifying it is. It appears cute at first glance, but then you notice the screaming faces trapped inside the mushrooms in the background, crying blood! :D\n\nOn the resource management side, you're tending to the needs of your followers. You can cook for them, clean after them, do little sidequests for them, watch them grow old and make meals out of them, and condemn them to several different fates worse than death!

I can already see the replay-ability aspect as well, I'm going a semi-nice run now, but I definitely want to try out a more iron hand with my villagers.\nYour little villagers are sooooooo cute! A cute rhino?! Devs stahp yall be doing to much. Just kidding, but you will definitely get attached to specific villagers, especially the brothers you get (mine were porcupines! cute!)\nIve only beat the first two bosses on casual, but I loved the combat. Im garbage at platforms and fighting, but after about 3 tries I got the second boss and it was so satisfying. Combats are short enough I dont burn out, yet challenging enough I still feel like the lowest difficulty isnt a complete walk in the park.\nThe music slaps.

This does not make it a bad game, but rather, a good one for its audience.\n\nIf you've ever found yourself interested in the Roguelike genre but unable to dedicate time or mental energy to popular staples, Cult of the Lamb is great. The same is true for colony simulators. It touches on the very basics of each genre in a way where you can safely play with them as a casual player, which is a great thing, as both genres are typically rather intensive.\n\nThe game is not very deep. You learn how it works and that's it. The things that change in the mechanics don't actually change them much, making it very easy to cruise. As a game intended for casual play, this makes perfect sense. At the same time, there is space to make your own challenges and create your own difficulty. You simply have to make that choice yourself.\n\nThat's not to say it'll be as fun for non-casuals. Optomizing is easy, combat rather dull due to the roguelike elements not really mattering and runs needing to be short to account for the colony management, and as many elements can't be changed to make things harder or more interesting as those that can. (Many being staples, such as locking yourself into a specific weapon, not upgrading your skills, etc.)\n\nAll in all, it's not a great game, but it is a good one.

While it can be very easy to breeze through the game if you are experienced in other roguelite/bullet hell games while taking few deaths or hits, it is still a very enjoyable game for someone like me, who tends to get bored of base builder games and I even found myself wishing I had a bigger base to build more stuff.

One moment I'm wrecking s*** in the beautifully illustrated combat areas, the next makes me almost cry when a scrap of lore pieces together a bittersweet tale. I love this game SO much, and I didn't expect a free DLC that's basically its own sequel!
