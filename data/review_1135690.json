Ya sea porque por el trabajo de nuestros padres hemos tenido que abandonar el hogar donde nacimos y crecimos, por un divorcio, por problemas econ\u00f3micos; por mejorar nuestra situaci\u00f3n y poder vivir en un lugar mejor; por independizarnos; por irnos a vivir con nuestra pareja; por comprar una casa m\u00e1s grande porque vamos a ser padres...\n\nLas mudanzas siempre suponen un momento importante en nuestras vidas, ya sea por un buen motivo o por una mala experiencia. No consiste solo en mover nuestras cosas de un lugar a otro, se trata de un nuevo comienzo en otro lugar, acompa\u00f1ados de los bienes materiales m\u00e1s \u00fatiles y a los que m\u00e1s aprecio les tenemos, dejando atr\u00e1s los dem\u00e1s.\n\nEs precisamente de esto de lo que trata Unpacking. Tendremos como objetivo desempaquetar todas las cajas de las mudanzas que vamos a realizar a lo largo de nuestra vida. Con esta sencilla pero original misi\u00f3n, nos cuenta una bonita historia a lo largo de los a\u00f1os. A continuaci\u00f3n, os cuento con m\u00e1s detalle.\n\n[h1]Argumento:[/h1] (no contiene spoilers)\n\nEn Unpacking no se nos narra una historia de la forma convencional. En su lugar, la tendremos que ir descubriendo e imagin\u00e1ndola mediante los objetos que vamos viendo. Por ejemplo, podremos descubrir el sexo de nuestro personaje viendo el tipo de ropa que usa, la etapa de vida en la que se encuentra, las cosas a las que le tiene m\u00e1s aprecio porque las ha conservado con el paso de los a\u00f1os, las que ha dejado atr\u00e1s conforme ha ido madurando, sus gustos y aficiones... esta original f\u00f3rmula de contarnos la historia y de hacer que nos sintamos identificados en etapas de nuestra vida al ver los escenarios y los diferentes objetos. Esto har\u00e1 que surja la nostalgia, siendo sin duda el punto fuerte de Unpacking.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\n\nEl manejo es muy ameno y sencillo. Todo se maneja con el rat\u00f3n (tambi\u00e9n se puede usar mando, aunque no lo he probado a\u00fan). Simplemente hacemos clic sobre las cajas y se abrir\u00e1n, y de cada una de ellas tendremos que ir sacando los objetos que hay que colocar en cada una de las estancias que se nos muestren. Cada nivel representa un a\u00f1o, una etapa de nuestra vida. Desde nuestra ni\u00f1ez hasta la madurez, viendo pasar una vida y su evoluci\u00f3n por delante de nuestros ojos. \n\nAl final se trata de un juego de bloques en el que podemos \"decorar\" la casa, pero solo hasta cierto punto porque a la hora de pasarnos los niveles tendremos que colocar los objetos en lugares donde tengan sentido. Este es uno de los problemas que le veo al juego, y es que aunque coloquemos las cosas en sitios donde podr\u00edan ir perfectamente, el juego las detecta como err\u00f3neas, teniendo que buscar otro lugar que considere correcto. Una vez lo finalicemos si podremos colocar las cosas a nuestro antojo. \n\nEl juego puede parecer que es solo para relajarse, pero en ocasiones ese supuesto relax puede convertirse en agobio al ver que hay muy poco espacio y muchos objetos por colocar, quedando todo el escenario excesivamente sobrecargado en ocasiones y pudiendo generar estr\u00e9s en el jugador (como ha sido mi caso, que a veces soy algo mani\u00e1tico con el orden de ciertas cosas e igualmente desordenado para otras xD)\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\n\nUnpacking tiene gr\u00e1ficos 2D de estilo pixel art con vista isom\u00e9trica, con unos dise\u00f1os muy simp\u00e1ticos y agradables. Escenarios detallados que f\u00e1cilmente podr\u00edan recordarnos a habitaciones y lugares en los que hemos vivido. Podemos girar los objetos para verlos y colocarlos de la forma que nosotros queramos, pero los escenarios son est\u00e1ticos. De haberse podido ver desde distintos \u00e1ngulos habr\u00eda sido mejor, aunque no es algo que se eche especialmente en falta. \n\n[h1]Sonido:[/h1]\n\nLa banda sonora corre a cargo de Jeff van Dyck, con melod\u00edas muy agradables y amenas que sonar\u00e1n de fondo mientas desempacamos, pudiendo cambiarlas por las que suenan en las radios disponibles en los niveles. El problema de este apartado es que hay tramos en los que la m\u00fasica acaba y se queda un largo silencio hasta que comienza de nuevo, a no ser que vayamos a posta a encender antes una radio. Esto me ha parecido un error de bulto, porque aunque los sonidos al abrir las cajas, mover y colocar los objetos est\u00e1n muy conseguidos, adem\u00e1s de tener mucha variedad, el silencio de fondo se siente extra\u00f1o hasta que comienza de nuevo la melod\u00eda, que es en gran parte la \"culpable\" de que jugar Unpacking sea una experiencia que puede llegar a ser emotiva. \n\nTen\u00e9is la banda sonora completa de Unpacking disponible en el siguiente enlace de Spotify:  [url=https://open.spotify.com/intl-es/album/546P1fkMWTbVjeCMivORqf?si=5RqoNSrxQ_WsoEFqJFQrPg]Banda sonora de Unpacking[/url]\n\nMi lista de pros y contras a modo de resumen:\n\n[H1][b]PROS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- La est\u00e9tica Pixel Art\n\n- La original forma de contarnos la historia\n\n- Ideal para la gente a la que le gusta tener todo ordenado hasta el extremo\n\n- La banda sonora es muy buena\n\n- Puede llegar a ser un juego muy nost\u00e1lgico\n\n- Es muy entretenido y ameno\n\n- Tiene logros Steam\n\n- Tiene cromos y art\u00edculos en la tienda de puntos de Steam\n\n- Tiene guardado de la partida en la nube Steam Cloud\n\n- Se puede conseguir bastante barato en p\u00e1ginas de claves\n\n[H1][b]CONTRAS:[/b][/H1]\n\n- Algunos objetos no se reconocen demasiado bien, poni\u00e9ndonos m\u00e1s complicado saber donde ubicarlos\n\n- Se puede hacer repetitivo demasiado pronto\n\n- Hay muchos momentos en los que no hay m\u00fasica de fondo, tarda demasiado en arrancar de nuevo\n\n- Aunque puede parecer un juego para relajarse, en mi opini\u00f3n a veces es estresante y agobiante ver todos los escenarios tan sobrecargados de objetos y sin demasiado espacio donde colocarlos\n\n- Su precio me parece elevado para lo que ofrece, especialmente por su corta duraci\u00f3n, solo recomendar\u00eda su compra de oferta muy rebajado o en alguna p\u00e1gina de keys baratas\n\n[H1]Conclusi\u00f3n:[/h1]\n------------------------\n\nUn juego precioso a nivel audiovisual y con un planteamiento muy original. Muy recomendable si te llama la atenci\u00f3n la propuesta, eso s\u00ed, recomiendo comprarlo solo de oferta ya que su precio habitual me parece elevado para lo que ofrece dada su corta duraci\u00f3n.\n\nSi mi an\u00e1lisis te ha gustado o te ha servido de ayuda, agradecer\u00eda que dejaras un voto positivo para que pueda llegar a m\u00e1s gente.

Sorting items after moving into a new home may technically sound like a boring chore to some but it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience, given the proper laid-back state of mind.\n\nAppreciate subtleties like how your character will not touch her roommate's stuff but she can later easily reorganize her lover's, or how you can place your toothbrush in a cup by the sink. Figure out where mismatched items go, in which room or specific location. Stack things neatly and make your place comfortable and tidy.\n\nScenes increase in complexity, with new and more rooms available as your character matures through her life stages, gets into new studies, goes through breakups or new relationships, and achieves professional success. Each scene marks a key change in her life. It surprisingly achieves a decent form of minimal storytelling without words or on-screen characters.\n\nI appreciate short, candid experiences but Unpacking still ends rather abruptly. I was genuinely expecting the main character to grow into old age, maybe even end on a bittersweet note, but the developers chose to leave the story in her prime years instead, which gives it a bit of unfinished state.\n\nYou can organize items anywhere that makes sense, and while the game is relatively permissive it won't let you leave irregular arrangements untended. Aside from placing things in a temporary location while you figure out where you really want them, there isn't much of a puzzle component.\n\nWithout any description of what an item is, few ones were a little more difficult to figure out, but most are easily identified. Anyone who's ever run a household will instinctively know where most things go. There is rarely an occasion where you will run out of place, though a few rooms are more cramped than others. Furniture can't be moved, so the basics of the room have to remain untouched.\n\nEarn stickers for placing special combinations of items together. Take photos of your rooms for the scrapbook.\n\nThe game is built on okay pixels but it is not visually outstanding. The pastel art style did not really appeal to me as it felt more functional than inventive, but it also does not detract my appreciation. The soundtrack felt likewise serviceable but relatively bland, despite good sound effects. I was drawn to the game's content and freshness more than its presentation style.\n\n[h3]Positive[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Simple and creative concept\n[*] A charming and relaxing experience, almost cathartic\n[*] Everything in its right place, leave no mess behind\n[*] Items stack neatly where appropriate\n[*] Stickers earned from special item combinations\n[*] Scenes tell a story from key moments in the character's life without words\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Negative[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] Ends rather abruptly\n[*] Okay pixels, not visually outstanding\n[*] Serviceable but bland soundtrack\n[*] No item descriptions\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1700448897, "timestamp_updated": 1700448897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150466746": {"recommendationid": "150466746", "author": {"steamid": "76561199242545864", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 186, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1700445460}, "language": "english", "review": "v cute!", "timestamp_created": 1700445472, "timestamp_updated": 1700445472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150465722": {"recommendationid": "150465722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318039702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 269, "playtime_at_review": 269, "last_played": 1700434354}, "language": "english", "review": "Super relaxing and chill <3", "timestamp_created": 1700443934, "timestamp_updated": 1700443934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150464960": {"recommendationid": "150464960", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230968584", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "playtime_at_review": 270, "last_played": 1700500488}, "language": "english", "review": "it is a short game 3/4 hours but you will play it multiply times to unlock all the achievements.

Not only do the items themselves tell you about their journey through life, but the ways in which the environments are arranged - and more importantly, how they allow you to arrange your items in them - tell you a lot about how the person we're following fits in. The items you unpack and their relation to the space they have to fit into is used to subtle and great effect.\n\n[spoiler]Without a doubt the most powerful example of this used in the game is the episode moving in with a boyfriend: the way everything's arranged means you have to move a LOT of stuff just to fit in making it feel like you're moving into a space that doesn't really want you there, but the most painful part by far is that your framed college degree, which usually takes pride of place on the wall, has to go UNDER THE BED as though it simply doesn't exist. Brutal.[/spoiler]\n\nThe artstyle is pretty cozy and is generally readable, although I did have trouble figuring out what one or two items were (which is important, because sometimes you'll get items that aren't meant for the room their box is in). The game does sometimes have seemingly illogical item placement rules, but you can turn them off in the options if it bothers you too much; I would recommend NOT turning them off for your first playthrough tho, just to get the intended experience which is important to the story.\n\nOverall, a very comfy experience that allowed me to indulge my OCD tendencies wonderfully.

I felt myself smiling as I unpacked things I recognised from previous moves as if they were indeed my own possessions. This game is very good at getting you softly attached to possessions, memories, and coming to feel like you know the character you're unpacking as. \n\nI adored the way that the character grew, how their rooms, needs, space, and style developed but also the little knick-knacks and books and games along the way that stayed with them and showcased that they hand't outgrown their hobbies and interests. \n\nI very much adored the nostalgia factor as a child of the 90s and appreciated the pixelated nods to various known franchises.

This game tackled things that I myself have had to go through -- as well as things I hope to achieve: \nsentimentality, family, the concept of \"home\", and how material items can affect our perceptions of what makes a home.\n\n=WHAT I LIKED=\n- The Music: The music was cozy and emotional, reminiscent of composers like Lena Raine and C418.\n- The Art Style: The art style helped to cement the cozy feel of the game. In a strange way, it reminded me of Point-and-Click mystery games from the days of Flash.\n- The Story: The story, even being unspoken, hit very close to home for me particularly (This may have been influenced by the fact I used my real name for the name of the first album).\n\n=WHAT I DISLIKED=\nAll in all, there was very little I disliked. Any technical issues I encountered could be attributed to my potato-tier computer. However, there were some items I had trouble recognising until (and even still I'm not sure they were what I thought they were). \n\n=THINGS I WOULD LIKED TO HAVE SEEN=\nPersonally, I would liked to have seen a sort of sandbox mode in the game. However, this only comes from my desire to have a home that doesn't look like it should be condemned.\n\n=CONCLUSION=\nNormally, games like this tend to make me stress out. But I found this stress to be missing while I played! I found myself actively interpreting the story in a way I haven't since I played \"Celeste\" and I was humming along to the music as I tried to figure out where to stuff a DS. Overall, \"Unpacking\" is a phenomenal game and a wonderful experience for those who enjoy organisation, interior design, and nostalgia. \n\n\n\n\n!!!\\\\\\WARNING: EVERYTHING PAST THIS POINT MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS///!!!\n\n\n=EXTRA COMMENTS=\nThroughout the game, I had this lingering feeling that the main character would turn out to be lesbian. I was pleased to see I was right! This really only made the story resonate with me further, given my own preferences away from the screen. I found the ending incredibly sweet and wholly deserved.\n", "timestamp_created": 1700289510, "timestamp_updated": 1700289510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150335153": {"recommendationid": "150335153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808370780", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "playtime_at_review": 241, "last_played": 1700106940}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1700286072, "timestamp_updated": 1700286072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150334843": {"recommendationid": "150334843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810189411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 324, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1700285533}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful game, hit me right in the nostalgia bone <3", "timestamp_created": 1700285615, "timestamp_updated": 1700285615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150333476": {"recommendationid": "150333476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185086546", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 353, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1700259842}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and satisfying game to chill.

Before hammering away at the \"unhelpful\" button, consider that this mobile app art installation is being sold on the same platform as actual games such a Counter-Strike 2, Mass Effect, The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 and hundreds of other dedicated PC games, with cutting edge graphics and gameplay.  Furthermore, the developers have acted unethically and insultingly towards PC gamers with the market positioning for this mobile app.  I cannot in good conscience recommend games (and game-like art installations) to PC gamers when they're from developers who behave in an unacceptable manner towards PC gamers.  \n\nOn with the standard review. \n\nUnpacking is a mobile app that's been dumped on Steam as if it was a real PC game (it's not)... it's a cash grab from greedy mobile devs.  This barely qualifies as a game, as all you do is put your finger on your iPhone screen to drag and drop various items out of boxes into a room.  It's worth mentioning this simple activity (which in itself is not a game loop, which is why this doesn't really qualify as a game) is backed by a narrative.  Each consecutive room that you move into reflects the aging of the protagonist (yourself), as your possessions move from whimsical childhood toys to the mature and sometimes somewhat depressing possessions of an adult. \n\nThis creates a rich narrative, to which we must ask, why couldn't they have coupled this narrative with an actual interactive PC game with decent graphics, instead of a mobile app with lazy pixelcrap \"art\"?  Imagine where this could have gone if the developers applied the discipline of, well, modern video game development to it. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nA choice was made to use obsolete, decades old retro pixel \"art\" as a substitute for contemporary PC graphics.  It's unclear if this is due to lack of budget or talent, regardless, the overall visual quality of the game is extremely low as a result.\n\nWhile there are options to change the resolution for the game, all this does is scale up the simplistic 2D art assets used to make the game, which makes little or no difference to the graphics quality.  Without any other substantial graphics tweaks, it's not possible for gamers to improve the lacklustre 2D visuals.\n\nThe controls can't be customised because the game has such a dumbed down, simplified interface that it's just iPhone screen tapping stuff.  The fact that the interface is this dumbed down might be seen as a problem in itself, however... this is a fairly shallow experience if you're the kind of gamer that likes to play games with deep, rich control schemes and interaction.  You'll get none of that here.\n\nBecause this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.\n\nThese technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nOnce more we see greedy mobile devs trying to scam PC gamers. On Steam, this is an eye watering, insulting $20 USD, on app stores, it's $10 USD. Mobile devs must learn PC gamers are not here to be gouged, and can't be expected to pay a TWICE THE PRICE, 20 BUCKS FOR A MOBILE APP just because it's been lazily dumped on Steam.  This is unacceptable disrespect for PC gamers.  Because this is a mobile app, is priced to insult and gouge PC gamers, and because of the other defects, it's impossible to recommend.  That's right, charging some gamers twice as much as other gamers just because you don't like the platform they use and prefer they used mobile phones for gaming is unethical discrimination towards a specific group of gamers. \n\nI appreciate the game is AeStHeTiC, and I absolutely agree that it's \"charming\", but the entirety of the charm of the game can be captured by a youtube video.  It's very difficult to suggest I should tell gamers to pay TWICE AS MUCH on PC for a mobile app that might as well be a 10 minute video on TikTok.  Instead we should be asking why the developers wasted their talent on making a mobile app when they could have created a truly 3D interactive experience on par with games like Life is Strange and The Last of Us.  Instead, they went the pixelcrap mobile app route.\n\n$20 will get you a lot more high quality gameplay.  If you really, really want to play this, buy it on the app stores where it costs half as much.

It's such a throwback to see all of the old tech you unpack at the start which I remember from my childhood which then upgrades as the years go on. There are also really sweet bits that you notice as you go such as she gains a new souvenir whenever she goes abroad, her childhood piggy teddy starts showing its age and she ends up patching it up, and she collects little chicken figurines. Sentimentally you see the girl fall in and out of love and mature as the years go on. There were lots of bits I related to like moving into her college apartment with roommates and moving into her first shabby place. \n\nGameplay wise it's pretty self explanatory, really well made and I didn't come across any bugs. It's point and click and very low stakes. The hardest part was figuring out where some items should go if they were packed in the wrong room, but wrong items are highlighted in red and you can play trial and error to figure it out.

There are many different types of items that belong to specific parts of the house and specific compartments within that room.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a written or narrated story, but the title of each level, the contents of the house and the rooms that are available tell a story by themselves and you can see the progress of the character\u2019s life. This life story seems very personal and auto-biographical and it might be even inspired by one of the developer\u2019s life events.\n\nThe graphics are pixel art based, but are very detailed with lots of interesting details and some interactable objects like game consoles and you\u2019ll find quite a few different ones from the 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s. The soundtrack is nostalgic and relaxing and the sounds of each type of object are realistic and distinct and that is a nice touch. \n\nThe gameplay itself is simple and easy. The correct placing of the objects is easy to figure out with common sense but a few placements seem a bit arbitrary, but, in any case, with just a few tries you\u2019ll figure out the right place for the item. In most levels you also won\u2019t run out of space easily so you don\u2019t have to be very meticulous with the object placement.\n   \n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]  \n[b]How many:[/b] 25 Achievements.\n[b]How much time:[/b] 3 hours, playing at a slow pace and without a guide.\n[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Very Easy, it\u2019s easy to find the right placement for the items.\n[b]Achievements\u2019 Difficulty:[/b] Easy. Some of the achievements are for completing the levels and the rest are for doing specific things in some of the levels. You can find hints for these within the sticker album inside the same or by checking the global achievement\u2019s page. When I completed the game, I just went back to the previous levels and figured out the missing achievements in a few minutes, so it won\u2019t be too hard, but there\u2019s also a very good guide available. \n\n\n[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  \nUnpacking is a cute and relaxing P&C puzzle game that is to play in short sessions. It has a very relaxing and nostalgic ambiance and the levels and achievements are easy to complete.\n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group [u][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/] Ribbon Hunters[/url][/u] for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1699715501, "timestamp_updated": 1699715501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149919617": {"recommendationid": "149919617", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970761123", "num_games_owned": 2918, "num_reviews": 866, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1699385616}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is currently in the Humble Choice for November  2023, and this is part of my coverage of the bundle. If you are interested in the game and it's before December 5th, 2023, consider picking up the game as part of the current monthly bundle.\n\nStorytelling by finding a place for everything. \n\nUnpacking is mostly about a unique narrative told through the act of unpacking boxes. The player has to open boxes and move items around to figure out where everything goes. It can be as simple as finding an underwear drawer and throwing all the panties in it. But it also can be anything from finding a good place for a clock radio or a diary. \n\nThe problem is there\u2019s not a lot of puzzle.  When the game is confusing and players can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong with their choice, the game just kind of waits until players figure it out, and that\u2019s just frustrating.  The player sometimes doesn\u2019t even know what an object is, which makes finding a place for it clicking around, rather than storytelling. \n\nBefore someone tells me, I know there\u2019s intentionally no text, but without that text, it often feels like the storytelling can be accidental. I\u2019m avoiding spoilers, but when something has to go under the bed, players of the game will know what I am talking about,  it feels more like a problem with the design of the apartment than a point in the narrative because no direct rule is being explained to the player, instead, it\u2019s where the game will allow you to place something. This isn\u2019t a horrible negative, but it\u2019s something that always bothers me with the praise the game gets for that moment. \n\nPick this up if you want a story told uniquely. Not necessarily a unique story, but this delivers an experience unlike anything else. That being said, it is only about 2 hours long, and it\u2019s more of a game to be discussed than a game to challenge players. I\u2019m torn on it but I did enjoy my first playthrough and this time was interesting enough.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review or want to know what I think of other games in the bundle, check out the full review on or subscribe to my Youtube channel: https://youtu.be/NSoVlkgy0D0\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1699691334, "timestamp_updated": 1699691334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590488910675048828", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149918735": {"recommendationid": "149918735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045068509", "num_games_owned": 1239, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 399, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1699772754}, "language": "english", "review": "Chill little game , you just vibe out and unpack stuff.

Among all these games full of action, epic scenes and killing they decided to create a game for something simple, a routine, something that ordinary people do. They make unpacking interesting.\n- Gorgeous minimalistic isometric visuals. Nice pixel graphics with great color palette and cool details. They have designed many different objects for you to unpack.\n- Responsive, effective controls. Moving, rotating and placing objects happen instantly and accurately without weird snaps. Very satisfying.\n- Fluid animations and. It's so pleasant to watch the cardboards disappearing. Also some objects change shape according to the position that you're placing them.\n- Cool, calm music.\n- Nice audio design. Sounds are simplistic but every object has different sound effect that corresponds to its material and the surface that you're placing it.\n- Some extra features like saving videos and gifs after finishing your decoration.\n- It has a cheerful atmosphere that may be relaxing for some.\n\nThe bad\n- It's entertaining enough, but the gameplay doesn't evolve at all as you play. You do the same thing from the start till the end, just in different houses and with more objects.\n- It tries to tell a story in an abstract way, but although you understand some major events it's actually pretty basic.\n- I'm not sure that I agree with its core meaning. It essentially tells us that happiness is moving in bigger and bigger houses, having babies, making more money and having more and more things.

It's a relaxing game where you unpack items as you move into new homes at various places in your life, from moving to college, to moving in with your boyfriend, to moving into a permanent house with your partner, there's a clear story to follow here without any cut scenes or dialogue. Is it anything too interesting or meaningful? Not really, it's very surface level but that's perfectly fine for this game and it adds meaning to doing what you're doing. Figuring out where everything goes is really only interesting the first time you encounter that room, for example the first time you get to unpack a bathroom, or an office, since that's the only time you need to actually figure out where stuff goes, after that it's just doing the same thing you've already done, and gets a bit repetitive, especially the wardrobes! Unpacking 20 pairs of underwear for the 5th time is just boring. Other than that though, the game is pretty solid. The graphics are simple yet effective, and the music is just fine. The biggest issue with this game is the price. It does absolutely nothing to warrant a $20 price tag. The absolute maximum I'd pay for this game is $8 and that's pushing it even I think. Either get this in some sort of bundle or when it's on a big sale, otherwise wait. It's a fun and relaxing way to spend an afternoon but not worth the hefty price tag.

Everything from the style, to the music choice, to the story, etc etc. Unpacking is one of my favorite games and I think a little bit of me died when I found out there wasn't a sequel or something similar. I have replayed this game at least four times and I experience pure joy every single time. I would sell my left kidney in order to be able to play this game again. I would pay my entire life's savings for them to make a sequel to this game. If you see this game I recommend, no I BEG, that you play it. This game cured me of any illness and filled me with joy I had not experienced in the past two decades. Everything about this game is genuinely stunning. The one flaw is that there isn't a continuation of it. The story is subtle for those of you who aren't really into story games and prefer just raw gameplay and also for those of you whom enjoy a cute little story to enjoy while playing this game. The little details in this game just perfect it even more than it already has been. I could sit and play this game for hours and hours. After a stressful day, this game is the perfect thing to come back to while you simply unpack and organize clothes and objects and listen to the calming music. To the creators I nod my head to you because never in my life have I seen a more enjoyable game before. I BEG and PLEAD with you to consider making a prequel and if anyone knows something similar to this please share it with me. The one thing that concerns me is that I doubt I'll ever find a game as beautiful and perfected as this one. Everything is absolutely amazing down to the last letter.

I am not convinced that there is enough content in the game to make it worth $20.\n\nThat out of the way, the content Unpacking DOES provide is FANTASTIC. It's a relaxing game about unpacking (who knew?) and I'm surprised I haven't played a game with this kind of concept before. It's the small details that sell it for me, like what items have been packed into what boxes, or what recurring items you keep as you move from place to place. I'm particularly impressed with how the game manages to invoke nostalgia, not just for myself thinking back on my own past, but nostalgia for the character you play as: her life, her belongings, and the way it all ties together as the years progress. It's a neat little story that does a great job showing you rather than telling. The music, sound design, and art style all fit the game perfectly.\n\nYou can finish the whole game in just a few hours and you probably won't feel a need to play the game twice. But if you're like me, you may end up returning to the game every so often. What can I say? It's a good game for me to de-stress. I suppose there IS merit in the whole \"cleaning is therapeutic\" thing...\n\nOverall, a solid game worth experiencing, but unless they lower the price or add more content to the base game (what about a hard mode with even MORE things to unpack each level, making it much harder to find space for everything? or a custom room builder where you can place items from all of the different levels? even

Unpacking and putting away a stranger's things is more enjoyable than you'd imagine, but after having played a few levels I can conclusively say that shoving mugs into a cupboard is not my definition of GOTY game play. You can play how you want to a certain extent, but it does make you follow the in-game rules. I was absolutely floored that Australian \"people\" just leave their dirty ass Vans on the carpeted floor in their bedroom closet but the game does not allow me to put it on a shoe rack like a proper civilized person.\n\nLike most of the over reviews say, it is rather overpriced. It has an average playtime of 2-3 hours, with no replayability or extra game modes. For a 5 dollar game that's OK, but this game is 22 CAD and just shy of 14 on sale. A bit much, no? There are people who defend this, which I understand: yes, it is from an indie team, but are we not indie gamers who prefer bang for their buck? I see no sin in avoiding a game due to the price/content ratio. \n\nI'm not sure what everyone else is seeing in the \"emotionally impactful story\" of this game.

It flows through big life changes and hints, some cute like an item or two from college or an old item from home when they're older. I liked it as a busy adult cause I could just drop it whenever I needed to in order to do errands without worrying. It's sweet and there is a lot of personality, but I don't see much replay in this - I beat the game and so far assume you can just create a new name/file but it goes through the same motions. If you save it you can fastplay watch how you organized the room before which could be fun. Now, I bought the game for $12, when it was 40% off. I would say to definitely wait for a decent sale and not buy it at $20. It's great fun, but it's quite short.

It begins when she first leaves home and we are greeted with boxes in each room of a small apartment. The story is not narrated, but well told through the different lodgings and belongings we have to put away from boxes. It definitely gives the player emotional responses, even without words, as the journey unfolds. With each new abode, new items will be added, and some will be left behind.\n\nIn it's essence, it is a puzzle game. Most items have limited possibilities of where they can be placed. If an item is not placed in one of its correct possible spots, the player is alerted and the item is outlined in red.\n\nIt can sometimes be quite a task to find a place for an item in an already crowded placement area. Thankfully the player can put items on the floor (or some other positions) in order to rearrange and make space for the item in crowded spots.\n\nPros:\n* A very well made game which made it a joy to play\n* An emotional journey, zen like, without words\n* Mid level saving allowing the play at your own pace\n* Easily accessible by players of all skill levels \n* Lovely music and graphics\n* Possible replay value to get achievements (25 in total) when not using a guide\n* Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n* A little on the pricey side for a roughly 4 hour game\n* A lot of the achievements will require revealing achievement spoilers or using a guide\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nEven with the high price tag, it proved to be a very enjoyable, worthwhile and memorable journey. The quality in all aspects of the game makes it shine and a joy to play. Definitely an easy recommendation.\n\nRating : 8/10 (would be more except it is a little short)\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]\nThis review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], where every game deserves a review.\nFollow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11978515/]Curator[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1692711183, "timestamp_updated": 1692860302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767346978187561035", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144778091": {"recommendationid": "144778091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996946716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1693123977}, "language": "english", "review": "very relaxing game, i love it", "timestamp_created": 1692694567, "timestamp_updated": 1692694567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144771334": {"recommendationid": "144771334", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090776138", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1692682202}, "language": "english", "review": "great game for people looking to unwind", "timestamp_created": 1692683127, "timestamp_updated": 1692683127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144767145": {"recommendationid": "144767145", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198853972", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1441, "last_played": 1694230147}, "language": "english", "review": "One my all time favorite games! super excited to see more from these developers!

Really?! that was all I got for $20?!\" It was a nice experience but it was spoiled by the feeling that I just got ripped off. This game should probably be $10 or less. If the devs had plans to add more levels later (which they apparently don't), or if they allowed for the community to create custom levels, it would probably be worth its current asking price (although even if these things were added $15 would still probably be a fairer price). \nAlso, I have to say, I think it's a little annoying that the devs teased \"big announcements\" that just ended up being ads for new merch or just announcing that the game is coming to another platform. It honestly feels like a slap in the face to see these announcements. The only critique I've seen of this game is that there aren't enough levels, yet the devs seem utterly reluctant to add new content.

For a $20 game you get one single story line that plays out for about 3 hours total. There a dark star mode that gives more freedom to the puzzle aspect but overall that's it.

\n\nMy 2nd issue is you're forced to put objects in certain areas which made the game feel scripted and less relaxing and more of a tedious puzzler whereas all the reviews and videos I saw for this game gave me the impression you could place items anywhere which is not true as you will see from playing you're barred from moving on if you don't. \n\nMy final thing about the game is that the devs have no plan for future updates nor any sign of a workshop which is sad as it would have been cool to have extended the game but also get more enjoyment out of it and to see what the community would have created this realistically would have made the high asking price justifiable.\n\nOverall these issues I had with the game is simply why I can't recommend it virtually all the advertisement I saw told me it was a relaxing game about a family moving in and unpacking boxes and being able to place items wherever you want which is what you get except items have to be placed in certain locations

However, I couldn't see this game being worth the full price so I waited for a sale. Luckily a great friend gifted it to me on the sale day and I was able to try it out.\n\nUnpacking doesn't flat-out tell you its story, however, you can piece it together by the gameplay. It is obvious that we are following the story of a woman starting from the time she is a little girl. The game does a great job of telling you her story through the items you \"unpack\" at each stage. I found this way of storytelling really cool and immersive as you see the important phases of her life. When she was a kid, going off to college, moving in with roommates, etc. It's fun and intriguing to see the items that go along through each phase of her life and which ones you don't see anymore.\n\nThis game is a puzzle game at its core. Each stage starts you in a room with packing boxes. It's your job to take out all the items in arrange them in the room as best you can. Once you finish unpacking all the boxes, you'll have to go through a final check. Any objects that have a red highlight have to be moved to a particular spot so the level can be completed. For example, toilet paper is not going to go in the living room. In the beginning, you'll only have to unpack a room or two. In later stages, you'll be unpacking a whole house/ apartment. It gets trickier when the space becomes limited.\n\nAs far as gripes go, I think I only have one. The game is pretty short and the replay value is low. There are 8 stages and the only reason you'll want to replay this game is to complete the special challenges on each stage. \n\nFinal verdict? If you want a chillaxing puzzle game, pick this up. However, I suggest grabbing it when it goes on sale for about 12 dollars. I don't feel it's worth 20.

Much like any real living space, there are limits to space in certain areas--sometimes the difficulty of a level is figuring out \"how do I stack these without them taking up ALL the shelf space?\", though it's not difficult, in my opinion.

Once the package is \"cleared\", the game will indicate if everything is in a place the game considers acceptable. Misplaced items will appear with a blinking red border. You finish a level once the room is tidied up, and the next one unlocks.\n\nYou will progress through a variety of [b]levels[/b]. Sometimes they consist of multiple rooms or even stages of a house as we follow the life of our protagonist. The game is not challenging, but sometimes finding a small misplaced item can be tricky. There is a setting to turn off the placement check, allowing you to progress through the levels without adhering to the ruleset if you get stuck or feel stressed at any point.\n\nIn general, the game is very [b]accommodating[/b]. You can zoom in and out, increase icon size, change the highlight colour and use keyboard, mouse or controller inputs. There is no time pressure, and the game autosaves at any time.  \n\nThe [b]story[/b] is discovered by interpreting the items you unpack and the nature of the apartments you live in. The game takes place from 1997-2018. People who grew up in that time might find many familiar-looking items. Many, if not all, books and other media covers resemble iconic pieces of the time. There are also domestic and religious items that you might not be familiar with. \n\nThe [b]time[/b] it takes to reach the credits depends significantly on your ambitions. Simply unpacking and finding a place that's allowed can be done in 3 hours. It took me 7 and then I started a second playthrough right away (there are 5 save slots) because I had a blast and learned that there is a hidden game mode with a different ruleset for item placement! It's also entertaining to try to complete the game according to a challenge you made up on your own. Like playing the floor is lava or trying to swap the purpose of rooms etc.\n\nThe [b]achievements[/b] for this game are visualized and and hinted at by stickersheets in the game. You earn specific stickers for placing or interacting with items in certain ways. \n\nLastly there is a [b]photomode[/b] that I didn't make use of but I saw on the community page thst some people create little stories making use of the filters, frames and stickers that the game offers!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI highly recommend the game to people\ntrying to be creative in a limiting ruleset. You can spend a lot of time here!\nenjoying short experiences that don't mind the price (or get it on sale)\nbeing a kid/teenager starting in 1997 looking for some nostalgia\n\nIf you are looking for action, a puzzle to think about, or a complex story, this game might not be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1690702411, "timestamp_updated": 1690729672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762809395790100098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143066357": {"recommendationid": "143066357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125244006", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 181, "last_played": 1644527328}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and cozy game", "timestamp_created": 1690700695, "timestamp_updated": 1690700695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143064413": {"recommendationid": "143064413", "author": {"steamid": "76561199510519622", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1693246689}, "language": "english", "review": "SURE\n", "timestamp_created": 1690697270, "timestamp_updated": 1690697270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143061235": {"recommendationid": "143061235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092035169", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1667586883}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!

For example that they like gaming or that they were doing cosplay at some point in their life. Those and many more little details make Unpscking so great in its visual story telling. \n\nThe game does ALOT OF things right but there are a few smaller things that annoyed me personally ~ for example that you can only place some items in dpecific places/areas around the house. Or that even tho there is technically enough room, you can't place a smaller item next to other items. That mostly happened to me with pots or pans. \n\nBut maybe the point that some items can only be in specific areas  around the house or room is also part of the visual narrative of the game, who knows? \n\nOverall I can wholeheartedly recommend the game to people who like cute, cozy and chill games or just people who want to play something relaxing after a long day.

They keep doing these \"BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS\" getting everyone's hopes up about dlc, more content, or a next game, only to be let down with ANOTHER merch drop..... or this last one was about them coming to mobile..... They have finally come out and said there will be NO new content added to this game.... the story is all wrapped up...., but they could add a dlc about a totally different story character, they called the game \"unpacking\" why keep it to ones specific persons story(?), so i feel like its a cop-out. It's easier to make money off of plushies and t-shirts, then make more of the game.... \n\nDid I enjoy the game? Easy, Yes very much so! \nThe story telling is great. You really get a feel who this person is and what they are going through. The art style is cute and cozy. The color palette is a great choice. The music is very chill and fitting. The sound design is satisfying. \n\nDo I think its worth the price? sadly no, there isnt much replay value to the normal gamer, and $20 is steep for so little content, so wait for a sale. :( Seriously when you look at other games made by small devs/teams feels like they give you more for your buck, and this game is seriously lacking.\n\nI have a lot of hours in the game, due to me using it as a tool. when i feel overwhelmed i boot it up and it calms me. I feel in control and that helps me ground myself. I am not playing it for the normal reasons you play a game, which some would say would be the story, action, challenge, art, ect. I play it because while yes $20 is a lot, its still cheaper then therapy(lol). I think thats why it sucks so much there isnt more game to play... this game has helped me out alot overtime, so just knowing that theres someone out there missing out because of the price tag or the lack of content is just sad..... \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1689901218, "timestamp_updated": 1689901218, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782027482986450195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142495935": {"recommendationid": "142495935", "author": {"steamid": "76561199228480486", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 533, "last_played": 1688063271}, "language": "english", "review": "A very relaxing, cosy & calm game, I love all the little elements in this game and the story to it.
