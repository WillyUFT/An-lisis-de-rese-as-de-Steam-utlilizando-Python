Also, the artistic, hand-drawn style was quite decent. Secondly, the gameplay is challenging at the same time, as every run you play feels unique with all the different enemies and synergies. Thirdly, the soundtrack is great and makes it a better experience.\n[*][h3]Negatives[/h3]\nOn the negative side, the problem with the original Isaac is that the difficulty spike is quite high, mostly because of the low variety of synergies and transformations that we have in the actual game. Also, the game runs at 30 FPS, which makes the experience even more rough. Too, the run can't be saved at any point, so if the game crashes or whatever happens, it can imply the loss of the entire run.\n[/list][h2][u]Conclusion[/u][/h2]\nIn short, there is no point in getting this game instead of The Binding Isaac: Rebirth because this game is just the base of something greater. The unique reason to get this game is just if you want to support the developer because of its great games and to try out how the original Isaac was.

muertes, a excepcion de las obligatorias. sin embargo recomiendo a los que tienen comprado la expansion eternal a no jugar en modo dificil hasta tener la mayoria de objetos desbloqueados y tener practica ya que los nuevos enemigos eternal son complicados incluso para jugadores experimentados, para algunos el mejor juego roguelike del mercado, yo no puedo hablar de eso ya que es de mis primeros roguelike pero me encanto tanto que no me estoy tomando el tiempo de probar otros hasta platinarlo, pero hablando del juego flash que estoy rese\u00f1ando en este momento, le doy un 7/10 ya

through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.\n\nScrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trap door to the basement hidden under his rug.\n\nWithout hesitation, he flung open

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.", "timestamp_created": 1695521741, "timestamp_updated": 1695521741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610364079475402832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146888595": {"recommendationid": "146888595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226074156", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1268, "last_played": 1621644304}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the original rogue-like zelda 1 clone.

'How could this not be Isaac? It says it right there, on the title!' But hold on, you're not understanding. This might be \"The Binding of Isaac\". This might be the predecessor to the beloved \"Rebirth\" remake/sequel. But this is sure as hell nothing like that game. \n\nI have dumped over 1k hours of my life in Rebirth, including all DLC's, that is, up to Repentance. I unlocked Dead God a year ago, at the time of writing this, and I'm currently on my second savefile. I know that game. I know what everything does; every item, every enemy, every machine and beggar; every nook and cranny. That game has virtually no secrets for me at this point. So there I was, yesterday, seeing the original flash version for sale on steam. 'Well --I thought to myself-- it's only two dollars, plus the expansion, that makes five. Might as well buy it and give it a try. It can't be that difficult.' \n\nOne of the things that drove me the most toward Rebirth, when I started playing, was the story. I was really interested in that little Isaac kid and all the ways that the items he picked up reflected all the ways he was tortured at home. That is why it came as a surprise to me when I finally bought the game and, other than the extreme difficulty that entangles the base game --that completely goes away once you install any DLC-- the tone and overall atmosphere was very light and very much opposite to what I had expected. The pixel art aesthetic made the game look way more tame than its themes and story wanted to convince you it was. \n\nI kept playing. From PS4 I then went to Steam, starting from 0, but this time, with over 50 hours of experience. I easily beat Mom on my first, maybe second run. I was unstoppable. I was getting achievements left and right, and that moody atmosphere and dark story that first grabbed my attention were slowly being buried by all the knowledge that the game was forcing me to learn. I got Repentance on release date, and right away, I was looking up information about the new characters and items; on how to unlock them and what they each were. I was effectively optimizing my fun. The story was now entirely gone from my mind. I was merely looking at items, synergies, enemies. What goes with what, which one should I pick, who sould I kill first. \n\nFlash Isaac made me feel, for the first time, that sentiment that went away as my knowledge of Rebirth widened. This game, within the first few rooms, had made me feel vulnerable, scared and alone. None of the hours I had dumped on Rebirth would help me. For the first time in years, I couldn't even make it to the third floor without dying. This is not the same game I have spent five years playing. This is a whole different experience. Immediately I could feel that darkness upon entering the first room. Isaac is not a 16-bit little guy; Isaac is crying because Isaac is scared. Isaac is doing this because his mother is after him. Isaac is experiencing something that no one should ever have to go through. His situation is extremely unfair, and so is the game. Every room that you get yourself into will make you want to cry, because that second of Isaac's life is now become more painful than the last. After dying for the first time, I remembered an interview in which Edmund McMillen, the creator of this game, said something along the lines of 'With this game, I wanted to go all in, and fill it with all the stuff that they wouldn't let me add to Super Meat Boy'. I remembered his words about christianity, and how terrifying it was for a little kid to be scared on such a level of his omnipotent God. It suddenly made sense. All those people that seemingly prefer flash Isaac to the Far Superior Rebirth Plus DLC's. They were two different games. \n\nIt was no help that, in my arrogance, I chose to start the game on hard mode, thinking that I would have no problem cruising through it. All those people saying 'Flash is harder', 'Flash is more unforgiving', 'In flash, it is actually difficult to get to Mom'. Oh, right? Watch me beating her on my first try.\n\nI played 11 games on hard mode. Not only did I not beat mom a single time; I didn't even get to her floor. Eternal enemies were kicking my ass everytime I saw one, and I was finding it hard to get accustomed to the faster gameplay, and to the enemies that sometimes had more, and sometimes less health than I was used to. Everything was scary, and I was alone. \n\nYes, this game is unfair, and very much so. There are a lot of room layouts in which damage is absolutely unavoidable. If Repentance's motto was 'All damage is avoidable', flash Isaac's should be exactly the contrary. And when I say this game is difficult, I mean it. People who have unlocked all achievements do not fuck around; beating hard mode with all characters is required, and that mode features something called 'eternal enemies', which are variants, recognisable for their entirely white color, that run faster, shoot larger quantities of faster projectiles, have loads and loads of health, and are, in general, and absolute pain in the ass. \n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone new to the franchise. I cannot recommend this game to anyone whose enjoyement of Rebirth comes from breaking the game and ending every run having emptied the whole angel item pool. I cannot even begin to recommend this game to people who kind of liked Rebirth but wanted a more challenging experience. This one is seriously tough, and it has not aged well in any aspect. You can hear the flash engine cracking and wheezing every time you enter a new room, and in that aspect, it is very much a good thing that they decided to change the engine entirely for the remake.

Or at least it pushed things forward as far as roguelikes and their visibility. I remember watching multiple people on Youtube play this game and having the urge to play it myself. High accessibility and a \"just one more run\" type of addictiveness is present here. The randomly generated rooms are more often than not full of surprises. I would die unexpectedly and often. But just often enough some good luck would come my way in terms of effective boosts to attack power and interesting new abilities. The overall playstyle is rewarding and arresting. One naturally grows more skilled with each run. The story and thematic elements of this game however are a bit less savory. So on a subjective level I enjoy the themes of this game though they veer toward the macabre and disturbing. There is psychological horror here that is in-your-face. There is also a comical tongue-in-cheek element that is purposeful. Very original and not bad but not going to be everyone's cup of tea for sure which is fine. Overall, easily recommendable and fun. Maybe a bit herky-jerky and stiff in the controls department by 2023 standards.\n\nNote : I played maybe 20+ hours of this game on PS4 in addition to the hours played on Steam.", "timestamp_created":

DO NOT PLAY THIS TRASH, only play Rebirth and onward if you truly wish to enjoy this game as intended. If you want to painstakingly sit there and endure the complete bs this game constantly throws at you then kudos to you. To begin you have no say on your controls, you have to play with whatever default it gives you. So if you fat finger stuff a lot or have a small keyboard good luck, because you will constantly bomb yourself or use valuable cards/pills at the wrong time. The fullscreen is a joke, not only does it tank the fps, it also makes certain enemies harder to play against as they all of the sudden fire way more projectiles all around them that are downright impossible to dodge. You know what else is impossible to dodge though? Every enemy when it comes to specific room layouts which is the direct reason I quit this game. Whether you play on normal or hard mode (Which you have to play Hardmode to get all the achievements) you constantly run into rooms that I like to call \"Death Rooms\". These rooms have a layout that limits your movement to the point where you are automatically cornered the moment you enter the room. The enemies not only approach you to deal contact damage, but are also constantly firing mach speed projectiles all over the room. In front of you, behind you, everywhere. You have next to no immunity frames so you are taking 1-2 hearts of damage in like 1-1.5 seconds. If you have the patience to deal with this kind of thing, you may eventually get lucky enough to beat a run and get a few achievements. Problem is, you don't win this game with skill, you win only with luck, because you will constantly run into run ending rooms that you couldn't do anything about. Another thing is the bosses, most of them are insanely tedious or downright impossible to kill. They either bombard you with exploding projectiles, leave creep everywhere while spamming projectiles making it impossible to dodge after only seconds, or both at the same time while spawning unlimited amounts of tanky enemies. I literally had a decent run going only to run into Eternal War in the Eternal Challenge Room. I went from 6 full hearts and 2 soul hearts to half a heart over the course of 3 minutes with 4 damage and Technology Tears. The room was completely open, but he would literally dash every 3 seconds and spawn about 6-8 Globins. Once again I have Technology Tears which pierce through all enemies and it took me longer to kill the Globins then the time it took for him to spawn more. And he was spawning 5-6 troll bombs after the Globins. He was literally on screen for like 1 min of those 3 mins and that was mostly during the 2nd phase in which he charges at you faster then you can run while you are still surrounded by Globins. Once I finally killed him I picked up some extra hearts laying around and got 1 more soul heart, then headed to the boss room which I hadn't cleared yet. Can you guess who I saw when I entered? That's right another Eternal War!!! :DDDDD I paused the game, contemplated whether to play it out, saw the hearts I had and knew I was defeated. For a second however I was going to unpause and go out swinging, but I looked at the room layout and just alt F4'd. Rocks covering the corners, and the center of the room. So if you really want to play this game: 1. Don't play hardmode. 2. Don't expect to beat the final bosses even on normal mode for a long time due to the amount of runs you'll lose completely out of your control due to death rooms.

El lore si bien no esta tan trabajado como en Repentance sigue siendo bastante interesante y la banda sonora no solo es mejor que su secuela si no que adem\u00e1s se ha vuelto hasta ic\u00f3nica (destaco My Innermost Apocalypse al ser mi favorita). \nA pesar de todo esto, el juego presenta muchos errores, como su p\u00e9sima optimizaci\u00f3n, el spawn de llaves que es casi inexistente, la enorme cantidad de items malos, la inexistencia de sinergias, el mal dise\u00f1o de algunas salas que, a menos que vueles, es imposible no recibir da\u00f1o y, lo que para mi es lo peor, el modo dif\u00edcil integrado en la Eternal Edition, el cual es injusto en muchos niveles y es posiblemente el peor modo dif\u00edcil que he jugado en mi vida, cada jefe e incluso enemigo com\u00fan eterno parece un mini Delirium, y los ataques teledirigidos son casi imposibles de esquivar, y si bien esto se compensa con una gran cantidad de corazones blancos, no es una experiencia agradable.\nEn resumen: El juego es muy bueno, es un desaf\u00edo terminarlo al 100% y, a pesar de todos los fallos que he mencionado anteriormente, puedo recomendarlo completamente si te gustan los juegos dif\u00edciles o con tem\u00e1ticas oscuras y t\u00e9tricas.", "timestamp_created": 1689905244, "timestamp_updated": 1689905244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Probably shredded through my first gaming laptop leaving it open to save playthroughs. I'd highly reccomend it, but seriously if you have religious or SA trauma, or are especially sensitive to trauma, I'd be very wary going in, its gonna likely be pretty triggering.

Each game generates a random map with a staggering variety of items. There are 17 initial characters, each with their unique abilities, and the compatibility between different items adds to the game's high replayability. The gameplay itself is simple and easy to grasp, but mastering the game takes a long time.\n\nIsaac is highly randomized, from map generation to item rooms, devil rooms, angel rooms, and the quality of items in the shops. Even the enemy placement on each floor is random. Therefore, in my opinion, each run depends not only on the player's skill but also on luck. A powerful Tier 4 item from an item room, like Sacred Heart or Brimstone, can significantly alter the course of the game. Additionally, players need to make choices and trade-offs. Should they use their heart containers to obtain items from devil rooms? Which of the many strong active items should they prioritize for maximum benefit? There may be other aspects that I, as a novice, am not aware of yet.\n\nCurrently, I play Isaac for a couple of runs every day before diving into other games.

The game was released in 2011 and has since garnered a cult following for its unique gameplay, dark themes, and challenging difficulty.\n\nThe game follows the story of Isaac, a young boy who is forced to flee into a basement to escape his religiously fanatical mother. The basement is filled with monsters, traps, and other horrors, and Isaac must fight his way through the levels to reach the final boss and confront his fears.\n\nThe game's gameplay is a mix of action, exploration, and RPG elements. Players must navigate through randomly generated levels, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way. The game also features a wide variety of bosses, each with their unique attacks and abilities, making each playthrough feel unique.\n\nOne of the standout features of The Binding of Isaac is its dark and twisted themes. The game explores themes of child abuse, religion, and mental illness, making it an intense and thought-provoking experience. The game's art style is also unique, featuring grotesque and disturbing imagery that perfectly captures the game's tone.\n\nThe game's difficulty is another aspect that sets it apart from other games in the genre. The game is challenging, with players needing to master the game's mechanics and learn enemy patterns to progress. This can be frustrating at times, but it also makes each victory feel that much more satisfying.\n\nOverall, The Binding of Isaac is a challenging and thought-provoking game that will appeal to fans of the rogue-like genre.

Of The Definitive Flash-Era Roguelite[/b]\n\n[b]The Binding of Isaac[/b] is now 12 years old, which is a pretty crazy thing to me. While I didn't play this original version until now, I had played the [b]Rebirth[/b] remaster a lot when I first got my PS4. That game was likely the first true roguelite I had ever played. Revisiting this original version makes it clear where the game placed its roots, but it also shows how inferior the first version was.\n\nThe interesting thing about Isaac is how much it replicates the original [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] with its dungeon design. This never occurred to me until I recently played the first LoZ game, but it's a core component of this game with its focus on ranged combat, bombs, keys, and the way dungeons and enemies are structured. It's a nice evolution of a pretty early adventure game idea.\n\nThe actual gameplay of Isaac is pretty simple but does devolve into a repetitive yet addicting loop. You defeat a room full of enemies to progress throughout a randomized dungeon, and you collect primary items and other secondary-use items along the way. This changes how Isaac's character functions and offers some wacky tools to fight enemies with. A downside is that you cannot get rid of items you don't enjoy, and there are no in-game descriptions for any items, causing you to have to memorize each one (unless you have a wiki pulled up next to you).\n\nThe game is also very, very focused on randomness. There isn't a lot of room for skill, so you pretty much just work with what you're given. I find this game to lean too far into the \"luck\" side of things more often than not, which really takes away from the feeling of accomplishment.\n\nStill, it's a fun game with some imaginative items, enemies, and boss fights. Future expansions/remasters would only make the game stronger, but this base version is still playable for those who are interested in seeing the earlier days of this game.\n\n[h2]Final Verdict: 6/10 (Above Average)[/h2]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my curator page for my thoughts on a variety of other games!\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/37542043-ADHD-Reviews/", "timestamp_created": 1687627871, "timestamp_updated": 1687627897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140621992": {"recommendationid": "140621992", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100811084", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1687712755}, "language": "english", "review": "i am in physical pain because i cant beat gurdie\n\n10/10 would reccomnd and get rebirth\n(send help)", "timestamp_created": 1687621781, "timestamp_updated": 1687621781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444417953491211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140594389": {"recommendationid": "140594389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251797118", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 189, "last_played": 1693672356}, "language": "spanish", "review": "me gusto", "timestamp_created": 1687580167, "timestamp_updated": 1687580167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140591946": {"recommendationid": "140591946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140215112", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 17210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17151, "last_played": 1687626748}, "language": "english", "review": "The OG Binding of Isaac.

"language": "english", "review": "[b]PROS:[/b]\n+ super interesting lore\n+ fun(ny) gameplay\n+ cool boss fights\n+ feeling of exploration\n+ a ton of unlockable items\n+ a ton of collectible items\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- no official gamepad support\n- Steam Cloud save issues\n- achievement unlock issues\n- fps drops in hardmode\n- replaced by The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nThe Binding of Isaac is a disturbingly funny game with a lot of cute but very morbid gameplay. The enemies are something to behold, especially the bosses, and the creators really went in with a \"let's crank up the levels of disgust\" attitude. But in a good way! It fits in very well with the flash graphics (the game originally was just a flash game) and overall the art style is unique and memorable. There is a surprising amount of lore sprinkled throughout the whole thing. From locations to enemies to playable characters and even items/trinkets have their own idea behind them. It's a very biblical game but I don't see it as either praise or satire, more neutral - it just sprinkles in various parts and leaves it up to you what you think. Now to the main part - [u]how it plays[/u]: well, it's a really REALLY difficult game. Don't let the casual look fool you it is merciless from the start and only gets easier as you unlock new items ... but then again you unlock new harder levels too so it stays challenging. You can become good at it, learn all there is ... but most of the time what makes or breaks your run is what items are generated for you. You can struggle with bad ones or become OP with others. It can feel unfair at first but after you get the rhythm you can manage your time based on what run looks good or not. But you will die ... a lot ... often during late game boss fights. However, if you cherish the journey, what you gathered along the way, you will have fun. Sadly, there are a lot of technical limitations. No gamepad support (you need third party apps like JoyToKey). Achievements pop up weirdly. Sometimes during play, often after restarting the game. And a couple of times the game time didn't add while playing, like Steam forgot the game is on. Steam cloud works super wonky, as the unlocks (serial.txt) and campaign progress (so.sol) are on two separate files in two separate paths. It was easier to copy files manually. Eternal Edition DLC (added with Wrath of the Lamb DLC) feels unnecessary. It breaks the mods, it doesn't add items and just adds a layer of sponge-like enemies. Sure the attacks are different too but that makes the game more of a bullet-hell than it was. There are also extra glitches and fps drops in hardmode. This is a great game but it has been overhauled and remade to become a bigger and (possibly) better game in [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/]The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth[/url] (and it's DLCs). The community moved over there as well. So, while I like this art style more, I recommend going for the newer version(s) instead of this one...\n\n[b]*Note:[/b] There is a limited modding tool available for this game. The Eternal Edition has no mod support. To disable this version and use normal WotL (which is needed for mods) go to \"Manage My DLCs\" and un-check \"The Binding of Isaac Wrath of the Lamb Eternal Edition\".

I understand that this is on me, but i had a wholly negative experience with the game. The items have no descriptions, so i never understood whether I had a good run going. In terms of game quality, the limited resolution options mean the game's aspect ratio never looked good on my monitor, so there were massive black bars when in fullscreen. Pressing escape opens a pause menu, but pressing it again does not close the pause menu, but rather tries to close the game.

There are some instances where you simply cannot avoid being hit, which is reason enough this doesn't get a thumb up! Also, some (all?) of the enemies that came with the DLC are incredibly difficult and annoying for their respective levels (unpredictable movement, additional effects like coin drain adding insult to injury). Jumpys are reason enough this doesn't get a thumb up. White flies are reason enough this doesn't get a thumb up. Greed is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen in game development outside of Path of Exile, as it is a quadruple punishment \u2013 by far the hardest of the sins to avoid taking damage, taking away coins if it hits you, taking away the store for the floor (!), useless drops of either a few coins or the Steam sale which I've been able to actually use (on a later floor, i.e. not the same floor) fewer times than I have beaten the game's various end bosses!!! On the other hand, some items are so unbelievably overpowered (e.g. Epic Fetus, any flying item or certain combinations like Sacred Heart + a few Tears up, or turning into the cat + max tears item (which was it? I forgot). bam, hard mode chest win first try) you are basically guaranteed a win. In the end, this game feels more like a chore once you've beaten it a few times and have to get a win on every character (and they really aren't that different) against every boss. Oh, and even after 150 hours the stat system in the game doesn't make any sense to me. One damage upgrade (what item???), and my damage stat is maxed out. So why doesn't it feel like that, then? What did that shit actually do? Have numbers, not inexplicable symbols and meaningless counters. Also, the fact the game doesn't tell you what items do. I still have to look up trinkets, tarot cards, devil and angel room items in the wiki even after playing HUNDREDS of games! That's not good game design. Actually unlocking the item description in-game after picking it up for a certain number of times would have been motivating and an additional reward for playing you know. And gambling is often wayyy too slow. The pace is dead like Ed McMillen's cats when you have a lot of coins late in the game. Let me put in 10 coins at once ffs.\n\nThis would be a sideway thumb if Shteam allowed it because like I said, the basic premise is unbelievably good. The execution however is severely lacking. In many regards, this is the counterpart to Super Meat Boy, a likewise severely flawed classic (but not masterpiece). I really doubt the remake which I haven't played yet is any different \u2013 it's likely just much much larger.\n\nThree (edit: FOUR) ideas how to make this much much better: 1. make rooms larger. one row and one column more would be enough to abate most unfair room layouts. 2. one optional boss room per level that lets you choose the reward (bomb, key, heart). It's SO FUCKING ANNOYING when I have to restart a run because I miss out on early blue heart stones or treasure rooms because I don't have a single bomb or key, and even worse when I got good items but am almost out of hearts in the sixth level or later. 3. EVERY character HAS to start with at least one key and one bomb. see 2 for why 4. The treasure room must be next to the starting room on Basement I. At least in hard mode, when you don't get a good item in the first treasure room, there is no reason not to reset instantly.\n\nPS: and oh holy shit, the bugginess. There are seldom bugs in gameplay, but unlocks and achievements are really unreasonably bugged (like just right now I unlocked ???'s chest completion item when I beat hard mode chest with CAIN.) If Sh1team had any quality control (lol as if), this game would be removed.\n\nPPS: Samson is a special kind of shit. I had to put that in the review.

There's fewer synergies that completely break the game, but there's also fewer items in general so the consistency of runs is greater.\n\nHard mode is \"f you\" levels of hard with many enemies simply becoming bullethells on their own let alone when you get several of them at once, good luck if your character is lacking speed and/or damage ups. But hard mode is honestly really quite fun, you get the equivalent of Angel challenge rooms occasionally which give angel room items instead of the typical challenge room items, and I love how things like that make it a fairly different mode compared to normal runs in more than just \"the enemies have more health now lol\"\n\nRuns are also fairly significantly shorter than Rebirth, likely in part there is not quite as much to do (shops and arcades aren't really worth it, but health ups from beggars very much are) which makes it good if you only have an hour or so to game.\n\nAlso I like the pausing on entering a room, stops me from running into floor spikes quite as much as I do in Repentance.\n\nIt's good. If you want more content on top of Rebirth, this isn't really treading any new ground aside from the hard mode.

of Isaac is a game that is both hauntingly beautiful and disturbingly dark, yet manages to be an incredibly heartfelt experience that leaves a lasting impression on its players. This game is truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word.\n\nThe game follows the story of a young boy named Isaac who is forced to flee into his basement to escape from his overbearing and abusive mother, who believes she is doing God's work. In this basement, Isaac must navigate through various rooms and defeat horrific monsters to reach his ultimate goal: escape.\n\nWhat makes The Binding of Isaac so special is its ability to blend horror, comedy, and emotion together seamlessly. Despite the game's disturbing visuals and themes, the story of Isaac is one of survival and hope. As players progress through the game, they uncover more of Isaac's backstory and learn about the challenges he has faced throughout his life.\n\nBut it's not just the story that makes The Binding of Isaac such a standout game. The gameplay itself is incredibly addicting, with players able to choose from a wide variety of power-ups and items that drastically change the way they play the game. Each run feels unique and different, and the game's replayability is second to none.\n\nThe art style and sound design of The Binding of Isaac are also worth mentioning. The game's pixel art is both charming and unsettling, and the soundtrack perfectly complements the game's dark atmosphere.\n\nOverall, The Binding of Isaac is a game that is both haunting and heartwarming, and one that is definitely worth experiencing. It's a game that manages to stay with you long after you've finished playing, and one that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a deep, emotional experience. It's truly one of the best games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1682728349, "timestamp_updated": 1682728349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe\n2. Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours\n3. Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool\n4. Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500mL \u2013 1L of stock. Leave to cool\n5. Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings. Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices\n6. Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck, and make up to 1L with cold water. When cool, add to the haggis mixture\n7. To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2\u20133 minutes and taste. Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed\n8. Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung.  Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely, and keep a little bung at each end\n9. When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors\n10. Tie the new end of the bung, and continue stuffing. Freeze any spare haggises\n11. Before cooking, pierce the haggis several times with a needle. Place in a pan of cold water, and bring to the boil. Simmer for 1.5\u20132 hours.

That's not the issue though.  Every time I died, it was essentially b/c I was forced to fight 3+ enemies in a room that I couldn't run around in.  You either have space to maneuver, or you don't.  If you're restricted to a small path with pits making the majority of the tiles inaccessible, you better not be up against the wrong type of enemy or else you're just dead.

On one hand you are a baby dodging poop and flies. However on the other hand the story is occurring because his mother has time and time again believed that there is a higher power telling her to restrict the needs of her child and then to sacrifice him in order to save his soul. In order to escape his murder the main character Issac escapes into the pits of his house and is both aided and meets resistance from previous children his mother has done the same thing to. The lore behind it even leaves windows open for fans to create little details here and there which is wonderful when a story rich game allows a community to come together like that. The mechanics of the game are simple and there are obstacles that are just hard enough to create a challenge on the easy mode while they get harder on the consecutive modes. It is no wonder that they have expanded on this game with further ones (which if you like this you should also check out by the way). Overall I am very happy that I got to enjoy this game and very much recommend it to others.", "timestamp_created": 1679420127, "timestamp_updated": 1679420127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

fully enjoyed to the fullest.", "timestamp_created": 1678538204, "timestamp_updated": 1678538204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

He needs to be saved.\" \"I will do my best to save him, my Lord,\" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. \"Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.\" \"I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,\" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.

To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.\" \"Yes, Lord. Anything,\" Isaac's mother begged. \"To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else.\" \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug.

It's been quite some time since I first played this game all the way some time in early 2012.\nBut today was the day I finally got all the achievements, after not having played the game for a good 8 years.\n\nI can still remember my first few attemps. I was so bad, it took a good 15 tries to even SEE the first boss and another 20 tries to beat him.\nLooking back, this was probably one of the most influential games in the early 2010s for me. And recently I had feeled the urge of completing this version of the game for the sake of it.\nLittle did I know when starting up the game, there was actually new content waiting for me. Having switched to Rebirth on its release I was fully unaware of the free Eternal-Update from 2015.\nSo, this felt like I visited an old friend who surprised me with a long awaited gift.\n\nThis version is not just the birthplace of a great game, but it still retained its place as a game in its own rights. Thanks to a developer finishing up what had been left and giving it a bit of content that is now fully unique to this version, you can have a completely new experience, despite going BACK to this game.\n\nSo, now I've finally reached the end of the journey presented by this game itself. But even that might not be the end of it. I will check out the modding communities' efforts.

The only issue is performance, since the game is built using Flash, you may experience slowdowns even on a good PC.", "timestamp_created": 1670459706, "timestamp_updated": 1670459706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128129378": {"recommendationid": "128129378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870871045", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1210, "last_played": 1691198699}, "language": "english", "review": "Matricide is good and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1670456373, "timestamp_updated": 1670456373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128109030": {"recommendationid": "128109030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092311209", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1670428484}, "language": "english", "review": "addicted to this game! mainly on the PS4 though, buy it!!", "timestamp_created": 1670428534, "timestamp_updated": 1670428534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128081233": {"recommendationid": "128081233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198883426571", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 213, "last_played": 1687855346}, "language": "spanish", "review": "cheto", "timestamp_created": 1670384884, "timestamp_updated": 1670384884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128022299": {"recommendationid": "128022299", "author": {"steamid": "76561199222612873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1670990587}, "language": "english", "review": "it take me back to the good old days when this was popular on YouTube", "timestamp_created": 1670309470, "timestamp_updated": 1670309470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127987153": {"recommendationid": "127987153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077737984", "num_games_owned": 739, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 12172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1238, "last_played": 1672975712}, "language": "english", "review": "Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself - drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television. Life was simple and they were both happy. That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above. \"Your son has become corrupted by sin. He needs to be saved.\" \"I will do my best to save him, my Lord,\" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life. Again, the voice called to her. \"Isaac's soul is still corrupt. He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.\" \"I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in Thee,\" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world. One last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her. \"You've done as I've asked, but I still question your devotion to Me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.\" \"Yes, Lord. Anything,\" Isaac's mother begged. \"To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son, Isaac, will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life, as an offering to Me to prove you love Me above all else.\" \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen. Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch, just as his mother burst through his door, and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.", "timestamp_created": 1670257826, "timestamp_updated": 1670257826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816767990589141846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127942594": {"recommendationid": "127942594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797913992", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1617335708}, "language": "english", "review": "binder of eye sack", "timestamp_created": 1670189431, "timestamp_updated": 1670189431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127890820": {"recommendationid": "127890820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135398516", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 8778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8778, "last_played": 1638671969}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic, while a bit outdated.

'runs' are pretty short and the gameplay is tight and controls well. the plot is a humorous take on the biblical story of the same name. it's hard but still fun even when you get your ass kicked.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I suppose those two options are hardly mutually exclusive though.\n\nFor a title so aggressively grotesque, I truly believe that it doesn't get enough of the credit it deserves. Beneath what I can only describe as a nightmare-fueled haze from the mind of Edmund McMillen lies a perfect video-game. I mean, I'd love to ask him what possessed him to come up with this in the first place, but that may be a head-first dive into the mouth of madness. This title amounts to a thinly-veiled retelling of the biblical story of Isaac [i](for those Christians reading at home, it's in that religious text that you've never bothered to actually read)[/i] with some morbid artistic licensing to add more flavor. It is a perfect blend of arcade-style playing and roguelike mechanics.\n\nI can't justifiably complain about anything that [i]The Binding of Isaac[/i] has to offer.

You play as Isaac, Magdalene, Cain and even Judas. You find crosses and rosaries, angels and demons. You fight the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, you fight Satan, but above all - you fight your own mother. All along being bombarded with all types of bodily fluids, drugs and self-harm contraptions. I think the message here is pretty clear, and I absolutely love it. Games ARE meant to be this influential.\n\nBut hey, the themes serve merely as the initial attraction. What keeps you playing is the exceptional roguelike gameplay loop, whose randomness keeps you on your toes at all times. The inexhaustible hope (and lust) for an amazing build makes you want to try your best every run. And the feeling you get when all the stars align just right is inimitable and... completely intoxicating. This game can be addictive as hell (pun intended), and that's its best quality.\n\nHowever, as much as I appreciate this game for what it is and what it brought into the roguelike genre, it is no secret that it has been surpassed long ago, by its own developer no less. In November 2014, Edmund McMillen has shown us what The Binding of Isaac should look like all along. The humongous hate that the Eternal Update received can be mostly boiled down to the fact that after coming back to this 2011 classic from the smooth and inviting Rebirth, all of the original game's faults have suddenly resurfaced for many people, the effect of which was very jarring. The flash original IS janky and sometimes frustrating solely due to its technical quirks. Hence, even though I believe The Binding of Isaac to be amazing, I still admit that in the long run, Rebirth is the way.\n\nAll in all, the original Isaac holds a special place in my heart. Writing this short review made me realise how much I appreciate this game, despite its obvious technical flaws. If not for this piece of lovable junk, we wouldn't have Rebirth, nor Enter the Gungeon, nor even the 2020 masterpiece Hades. Oh, wow.

The only redeeming factor of this game is the design.\nIt's dark, but beautiful. I love how each item changes your character to look more grotesque. And I love the plot. But that's where the positives stop.\n\n- It's practically a bullet hell game, yet there's no dodge feature.\n\n- Most of the items themselves are lame and NOTHING tells you what ANYTHING does, so you'll have to wiki-search every 5 minutes if you don't want to risk ruining your run.\n\n- Some rooms are filled with traps and fast enemies, so since you can't dodge you'll be forced to face-tank everything and lose 8 hearts. And if you didn't find any extra hearts yet, game over.\n\n- The shooting mechanic as a whole is an absolute joke. You can only shoot in 2 planes; up/down, left/right.\nso combine that with the fact that you can't dodge leaves you completely bamboozled on this choice for even a semi-bullet hell game. Did I mention enemies CAN shoot in any direction?\n\nThere's even more BS, and the game doesn't have a tutorial besides how to move, which would be second-nature to gamers anyway. So you'll have to put in the time to figure out just how much garbage this game has to offer.\nDo you want an actual good roguelike/lite bullet-hell? Play \"Enter The Gungeon.\"\nIt's practically perfect. And that's coming from a guy who's done literally everything there is to do in it.\n\nThis is my opinion. Maybe you'll like the game. But I assure you the hardest part about this game is NOT the enemies.

Yep, it's more or less a story of a child and its imagination twisted with fear and religious teachings but for expert lore I'd suggest checking YT ^^\".\nGameplay wise it's all about clearing each room you enter, collect items, beat boss, repeat on next stage till the end. All this while trying not to die as this game is not easy. If you fail you have to start over. Some will love this idea, some won't so do make sure if its your cup of tea.\n\nTechnically Rebirth is, despite all, a technically superior product, however the original has its upsides regardless:\n+it's much smaller. As said Rebirth may feel overdone and over-saturated with content, too big item pools, ever more extreme achievements... This however is very compact in comparison but even then the RNG with items is a factor.\n+Unique looks. Smooth, not on-purpose pixelated art design. It's simply oddly pleasant to look at in its own, well visible and obvious grotesque\n+Superior soundtrack. In my opinion it fits and works much better for this game than orchestrated Rebirth's which often felt like too much for what is on the screen. But each to their own here.\n\nBut then there are the downsides:\n-It's old and made in flash which means 30fps lock and stability issues. Hell, for some may not function at all or have achievement issues.\n-RNG heavy in the end, despite all.\n-Don't be fooled, it's very difficult which may be a major roadblock in 100%-ing. Though no oddities like beating all bosses without being hit once like Rebirth has. Just no-dmg achievs per vanilla stage but on the other paw this one doesn't have many cheese strats and none are very safe.\n\nI feel these are the biggest bullet points about this entry. I'm quite on a fence since it was my introduction into the genre but on the other paw I have personal reasons to not like the genre...but then I don't really know is it game's or genre's fault ^^\"",

Isaac kept to himself, drawing Isaacs and playing with his Isaacs as his Isaac watched Christian Isaac on the Isaac. Isaac was Isaac, and they were both Isaac. That was, until Isaac's Isaac heard an Isaac from Isaac. 'Your Isaac has become Isaac by Isaac, he needs to be Isaac.' 'I will do my best Isaac, my Isaac', she replied, rushing into Isaac's Isaac, removing all that was Isaac from his Isaac. Again, the Isaac called Isaac. 'Isaac's Isaac is still Isaac. He needs to be cut off from all that is Isaac in his Isaac and confess his Isaacs.' 'I will follow your Isaac, I have Isaac in thee', Isaac's Isaac replied, as she locked Isaac in his Isaac, away from the Isaacs of the Isaac. One last Isaac, Isaac's Isaac heard the Isaac of Isaac calling to Isaac. 'You've done as I've asked, but I still question your Isaac to Isaac. To prove your Isaac, I will ask one more Isaac of Isaac.' 'Yes, Isaac, anything.' Isaac's Isaac begged. 'To prove your Isaac in Isaac, I require Isaac. Your Isaac will be the Isaac.

Not much to say really.\n\nREPLAYABILITY AND CONTENT - 7/10\nWhile being way less replayable than Rebirth, it's still pretty replayable with near 200 items and 2 final bosses with the WOTL DLC. There is also 7 characters with WOTL (and like half of them suck), which is an OK amount. WOTL also adds 10 challenges, which half of them are barely challenging (a challenge with Dr Fetus isn't challenging when its a free win item in this game) but whatever. Overall, its pretty replayable.\n\nART STYLE - 9/10\nI really like the art style. It's unique due to the fact that not a lot of games use this type of art style and it is fitting since the game looks like a child's drawings.\n\nSOUNDTRACK - 10/10\nSoundtrack is great, especially the final boss tracks, the basement and the cellar tracks and the main menu track.\n\nDIFFICULTY AND DESIGN - 3/10\nGame is pretty challenging but also pretty unfair (which is why dark boy is like one of the hardest achievements IMO). For example, if your damage is low, then a 5 charger room with 3 corridors can result in you taking unavoidable damage. And I think there isn't enough damage and tears upgrades in the boss pool. There are literally more shot speed ups than tears and damage ups in the boss pool. And there is way too many bloat items and even the devil deals, which are like the best pool in this game, still suck. Overall, I think the game's design is lacking and the difficulty is too unfair.\n\nCONCLUSION - 37/50\nDespite its design not being good and its difficulty being unfair, I still think the game is really fun and that both its art style and soundtrack is great and its pretty good at replayability. And I think the price makes this game a great buy.", "timestamp_created": 1653140574, "timestamp_updated": 1653140641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Issac making his way down the basement trying to escape his mother that's trying to kill him. There isn't really any characters to talk about so this section isn't necessary. The story itself is fine and does move things along, however there isn't really anything special or interesting about it. While it might be a interesting twist on an old story, it never develops into anything great. \nThe setting of the basement and the different rooms that you go through are really boring with no a lot of stuff going on in them. While the more you go down the darker it goes, the layout of the levels is uninteresting with there pretty much being only the enemies and some rocks to provide both cover and an obstacle for the player. There are rooms for different purposes that have some form of a change, but even these don't offer anything enjoyable. \nVisually, its a bit iffy. The art direction that these types of games go for are pretty decent as they are pretty simplistic, but do offer some interesting character designs, but it seems that this didn't translate to the levels of the game and sometimes so of the other things such as items are pretty boring to look at. \nSound and Audio aren't great either with the soundtrack being serviceable and the audio for things such as the tears and enemies are a bit pathetic. \nIn terms of gameplay, this has got to be some of the most frustrating controls that I've had to use. The way that Issac and enemies move about in game is very stiff and janky which makes for a really annoying experience. This also effects the way Issac fires as he can only shoot in 4 directions making it hell to position with an enemy and with the way that they move this makes it one of the worst combat experiences I've experienced in recent memory. I think the items and buffs that you can earn in the game can be quite useful, but this can be handicapped due to the poor controls. The only thing i could commend about this game are the bosses as they are designed really well and have unique attack patters, but these can also be beaten easily with the use of bombs as they tend to be a bit overpowered. \nOverall, The Binding of Issac was a really poor game with little to offer and I'm hoping that the rebirth version rectifies to issues that i had with this version", "timestamp_created": 1651425829, "timestamp_updated": 1651425829, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393325388431549072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114786751": {"recommendationid": "114786751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032291007", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 322, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1646838451}, "language": "english", "review": "It's probably not bad, just not my type of game", "timestamp_created": 1651420486, "timestamp_updated": 1651420486, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114756275": {"recommendationid": "114756275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083461907", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 448, "last_played": 1651378297}, "language": "spanish", "review": "piola", "timestamp_created": 1651375744, "timestamp_updated": 1651375744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114748896": {"recommendationid": "114748896", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229878299", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1681598307}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego entretenido por si estas aburrido ademas buena historia y mucha variedad de armas", "timestamp_created": 1651363226, "timestamp_updated": 1651363226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114747454": {"recommendationid": "114747454", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201410033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1642048350}, "language": "spanish", "review": "compre este pensado que era un dlc  y lo jugue hasta que me di cuenta que los graficos estaban deteriorados un 150%  y que quitaron salas , no lo rembolso pq 6 pesos ni pa tutuca alcanza xd", "timestamp_created": 1651360569, "timestamp_updated": 1651360569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612676024436950684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114741298": {"recommendationid": "114741298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080379105", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2164, "last_played": 1642635121}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun and very worth the price!

Progression is fun the way you unlock more content as you beat the game more and more times and the more achievements you unlock that does feel rewarding. But the luck factor, the RNG, is WAYYYY out of control. It's just extremely unfun when you're the unluckiest person even to get screwed by luck so many times. Again the bug and also I've had good runs which were ruined in a single moment because there's 0 bad luck protection but there's good luck protection, for example the permanent flies that surround you and can soak a hit are limited to just 3 even if you earn more. It just needs to let you have more control like give you 1 key, bomb, heart and maybe 3 gold at the start of each area, treasure rooms should have 3 options and when you choose 1 the other 2 despawn like something that doesn't leave everything to sheer luck.
