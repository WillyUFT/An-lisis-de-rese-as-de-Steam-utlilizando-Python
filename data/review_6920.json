While it certainly has its moments, the game struggles to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor.\n\nStory Overview (Spoiler-Free):\n\nSo as the main plot of the story has you thrown into a dystopian future where power-hungry factions battle for dominance, Deus Ex: Invisible War puts players in the shoes of Alex D, a protagonist caught in the chaos of global conspiracies. The story centers on the aftermath of the catastrophic Collapse, an event that has drastically altered the geopolitical terrain. In this world of corporate intrigue, shadowy organizations, and clashing ideologies, players find themselves at the heart of the action, making crucial decisions that mold the course of the narrative. As Alex navigates through the intricacies of this altered reality, the player is tasked with steering the protagonist through a landscape fraught with choices, each one contributing to the unfolding story. (this sounds quite good wouldn't you say so?)\n\nPros:\n\nChoice and Consequence: Invisible War maintains the series' trademark feature of allowing players to make choices that impact the narrative. Your decisions affect the world around you, leading to different outcomes and providing a sense of agency.\n\nCyberpunk Aesthetics: The game captures the essence of a cyberpunk world with its futuristic settings, augmentations, and conspiracy-laden storyline. The visuals, although dated by today's standards, manage to convey a dystopian atmosphere.\n\nVersatile Augmentations: The augmentation system is diverse, allowing players to customize their character with a variety of cybernetic enhancements. This adds an element of strategy to gameplay, enabling different playstyles.\n\nBranching Narratives: The game offers a branching narrative with multiple endings based on the choices players make. This adds replayability and encourages exploration of different story paths.\n\nIntriguing Lore: Invisible War delves into the rich lore of the Deus Ex universe, expanding on the conspiracy-laden world established in the original game. The narrative explores themes of transhumanism, ethics, and the consequences of unchecked technological advancement.\n\nGlobal Perspectives: The story takes players to various locations around the globe, showcasing the geopolitical consequences of the Collapse. This diversity in settings adds depth to the narrative and keeps the player engaged in the unfolding events.\n\nCons:\n\nTechnical Issues: Invisible War is plagued by technical shortcomings, including awkward animations, texture pop-ins, and occasional frame rate drops. These issues can detract from the immersive experience and make the game feel unpolished.\n\nSimplified Gameplay Mechanics: In an attempt to streamline the gameplay, many mechanics from the original Deus Ex were simplified, leading to a less nuanced experience. The removal of the skill system and the universal ammo system, while intended to make the game more accessible, may disappoint fans of the original's complexity.\n\nLinear Level Design: Unlike the open-ended, sprawling environments of the first game, Invisible War adopts a more linear level design. The lack of expansive environments diminishes the sense of exploration and limits the player's freedom.\n\nUnderdeveloped Characters: The characters in Invisible War lack the depth and complexity of those in the original Deus Ex. The narrative fails to build meaningful connections with the cast, resulting in a less engaging story overall.\n\nLackluster Character Development: While the game introduces a diverse cast of characters, their development is often superficial. The lack of compelling backstories and limited interaction with NPCs can result in a less emotionally resonant experience.\n\nPacing Issues: The pacing of the story can be uneven, with moments of intense action followed by slower, exposition-heavy segments. This inconsistency may impact the player's immersion in the unfolding plot.\n\nVague Plot Points: Some plot points and overarching mysteries may feel convoluted or poorly explained, leaving players with unanswered questions. The narrative could benefit from more clarity in certain areas to enhance player understanding and engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, Deus Ex: Invisible War offers a dynamic blend of cyberpunk aesthetics, player choice, and a sprawling narrative. However, technical issues, simplified mechanics, and narrative shortcomings prevent it from reaching the heights of its predecessor. While fans of the franchise may find enjoyment in the familiar cyberpunk setting and choice-driven gameplay, those expecting a true successor to Deus Ex may be left wanting more.", "timestamp_created": 1699819679, "timestamp_updated": 1699819679, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149962138": {"recommendationid": "149962138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081955533", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 890, "last_played": 1698107359}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b] Invisible War's Biggest Hurdle [/b][/h1]\n\nThis is something that [b] HAS [/b] to be mentioned before I would go to rest of the review as most of the issues can be traced back to the same point and that is Invisible War was originally made for console namely Xbox. As you can imagine, due to hardware limitations making the same game as original Deus Ex just wasn't possible. (Even after it got ported into PS2, some streamlining had to be made whenever is it to cutting bigger levels into smaller ones or removing certain game mechanics like locational limb damage)\n\nI would like you to keep this is mind during reading this review as I didn't want to brought it up every 2 sentences. I believe you are smart enough to notice when we get there.\n\n[h1][b] Part 1: Gameplay [/b][/h1]\n\nAt its core, it plays very similarly to original. You can go lethal or non-lethal depending on your preference, there are usually multiple ways to aproach the problem at hand, you have multiple abilities to choose from etc. The most important thing to note is that [b] ALL [/b] of them got downgraded one way or another.\n\nFirst of all are the levels. They are much smaller compared to previous game and a lot of them are hub areas that leads to other smaller locations. The problem is there are a lot of loading screens between areas regadless of their size which can make traversal really annoying especially if you end up backtracking a lot. \nThe common usage of vents makes the levels feel smaller than already are, although fortunately they aren't completely free as they are spider-bots that can drain some of your resources. (It isn't much but it's something at least compared to implementation of vents in the next instalment) The ways you can enter certain area are the same with the exception of locks getting removed while giving multi-tools same function. \n\nThe combat is possibly one of the biggest victims of the streamlining process. The locational limb damage got replaced with a health bar, headshots still deal increased damage however after the introduction of spongy armored dudes your guns can feel very weak as they can withstand multiple headshots and rockets, fortunately they aren't very common so it's not that bad. \nThe inventory management is gone instead you have certain amount of slots to fill, on the flip side you can carry multiple type of the same weapon whenever it's the pistols or rocket launchers as each gun can have up to 2 attachments each, the system wasn't that well implements though as the attachments range from somewhat useful to mostly pointless. \nAs a positive however, I can say that some of the non-meele weapons has additional functions for example: pistol has build-in flashlight and rail guns has emp blast as alternative fire etc.\nThe stealth related weapons and meele got nerfed, the boltcaster which is essentially a crossbow cannot take down with a single shot and due to absence of locational limb damage, the meele weapons end up being very clunky and ineffective compared to the rest. \nLastly, the ammo is shared between every weapon while it isn't bad by itself, most enemies you will fight are grunts that always drop ammo which makes fight much less punishing than it was in the original Deus Ex.\n\nThe last thing is the upgrade system.  Skills and augmentations get merged into singular system as just augmentations. The canisters now can be used to both acquire and upgrade your augmentations. There a is twist however as they are two types of canisters to get: normal and black market which each give you access to different type of skills that can be passive (Like hacking) or active. (Like cloaking) Unlike in original, you can swap between your augmentations on each slot but at the price of wasting the canisters that were already used as you lose the skill regardless of the level of the previous skill. \n\n[h1][b] Part 2: Story [/b][/h1]\n\nFor anyone how played the original you probably asked: \"Okay, which ending is canon?\" The common answer is all of them at once but that's not exactly true. In short, [spoiler] Helios Ending [/spoiler] is canon but the other two are the side effects of making that decision.\n\nThe best way to describe Invisible War's plot is it's like reading a summary of 500 page book, all the important moments are there but with lack of details. Which is a shame because the core of the story is really good but it's dragged down by the rest of the elements being subpar at best.\nThe protagonist barely has any personality as the game doesn't give him any opportunities to add any depth to the character. That also stretches to important NPC's that aren't returning characters from the previous game.\nThe factions despite having big role in the plot besides [spoiler] JC Denton's faction [/spoiler], they never get properly fleshed out which is a result of speedrunning all story beats without looking back.\n\nIf there something I can give an earnest praise, it's the worldbuilding. The devs did a great job at establishing more sci-fi elements while remaining grounded in reality which makes sense as it's been 20 years since the last game.\n\n[h1][b] The Conclusion[/b][/h1]\nDeus Ex: Invisible War is a considerable downgrade from the original while still retaining it's core elements. So why I recommend it despite it's numerous flaws? \nIf you are interested how the story continues from the previous game, it does a good enough job at going into new direction and gameplay can bring a joy time to time. I would recommend to not have much expectations and try it out for like an hour and see whenever you enjoy it or not, so that you can refund in case of the latter.\n\nAs for the rating I would say it's [spoiler] 5/10 [/spoiler]\nI hope this review gave you some idea on whenever the game is for you or not.

Thanks to the fanbase every problem has a solution, sometimes you just gotta look harder.

You might need to open the dropdown menu\n-Choose the unresponsive process and right click, choose \"Go to details\"\n-Right click on the unresponsive process again and choose \"Analyze wait chain\"\n-You'll now see what was causing the black screen. Either disable it from your pc for a while or just kill it from the window you're seeing. In my case it was RadeonSoftware.\n-Voila, enjoy the game!\n\nAnd for the review...\nIW is much shorter than DX, around 10 hours on my final save. Longer with all those experiments and reloads tho.\nSmaller maps sucks. Every time you switch a map the game shuts down itself and reopens with the new map. However this is not a concern since any decent PC can load a 64mb map in like 5 seconds. You should disable steam stuff so your friends won't get a notification every 15 minutes.\nThe gameplay is simplified, easier and kinda forces you for combat. Stealth is pretty hard if you don't build for it IMO.\nHowever the new combat is good, much better than DX. Universal ammo is cool, same with the new biomod system. You don't spend time organizing your inventory since they don't use slots.\nThe hub worlds are pretty cool and realistic.\nYou can side with factions earlier. There seems to be more choices and results this time.\nThe story didn't unfolded the way I wanted but it was still pretty good.

The physics are really clunky, the HUD and the inventory system are godawful. It's easiest the play the run and gun type of character over anything else, but the late game enemies are bulletsponges.\n\nNow to the pros, the exploration is sometimes intriguing and the environments can be neat. The sidequests with the two coffee bar chains competing are funny. It has a great atmosphere, however for that aspect Thief 3 is a much better choice. The plot takes into consideration all of the endings of the original game, making them all canon. In DS:IW there are a total of four different endings to choose from and all of them are outlandish. If playing this as a typical shooter game, it starts out really difficult, whereas mid-game you're fucking everyone up and the late game turns tedious. \n\nRecommended play for the fans of \"immersive sims\" and FPS games.", "timestamp_created": 1697823401, "timestamp_updated": 1697823401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148510526": {"recommendationid": "148510526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129113524", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 985, "last_played": 1697752374}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, it's essentially the original Deus Ex simplified in several respects - universal ammo, no levelling up, only a handful of biomod slots, no inventory management, and much smaller loading zones. \n\nAnd yet, I still couldn't wait to replay this game after so long, having only previously played it on the Xbox many years ago. It's still a purely enjoyable game if you meet it on its own terms. Sneaking through enemy-infested levels while crouching and using the Cloak power-up was my favourite method of progress. You'll also like the many different paths available to complete each mission, and exploring the streets of Trier was nice.\n\nNegatives? I get the impression that Ion Storm tried to cram too much story in a much smaller and shorter game than the first one, and I found it easy to lose some of the strands relating to all the different clans and their leaders. And there are lots of technical issues with this Steam version. On my previous computer I was unable to run it completely, and on this one it's prone to crashing and failing to load anything apart from a black screen, which required a restart. A hint: don't load the most recent save upon starting the game - use the second from first instead. \n\nIn the first hub area - Seattle - the game throws so many objectives at you that I sunk about 3-4 hours in that city alone, at first giving the impression that Invisible War will be a time sink. Not so - you can finish the game and see all of its endings in around 15-20 hours.

It essentially is a watered down deus ex 1, with many similarities to human revolution's problems. That makes it really hard to play for people who liked either of those games, since it is essentially Human Revolution 0.5. \n\nHowever I think that any deus ex enthusiast should take the time to play and learn Invisible War, since the content and story and world can be really intriguing to anyone who was interested with the first game's. But of course it has its flaws in its execution. Spoilers ahead:\n\nStory Spoilers:\nIn Invisible war, every single ending in deus ex 1 applies.\nYeah its confusing. JC managed to merge with helios, restore the illuminate, and shut down global communications.\nFrom a world standpoint, the world is changed in ways that should have depended on what endings you would have gotten. \nFor example, if you got the Helios ending, the world should have been more prosperous and controlled by a singular being. However, since in IW, JC also shut off the aquinas router, he wasn't able to bring peace to the world with helios. You see how they're clashing? It leaves a bad taste in anyone's mouth. \n(I'm getting tired iterating this point so lets move on)\n\nGameplay Spoilers:\nAmmo is universal across all your guns\nthere are no skills\naugs and their progression have been simplified\nThats basically all the huge stuff\nYou'll also feel that enemies are either really squishy or absolute tanks\nThere are a few things i did like, such as the emp black market aug, which at its first rank game you more melee damage against robots, but then you could use it to temporarily change the robot's alliance to fight for you. With enhanced melee strength, this was a really good combo.

Yes.\nIs it by all accounts, a terrible game? Not exactly.\n\nI still enjoy it, I played with the [url=https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=147423]Visible Upgrade [/url] mod installed, my laptop has zero issues handling it but it occasionally has bugs that are not game-breaking. But you can tell it's a visible downgrade from the first game as soon as you started playing. Unfortunately, consoles suck so the game opens and closes itself for loading screens to prevent memory leaks.\n\nUniversal ammo? Permanent HUD? Simplified skill progression? Constant loading? Bad writing? Boring level design with awful backtracking? Flying 5 feet in the air because you're trying to jump into a vent?\n\nThere is no character development, so you don't feel convinced by their rhetoric to pick a side. The obsession with coffee shops in this game is weird (I know its foreshadowing but still). Your dialogue choices are binary, how you approach a level does not have any repercussion because DX loves its choose-your-ending-because-your-allegiances-don't-matter story beats. The wonky bouncy physics threw me off because it's almost impossible to mantle or climb in a vent properly.\n\nShit could've made anyone drop this game but I love immersive sims too much to do that. It's still very much Ion Storm DNA in this game. The transhumanist/cyberpunk/conspiracy themes, the atmosphere, attention to details you love are still there. Some builds are fun and absolutely broken you could breeze through the whole level.\n\nDXIW is mid, it's not garbage, it's an okay sequel that was dumbed down for consoles and sandwiched between acclaimed titles in the series.

Obviamente a nivel gr\u00e1fico ha mejorado aunque por alguna razon el protagonista tiene un peor modelado que el resto de personajes (nuestros ojos no tienen parpados xd). El inventario se ha simplificado y diria que a mejor (una ranura por objeto). La comida AHORA ES UTIL: no solo cura de forma decente sino que encima puedes stackear casi cualquier tipo de comida en 1 slot. Los mods de armas y habilidades tienen su inventario aparte. Si te dan un c\u00f3digo, tu pj lo aprende para cuando actives el panel correspondiente (evitando pasar por varios men\u00fas y aprender claves y contrase\u00f1as en el proceso o ir apuntandolos en papel o en el movil). En general los men\u00fas son bastante mejores que en el primer Deus Ex.\n\nY ahora lo malo:\nAl igual que el primero, este tiene un par de problemas que tienes que arreglar con mods de la comunidad (entre esos problemas que no est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol y la resoluci\u00f3n). Le\u00ed que a algunas personas les crasheaba mucho, aunque a mi no me dio ningun problema nunca. \nLos mapas se han reducido DEMASIADO comparado con Deus Ex 1, hasta el punto de ser pasillos entre peque\u00f1as zonas, lo que causa que cada 2 minutos te tengas que comer una pantalla de carga (no exagerar\u00eda si digo que 30-60 minutos de mi tiempo jugado son pantallas de carga). Que sean mapas tan peque\u00f1os tambien castiga a la hora de tomar tus rutas y las opciones en el juego, por lo que se vuelve extremadamente lineal. Un poco igual que en el anterior, da igual lo que hagas a lo largo del juego, lo unico importante es la decision del final.\nTeniendo en cuenta que es un juego de rol, que tu decision del juego anterior sea irrelevante para este tambien me chirr\u00eda un poco, porque hace que solo haya un final \"can\u00f3nico\" en el primer deus ex que es el que enlaza con IW.\n\nLo de que se hayan quitado las \"aptitudes\" del primero no se si calificarlo como algo bueno o malo, porque con el primero yo no notaba demasiada diferencia al subir cada arbol quitando la pirateria y abrir cerraduras (que aqui se ha simplificado y todo se abre con la misma herramienta)\n\nEst\u00e1 tirado de precio a dia de hoy y me parece una experiencia mucho mas disfrutable que el primer Deus Ex.

There is also a staggering amount of long loading screens between these which absolutely kill any semblance of flow and NPC's will also frequently interrupt gameplay. Characters also look quite cartoony and the voice acting is quite frankly horrendous from most key characters. A stark contrast from what the original game offered from varied locations to its vast cast. \n\nElements like Augmentations and the inventory system have been dumbed-down spectacularly and are all condensed into this hideous looking HUD made for controllers. Ammo is universal and things like multi-tools and lockpicks are fused into one. Skills have also been removed so what you are left with is a basic character who can activate augs and that's about it.

IW's engine does have some nice lighting that is quite reminiscent of Doom 3's lighting - but the actual art style of the in-game assets and the world overall feels completely out of sync with what the world's plot would imply.\n\nThis is further exacerbated by the aforementioned simplified and shrunk down map design, as factions that are mortally at odds with each other will stand around 12 feet apart from each other like they're tending to kiosk booths at a convention (in one of the maps this is literally canonically the case mind you) - this physical proximity between everything and everyone really removes any sense of scale or gravity to what is happening in the plot.   \n\nThere's also an abundance of loading screens and map loads everywhere, given the console limitations: this is extremely detrimental to pacing and is related to a lot of crashes and technical issues.\n\nOverall this game is quite a pity, even more so when taking into account that this is the culmination of the Deus Ex storyline and all other games have been prequels.

Visible War reads the game's Steamapp files but is a distinct application, so while it looks like I only played for an hour I played for an hour unmodded before hitting an impassible bug then switched to the modded version. This mod is a QOL mod that's mostly there to get the game running properly on modern hardware, and doesn't impact gameplay. I played on the second-highest difficulty and completed the game.\n\nWith that out of the way...\n\n\"Boring\" and \"frustrating\" are the keywords when talking about Invisible War. The game is boring, because while on the surface it replicates the stealth-immersive sim gameplay of its predecessor, its simplified mechanics and massive amounts of loot it showers you with means that you rarely have to make meaningful decisions or sacrifices. In the original Deus Ex, gameplay frequently involved tradeoffs. You could never max out every skill (without abusing glitches). You couldn't max out every augmentation. You could never open every container (again, without abusing glitches). You couldn't cheese your way through the entire game with only one gun, because there wasn't enough ammo to do that. Invisible War does away with these tradeoffs. These is no skill tree in Invisible War. You can easily max out your biomods around halfway through the game. There are more than enough multitools and passwords to open every locked door and container in the game. The unified ammo system lets you use one gun the entire game, if you want to. Removing the cost behind decisions devalues the significance of making the choice in the first place. Invisible war does give you choices of who to work with, but for 90% of the game these are false choices, because [spoiler]both major factions you're choosing between are just different branches of the illuminati[/spoiler].\n\nThe frustrating aspects of the game are largely confined to its story. Deus Ex speculated on the near-future and commented on the contemporary world, and in doing so predicted the global war on terror and its consequences (and I'm not just talking about a NY skybox without the Twin Towers). The developers, making a game after 9/11/2001, had a chance to build on that foundation and create a game with something meaningful to say about that contemporary sociopolitical climate. America and the rest of the world are still dealing with the consequences of the war on terror, so even a commentary on the 2003 political climate could have been relevant today, two decades later. Instead, they made something with negligible sociopolitical value, focusing on transhumanist pipe dreams that ignored the actual issues around real-world transhumanism. For example, while the plot does indirectly deal with the issue of informed consent to modification, the topic is only really brought up on a global level rather than an individual level, and the issue of access to modification is ignored entirely. On top of that, the characters are largely one-dimensional and/or lacking in any ideological consistency. \n\nThe game isn't beyond salvaging. There's some enjoyable sections in the midgame with some interesting combats and branching paths before the plot goes completely off the rails, and the biomods and weapons are at least fun to play around with. Spiderbombs are pretty mediocre, but are the coolest thing in the game, earning a special shoutout. Invisible War also gets some points back from having the funniest solution to making a sequel for a game with multiple endings, which is \"all of the endings happened simultaneously.\" Also, while the ending itself is poorly foreshadowed and framed, having an ending where you [spoiler]destroy every major faction, kill almost every named NPC, and doom most of the world's population to death by climate change just to get a discount on black market weapons and biomods[/spoiler] is also very goofy, and feels cathartic if you got to the last segment and felt like rebelling against the game's story.\n\nDespite possibly qualifying for a refund because I only used the unmodded game for an hour, I'm not going to refund the game. I bought it on sale for a dollar, and I feel like I got my money's worth of entertainment, even if I had to install mods to make it playable at all on my computer. I guess if you really liked Deus Ex, then you might consider waiting for a 90% off sale, but I can't endorse spending any real amount of money on this game.", "timestamp_created": 1688798223, "timestamp_updated": 1688798223, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141564983": {"recommendationid": "141564983", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989692927", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1689056033}, "language": "english", "review": "What an absolutely shoddy port of an already shoddy original game on the first Xbox.\nThe game itself is fine, from a design standpoint, but the optimization on every platform is nothing short of horrendible all-around.", "timestamp_created": 1688779748, "timestamp_updated": 1688779748, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141523103": {"recommendationid": "141523103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080420228", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1562560890}, "language": "english", "review": "bad", "timestamp_created": 1688736791, "timestamp_updated": 1688736791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411676645278930664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141494886": {"recommendationid": "141494886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071436886", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 735, "last_played": 1688698797}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is definitely overshadowed by the first Deus Ex but otherwise has a really undeserved reputation.

Many people brushed this game off as a dumbed down consolized sequel and its exactly what it is, the game cut off several interesting mechanics of the first game, especially the skills/rpg part of it, say what you want to say about the prequels but they still have many more rpg elements than this crap. The story and characters especially the way they were talking in the first missions really put me off, after the amazing quality of the dialog in the previous game and its engaging characters, in invisible war the characters talks like some dumb teenager or an emotionless bland character, the initial setup of the game story felt so forced and stupid and the gameplay, the shooting feels really weightless and bland and with universal ammo the whole gunplay aspect of the game feels more like an afterthought, it just doesnt feel good to shoot things with those crappy weapons all using the same ammo, the new augment system is ok, it isnt the worst thing it has going on for it but the removal of several other stuff that made the game more immersive like you know looting stuff and sorting properly your inventory, being able to acess computer interfaces and hack stuff or even type codes on a door, here you just press buttons with zero immersion. There were many ways a sequel could improve the previous one, especially in the gameplay department and this one just blows at it, nothing here feels improved besides graphics, from story to gameplay, everything feels worse, it doesnt even feel like a Deus Ex game, the whole feel of the game and amostphere reminds me of some random generic scifi game that could be released exclusive on consoles of the ps2 era at bargain bin, the soundtrack is good at least but thats the only positive I have to say about this game.\n\nTheres a reason that the franchise disappeared after this one and why its reception is so negative, this game has nothing to do with Deus Ex and it feels offputting how they decided to continue the franchise after the immense success of the first in this way, even if you put the name aside and ignore its a Deus Ex game it doesnt feel its a game worth playing, the previous game is an aged old game that is worth coming back or giving a chance because it offers something unique that no other game has replicated, this one which is also already an old game, has just nothing going on for it, nothing to offer, no qualities, its just a very skippable game that deserves to be forgotten and ignored, it makes me think what kind of shit people from Ion Storm were eating when they decided to design a sequel to one of the best pc games ever made, even the consolization excuse doesn't justify it when they managed to port the original one to ps2, this game just blows, so, don't even think of wasting your time with it.", "timestamp_created": 1688483515, "timestamp_updated": 1691249968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493975907564163208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141093993": {"recommendationid": "141093993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184720801", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1688260047}, "language": "english", "review": "This game bricks my whole fuckin pc at the very beginning.

However, it is important to note that, in terms of gameplay, it is considered one of the weakest in the Deus Ex franchise. The game has significantly simplified the character upgrade system and unified the weapons, making them all share the same type of ammunition. Furthermore, compared to the first game in the series, there is a significantly smaller variety of available weapons.\n\nRegarding the level design, the game has also undergone simplifications in this aspect, featuring smaller scenarios and loading areas between them. These limitations restrict the options for completing objectives, resulting in a nearly linear gameplay experience.\n\nWhile the dialogues are interesting, they don't reach the same level as the first game in the franchise. In relation to that, there are only a few key moments of choice during the game. Only in the final phase are four ending options presented.\n\nOverall, it is a rather weak continuation, and if it weren't for The Fall, this would be the weakest game in the franchise. As a result, I only completed the game because I enjoy the universe, but I wouldn't play it again for further exploration.

It's considered one of if not the best video game of all time, to many people everything pales in comparison. So, to me, people seem kind of harsh to DXIW, played in isolation with only having absorbed information of DX1 through osmosis and seeing reviews of it and all the other games it's influenced, I found DXIW a wonderful game that has made me more excited to try out DX1 soon. \nI've put off playing DX1 because it seems intimidating, wouldn't be the first time people hype some game up to such degree that it becomes almost off-putting and I become uncertain if I'm in the right mood.\n\nBut hey, I loved DXIW, I'd put this up there with my top 100 games of all time (I have a lot of favorites ok? Hard to pick any one game), so if DX1 is actually more of this and somehow better, then I'm all for it, but that doesn't make DXIW imo bad.\n\nI was a massive fan of the aesthetic, as someone who more fondly remembers the graphical leap in the early 2000's with Halo, Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Chronicles of Ridd:ck, Far Cry, Quake 4, Prey, SCCT & FEAR, this one has those cool dynamic stencil shadows & lighting with normal mapping that looks pretty great, a lot of areas in the game still look wonderful with atmospheric lighting & art.\nThe imsim stuff was still fun, sneaking, having lighting conditions slightly influence your visibility, though nowhere near Thief/Splinter Cell levels, you'll want the Cloak biomod to go completely invisible, & sound playing a role, a lot of dynamic factions & infighting with decent AI, you have a ton of different lethal and nonlethal weapons, gadgets & biomods available.\nWhat was fun was how as a lite RPG with more imsim elements your actions speak louder than words, unlike so many RPGs these days, in DXIW talking is secondary to what you do, roleplaying isn't just picking red or blue or grey conversation options, it's you looking at situations, deciding if you even want to complete a \"primary goal\" or do you want to snoop around and see what other options might present themselves if you pay attention and investigate actively more the environment, a lot of your \"quest givers\" only share their side and what they want you to know, you need to go out and find out if they are speaking the truth, or if there's more to the story.\n(I'm sure DX1 already did this and better, not disputing that, just saying DXIW is a fun game by itself.)\nA lot of characters had depth to them, I can't really say some were purely good or evil, though the game also avoids falling into the usual \"everyone is awful and you'll feel bad regardless of what you accomplish\" trope some edgy RPGs end up doing to try and appear mature. I had some minor philosophical quibbles here and there but nothing massive, this is overall a relatively mature and insightful game tackling more complex subjects than you usually see (not just a \"racism bad\" focus like has been in many games trying similar things, it's an aspect in the game, but only one) and I applaud that, a bit clunky here and there but not really in a way where it detracts, it's not like the subject matter is simple and easy to resolve either.\nAlso a fan of how it didn't feel like the game was punishing me really for any actions (looking at you Dishonored & Metro), you can be a total pacifist and that's great & to some degree encouraged, killing isn't a massive game ender or locking you into only the scolding ending, it seems you actually kind of have to actively work towards an apocalyptic ending, which is kind of cool that it exists.\n\nWhat was clear though when playing DXIW was that some limitations were still apparent, a LOT of loading screens being the main one. They are luckily on modern hardware relatively short, but a lot of areas have been chopped to smaller chunks to still try and retain in each area you visit as much variety and options as was possible at the time, which did feel like a decent amount. \nThe Inventory too felt a bit consoly, it functions, you can still click around with your mouse, it's not like a poor console port where you'd be forced to only scroll through it or something, but man I prefer grid-based inventories instead of just having slots.\nAnd it did have some awkward collision with the physics and geometry, which could make some jumping/platforming clunky on occasion, and you could see AI also at times struggling with some geometry, making it appear dumber than it would otherwise be (compared to the vast majority of games out there).\nAnimation quality of course is no \"last of us\" since this is an early 2000's game & don't expect the voice acting to be big budget hollywood either (the same is probably true of DX1 as well) but I felt the game did a good job with its presentation and direction, I was engaged talking and listening to NPCs and following the plot, many characters might come off initially off-putting or awkward, but that seems almost purposeful at times given their character arcs that they go through over the course of the plot.\n\nAnyway, I'll say some stuff about technical aspects.\nhttps://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Invisible_War\nhttps://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk/releases\nI played with the Visible Upgrade, simple installation. Applied the 4GB Large Address Aware patch to the executables to improve stability, & I added the newly released Vulkan wrapper for DirectX8, by AplyneDreams on github, called d8vk, I've had success in the past with DXVK to improve stability & compatibility with old games on modern OS's and hardware, and it too seemed to work here, I had 0 crashes or visual bugs or anything, I locked my FPS to 60 & it stayed there.\n\nToo much for many who want a game to work out of the box I'm sure, and to them yes, I wouldn't recommend this? I've been a PC player/modder for 20+ years so for me all of this were just standard vanilla minor stuff I'm used to tweaking to make sure older unsupported games would run smoothly.\n\nDXIW might not live up to DX1 (not here to argue that), but as someone who's only played DX Human Revolution a bit before now trying DXIW as an experiment, it's still on its own a really solid light RPG/imsim which still makes it massively better than 80% of games released to this day, I kind of feel that it's harsh to just completely dismiss this, the devs clearly cared about the project, it's not just a half-baked prototype completely blasted to be a simple linear stealth shooter for the console audience.\n\nLike I said, release this today under different names, remove most loading screens & make it stable on modern machines natively without tinkering, and I think it would be a mad world if still people would somehow all vote this as being \"mixed\" at best like it's currently on steam. Then I question why Deus Ex Human Revolution and many other games deserve very positive aggregates if this would today be anything less than \"Very Positive\".", "timestamp_created": 1685260414, "timestamp_updated": 1685260414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748270988464355469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139103309": {"recommendationid": "139103309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022633906", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1516088505}, "language": "english", "review": "rented this for the xbox 19 years ago and liked it. \nbought it for the pc whenever i bought it and it held up its dorky charm.\ni have no idea whats going on.\npretend its not deus ex and its fun.", "timestamp_created": 1685213448, "timestamp_updated": 1685213448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138910889": {"recommendationid": "138910889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089038327", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1684939996}, "language": "english", "review": "What an underwhelming sequel. \n\n- Shallow story that retcons the previous game\n- Dull characters\n- Basic, barely functional stealth mechanics\n- Basic, barely functional shooting mechanics\n- Stripped back character progression\n- Claustrophobic, uninspired level-design \n- Too many loading screens, each of which seems to open a new window\n- Frustratingly clunky UI\n+ The visuals are better than the previous game\n\nIt's fine to kill a few hours, especially as it is cheap.

And i have to say, really not as bad as the steam reviews might lead you to believe!\nIt certainly has its problems, and many annoyances, but without a doubt i enjoyed my time with this game, and i also appreciated the throwback to the original deus ex at some point in the story. Still no Jaime! sadface.\n\nStarting with the good things, the combat is pretty good, and so is the stealth. I pretty much immediately picked up fully upgraded silent foot though so i can't say what it is like without it. Talking about \"silent foot\" (It's 100% not called that in the game) I am very happy with the variety of mods and customisation. There are 2 different types of mod canisters and one is supposed to be unofficial, and unpredictable! Sadly they did not explore this at all. They are the most powerful but i really was hesitant originally to use unofficial canisters as i was concerned on what it might do negatively to me - it did nothing. Oh well!\n\nThis is controversial, but i also fully appreciate the all-in-one ammo. It canonically makes sense and although i was confused to begin with (I thought all the ammo i was picking up was for the pistol) I later realized and honestly i am happy with it, it makes sense to be there. I understand that many dislike it but at the very least it makes sense in the world of Deus Ex.\n\nAnother thing they did, which i didn't like as much (Especially as canonically its fluky) but it did make things simpler, is to streamline the lockpick and bypass tools into just a multi-tool. Yes it does make the game simpler, but i don't think that is a problem in this department, though it is somewhat immersion breaking to convince yourself that every single door uses an electronic lock so the digital tool can bypass it, but it is canonically on base.\n\nThe story had good pacing and there was plenty of bonus things to do that reward you for doing them. A lot of them don't really have consequences but some do and reward you well, and others just offer immersion, and help you feel like there is a world and not just 1 main objective.\n\nCombined with the mod choice, i also think the enemy variety and weapons are nice. Later in the story there is most definitely a difficulty curve as some enemies are in stronger gear and some weapons you may use (Specifically, i would knock people unconscious in my playthroughs) will be become entirely ineffective, whilst other weapons you have been sitting on would become more viable.\n\nOnto the negatives.. \n\nI'll disregard any lack of resolution support, and anything else similar as you must consider that this is an early 2000s game. There are community patches which you can download at your discretion, but i personally did not use this. The only modification i made to the game was to download dgVoodoo to make my frame limiter work. (Without a doubt you will need to limit your frames in this game to have any semblance of it running correctly). The maximum resolution that the game can handle was fine on my 1920x1080 monitor.\n\nThe first thing that i absolutely hate with a passion in this game is how they implemented zone changing. In most games you'd expect a little sound, fade to black and then a loading screen. Not in this game. In this game, the game application exits, an Ion Launcher application starts, then the Ion Launcher exits and another application launches and then you get a loading screen. It completely sucks, and to make it worse around 2/5's of the time ion launcher will just fail to launch the new application. I once waited like 2 minutes to see if perhaps i just needed to give it time. No, it'll just come up with a popup saying timed out and then close itself. To make this worse, the zones are inconsistent in size so you'll sometimes find yourself going through zones quickly and consecutively, and each time, risking what can only be described as soft crashing.\n\nAnother thing that is really weird is the 2 factions in the game. One is supposed to be traditional government, hogging power and trying to control everything, and the other is supposed to be about freedom of self, charity, selflessness and for the people. The government-like faction behaves precisely as you expect, and the other one does until they interact with the player. There approach to everything seems to be \"kill this person for me\". There is a character who worked on a project that didn't even want to work on the project who was the head of it, and the non-government faction asks you to solve the issue of their creation by killing them. They will just be replaced! Why not destroy the plans, or try a different approach? The entire functioning of that faction is in complete contrast to what they are supposed to represent, so i found myself going with the other faction quite often just on a moral basis. This could have been an intentional choice to deepen the greyness of morality between the factions despite their viewpoints, with their not being a clear light and darkness, but it completely decredits the other faction and just makes them feel fake, and therefore as if not more corrupt than the government-like faction. Thankfully, throughout the entire game you're not really forced to completely devote yourself to one side, it's more like \"Hopefully you don't betray us again\".\nSome nitpicks. Using the stun prod, sometimes the enemies will break out of it and shoot you even as you continue to \"stun\" them, despite it being implemented in a way that you hold it down to stun for as long as you have the ammo for it.\n\nYou also have to be careful in cases where hostiles are near allies. Even if you hit them with a flash (Bare in mind they'll run around when the enemies shoot at you as they hear) They will not attack you, but will see you as hostile, blocking all dialogue options and them repeating that it is not safe.\n\nAnother nitpick for sure is F12 being unrebindable without messing with game files outside the game. I wanted to take screenshots as I always like to do but it was literally impossible using steam overlay, both because of the F12 issue and the way levels reloaded and steam overlay not rehooking to the new application.\n\nOverall, despite these issues it wasn\u2019t too difficult to play the game in its entirety, and considering the age of this game, I am very happy about how everything went.

This game certainly takes place after the first game but really lacks a lot of the depth that the first game brought with it. TLDR: get it on sale with all of the other games or get it bc you want to know what Ion Storm was intending to do with the first games plot. Or just buy it for around the 5$ price range. Otherwise you aren't missing much unless you are a super fan.\n\nWithout jumping deep into the story ill just be brief and say that it lacks the intrigue and depth that the original brought with it. While it develops on that game's story by making all three endings technically cannon the resulting mess that comes after is just not unraveled in a way that's well paced or well done. However i will admit that I did enjoy the endgame a fair bit when presented with the ultimate \"question\" of the game and found it to be rather interesting. Beyond that the gameplay is a straight downgrade with a universal ammo system that at the best of times makes the game more convenient and at the worst forces you to value ammo preservation towards the end of the game. Other than that the light RPG mechanics of levels and EXP are gone and as a result specialization is pretty much gone as well. Meaning this game has much less replay value and most of the variety comes from the weapons and biomods. While that would be okay alot of the higher tier weapons and bio canisters are practically thrown at you like candy. by the end of the game i had like 8 normal mods and 3 illegals left over after fully kitting myself out. This encourages you to really do what you want when you want like in a game like skyrim however I think it just dumbs the game down for the lowest common denominator. As for performance you'll need a mod to even run the game on windows 10 and good god are those loading times long even with an SSD. It makes doing the back and forth of turning in quests a total chore as most of the time is spent just loading. The environments and music tracks are all pretty much a flat downgrade IMO. Overall the game isnt bad per say just a bit of a disappointment if you loved the first Deus Ex, it feels like a lot of the complexity is lost in favor of attracting the most amount of people rather than appealing to what made it a great experience in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1682630842, "timestamp_updated": 1682630842, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137214675": {"recommendationid": "137214675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071359259", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1071, "last_played": 1682272308}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, the game is not bad, but it's definitely worse than the previous one.\nImho, the main issue is there's no experience/skill points system. That mean, when you finish a quest, the only reward you get is some money, and you know what? After approximately half of the game you don't need the money at all. So, there's no motivation to do side quests except for lore reasons, but you don't get enough lore either....\nThe developers decided to use the augmentation canisters instead of skill, but I don't think that's a good idea. First of all, there are a lot of canisters in this game - you'll get everything you want pretty soon. The second reason why I don't like the current system is the imbalance between augmentations. Some of them are extremely useful (for example, the one for hacking the computers), and the other ones are not that good.\nAnd, of course, the ammo. Of my God. Maybe the creators though that making the ammo suitable for all guns will help players to use their favorite weapons more often, but in the reality it's vice versa. If you depleted all your bullets with one gun, that means you can't use any of your weapons anymore! It becomes really annoying by the end of the game, when you have to fight some really durable enemies.\nThe endings are pretty lame - the videos are approximately 10 seconds long and after that you'll find yourself looking at the main menu.\nBut I recommend playing Deus Ex: Invisible War if you want to know how the story of Dentons ended.

This game isn't that bad.\nI just finished Invisible War and I was surprised with how much I enjoyed it, since I had heard all about how terrible it was and how it was \"one of the worst games ever.\" But it wasn't the worst game ever, not even close. It's actually a pretty decent game, not good, but decent. \nThe biggest problem, by far, is the gameplay. The game feels clunky to play, with crude, underdeveloped mechanics and bad controls that make it not fun to play. Making things worse is the level design which is cramped, uninspired and dull with repetitive areas and, for the most part, forgettable scenery. So I will admit, the moment to moment gameplay is definitely bad but what kept me going all the way through this game was the story. \nWhile not on the level of Deus Ex 1, Invisible War's story is actually quite compelling and, imo, unique. It has several very interesting ideas with mature, rarely explored themes that are very well handled. Most of the characters are not particularly memorable but some most certainly are, the AI version of NG Resonance is awesome, the pilot Ava Johnson is a fascinating character and the Omar (they're a hive mind sorta thing so I'm counting them as one character) were my favourite part of the game. The game is a very good continuation of Deus Ex 1 and continues the plot of that game in a fun and engaging way, I don't want to say more than that since...you know, spoilers and all.\nFinally, while not getting into them to once again avoid spoilers, I adore the endings to the game which are unlike anything you'd find in games today. Each ending is intriguing and morally complex and each of them left me both shocked and very interested. I'll fully admit that I'm still not sure which ending could be considered the \"good ending!\"\nIt's not too long, my playthrough took me just over 11 hours, and if you enjoyed Deus Ex 1, you really should play this as it wraps up the ending of that game quite nicely. While the gameplay isn't great, I've played worse and you can definitely push through it.\nSo yeah, I recommend you play it if you can give it cheap, even if it's only once.", "timestamp_created": 1681087355, "timestamp_updated": 1681087355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136346429": {"recommendationid": "136346429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075022903", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3102, "last_played": 1680983227}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1680961943, "timestamp_updated": 1680961943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465587049722671509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135657221": {"recommendationid": "135657221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133764443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1680130429}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game with many possibilities.

Hassle to set up for an ok game, doesn't work properly out of the box.\nFun but could be better. If you want more Deus Ex and have already played everything else, then it's an alright choice to play.[/b]\n\nFirst things first: To make this game a smooth experience, you need to google how to set up everything properly. Additional Software might be needed (Project Lasso for example), new launcher, deactivation of Steam and Nvidia Overlay etc. You'll find a good guide here on Steam (Read comments below the guides if the setup doesn't work). Otherwise it crashes on loading screens and can't set up the resolution for modern systems. But only if you don't optimize it via guides! After that it's a perfect game experience!\n\nThe Story is a Sequel to the Story of Deus Ex 1 (2000). If you haven't played that first, you will be confused about what's really going on, who the characters are etc. Play DE1, it's great.\n\nThis game is a heavily watered down Deus Ex. Only one type of Ammo for all weapons, lockpicks and multitools have been fused to one item. Skill System has been removed. Level design is much simpler, less options on how to approach the mission. In the tutorial you can already choose 3 out of 6 Biomods (Upgrades) which will make you unbeatable. Sneaking isn't as sneaky as it used to be. It feels more like an action shooter. Or a \"I'm using my stealth Biomods and run past everything\" game, which is not real stealth gameplay.\n\nIf you like a theme park styled game, where you pass everything with ease (even on hardest difficulty), then you'll quite like it. I prefered the gameplay of Deus Ex 1. But I still had my fair share of fun in this game! The story is interesting, the ragdoll physics are very fun. The characters are cool.\n\nYou can skip this game if the setting up is too much hassle for you, but if you want a quick fun game whith some Deus Ex elements, then this game suits that perfectly.

A lot of times, if a quest giver tells you to do X, you can still poke around and find an alternate solution or find a reason not to do it.  There are a bunch of factions/characters telling you conflicting info, so it is always up to you to decide what you want to do.  This is the sort of thing you'd not experience if you just rush through the game by following objectives.  Your choices matter, and the game reacts to them.  I think the side quests were very well done, even the simpler ones.\n\nWhile the smaller levels hurt the game somewhat (for stealth players), personally I don't think they are as bad as people say.  Buildings and rooms are in more realistic sizes than in the first game, and I think the environment looks very good with Visible Upgrade installed.  Exploration is rewarding, and crawling inside vents is a lot of fun.  I think the level design is actually very good in this game.  The soundtrack is excellent, and supports the atmosphere very well.  Worldbuilding and locations in this game are great.\n\nWhat did not work for me :\n\nI tend to play full stealth if a game allows me, but for this game, it didn't work out for me.  Enemy distances are not as much as in the 1st game because of the sizes of levels, and this makes it difficult to sneak.  Whacking enemies with a baton from behind for non-lethal takedown didn't work for me in this game.  I've defaulted to lethal way using a silenced pistol instead.\n\nBiomods are grouped in a very strange way that, you actually have to pick between Cloak and Hacking.  You get quite a few Biomod canisters very early on, so the progression is not really there.\n\nAmmo system is unified and weapons draw different amounts from the same pool.  For the entire time, I couldn't tell how many shots I had left in my equipped firearms.  If your rocket launcher uses up all your ammo pool, your pistol is out, too.\n\nLate game bullet sponge enemies with lots of firepower were not fun to go up against.  When combine that situation with the above 3 points, things can get quite frustrating. \n\nThe inventory slots are so few while there are lots of grenades and mines.  In the first game, the mines worked also as grenades, but here they are separate.  Lockpicks and multitools were combined into just multitools, but a bug causes the multitools to not stack properly and take up more slots than they should.  Medkits don't heal as much as they did in the first game.\n\nThe reticle design is ridiculous, lol.  I had to switch to Dot using the Visible Upgrade patch.\n\nI felt that the game was better in the first 70% or so, when truth and real goals weren't revealed yet.  The game felt a bit short.\n\nTechnical issues :\n\nThis game was built around the memory constraints of Xbox, and whenever it loads new contents, it starts a new process.  If you have another program which interferes with how this is handled, you'll get \"stuck in the black screen\" situation.  It took me a while to figure out which one was interfering on my particular system.\n\nAlso, since each load is a separate process, sometimes the game would not respond until I click once to focus on that process.  This also seems to prevent the Steam Input based controller support from working properly.  I prefer controller because of an issue with my left hand, but I had to play this with KB+M.\n\nConclusion :\n\nI enjoyed my time playing Invisible War, and I might actually do another playthrough siding with different factions.  I've listed what I thought was the \"negatives\", but I actually got used to how things worked in IW, and those ended up not being show stoppers for me.\n\nFor a long time, I kept wondering if I should play IW, but I am glad I finally gave it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1674994328, "timestamp_updated": 1675046425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630872488021850586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131624767": {"recommendationid": "131624767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997799367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 426, "last_played": 1674769992}, "language": "english", "review": "A game all about moral ambiguity and being open to many possible choices...executed in one of the most flawed ways of its era.

UI is a downgrade\u2026 hey, give it a chance.\nDifferent endings depending on your choices, as usual, that's good.\n\nBe sure to install the Visible Upgrade mod too!\nIt fixes the game for modern systems, there is also an optional HD pack, rather true to the original game in my opinion.\n\nMod link: https://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-2-visible-upgrade\nThere is also a Steam guide here with good tips to play the game in the best conditions, I advise you to read it, it's short: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2482215439\n\nTo finish: try it if you're into Deus Ex!\n\nEheh \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1674761516, "timestamp_updated": 1674761516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544478535652160645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131603003": {"recommendationid": "131603003", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968073802", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 172, "playtime_forever": 1219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1674756486}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh man! I finally finished this game in 2023. It's been on my desktop for years! (TLDR version down below)\n\nI started playing this game out gently some years ago, but barely an hour, and to be honest, I really lacked the interest to put it high on my priority list. The game is almost 20 years old, and it's ugly compared to the new games you can find, even from a decade after this was made. \n\nSo, obviously my reason for recommending this game is not because it looks beautiful, but simply because of all the tech stuff you get to try out, and gameplay wise this is working for me. However, this game is probably not far off from a thumbs down from me either, because even though the game has a rich story, different places to go, and alot of voice acting to enhance the story, I frankly think the game could be a bit boring sometimes.\n\nFor some reason I realised I was gonna kill as few people as possible, so I just made most people go to sleep. I also wanted the gameplay to go in a way I wanted it, so I saved and loaded a lot. Did I make someone pissed, that I shouldn't make pissed? LOAD! Did I feel my way of doing things was not what I wanted? LOAD! Did I take too much damage in a place where there was little margin for error? LOAD! \n\nI THREW A BRICK AT AN ANIMAL AND IT DIED!! LOADED!!!\n\nAnyway. I'm just gonna write a [b]TLDR[/b] version right now:\nYou are Alex D, and much like in the previous Deus Ex, you're able to augment yourself in a way to enhance your abilities. Along with powerful weapons and mods to help both you and your weapons get stronger, you dive into a story about violence, treachery and lies, but also ALOT of politics. The way game works is that you interract with different characters relevant to the story, and they will send you on a mission. You can ofc choose what missions you wanna do or not wanna do, sometimes for the reason that you wanna ally yourself with a faction. Sometimes you can do extra stuff, for extra credits (cash) too. [b]END OF TLDR.[/b]\n\nThere is alot of talk, and even though you can just skip everything, you might get a bit tired of it. I didn't skip anything as long as I had not heard it before. Anyway. As said before the game is old af, so I would just say that it's very tiring to play a game like this, with the graphics being not only outdated, but beyond outdated. Along with happends (the talk) and how the gameplay works, I wanted the game to be done, so I could play something else.\n\nI mean me recommending this game, means that I had fun right, but I just wanted the game to end. When it feels like you have to force yourself to play a game, it's different than if you're actually having fun. I played this game from where I last left off, around 1 hour into the game, but this time I played the game from start to end, and if you're really going for this game, do it like that, so you can get over to play some newer games. \n\nSo yes; I'll guess I'll recommend this game, but I won't play it ever again.

Invisible War tries to be what its predecessor was, an action fps game with rpg mechanics and decision making that has reaching consequences to your actions. It tries this, while at the same time fiddling with game mechanics in ways no one really asked for, with a story that misses the par set by its previous game. First I want to start with the positives: this game has some interesting augmentations. Personal EMP charge in your melee attacks? Passive augs that cost no energy? A drone aug that can essentially eat organic life and heal me? Yes, please! Some of the side missions and objectives have some interesting twists, or at least some amusing stuff you do like rigging a greasel match or dealing with the augmentation black market. Bodies ragdoll, and can be picked up and thrown to hide them or just mess around with them; sometimes to an absurd degree if you have the strength augmentation. Augmentation cannisters (both black market and regular) are quite generously laid about throughout the game making it quite easy to make your aug loadout compared to the first game.\n\nThe downsides of this game? Easily the biggest one is its universal ammo system. Its the future, so apparently every ranged weapon works off the same power source for ammo. Rockets, flamethrower fuel, rifle rounds, pistol bullets, tranquilizer darts, spitballs, foul language, everything is tied to this one energy bar you grab energy magazines to recharge. Enemies drop weapons and energy mags separate, meaning if you pick up their gun you just get a double of their gun and not the remaining ammo they had for you to scavenge, making it a headache sometimes when scouring the aftermath of a fight. Lets not forget too that if you run dry on one weapon...you're basically dry for all your guns as they all draw from the same ammo pool essentially. This is why I just about never used heavy weapons due to how much of a drain they put on all my other guns inadvertently. While we're on the subject of gear, the inventory system is kinda downgraded from the first game. You can only hold a set number of items as opposed to an inventory space which larger items took more room and smaller ones far less. Because of this, weapons and their size don't matter as well as other items you pick up like healing and bio-cells. Aug canisters each take as much space as a rocket launcher or a sword, and vice versa. The augmentation system itself, as much as some of those powers are fun, is kinda over simplified yet broken. In Deus Ex, you had about 9 slots for augs, and for just about all those slots you had multiple choices you could make for what you want installed. Invisible war offers only 5 slots for augs with three choices for each slot (one of those three being a black market aug). Augs are upgraded with just using more aug canisters on the existing aug you have installed. By midgame, I easily had all the augs I wanted fully maxed out and was still finding more canisters. You can change your installation choices too with just an aug canister, making configurations no longer permanent but it all seemed unnecessary. The skill system is gone from the first game, which took away that sense of progression and specialization that the first game had as you got better and better with equipment you preferred to use or improve on. All this is not even getting into the story, which honestly bored me for the most part; the only thing that kept me going was seeing how broken the combo of Strength Enhancement+Electrostatic Discharge was as I cold clocked bosses to sleep and turned enemy bots to my side with just a tap of a baton.\n\nI recommend passing on this game, while not an abysmal failure comparing it to its predecessor is like night and day.", "timestamp_created": 1674191349, "timestamp_updated": 1674191349, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667258918285369873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131074249": {"recommendationid": "131074249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023701983", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1674313295}, "language": "english", "review": "not as good as the first one especially that they over-simplified the character progression and why the firearms  shares the same ammo clip? but if you want more Deus Ex it is still worth it, just ensure to get the visible mod before playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1674027786, "timestamp_updated": 1674027786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130967500": {"recommendationid": "130967500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044437838", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1672958855}, "language": "english", "review": "This game may have a bad reputation, but I believe it's a worthy successor to the original.

You can still approach each situation in a wide variety of ways, you can still specialize your character to fit your own playstyle, and you still make impactful decisions that shape how the story progresses. In fact, this game has a much greater sense of choice than the first game, mainly due to the ability to choose which faction you decide to align with in every level. While Deus Ex 1 forced you to take orders from whoever the story dictated for that mission, Invisible war gives you several different sets of objectives to follow, each given by different factions vying for control of the world, and you have to decide who you want to side with.

Has a bad story and its gameplay is watered down from the first Deus Ex. If you're interested, buy it on sale, I got it for 97 cents.\n\nAbout 2.5 hours of my playtime was just set up, trying to get the game to run properly before I could actually begin the game. There is virtually no optimization on the game's side, you'll have to do everything yourself, even just to get it running in your monitor's resolution.\n\nThen after like a week (on/off) of trying fixing technical problems and installing performance mods, the game still crashes unexpectedly, causing me to lose progress. \n\nThe game itself has a horrible story. It wants you to choose between a few different factions to work for, but they're all incompetent and immoral in some way so I don't actually want to side with any of them. It doesn't start following up on plot threads from the first game until a few hours in as well, so you get thrown into this world and all I'm thinking is \"what happened to UNATCO, FEMA, the NSF, the Illuminati, silhouette?\"\n\nAll questions the game isn't interested in answering, instead it throws the WTO, The Order, and the Omar at you, all factions that didn't appear at all in the first game. It also made the horrible decision of making every one of the first game's endings canon to the story, which doesn't make sense because they're contradictory outcomes.\n\n(SPOILERS) I don't understand how JC could've simultaneously merged with Helios and destroyed Area 51 and have the Illuminati take over. My suspension of disbelief is already shattered with that even being the premise the rest of the plot is working off of. It also defeats the point of making you choose your ending in the first game to begin with. I also think, that if we're meant to believe that the Tracer Tong ending of DX1 happened, that it would take more than 20 years for the world to be as futuristic as it is in this game. A lot of locations look more Mass Effect than DX1, weirdly.\n\nPlot grievances aside, they neutered the game play of the first game. What they did with the inventory system is a crime. Even the prequel entries brought back the grid inventory. The universal ammo system dumbs down ammo management, and you may as well only use the pistol if you want to conserve on ammo because not only do your guns share the same mags, but the more damage the weapon does, the more that shared mag depletes. I was constantly out of ammo in the early levels because I was relying on the shotgun, not realizing all the guns share the same clip.\n\nEven with universal ammo being a thing, each gun could've had individual clips, that way if you take a shot with your sniper rifle, your pistol isn't out of ammo? I personally cannot stand this ammo system. I could be wrong on this, but melee weapons feel less effective than in the first game. I swear it takes like 8 wacks to take someone out now.\n\nThere's less specialization for your character compared to the first game. As far as I'm aware, there's not really a skill point system so you can't invest in like better lockpicking for example. Speaking of which, they combined multi-tools and lockpicks so anything that could be locked takes the same resource. Some people might find this convenient but I think it just removes another layer of complexity from the original's gameplay and gives you less options to handle situations with. At least you can still blow doors off their hinges.\n\nThere are moments where the game feels Deus Ex-ish and you start to get into it, but then either a crash, some bad dialogue, or just an unbelievable world building detail will just pull you out of the experience completely. The first game felt like once it got going, it was a cohesive experience. This game felt very start and stop in terms of my enjoyment.\n\nThe smaller maps are a double edged sword. On one hand, I enjoy the convenience of getting from point A to point B much faster, especially in the hub areas where you'll have to go around to the same places multiple times. On the other, exploration is completely uninteresting and the feeling the first game had that there was always a missable room or path just around the corner is gone. I honestly find the maps to be the least of this game's problems, though.\n\nNitpick complaints: Why did they rename Biocells to Energy Cells and Augmentations to Biomods? It's just annoying that they did this. The UI is uglier than the first game's and oddly feels more dated. Music is okay, suitably atmospheric but no real bangers like the DX1 soundtrack. Alex D's voice is very generic and bland compared to JC Denton's iconic voice. The guy from the opening cutscene is clearly the same voice as Walton Simons, I actually got confused and forgot for a moment that you kill him in the first game and was like \"wait, Walton Simons, is that you? You're a good guy now?\"\n\nI found it very hacky when a character literally said \"I'm fighting an invisible war here.\" Wreaks of \"You're alone, huh? Guess that makes you Han...Solo\" type writing. I only got the Cairo part of the game, but I'm still not sure why it's even called Invisible War. The war parts are very visible, the game starts with one of the US' major cities being destroyed. What is invisible about that? From the title, I assumed it would be a plot about hackers, espionage, maybe something involving cyberspace? You know, some kind of conflict that's invisible to the public but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "timestamp_created": 1671826435, "timestamp_updated": 1673224239, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129062924": {"recommendationid": "129062924", "author": {"steamid": "76561199055732095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1228, "last_played": 1671843366}, "language": "english", "review": "You can kill children in this game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1671762266, "timestamp_updated": 1671762266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611682295799255371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128704262": {"recommendationid": "128704262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017798474", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 766, "last_played": 1671712697}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a good game. you were spoiled back then. you didnt realize how good you had it as a gamer. im not going to say it is a masterpiece, but it is worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1671252708, "timestamp_updated": 1671252708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500709712505340576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128679076": {"recommendationid": "128679076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004113670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1657485703}, "language": "english", "review": "Unlike the other reviews what I'm going to do is show you how terrible this game is even if you purposefully forget it was the sequel to Deus Ex 1.  Nothing in my review will use the words \"like in the old game\", \"like in DX1\", etc.\n\nAn inventory menu with 10 slots... sounds like enough until you realize that your weapons take up a slot each.  Since you will need at least 4 and preferably 5 for weapons you will need, this is now cut in half.  But wait there's more!  You will most likely want to be always holding medkits and bio-recharge cells, so we're up to 7/10 slots now.  But wait there's more!  You will also have to be juggling story items too.  So within 30 minutes of the start of the game you will be dealing with 9/10 of your inventory slots constantly filled.  Forget about any comparison to DX1 because I've never played -ANY- kind of RPG/FPS-with-inventory-game/whatever in 25 years that is like this.  Oh but good news, you can stack items in inventory you already have.  What this ends up with is you feeling like a three year old going on an easter egg hunt when some character in game mentions in passing there is a copy of an item you already have, just so that you can validate the slot it takes up.  Frag grenades are useless but EMP grenades are extremely useful for getting past otherwise tough battle robots and indestructible cameras connected to gun turrets, and if you choose to keep them after you find them, congratulations that can be the final thing to bring you up to 10 out of 10 inventory slots filled at all times.\n\nThe augmentations are all mostly useless.  Resistance to poison?  You mean for the 5 enemies in the game that shoot it?  And for the 3 seconds that the poison is active, barely giving me enough time to remember I have the augmentation and then go activate it?  Thanks for thinking of me.  A strength augmentation so I can pick up uselessly heavy objects, which weren't blocking anything, and have no point to be picked up?  Thanks for thinking of me.\n\nWeapons all share the same ammo and ammo is virtually non existent in the game.  How non existent?  For a long time I thought weapons were one-shot deals.  The game likes to tease you and remind you of this every 5 seconds because each and every enemy you kill will drop a copy of a weapon you have, and an ammo magazine with, I kid you not, 1/100th of its capacity.  Shotgun and rifle shots take up pretty much an entire spare magazine with one shot, so that's 2 hours of conserving bits and pieces of ammo you found everywhere with one click.  Getting good with melee weapons is required in this game, and at least they give you the electric sword almost at the start of the game (which by the way, is an inventory slot).  Ammo magazines are the one thing that are not in your 10 inventory slots and they are stored elsewhere, so at least you have that!\n\nSee that?  No mention of DX1.\n\nIf you must play this game, there is a community patch so you can modify the FOV and also have big resolutions and also surround/eyefinity support.  Oh, and it fixes the other apparent legion of system crashing bugs as well.  Which again, other games from this time don't have, even without a patch.\n\nOne slight redeeming quality is the story is interesting and unique and that part of it at least feels like they answered questions from DX1 or made it feel like a complete story.  The game is trash even if you ignore it was a sequel to DX1 as hard as you can, so just go watch a longplay on youtube.  Do not play this game, if you are a fan of DX1 or not.\n\nMajority of people positively reviewing this game are \"i hAd iT wHeN i wAs a kiD\" or \"iTs sEeN aS bAd oNlY bEcAuSe oF DX1\".  Sorry, but no, this game is legitimately terrible, completely on its own.  Quite literally nobody on Earth plays this now unless they played another DX game and wanted to complete the series.  It's not say, big rigs scam tier, but it's not excusable especially since there is literally no other mainline DX game that is this level of \"instantly drop due to exceptionally glaring gamplay flaws\".\n\nWhy do they have Alex in the cover art holding the gun sideways like a gangster?

Having played DX1 and this one back-to-back, I think it's mostly the opposite. This game has better story (although geared even more towards adult audience), more thoughtful choices (there is even less good/bad than in original game, most of the time you are choosing subjectively the least evil), interface is easier to work with, music is way better. Gameplay-wise, the only bad thing about this game is universal ammo (what a dumb idea).\n\nWhy negative review then? Well, it has to do with the program itself. First, you need to install some patches to even be able load the game. Now, if you think you are prepared for it - think again. There are some patches that you can find links to in various guides, but none of them are a universal recipe that works for all systems. You have to spend an evening or more trying different things. Even if you succeed, every level of the game basically starts a new process in a new window(!), and there is a big chance that the previous processes won't be closed automatically (same happens if you reload from a save). Needless to say, loading always takes a long time. You might need to disable Steam overlay and uninstall programs like Overwolf and Geforce Experience.\n\nAnd the most important thing: this game broke my display settings! I don't understand why that happened and I don't know what exactly changed, but after I first switched from the full-screen version of this game to my desktop, my settings got messed up and I can't get my display look the same anymore.

However, Invisible War simply cannot be analyzed in a vacuum \u2013 it was developed in a shadow of the original Deus Ex which, as we now know, was one of the most inflation games ever made so it is safe to say that it had some big shoes to fill. Did it succeed? \n\nShort answer: No. Slightly longer answer: [i] [b] Absolutely fu*king no. [/b] [/i]\n\nAs mentioned above, on its own, IW can be seen as ever-so-slightly above average futuristic RPG that isn\u2019t very memorable, feels bland most of the time but has some interesting ideas and concepts. However, when compared directly to its predecessor, its flaws pop out like sore spot \u2013 virtually every aspect of the original has been dumbed down, simplified, and streamlined, and for worse. Reason? [i] [b] Consolification. [/b] [/i]\n\nIW was developed for consoles first and foremost, with the PC as an afterthought, and since consoles possessed only a fraction of PCs\u2019 performance, it could not handle things large open areas and also was not built for larger quantities of text on the screen, deeper, more complicated RPG systems from the first game (Augments, inventory management\u2026) and thus streamlined what it could, ending up with a shallow, washed-out version of the first Deus Ex. Now you are stuck with these [i] [b] \"amazing\" [/b] [/i] new additions as universal ammo, closed off and claustrophobic level design and inferior plot.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict? As I mentioned above, if you get Invisible War, you might enjoy yourself for a while, especially if you did not, for some peculiar reason, play the original game until you discover how shallow, uninteresting and forgettable it is. I say skip IW and move onto Human Revolution, you won\u2019t miss much.\n\n[b] [i] Positives [/i] [/b]\n\n+ Voice acting can be decent at times\n\n+ Some weapons feel better than in the original Deus Ex\n\n+ OST\n\n+ Level design, as bare-bones as it is, still retains some non-linear elements like access shafts and multiple routes to the destination, allowing for different way of approaching objectives\n\n+ Interesting story premise connecting IW with the first game\n\n[b] [i] Negatives [/i] [/b]\n\n- Disappointing storyline\n\n- Boring dialogues\n\n- Stripped-down level desing exchanging large, open areas for claustrophobic corridors with only a fraction of the personality of those from Deus Ex\n\n- Obnoxious UI design\n\n- Streamlined to seventh hell as a result of being consolified\n\n- Universal ammo system sucks b*lls\n\n- Less options and variety\n\n- Graphics have gone from \"dated but serviceable\" to downright ugly", "timestamp_created": 1664304669, "timestamp_updated": 1668516731, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168471813201904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122813746": {"recommendationid": "122813746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405005246", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 969, "last_played": 1658068749}, "language": "english", "review": "Good idea, disaster build", "timestamp_created": 1664116729, "timestamp_updated": 1664116729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518469095230102539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122674711": {"recommendationid": "122674711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967345935", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 876, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 718, "last_played": 1686467603}, "language": "english", "review": "I adore this game.

Perhaps 30ish hours is more accurate.  Just pointing that out.\n\nAnyway, if we're talking numbers, this is a solid 4.5 out of 10.  It's mid.  Total mid.\n\nLet's start with the good things:\n\nIf you think of this as a separate game from Deus Ex, it's actually quite enjoyable from a gameplay perspective.  You can get your biomods all set up before you even leave the first locality, Seattle, and from there you're set.  If you want to get to the nitty gritty of the gameplay, I'd like to say that stealth absolutely blows.  It's better to play this like you're spec ops, because nonlethal stealth is dogwater.  Once you stop caring and do a lethal stealth until you get caught approach, you're pretty much ballin.  I recommend the strength mod and throwing trash cans and crates at random people.  However, the UI is TERRIBLE, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe story is engaging enough to pay attention to, but the writing direction it took is dogwater.  Everyone feels stiff in the acting department and the character models have zero expression whatsoever - all they do is flap lips and wave hands.  At least the original Deus Ex had half decent voice acting despite having this same problem with the models.  Felt like the game had no real love it into it story wise and it shows.  No real emotional engagement, just pure \"yeah, kill this and do that for this reason\" type of stuff.\n\nThe .5 points I took off was simply because of technical issues that's more annoying than a turnoff.  This game will change your screen resolution on your computer proper, making you reset it back to your native res every.  Single.  Time.  On top of this, I can't change the hotkeys to activate my biomods, which even Human Revolution and the original allowed you to do.  Lastly, this game is a LOT of loading screens, though they don't take too long to load - the issue is that they're frequent.  The game rarely crashes, but when it does you're screwed out of an auto save, so save often just in case a crash DOES happen.\n\nThe jankiness of the game can be fun to play with, but overall it does limit your options.  You'll still have fun with it regardless, though it feels like an indie game more than a sequel to a critically acclaimed title.  Do I recommend the game?  I mean, sure, I had fun with it when I stopped caring about the nonlethal route and just went guns blazing.  I'm sure you will too.  Is it a good Deus Ex game?  Homie, if you're looking for that grit, just go back to the original or human revolution/mankind divided if the latter is good (haven't played MD).  This is a janky experience and it's mid.  Not everyone will like it, and if you don't like jank gameplay don't buy it.

It's not that the game is particularly awful in any of its aspects, but it never manages to do anything well and thus fails to compensate for its faults in any way that would make it worth your time to play.\n\nThe issues with gameplay are straightforward enough. The whole combat system is way oversimplified from the original. All skills were removed, all weapons use the exact same ammo, stealth has been nerfed to the point of being completely unviable (unless you use the invisibility skills available right from the start of the game, in which case stealth is ludicrously broken), and the level design was simplified to little more than confusing hallways that occasionally had vents connecting them. Honestly, this game doesn't even feel like an immersive sim anymore.\n\nThe story was similarly disappointing. None of the factions felt nearly as fleshed out as the original and relied much more on vague platitudes than any real nuance to their positions. I felt somewhat conflicted between the choices available in the first game, but in Invisible War I knew what my choice was going to be hours before I actually made it in-game because all of the alternatives were just blatantly awful. Looking back at it, the original's structure worked pretty well. [spoiler] You have one side that's more unambiguously bad (Bob Page) which you have no choice but to stop, but there are several different arguments for how to do so (Illuminati, Helios, and Tracer Tong). Any of these three have enough pros and cons that I could see why someone would consider them the best option.[/spoiler] For Invisible War, the choice is a lot clearer. [spoiler] Siding with JC is easily the best option here. The Templars are just luddite wackjobs with a penchant for cruelty, the Omar get practically no real development in their broader motivations, and the motives of the Illuminati aren't compelling when its JC they're up against rather than Bob Page.

[/b]\nSomething easily gleamed from videos/screenshots is the amazing art direction and lighting. Honestly i think the lighting in invisible war is more appealing to me than most modern games by a landslide. The art direction leans way more into Sci-Fi than the previous game, which is a double edged sword, it makes things look either way cooler, or way dumber, and it varies from person to person. the biggest offender to all of this is how characters look, between Alex Dentons hairline, eyes that look either glued on or on crack, or some characters not getting shades like they deserve, one of the best aspects of the older game, the characters, feel like a step down, which leeds into the next section\n\n[b] The Story: oh dear god i have to talk about this help me [/b]\nso... just gonna put this in the spoiler tags.\n[spoiler] This is the big thing people criticize the game for, and for mostly good reason. there are plenty of videos that go into all its fault, so i may or may not repeat things others have said. the biggest problem with the story, beyond the pacing in that regard, is its lack of focus on characters and individual philosophies. what made deus ex 1 so good was that towards the end, instead of (like every game) giving you a good, bad or neutral option, it presents 3 different sides, all with unique and specific ideals. this made the choice for which ending to do first harder, because instead of relying on blank moral choices, you have to evaluate your own philosophy on the topic. different reviews of the game reflect this, some saying Morgan Everett's ending is better, others going Helios, and some out there people side with tracer tong. the main problem with invisible war, is the fact it doesn't flesh out any of them. siding with anyone wont give you any reason to go alongside them, not Apostlecorp, not Illuminati, and especially not the Templars. there is a fourth ending, which is kill everyone (the Omar Ending), which a lot of people ended up choosing, because everyone else basically talks down to you, instead of providing convincing arguments. its the same idea the first game had, but with way worse execution. and beyond continuity issues (like how the world recovered from the \"Collapse\", and why the Collapse happened), this could've been just as good, if not better than the first game. maybe lock some endings behind who you sided with, with both the WTO and Order (which the order shouldn't be a conglomerate of multiple religions, and instead should be baptist, since most religions originate from the bible, and work well the the Templars gimmick), and the illuminati/Templars/Apostlecorp.   [/spoiler]\n\ni Think if i had to summarize Invisible war in two words it would be: Lost Potential. so many of the games faults either lie with misunderstanding what made the original good, and poor execution. many attribute the faults to Making the game for both pc and xbox (the only thing this changes is how big levels are, which are super small), but its more so the developers making mistakes. if you see this on sale, or have 10 dollars to burn, buy it (and install visible tweaker to make it function properly on modern hardware).\n", "timestamp_created": 1659123129, "timestamp_updated": 1697492674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119706894": {"recommendationid": "119706894", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007476066", "num_games_owned": 2923, "num_reviews": 459, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1578785368}, "language": "english", "review": "Weaker then the original, a slight disappointment.

It had a lot riding on its shoulders and eventually crumbled under the pressure of having to follow it up. I initially had a very rough start with the game and disliked it. As I played through it for a few more hours I thought eh, it's ok and thought that I'd drop a positive review when I finished it, but as I pressed forward and finished the second half, the multitude of issues present in the game became too big and turned it into a dislikable experience that left a sour taste in my mouth. The second game in the Deus Ex series is a watered down, simplified game in comparison to the first. I'd even dare to say that it's hardly an immersive sim compared to the first. The first issue that popped up, very minor, was the fact that all spoken dialogue or dialogue said over \"info-links\" (the radio communication system) was completely muted when wearing headphones, so I had to play the game listening from speakers. Ok, fine, I'm willing to forgive that, I thought early on. The first section is also bugged so that you can't save until you get out of the lab and into upper Seattle, otherwise the game will hard crash. The more I played the more that I noticed that the voice acting was even worse than the first, the weapon selection is much more limited, boring, and uniform, and they even instituted a universal ammo for every weapon as well as decreased ammo capacity. I get that this game was simplified for easy use for consoles, but that means that a lot of great immersive sim elements from the first game had to be ditched. There is no more worrying about how to fit everything into your inventory box, instead you get a pop up HUD of 12 inventory slots each with far less medkit and energy cells capacity. Part of the simplification was making weapon mods only two to a weapon. They also cut down the number of augmentations you have to only six, further streamlining the game into a steaming pile of shit. Another thing they got rid of was the dynamic health system from the first game where each part of your body has a different amount of health and could have an aug assigned to each limb. They also removed the ability to see what had been said in previous conversations, removed notes, and made it so that you didn't have to enter passcodes anymore, the game did it for you. A couple of other complaints that I had were that the stealth was practically removed because enemies can spot you from far away very easily, giving you far less player agency in how you approach situations. The weapons also deal a lot less damage even when fully upgraded; and towards the endgame you end up fighting a ton of bullet sponge enemies that can kill you in two hits but take five to take down. The game is also floatier and feels a lot crappier. The physics are all screwed up, and many of the assets made to have the game look futuristic end up looking silly and out of place. Another victim of the streamlining was the removal of skills and abilities that could be upgraded and the simplification of hacking. Ok, that's all fine and dandy, I can look past that you might be saying, but wait there's more! I already mentioned how there are far fewer ways to approach situations, but there're also fewer situations to approach. The game length is about half as long as the first. There are three main hub cities to explore throughout the game, those being Cairo, Trier Germany, and Seattle with a small variety of things to do, this is where you can find some side quests and a couple of interesting story beats. The one positive thing that I'll give this game is that the three hub cities can be fun to explore and interact with at times. But once again compared to the first game these three hub cities are a lame offering versus New York, Hong Kong, and Paris from the first game, each with several mini story lines, multiple main story lines and areas to explore. There are also not that many other locations in the second game, only having Antarctica and a brief time spent in New York to add to that list whereas in the first game you were visiting large expansive levels such as area 51, an underwater lab, and tons of other missions within the hub cities. The story in this game is also atrocious. The factions are somewhat interesting towards the beginning being a church and a capitalistic bureaucracy, with another religious entity, the Templars coming in later. There's one twist involving the Illuminati, but the final factions that you end up deciding the world's fate with are a renegade, evil anti-tech cult, the Illuminati, and the Protagonist of the first game's global AI merger. None of the characters throughout the game are particularly likable and I was certainly dissapointed to see the way that the characters from the first game were portrayed. Also it really didn't make that much sense that factions throughout the entire game and endgame tried to kill you and then asked you to choose their side for the ending. The final piece that I have to say on this game is that the world building was very weak. The talk bullets viewed on little stations spread around the levels were interesting in keeping you up to date on news, but hacking into computers and reading the extra lore was non existent. The soundtrack was also far less cyberpunk and fitting for the game and was played far less. The only time you could listen to the music was in the bars, and they even removed the combat music. To wrap this review up, I was disappointed by the sequel of Deus Ex to say the least. It lost its charm and was bogged down by watered down game systems, a disappointing story, and a much shorter length due to fewer areas and smaller levels.

Basically, this review could go either way, depending on the subjective-ness of certain things.\n\n[snip]\n\nI DIDN'T ASK FOR...THESE PROBLEMS.\nThe biggest crime Deus Ex: Invisible War had back in its day, when it came out, was that it...ran poorly on most systems. Sure, the streamlining & console-lization (consolization) of the game did not help by any means in most ways, but now things might actually be even worse than back then. Running this on modern systems can be such a problem, it ain't even funny - and keeping it running can also be a major hurdle too.\n\nTo get the game running & to keep the game running on my gaming laptop - which is a i7 4720 HQ; 16 GB RAM; 2TB HDD; and 4gb GTX 960m - I had to do all kinds of stuff. I used the Visible Tweaker Mod to actually get this game booted on Windows 10; used Borderless Gaming & programmed it to handle Deus Ex: IW to keep the game from having issues w/ Fullscreen/Windowed modes; installed Process Lasso (Free version) to set up the Affinity Cores so it handled the game properly; used the DGVoodoo wrapper to actually get the game past the main menu, past any sort of loading screen issues & had to set that up properly; had to use Task Manager to stop other programs like NVContainer (NVidia program), Logitech App's, and anything else you can think of that this game might not get along with. \n\nEven though I normally save-scum in these type of \"immersive sim\" games a lot anyways, quick-saving & save-scumming a lot did help a lot namely in case the game would crash when loading, conflict with another app running that happened for whatever reason, and/or for whatever reason or for whenever the game would just straight-up crash while playing. Not sure if this was the poor implementation of engine itself & its lack of optimization and/or any DGVoodoo layers here needed just to keep this running could also cause a slow-down or whatever else - but sometimes, I would have stutters here & there while in important moment of combat, especially when special effects were happening on-screen and/or a lot of action happened on-screen (especially by the end of the game). It was easy enough to keep it stable & locked at 30fps or so, but when it took hits and/or stuttered, that did not help keep the combat fluid.\n\nEven w/ this being an older game, this also isn't the most friendly game for multiple screens - as it would work fine on my 1st monitor which was the laptop built-in monitor, but on other 2nd monitors connected via HDMI would run it fine (no syncing on it), while another monitor (G-Sync monitor) would not.\n\nA new patch, a properly done Remaster, moving this to another engine, and/or something could really be a good idea to fix a lot of these problems out-the-box; it would go a long way in fixing this game, if whoever holding the IP (that would now be Embracer, probably not Square-Enix anymore) would make this happen - especially in an age when Remasters and/or re-releasing an old game is all the rage these days.\n\n[snip]\n\nPLOT & STORY.\nThe story & plot is really good & really interesting; certainly one of the highlights of this game. Taking place after the first game, all of the endings from the original game actually happened; not just the one you earned in your 1st Playthrough. In IW, you play as Alex D. here, in which you can decide to make this Alex D. either male or female; up to you. You are at a Training Academy Facility to be an Agent, as your Academy gets attacked & the city gets bombed. Of course, you get out of there & you're to figure out why certain groups are after you and/or might be helping you ... and/or even trying to use you. Terrorism and factions at war are the main theme here, though this isn't the tip of the iceberg - as there are other factors, factions, groups & conspiracies at play. Since you're at the center of this, you're to figure out who's attacking cities & places; and what factions are playing what roles in these wars & matters.\n\nI DID ASK FOR THIS...STUFF.\nThough, despite tons of complaints & issues - well, everything else about this game though is really good. Despite some of the levels feeling small & load-times are everywhere (so they can try & have their cake and eat it too), the actual level design & their areas are excellent. The hubs of a futuristic & cyberpunk-y Seattle & Cairo, for starters (as there are more cool areas) are really good & cool. All levels are designed in interesting and really good ways, even despite their small size and/or it's broken-up in pieces & sections, when compared to Deus Ex 1: GOTY. \n\nA lot of the missions are really good & interesting, often having decisions and/or feel unique. If IW gets anything right here, despite being much shorter than Deus Ex 1: GOTY - it's that this game in its content & questing is mostly all killer & little-to-no filler here. This game took me around 19 1/2 hours or so to finish, though Steam won't recognize that b/c it was done mostly offline & with mods - though, it probably could be finished in much less than that if you just followed the main story and didn't tackle a lot of side quests. And to be honest, a lot of the side-quests are really good & often offer-up good rewards (more canisters, BioMods, clips, weapons, etc) - so it is worth taking these on, as this could help make the final few areas much easier to tackle. \n\nIn typical Deus Ex faction, a lot of the missions can be finished in numerous ways - whether you're going all stealthy & silent; going run-and-gun & all loud; using tools to hack open items; using lethal weapons to kill enemies; using non-lethal weapons to knock enemies out; carrying, moving, and dropping bodies; entering or exiting areas via vents; entering through a front or back door; and/or whatever - there's often numerous ways to get the job done.\n\n[snip]\n\nOUTRO:\nWhen it's all said & done, Deus Ex: IW just doesn't live up to the greatness of the original Deus Ex 1: GOTY, in terms of actually streamlining the game, baffling design decisions, and/or other things that make the game nowhere as great as the original.\n\nWhile I could still recommend the game for numerous other reasons - namely regarding the cool characters, story, plot, choice, music, voice-acting, great quests that are mostly \"all killer and no filler\", and all of that stuff - it's still the tons of technical issues & modding to get the game running and/or even stable...and that stable-ness still might not always be the case either, which could make this game in many ways a gamble and/or crapshoot. You're likely going to need mod this a lot and try all kinds of stuff, to get it going & also keep it going. Save-scumming is going to necessary, just to make sure when it crashes that you can get right back to where you were.\n\nIf any modder could make an all-in-one solution here to fix this game all in one clip; a company fixed all of the technical issues; and/or a Remake/Remaster/Port over to a newer engine could be done here - any of those things happening could make this still an easy recommendation, even despite its other design & streamlining issues.\n\nON SALE NOTES:\nWhen bought on sale, though - since this game often goes for 97 cents to $2 USD or so - it's certainly a worthwhile & cheap gamble, if you've ever wanted to see what happens after the legendary Deus Ex 1: GOTY Edition...provided you actually can get the game stable and/or running...", "timestamp_created": 1651946045, "timestamp_updated": 1651946315, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522862792015075684", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114938591": {"recommendationid": "114938591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061577268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 424, "last_played": 1652363932}, "language": "english", "review": "ok", "timestamp_created": 1651674637, "timestamp_updated": 1651674637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "114872756": {"recommendationid": "114872756", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966409460", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1651562734}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this straight after the original.

I completed Human Revolution first as I was interested in how the series rebooted itself into the mainstream gaming world. I really enjoyed it, and I thought I just had to come back and finish the whole series.

If you're aware of and okay with this, this game is worth checking out. Back in the day I played this on console and loved it. \n\nDE2 is basically where the series starts to fall apart,and it devolves into a generic sci fi adventure-shooter with very little actual character building. You're Alex D, a trainee of the Tarsus program recently moved to Seattle after a terrorist plot destroys all of Chicago. During a second attack, you are free to learn the answers of the new world and determine who you can really trust. This mostly involves exploring extremely small maps completing objectives in your own style. There is a gun that does Non-lethal poison damage but it's not really tracked or important. \n\nStory-wise it's textbook cyberpunk social commentary about how corporations create multiple faces in order to fool consumers/voters into sheepish compliance.  Literally every organization in this game is some kind of front for another one; to the point where it's a little too real. Much like in real life, the factions are built up for one purpose: Consolidation of power/control. The cyborg future is also super progressive, even in the American zones there's a pretty satisfying mixture of races/creeds portrayed in the game. \n\nNow let's talk about why the series objectively gets worse after the first DE. There is no individual weapon ammo, everything's fired with the same little energy clipazine. What this ends up meaning is that you will go through large sections of the game using little to no ammunition and then at the very end of the game you are BLEEDING for ammo because you have to kill about 20 dudes in heavy power armor. Money is also completely without purpose because there isin't really an economy! There are black market guys you can throw money at and what they have is not worth grabbing in most cases.\n\nThe second reason is the lack of hybrid FPS RPG mechanics that the first game had. DE 1 had XP you bought skill ranks in but that's all gone, the inventory is just a flat 20 slots now, and compared to 1 the maps are TINY due to it being a 2003 console game. Once you get your hands on a silenced/glassbreaking handgun you can basically ride with it until the game ends. \n\nThis is a game I played through 3-4 times to get all the endings when I was younger and it's about 8-10 hours long.

The too long didn't read, it's not only a lesser game, but it's not even decent enough on it's own to play in my opinion. \nHonestly, I cannot recommend this game at all. Maybe you can try it if you're morbidly curious, but a combination of horribly simplified and dumbed down gameplay and a lack of story hooks make this such a difficult game to justify playing it for your actual enjoyment, even considering how weak it is compared to the rest of the series.\nAs years go by, I have heard two descriptions to this game, \u201cIt\u2019s a game where stuff supposedly happens\u201d and \u201cIf you wanna know why consoles were a mistake look no further\u201d, and that\u2019s not far off the mark.\n\nAnyway here's a disjointed rant with no effort, much like this title's game design.\n\nSo after the first cut scene that reeks more of Final Fantasy, you get a character avatar with pick of male or female, skin color and hud alpha. I instantly notice there\u2019s no skills to choose (lock-picking, medicine, specialization for guns, demolitions, nothing). You start, get tons of tutorials shoved in your face to do ANYTHING, and are let in the first real gameplay proper, escaping a small building facility.\nThe inventory as a whole is horrible. Can stack food regardless of size, can only drop with a button on the corner, reorganizing for mousescroll is cumbersome, also I really hope you dont find it\u2019s placement as a circle bad because in widescreen it\u2019s horrible. If you play this game, play it at 4:3 or it will get in the way.\nWeapons have no reloading. There is also universal ammo which is so stupid I don\u2019t know where to start. Universal Ammo has two working uses- Coop/multiplayer games where players have different weapons and has to account for it (see Left 4 Dead) or different weapons who\u2019s ammo use is different with benefits and negative drawbacks (classic example, a shotgun vs a double barrel). This removed so many layers of planning, management, overall engagement, I dislike it so much.\nIt\u2019s also impressive how lacking the story is. Fair, I played like four hours only but I have no idea what to make of it. Why is every faction a \u201cgrey area\u201d? \nSpeaking off, I cant be sure but they seem to pull a \u201cALL ENDINGS CANON\u201d which is lame in my opinion. It would be much more interesting to see the consequences of one if the most \u201crational\u201d endings, like say  JC just blows internet the fuck out and embraces this Dark Age Tong wants. Humanity inevitably builds back. What happens? How would people think of it? What consequences occur? It could atleast be INTERESTING. Every document , news article, conversation, all fail to intrigue me. The writing is noticeably more shallow and barren. Alex\u2019s voice also doesn\u2019t help, JC and Adam were both very \u201cunemotional\u201d but they still display personality and character, the voice makes it so any interpretation of their characters fit. Alex speaks and comes across like a plank of wood figured out how to communicate.\nAnd levels.

In consequence the gameplay is dull, unengaging, tedious and unfun.\nYou'd think the graphics would be the one good thing about this game, but they ain't, every character model looks stiff and lifeless, they have weird bug eyes that make them look like psychopaths, add to this the eye-hurting teal color filter and it's the perfect mix for disaster.\nI could say a million more bad things about this game, like how it fucks with the lore, ruins certain characters, has a story that makes no sense, is a complete downgrade in every single sense of the word, etc. But this review is long enough as it is, so to TL;DR: Don't buy this game, specially not if you liked the first game, play GMDX instead, it's free and it's not an utter embarassment.\n1/10.", "timestamp_created": 1638381703, "timestamp_updated": 1638381703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104765134": {"recommendationid": "104765134", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981852474", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1638226286}, "language": "english", "review": "Old and worse than the original however not as bad as everyone said.

Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and realise that these games have probably been randomly generated by the shadow government, you know, to confuse us so they can implement biotech on a wide scale and destroy humanity because,you know, if everyone is a technologically enhanced to become super humans then they can keep the populous submissive.\n\nI'm actually a very spiritual person you know, I'm actually working on a little project right now where I mesh all the religions in the world together into a super religion... that's so it appeals to more people you know... and then I'm going to kill certain scientists who are developing weapons because I really don't support weaponry... that's a part of my super religion actually... And then I'm going to kill this shadow government yeah and take over right and stop this biotech nonsense... I don't know what else I'll do... But hey, sounds pretty good right? I think I've told you enough about my side now to reasonably expect you to want to fight and die for us... all makes sense... see its interesting because there's this conspiracy you know. So many sides to choose from? Which one will you pick?\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1636259395, "timestamp_updated": 1636259395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102242205": {"recommendationid": "102242205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080966616", "num_games_owned": 1222, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1599479947}, "language": "english", "review": "While console ancestry may be bothersome to some people, Invisible War isn't a bad follow-up for Deus Ex.

Or a story about Technical Problems[/h1]\n\n  Right....so the main reason why I personally dislike this game - is because running this game smoothly on modern system is....practically impossible.\n  Check this out - if you have Win10 - prepare for unforseen consequences. If you patch the game with Upgrade from ModDB - it will do nothing. Literally. Loading screens are simply dont work - you need to bring up TASK MANAGER to SHUT DOWN some programms that for whatever reasons CONFLICT with the 2004 YEAR GAME, LIKE WHAT THE FECC.\n  If you somehow manage to run this game and fix all the problems, withstand constant crashes, freezes, laugh out all of the goofy bugs like not working scripts, broken physics, dumb AI - get ready to be SEVERELY DISSAPOINTED STILL.\n\n[h1]DA \"Gameplay\"[/h1]\n  If you started this game right after Deus Ex 1 - you've made a BIG mistake, friend. All of the gameplay in this game - is a complete ultimate DOWNGRADE from previous installment.\n  Narrow corridors, small locations, loadings everywhere (that barely works, mind you), Experience points are no more, augmentations are limited, ammo is now only one type and works for every gun - which is REALLY weird. Stealth approach is not rewardable at all and the quests...lets say they are weird too. The game is not that hard, no. Its easy to learn but sometimes the game will punish you for not caring at all - so...just be careful at what you do.\n\n[h1]Ugly looks[/h1]\n  Its hard to believe...but Deus Ex 1 looks better\nWhile some textures looks okay, shadows and lights are kinda cool - they are completely lost it at the models department. Faces are awful, creatures and animals are hideous, and weapons/tools are...well, they are exist. \n\n[h1]Plot?...what plot?...[/h1]\n  The story in this game \"Can be\" divided in several parts\n1)RUSHED BEGINNING - so ye, you're a survivor from burned down Chicago, you're a student AND THERE ARE TERRORISTS WHO KILL EVERYONE\n2)Some liberty - tons of various factions storm you, nameless random, to do stuff for them for no reason at all - you dont like anyone of them but...nobody gives a shi~~ and get ready to stumble in small rooms and corridors\n3)THE ILLUMINATI - SPOILER WARNING\n4)HE'S back - that certain part when you start caring because its Antarctica\n5)Grand Finale - shoot everything that moves and decide which bad ending you dislike the least.\n\n[H1] Characters and personality [/h1]\nThe MC is ... he/she dont give a single shi~ about whats happening around him/her\nThe NPCs are either stupid/dont care about anything/EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE/wants you do something for them because YOU WILL\nFinally - the voice acting...they managed to fecc up even the nostalgia actors...\n\n[h1]Music and sound[/h1]\nThe beatiful music of Unreal Engine 1...is not here\nThe only good song you'll ever hear - is in the main menu. Other than that - maybe in Church..but the rest of it - is meh\nAs for the sound...well, its there at least.\n\nAnd finally, because the locations are so small - it made the most of the game really boring and you simply cannot put yourself in such conditions.

It's a title that stripped away everything that made the original so compelling, crippled the experience to fit on the XBox's RAM infrastructure, took out most of the interesting character motivations and murky morality that defined the previous game, and wrapped it up in a package that comes across as some sort of simplistic epilogue DLC.\n\nEvery time I see someone say this is \"a terrible [i]Deus Ex[/i] game, but not a bad RPG\" (console players?), I burst out laughing. This is a title that took every interesting game mechanic from the original (risk vs. reward systems, tough moral choices, skill trees and character customization) and boiled it down to its barest elements, then tried to awkwardly shoehorn a bunch of major developments into the last fourth of the plot to cover how narratively void the rest of the game is.\n\nAt the time of this writing, I'm halfway through the game (in Cairo). The game throws out bizarrely-inconsistent character motivations, caused by a \"join any faction\" system that allows you to work against other groups with no penalty. The Order, a faction who's been courting you through the game, complains about you working against their interest, sends out a hit squad to kill you, then your handler calls you back to say, \"Let this be a lesson to you... by the way, we're going to give you more missions.\" [i]What?[/i]\n\nMost side missions boil down to \"destroy x object\" or \"kill x npc\", characters act like you're their best friend when you've barely had more than one conversation with them, the plot expects you to side with a faction that destroyed your hometown (killing your parents -- an act lead character Alex Denton isn't even all that surprised by) and attacked the academy safehouse you're in, and the extent of the exploration boils down to taking a left instead of a right in a tunnel or hopping over a few beams to get a [i]slightly[/i] hidden unique weapon, which are among the top of their class and makes it pointless holding on to the normal versions.\n\nIt's a game that \"wants to have its cake and eat it too.\" All of the endings from the original game occurred at once... which is something that only gets revealed two-thirds of the way through the game by former lead character JC Denton, who now has some bizarre Cthulhu-like alternate form living in Antarctica (uh?). Voice actors from the original game come back, some reprising their roles (Nicolette Duclare) and others voicing different characters, which adds to the confusion (Tom Hall, the voice of Walton Simons, as a random scientist in a weapon facility?). Combat boils down to \"aim, point and go boom-boom,\" lacking all of the tactical action from the original (to say nothing of the broken Biomods that trivialize combat). You can hire one of two different pilots, one of whom is completely superfluous and makes you pay for transit so that you can skip more of the level(?). There's plenty of outright confusing moments that take the player out of the experience.\n\nNothing in this game is a challenge -- you can max out most of your biomods before the midgame if you bother to explore at all, there are no cleverly-hidden conversations or choices (in fact, you can kill one of the endgame bosses in the very first level, and the game kind-of acknowledges this, but still has her appear on communications several times, not to mention bugging out missions to get both rewards from mutually-exclusive questgivers), the combat feels simplistic and floaty, and major moral dilemmas (like interlinking all of society in the final mission) are covered with all the gravitas of a wet fart.\n\nIf you're a completionist and just need to see everything this franchise has to offer, you might as well try this to see where it all went wrong (and where [i]Human Revolution[/i] and [i]Mankind Divided[/i] worked the formula much better).

The story takes places 20 years after the events of original game. However it builds upon the themes presented in the first game, so knowing it's story is required. The game starts with a cool cutscene in which the whole city of Chicago gets destroyed in an explosion, but some of the people escape and one of them is you, Alex D, a special agent in the making. After a series of unfortunate events you find yourself on the streets of Seattle with a lot of voice messages from two warring factions asking you to do stuff. Just like in the previous game there're a lot of twists and turns on the way to the ending. You can influence the story by helping one faction or the other. There are also a couple of side-stories mostly unrelated to the main plot, which you can complete to earn money or other useful supplies. \n\nJust like in the previous game, your character has access to different augmentations. You can pick one three for each of the body slots you have and upgrade them using the canisters found on levels. Unlike the first game, you get a lot of those canisters right from the beginning, while it does make the game more fun, it takes away that gratifying feeling when you finally get the upgrade you want. As to the weaponry, once again there's a choice between lethal and not-so-lethal, which is represented by stun baton and crossbow. However, the game doesn't comment on your choice in anyway, so there's no reason to use non-lethal weapons other than as challenge for yourself. The gunplay feels a bit better due to the ragdoll physics, but the AI is still very bad. So both silent and loud approaches aren't working as well as they should. Due to some technical limitations locations got smaller than in the original. They are now divided by loading screens. It would have been ok, if the locations were at least a little bit bigger, but seeing 3 loading screens in the span of 5 minutes is enough to throw immersion out of the window. The level design tries to stay true to the original. There are still multiple paths to take, but due to the small environments, they usually look like a choice between a door and the ventilator shaft next to it. \n\nThe sequel does improve on the original in some ways. First of all the graphics, that still hold up to modern standards. The interface looks modern and more intuitive. You don't have to input keycodes manually anymore, yet the characters sometimes say them out loud for some reason. The number of augmentations is lower, so you don't have to move your hand all the way to F12 to turn on the flashlight, which also got a great improvement, it doesn't drain your energy anymore. Moreover the ammo is universal now, hence you can stick with your weapon of choice not being scared that you'll run out of bullets. The story doesn't repeat itself instead it tries to tackle new issues and expand on some of the themes set up in the first game. Coupled with a new visual design that makes Deus Ex's world look more like the distant future it is supposed to be. It turns out to be not a bad game after all. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Interesting story with a lot of twists\n+ Good graphics that still look ok\n+ Multiple paths to take and choices to make\n+ Attention to detail in environments\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Levels feel cramped and there are a lot of loading screens\n- Technical issues, getting the game to run correctly is a pain\n- Lack of secret paths and locations\n- Bad AI\n\nEven though I had some issues with it, I've enjoyed the game. It's not a masterpiece like the original Deus Ex, but it's still a good game. It's worth picking it up, if you're a fan of the series, but you probably know that already.

Controls are kinda clunky at times, but it's still an improvement from Deus EX GOTY. \n\nI definitely LOVE using the dead/unconscious bodies of those templar knights to heal my hp. Those Templar Knights can SMD for giving me so much trouble at the beginning part of the game when I only have the bare minimum to defend myself.\n\nOverall, a decent immersive sim classic. Worth trying out.

There are books and news stations you can find to find what's going on in the world but it's not as saturated as in the first game. Mods are done better though and there are more kinds, although a weapon can equip only two and you get way too many mods for the amount of weapons you use throughout the game and quickly become obsolete. Ammo has been simplified to only one type for all weapons which limits to using only 1-2 weapons at most. The experience points have been completely removed and the biomods have also been simplified.

As the sequel to a true masterpiece, OK is pretty disappointing. In an effort to make it more \u201caccessible,\u201d they stripped out the soul of the original game. Invisible War just doesn\u2019t hold up the same way Deus Ex holds up. Give this one a pass, unless you are a series fan and really need to see the whole plot/story. In that case, set your sights on disappointment and Godspeed.\n[hr][/hr]\nI really do not think Invisible War was a terrible game. It\u2019s unfair to ask any game to play sequel to a classic that a whole lot of people, myself included, think is one of the best ever made. But nearly every fault I had with Invisible War can be summed up with one quote, \u201cThe aim was to [i]create a more [b]accessible[/b] version[/i] of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Let\u2019s dumb [b]everything[/b] down to reach a bigger audience.\n\nTranslation of the Translation: Let\u2019s sell out\u2026just a little bit.\n\nNow, Deus Ex was such a great game that even after the simplifications, what we are left with isn\u2019t bad. Especially considering the quality of games in 2003\u2026I played MUCH worse games in 2003. But this stripped something essential out of the soul of Deus Ex: the idea that [i]every[/i] choice you make has an impact. How do you spend your limited skill points? Which biomods do you want? Do you spend your last 2 sniper bullets on those goons?\n\nIt felt like they wanted to make sure you could do anything you wanted in the game regardless of your choices. Like making sure there is a ladder on the building for a rooftop entry\u2026well, now you don\u2019t really need the jumping biomod, do you. They also wanted to make sure you never feel like you missed out\u2026so computers are easy to hack, you\u2019ll max your biomods about a third of the way into the game, the tasty looking lockboxes can be opened (assuming you don\u2019t try to open every one), and maps are easier to navigate with fewer secret tunnels/entrances.\n\nHere are some highlights of the \u201csimplifications.\u201d Ammo is universal, but different guns use ammo at different rates\u2026and running out of ammo really isn\u2019t a thing. Your tool box is reduced down to a single \u201cmultitool\u201d for all purposes. Biomods still do cool things, but the game and maps were simplified enough that they no longer really feel useful (except hacking). Gear/stuff is much more plentiful, so by mid game you never have to make a hard choice about using/saving anything\u2026plus most of the stuff in those locked boxes is useless since you already have full stacks of gear. Oh, and skills\u2026they\u2019re just gone.\n\nLet\u2019s not kid ourselves either, accessible is a code word for easier. I played on Realistic difficulty, and Invisible War is much easier in nearly every way. Yea you can still get one-shot on Realistic, but you never really have to worry about how many snipers are hiding out there in a gigantic ef-ing map with tons of clear sight lines. Turrets and robots are much easier to disable\u2026there are fewer of them, it\u2019s easier to get to them, and you have more tools to disable them.  I could go on\u2026.\n\nI liked the direction the plot was trying to take, but unfortunately this also suffers from being over-streamlined. Rather than tell a complex, evolving story with multiple plot elements and good hooks, the story feels shallow and rushed. Story elements are just thrown at you so that you \u201cget it\u201d more easily. Your character\u2019s involvement feels very superficial at times. Tropes stand out and feel clich\u00e9. Overall, a shame really.\n\nSo, the developers succeeded. They created a more accessible Deus Ex, which received some deserved acclaim upon its release. Unfortunately, to do that they had to strip out the parts that made the original Deus Ex an enduring classic. So, unless you\u2019re stretching all the way back to 2003 to look for mid-tier games to play, you can probably find something better in your backlog.", "timestamp_created": 1622584168, "timestamp_updated": 1622584367, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92925812": {"recommendationid": "92925812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174375195", "num_games_owned": 621, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 907, "last_played": 1619012954}, "language": "english", "review": "7/10", "timestamp_created": 1622459207, "timestamp_updated": 1622459207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92882775": {"recommendationid": "92882775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378640131", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 838, "last_played": 1657985342}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1622395033, "timestamp_updated": 1622395033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92855464": {"recommendationid": "92855464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135827599", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 75, "last_played": 1635664950}, "language": "english", "review": "No.", "timestamp_created": 1622366707, "timestamp_updated": 1622366707, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496530145406723022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92596938": {"recommendationid": "92596938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150963847", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 783, "last_played": 1526060915}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n- Solid story. While characters have a lot less in terms of raw speeches in IW compared to the first game, seeing the story and its world along with the impact of JC Denton's actions from the first game, which [spoiler]caused a major apocalypse that made life worse than things were under Majestic 12's conspiracy for many[/spoiler], is still interesting and the game has some unique twists along the way, such as [spoiler]Chad Dumier, the idealistic French revolutionary you met in the first game becoming a cynic and actually joining the Illuminati elite after realising the damage his efforts to bring down the world order resulted in[/spoiler]. While I preferred the realism of DX1, especially the sophisticated political and societal perspectives that this game lacks, IW's far future continuation of the world 2 decades on is still fun to learn about and explore. The competing movements and their ideologies offer some decent food for thought as you watch them jockey for influence, drag you into their battles and almost tear the world to shreds in the process.\n- Lots of choices. Wouldn't be a Deus Ex game without them, there's several wildly different endings you can end up with based on your relations with the story's main factions, each with really different outcomes for the world. Throughout the game these rival factions will offer you different objectives to carry out in your missions to help you define your alignments, unlike the first game where you were more or less just working with everyone [spoiler](the Anti-Establishment Primitivist Tracer Tong, the all knowing benevolent Helios AI, the Capitalist establishment of the Illuminati, etc etc)[/spoiler] against the common enemy of [spoiler]Majestic 12 and Bob Page[/spoiler] until the finale offered up the ending choices. The factions in Invisible War have a lot more competition between each other this time around. so you've got more of an incentive to weigh up their pros and cons and question their methods and ambitions, the OG Deus Ex gave you a set list of objectives but great variety on how to accomplish them, Invisible War gives you variety on the objectives you take on as well.\n\nCons\n- Reduced scale. This game was designed for consoles first and PCs second and unfortunately that caused a lot of shortcomings in the end product. Ion Storm didn't do a good job adjusting the Deus Ex formula for the shift in platform priority to the Xbox, that means that it lost out on a lot of content in comparison to the first game. There's a lot less dialogue, the maps are way smaller (shattering immersion as the game tries to pass off single streets and tiny alleys separated by long loading screens as entire megacities) and the gameplay is much more simplified, the game's attempt to pass itself off as a globetrotting adventure doesn't really pan out when each stop in this wondrous globe is a dingy back corner with a ton of fog dumped in to mask how underdeveloped it all is. This is the game's biggest down side for sure, Deus Ex 1 is a game worth hundreds of hours that you can keep coming back to for years and still uncover new things from, with Invisible War you can get about 10 or 20 hours of gameplay max and you'll likely only get through it to completion once or twice.\n- No skills system. One of the key RPG elements of Deus Ex, the skills system where you could specialise in some abilities in exchange for lacking in others, doesn't exist in Invisible War, your abilities at things like shooting and lockpicking will always be the same and can't be upgraded or downgraded in exchange for other abiltiies, the only changes to your character that can be made are selecting IW's version of Augmentations called Biomods, this leads to a lot less variety in player skillsets (and by extension, playstyles) between playthroughs.\n- Compatibility problems. Getting this thing to run on a modern system can be a pain and you might need to do some extra work by installing fan made patches or fixes to get it to start, can be a tedious process.\n- Disappointing soundtrack, the first Deus Ex set a high bar musically, it had an iconic OST with lots of memorable songs, Invisible War doesn't even come close to equalling that accomplishment, most of what it has to offer is just a series of generic electronic melodies for ambience.\n- Universal Ammo. One of the most confusing gameplay decisions the devs came up with for Invisible War is the introduction of Universal Ammo, in Deus Ex 1 all the guns had their own ammo types and even came with alternate ammo types that changed up their functions, not so in Invisible War where every single weapon uses the exact same ammo pool and there's no reloading, you keep firing until you run out and then you have to go and look for more clips, a Rocket Launcher will use the same pool of rounds as a Pistol, an SMG or a Shotgun. Not only is this really stupid and nonsensical even as a kind of far future sci fi concept, it's also frustrating in gameplay terms as well, as having no ammo for one weapon means having no ammo for all weapons, this can push you away from using some of the more powerful weapons as they're a much bigger drain on your ammo supply than small arms.\n\nUltimately DX Invisible War is a decent game that shows its age and suffered from the limitations of being a console focused game at a time when working on consoles was still vastly inferior to PC, if it didn't have the Deus Ex name attached to it I imagine it would be looked at more forgivingly but being a sequel to a cult classic it's inevitable that players will draw comparisons between the first game and IW, those comparisons will almost always be negative since Deus Ex 1 undeniably has a metric ton more depth mechanically and thematically than Invisible War.\n\nHowever, this is still a solid product and a valid piece of the Deus Ex franchise, it was made by the same team as the original, they just made the mistake of learning the wrong lessons and listening to the wrong people. At the least fans of the first game should give Invisible War a chance and form their own opinions on it as a game, while I'm not a big fan of it I can appreciate its successes and acknowledge where its shortcomings came from, maybe if it was made a decade or half decade later it could've been something iconic, instead it's just okay at best and poor quality at worst, I'd say its a passable game but a truly terrible sequel, and that's where the harshness towards it comes from, deserved or not.", "timestamp_created": 1621985821, "timestamp_updated": 1622489020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611940324306488037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92535234": {"recommendationid": "92535234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801515989", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 2711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2372, "last_played": 1621901780}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, it's not a bad game but it has its flaws: \n\nCompared to the previous game, the levels are ridiculously small.

The fact of the matter is that IW just isn't a good followup, not when it came out, and not now about 17 years later. \n\nThe acting somehow feels MORE stilted, even compared to JC Denton's stiff-as-a-board delivery (Which, don't get me wrong, I think JC's amazingly entertainingly acted), the sound quality is worse, and while there wasn't a ton of emoting during conversation in the original game, the lack of it is far more noticeably awkward in this release due to the increased overall fidelity.\n\nThere IS a large amount of lee-way for completing objectives how you want. But there's also a good amount of handholding, a lot of the characters (your early-game counterpart Billie, for example) can come across as naggy/preaching, and at least as far as my recent run goes (More time than on record, I'm using the visual upgrade and it doesn't like working with steam) the game's world has a lot less nuance. \n\nIt feels watered down, is the best way to put it. The first game let you get steeped into the world a bit, letting you act as a UNATCO agent and carrying out counterterrorism missions.

Yes, it is a worse game than Deus Ex 1. There is too much backtracking if you want to do all side missions. Plus, it has technical issues due to being a poor console port. For example, every time you load a new area or load a save, the launcher restarts the game to clear memory. Also, the mission maps are smaller, there is only universal ammo now and you could probably find some other issues I forgot to mention here.\n\nHowever, there are also many pros. There is more Deus Ex content and it gives you a lot of references to the first game. During most missions, you will get contacted by various competing factions wanting you to achieve different mission objectives. This is a fun concept and increases the replay value plenty. There are  enough interesting characters and a few memorable moments.

I replay this game every year or two, just like the original. \n\nCompared to the original, here is what you typically hear...\nSimplified inventory? Inventory management is not fun. No issue here.\nUniversal ammo? An interesting mechanic where different weapons consume different amounts of ammo. No issue here.\nAI too dumb? They were just as dumb in the original. No issue here.\n\nHere's what you get that's better than the original...\nMore side quest. That's right. Everyone loves Hong Kong in the original, but it's pretty much just the main quest there. Here, you get two hub worlds packed with things to do.\nBetter factions. In the original, you moved from faction to faction linear style. Here, you can play the game favoring one faction over another, and it changes progression.\n\nWhere it falters...\nSmall hub worlds, almost like dioramas. The illusion worked well enough back in the day. And it might even fool you now on a first play-though. But especially the first hub world, it's almost comical to think of it as a city.\nEasy combat. Combat was easy in the original too, but here, even on the hardest difficulty, it's still too easy. Maybe it's just because I've played it so much. Even on realistic, 2-3 upper body shots with a simple pistol kills 90 percent of enemies. With a damage upgrade on a pistol, it's 1-2. The super soldiers later on require a lot more, but you're also OP by that point.\n\nWhere it ties the original, and the most important part... story. The story is great. In small and big ways. Two school friends interact with you throughout the game, one even offering a different ending if you keep him around. Two competing coffee shop companies enlist your help throughout the game, providing foreshadowing to the main plot. The Omar are cool. You discover plot points with your character, being just as ignorant as you. \n\nIf you optimize how you do side quest, the game is short. Very short.

The story is alright, there is some lore to read and hear and there are some interesting characters. What is somewhat annoying is that the game keeps crashing. It is interesting to note that these crashes are not bugs, but, and I\u2019m not kidding, an intended feature. Whenever loading a new area, the game will close itself and reopen. This was the only way they could think for the game to work properly. I admit it is as much ingenious as it is a red flag. But positive feelings! It\u2019s an average standalone after all.\n\nSo, inside these arbitrary metrics, it\u2019s an okay generic game.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t a standalone game, is it?\n\nNow, to the crux of the matter. As a sequel to Deus Ex, with the exception of the better graphics, better voice acting (the male protagonist, for instance, is voiced by Vegeta) and some sparse good tweaks; It falls short. Unbelievably short.\nInvisible War is inferior in almost every conceivable way. Plot, music, game design, level design, characters, lore, dialogue, among others. You can pick, there is a plethora of detractions from the first game.\nIt is far more streamlined, less immersive and massively less cerebral. You can have more meaningful conversations with bartenders on the original than with faction leaders on the sequel. The only two moments I felt this was actually a Deus Ex was during [spoiler] the Coffee Wars mission in Trier (which could have been done better and serves as a hint to a plot point which is already obvious to the average Deus Ex player at this point) and the first encounter and subsequent conversation with JC Denton. [/spoiler]\n\nAs a sequel to Deus Ex, this is a monumental step back. I honestly feel bad for the developers that had to bend to the corporate desires and mangle this. It\u2019s ironic. What went down behind the scenes between the devs and executives is, most likely, far more Deus Ex than this game itself even attempted to be. (It was originally developed for the Xbox, because money.)\nThis is, most likely, the worst of the main Deus Ex games. I say most likely because, as of the time of this review, I have only played the original and Invisible War. The only things I know of Human Revolution and Mankind Divided are opinions and reviews of friends, so I have a gist of the overall quality, but am biased due to not actually knowing.\n\nSo, I give this game a positive review. Under certain boundaries, I enjoyed this game. And you will, or could, enjoy it also, if:\n-You never played any Deus Ex. If this relates to you, you will have a good time, it is a fun game. But it would be best if you played the original first. For any reason whatsoever.\n\n-You only played the prequels/newer ones. If this relates to you, you might find this fun. It is still far less cerebral and nuanced, but there are some traits that you could find familiar. But then again, if you are stepping your toes onto the waters of the old ones, play the original, for the love of g..\n\n-You played the original, but you came expecting nothing of it and try to see the game as something else, disconnected, from the original.

It reeks of cash in for consoles sequel. Virtually every system of the game was reduced, dumbed down or simplified from the previous game. I played through using the visible upgrade mod, which makes the game look better and ironed out some bugs. I will also note that I had crashes on loading screens until I disabled the steam overlay, after which the game ran fine.\n\nThe game takes place 20 years after the first. Society had collapsed but rebuilt and is now more technologically advanced than before. The rich smart people live in closed societies and everyone else is a hobo. You are a fresh nanoaugmented recruit of the Tarsus Academy when shit starts to tilt. I liked that there were multiple factions with conflicting mission goals on missions. A lot of the choices would greatly effect the later game and change what side you were on which was cool. That being said even when you continually fucked a faction over they would still ask you to do their bidding on later missions, letting you flip flop which detracts from the gravity of your choices. \n\nThe story is far less intriguing than the original Deus Ex. There were some minor twists but nothing that will stick with you. You would think the big reveal of who you really are would be a big DUN DUN DUNNNNNN moment but it was so flat and unceremonious that it was laughable. All of the factions you can choose between are kind of meh, which I guess ends up being a pretty good moral dilemma but it also made me not give a shit about any of them. Even involving characters from the first game didn't spark any interest. There were several subplots that develop through side quests that carry through the levels, but most of them felt like filler fetch quests that I didn't bother pursuing them to the end. Coffee shops? Pop stars? Who cares? I thought the Omar were cool but they played virtually no part in the game, just a flavor side faction. \n\nSo much of the cool stuff from Deus Ex was chopped down or removed. The skill system is entirely gone. Character progression is linked solely to augmentations, which can be renegged on and changed at a whim. After looking at the options I knew pretty much what I wanted to use and had a half dozen canisters left over by the end of the game (the skill canisters and the upgrades were combined into one). Seemingly half of the augmentations are all passive, which while a QOL improvement makes energy a meme and easy to keep topped up. Multitools and lockpicks were combined into one item. The inventory system is gone and is just slots. Weapons all use the same ammo. LAM's are gone but they split grenades and mines into two different items? Bizarre. Hacking may as well not be in the game at all; it is available solely as an augmentation and is used so seldomly that they may not have even added it. \n\nThe actual gameplay and combat was as unmemorable as the story. Fighting felt as limp and disjointed as TES4: Oblivion. Stealth is viable, but if you don't one shot a guy it seems it instantly alerts everyone around. Melee besides the sword all seemed crappy and I can't imagine trying to play non lethal. The level design is samey corridors. They did have some decent multiple paths in places but overall it was very cramped and limiting. The vaulting feature was a nice QOL improvement but it took forever to do and climbing ladders was even more annoying than the first game. \n\nIn summary, if you liked the first Deus Ex I would say to definitely NOT play this one. It's not worth it, pretend it never happened. Not even for continuing the story. Leave it at JC's decision at the end of the first game, where you change the world and the possibilities for the future are endless, because this future sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1604629347, "timestamp_updated": 1604629347, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573692440986633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78613467": {"recommendationid": "78613467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051940593", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1604349466}, "language": "english", "review": "couldnt even play. broke my computer", "timestamp_created": 1604349612, "timestamp_updated": 1604349612, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "78583834": {"recommendationid": "78583834", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016355774", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1604315681}, "language": "english", "review": "It doesnt even start properly.

Invisible War reminds me of all the games I used to play when I first bought an Xbox and that bit of nostalgia absolutely carries through.\n\nIt is a bit weird getting used to all weapons sharing the same ammo supply, but ammo is also plentiful to where I've literally never worried about ammo in my 15+ hours of gameplay so far.

I typically don't have a ton of time to play outside of work, but Invisible War has made it in there in the last 2-3 hours before heading to bed.

I wont talk about what the other games have, that should be fairly obvious, or if not then youtube them, they have many videos that give them justice. I want to focus on what this game has, and why i like this one. The main thing i like in this game is that stealth, and strength mods dont drain your power, they are just passive so i like that i dont have to drain my energy to move silently, carry heavy items, punch people with the force of a truck, or throw them across the room. The black market mods are interesting, I like having a flying eye to spy with, detonate to shut down electronic/stun biological enemies, and having an emp skeleton is nice for punching laser eyes on doors to shut them down etc. The game is not perfect, but the game does have some interesting mechanics that only made an appearance on this one, as well as the Omar \"a very interesting NPC type\" The Kidney Thieves music in most social areas is also a nice bonus. While not for all people, this game certainly has its place for those who like the niche that invisible war fulfills.

We're speaking of the year that brought outstandingly looking games such as Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Tony . This one, on the other hand, does not look that pretty, facial animations look a bit overdone, and although I'm not entirely sure whether it's only the fault of my laptop's 120 Hz screen or excessively powerful graphics card (when compared to the graphics cards of old), I could never get a smooth 60 FPS experience.\n- The story continues with the typical clash of organizations and cults, each begging you to abide to their conflating wishes, all the way through the game. It becomes a clich\u00e9, seriously. And ultimately, this affects how much they trust you, but the ending only changes depending on what you choose to do in the last level.\n- Stealth is more feasible than in the former game, but the experience is not as exciting as in the latest generation of Deus Ex games. At some point, I was just smashing everyone that stood in my way with a baton until they dropped unconscious. It worked quite well after investing on strength biomods, but it still felt cheap. Alas, this strategy becomes utterly difficult at the last few levels, so I gave up there and fragged my way through.\n- The decision to merge lock-picking into the multi-tool was a refreshing decision, as not having enough tools to unlock doors and alarms was a minor frustration in the previous game. There are plenty of multi-tools to find, although due a bug, not all of them can stack in the same inventory slot.\n- And speaking of inventory, this one was different as well. While stacking food items together in the same space is OK to have, the very small number of slots available (expandable via biomods) was a bit disappointing, requiring me to leave many items behind regardless of how much they weighed.\n\nBut overall, It's a Deus Ex game all right.

It's just kinda boring and disappointing. \n\nBut if you can ignore the feeling of being robbed of a proper sequel, this can be a good chill out game. \nThe art direction, the ambient music and the \"relaxed\" gameplay adds to that, I felt like I should be receiving a massage and burning some incense while playing this. Everything is so pleasant, even the dirty alleys full of rats have a nice soothing feel to them. \n\nThe best part of this game is the graphics, they are quite impressive for 2003. Using the VisibleUpgrade mod (I never use the texture pack, they change the look of the game too much) to run smoothly in 1080p, this looks a generation ahead of its time. Too bad the maps are more claustrophobic and with more loading points than in DX1 (thanks Xbox!).\u00a0 And being basically a ported XB game, you can easily configure antimicrox (or joytokey) to play it with a 360 controller, it works very well. If you prefer mouse\u00a0and keyboard, I would advise you to play on hard or realistic, otherwise the game is WAY too easy.\u00a0Especially for veteran DX players.\n\nAnd I'm not kidding about being easy, some games don't reward exploration but DX2 rewards it [b]excessively[/b] . You'll quickly end up with way more medkits, biocells, biomods and gun mods than you can ever use. Beside that, medbots and repairbots\u00a0 don't have\u00a0a cooldown as in DX1 and you can also save multitools by using the widely available explosive craters to\u00a0open doors and lockers.\u00a0\n\nAs for the weapons, because of the silly unified ammo system they are mostly redundant (except the rocket launcher) unless you are performing a pacifist run. You can literally one-shot all the human enemies (except the armoured soldiers) in the game with the silenced sniper. And for any robot or turret in the game you can just max out the EMP melee biomod and easily destroy them (even the beefier ED-209 look-alike) with a few hits, they all turn too slowly to catch you. This all amounts to a not very exciting gameplay.\u00a0 \n\nThe whole game is janky as hell, it quits and reloads the executable every time you load an area to free the memory and you can multiply items you receive from NPCs if you have a full inventory. The physics are fun but very wonky too, like how you can climb anywhere parkour-style without the jump biomod by just holding the space bar. It's just like DOOM 2016, but unintentional. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs the story goes, it's not as good as the first game but is still far better than the tone-deaf \"augmented civil rights\" plots of DX:HR and DX:MD.\n\nVERDICT: I don't even know why I'm recommending this game, but it's so pretty and relaxing I can't hate it.  So if you want a game to play\u00a0with a controller sitting on the couch while chilling out (and maybe stoned), it kinda works even if the game itself is not very engaging. And if you are a fan of the series, this can scratch your Deus Ex itchy when you have already played all the other games to death.

Steam does not register play-time while using this mod. However, I have beaten the game twice; both in the normal and realistic mode. \n\nTLDR: Deus Ex Invisible War is the Mortal Kombat Annihilation of the Deus ex series. It's the Star Wars Episode 1, The Devil May Cry 2, Hell even the Zelda 2 of the Deus Ex series. Okay, I think you get my point. It's a tragedy that should have never happened.\n\nWith that said...\n\nLet's get the first major issue out the way. The story. They ruined it. If you played the first Deus Ex and wanted to know how the writers decided to wrap things up, then you will be gravely disappointed (at least I was).\n\nThe plot in the original was so grandeur and well thought out compared to this. It feels like their only goal was to stitch together some flimsy plot to tie in all the factions and characters from the first game. It lacks a sense of identity like the first game had, and as a matter of fact, it LOST almost all the identity that the original game established.\n\nThey butchered certain parts of the lore, removed important characters that SHOULD have made an appearance over certain others, the characters are robotic and lack the sense of charm and intrigue that the original game had, decisions don't matter till the end of the game and overall, they just did not do proper justice to the events that happened before this story took place. As a result, the plot simply drags and never recovers. Ever.\n\nBelieve it or not, as bad as the story is, it's not the worst offender here.\n\nThe gameplay. Wow. What did you do? First of all, If you insist on purchasing this game, make sure you play it on realistic difficulty unless you like the idea of shooting someone in the head and them not dying because you didn't do enough damage to them beforehand.\n\nThe combat in the original was never that great, but they took steps backward in this sequel. No limb damage, aiming is awful (and this an FPS game by the way), limited and overpowered weapons and on that note...\n\nSo in the opening of the original, you are offered an option of a few weapons: Crossbow, Sniper Rifle, GEP Gun. You chose wisely depending on your playstyle. While this may seem overpowered at first, it balances off due to the implementation of the skill point system and the rate in which these points were awarded to the player (also having options always rocks). \n\nYou can open with a sniper rifle if you want, but if you didn't allocate your skill points properly your aim would be wobbling like crazy, rendering the weapon almost ineffective.\n\nIn Deus Ex Invisible War, there are no such limitations. Your character is awesome from the start. This is fine, but the problem is now when you find that Sniper Rifle (which you find VERY early) all you have to do is put a certain damage mod on it, slap on a suppressor and voila, no need to own any other gun in the game (yes, and I do mean to include the unique weapons).\n\nTo make matters worse, ammo is universal across all weapons. Yes, there's a lore reason explained for this, but it doesn't make for great gameplay because you NEVER run out of ammo! There's plenty to find in crates, on the corpses of enemies and with you delivering head shots to every opponent in your way-- how the hell do you plan on running out of ammo?\n\nGone are the sprawling and complex level design of the first game. Each location feels small and lazily mapped out. Deus Ex boasted amazing multitudes of path you could traverse to get the mission done in different ways. This right here? The bare minimum. The design felt like they did it just it to make the locations feel authentic and less of a labyrinth. Once again another design decision that translated into boring gameplay.\n\nThe music was completely forgettable. No need to even spend time on it. The voice acting? Wow. If you were a fan of the original just wait till you hear what the did to some of your favorite and ICONIC voices (what the hell did you do to [spoiler]Tracer Tong's[/spoiler] voice). Straight up hack job is what this is.\n\nOkay, I'm tearing into this game way too much so let me tell you what I liked about it. The graphics. Okay I know I know. It looks like trash in this day and age, but if you are using the Visible Upgrade mod (which I highly recommend) then the game looks stunning. The world is cyberpunk heaven to behold. The locations are also very unique and interesting, if not limited in scope. Just ignore how robotic the character models move. It was 2003, man. Chill.\n\nI do not recommend this game at all, even if you're a Deus Ex fan and even if you need that closure. I recommend that you pretend this game never happened and pray that Eidos Montreal remakes the original and scrubs this from the canon.", "timestamp_created": 1598386487, "timestamp_updated": 1598408869, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513017952442169189", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74906895": {"recommendationid": "74906895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018730872", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 804, "last_played": 1598662812}, "language": "english", "review": "this game just be redone as in a remake.

close the game, that resolution you were playing stays, meaning you have to change it again to whatever the size your monitor has.\n\n------\n\nWell, i'm not one to talk about graphics, but this is clearly outdated, it doesnt really matter tho, i recommend to those looking to waste some time on this dumb game, i had a laugh with it, you may also laugh, unless you take the game too serious!",

L\u00e1stima que algunas mec\u00e1nicas del original ya no existen en esta secuela (Especialmente en la secci\u00f3n de items y inventario) Me dio cierta nostalgia el hecho de poder recoger armas y descargarlas para guardar su munici\u00f3n, cosa que en este juego no existe debido al sistema universal de munici\u00f3n. \n\nTodas las armas comparten el mismo tipo de munici\u00f3n (Incluso los lanza-cohetes y las armas que claramente utilizan plasma) otro punto negativo es claramente el limitado inventario que se basa en casillas dejando de lado el inventar\u00edo del DX original. Ni que hablar de las biomodificiaciones que han sido balanceadas en este juego y se nota bastante. Volviendo a las armas, estas solo pueden tener 2 tipos de modificaciones. Algunas son obligatorias para mantener un ritmo constante en el juego, como tambi\u00e9n tener 2 armas iguales pero con distintas modificaciones. \n\nEn el original podr\u00edamos ser invencibles s\u00ed ten\u00edamos solo la nano-aug de la regeneraci\u00f3n en su m\u00e1ximo nivel, en este juego ciertamente respeta un poco lo que es la dificultad balanceado este factor. Las biomods se pueden cambiar en cualquier momento y eso es debido a que los \"cannisters\" son f\u00e1ciles de conseguir a lo largo de todo el juego (Casi siempre se pueden conseguir siguiendo las misiones secundar\u00edas) a diferencia del original que en algunas localizaciones era posible encontrar entre 3 o 4 (VersaLife Labs por ejemplo) por ende es posible cambiar las biomods seg\u00fan las necesidades o adversidades que se presenten.\n\nEl sistema de skills no existe y para hackear computadores es necesario una biomod del mercado negro. Lo cual es un gran contra punto para cualquiera que busque la esencia del juego original en la secuela. Lo mismo para las ganz\u00faas y las multitools. Al final solo es necesario una o m\u00faltiples multitool para abrir cerraduras u \u00f3 desactivar sistemas de seguridad\nLos computadores existen pero han sido remplazados por los libros, solo he visto algunos y son completamente opcionales.

In comparison to its predecessor, IW is dumbed down mechanically, and there are plenty of questionable design choices (especially throughout the latter third of the game). You can't go wrong with this game for a dollar, but you really shouldn't expect it to live up to the quality of the rest of the series.\n\nCore mechanics have been severely changed since the original game, and only a few of these changes are favorable. I didn't like the awkward \"agent aim\" mechanic in DX1, which they decided to remove in this game. Augmentations are generally better balanced, and some of them are passive. You can change augmentations if you want (I don't see why not, especially because it's very costly). A lot of weapons have been given quirky alt-fires, such as the rocket launcher's guided missiles or the shotgun's smokebomb. There's a ton of grenade types, and I actually found myself using them far more frequently than in the original game.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot more of these changes lean towards the bad side. Level design has been severely dumbed down in nearly every way (more in the next paragraph). Skills have been completely removed from the game, removing one of the player's primary forms of progression. Augmentation canisters are sometimes handed out like they're candy despite the fact that you only have 5 augmentation slots. By the end of the game, I had over 10 augmentation canisters that I didn't know what to do with. The unique inventory-tetris system from the original game has been replaced with static item slots. Weapons use universal ammo (something I've personally hated since Dead Space 3), and alternate ammo types have been completely removed.\n\nLevel design is a particularly significant problem that I have with this game. Most of the level design is mediocre at best, and it's by far the worst in the main series. It generally feels far too streamlined and condensed. You'll often see segments where a door is the \"combat route\" and the ventilation shaft several feet away is the \"stealth route\". Sometimes, you're outright funneled right into combat. The hardest encounter in the game, by far, is when the game effectively forces you to take on 7 rocket-launcher wielding goons at once. The hubs are especially awfully designed, because they're so small and almost everything needs you to look at a load screen. The Trier hub is literally just a small circle with four doors to other areas in it, with each door being around ~15 seconds away from each other. Loading screens are incredibly frequent because of how small most maps are (and this applies to all levels - not just the hubs!).\n\nCarrying on from level design, some cracks start to appear in the armor later on into the game. It seems like the developers forgot to escalate the difficulty properly, so they decided to abruptly start hucking the hardest enemies in the game at you in swarms. This isn't too awful, as the player is far stronger in this game than any other entry in the series. I spent the bulk of the first two thirds of the game wiping out most encounters with my baton, so I did welcome the escalation in difficulty. Still, it seems jarring and lazy to me. It's one of the biggest, most spontaneous difficulty spikes I've ever seen in a game.\n\nThis game requires a patch in order to work on modern operating systems. Getting this patch to work is incredibly easy (I used Invisible Upgrade), so at least that isn't a major problem. Though I experienced no actual crashes, there's a bizarre quirk with load screens in this game where the game literally crashes to desktop before just restarting in the next area. I've never heard of a game doing anything like this before, but I guess it works? In addition, the physics in this game are buggy in a good way. They're amusingly jank, and I always laughed whenever I saw a Templar get stretched like he's made of taffy.\n\nDo I recommend this game? I think it's worth your time, especially because it's less than $1 on sale. Despite the fact that I have been rather negative, it's completely playable and it delivers an enjoyable, slightly watered-down immersive sim experience. You still have a ton of tools at your disposal, and the gameplay encourages you to mix things up and adapt your character to your preferred playstyle.

Time to Start drinking Again![/h1]\nThe original Deus Ex is considered one of the greatest PC games ever made, this title pretty much nearly killed the franchise. I finally played and finished 16 years after release. Also, the developer behind Deus Ex games was shut down soon after this mess. Invisible War has to be one of the most disappointing sequels of all time. Much of this is, again, the result of having been designed and tailored for the original Xbox hardware in mind (which were insanely limited by PC standards of the day especially for a game like this).\nIon Storm managed to take all good things that made original so special and decided to cash into sci-fi genre. There is almost no cause and effect like in the original title, no weight in your choices. Much of the cyberpunk feeling is pretty much gone! The art direction felt very cartoonish and colorful. Everything in this game feels rushed, from the dialogue, the story, the graphics, the controls, even the voice acting, HUD and item screens.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n-Horrible level design, pretty much all levels feel and look the same. The levels Similarly, the outdoor environments are claustrophobic, and there's never many characters onscreen at any one time.\n-Invisible War gives you a miserly five bio-mod slots to fill.\n-The developers decided to remove the hacking skill, and along with it the fantastic ability to read private emails from all the computers you can find. It was one of the best ways the original fleshed out its fantastic story. Now it\u2019s replaced with automatic hacking. \n-Enemy AI is dumb regardless of difficulty setting. Gameplay balance between Alex and enemies is strangely weird and messy. Initially the game is extremely easy but enemies become op very fast during the final act of the story. It\u2019s like every bad guy drank Red Bull at the end. Also, you get very less ammo for the last mission. \n-No-kill run or 100% stealth playthrough is probably impossible in this game imo because of the advanced level enemy types encountered in the game with tough body armor. There is also no bio-mod that lets you sneak past human enemies (there is one but only for bots). A bit disappointing because playing Human Revolution this way was hella fun!! \n-Your actions result in no consequences for committing undesirable actions against factions other than ending. \n-Excessive loading screens despite lacking large open world environments that were present in the first game. \n-Requires fan made patches and mods to make the game work just right on modern PCs.\n-Screen resolution won\u2019t go higher than 1280x1024 for me.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- The devs have acknowledged the original Deus Ex ending(s). Some of the coolest as well as minor characters from the original also make an appearance! \n-There are many references to the first game including some locations and landmarks. \n-Serviceable story and voice acting. There are also plenty of side quests. \n-There are some cool factions here (incl. Knights Templars and Order of the Church xD) \n-Universal ammo, yes it means no more messing around rearranging ammo in your inventory, plus you could choose to use the same gun throughout the whole game should you prefer to do that. \n-There is a surprising amount of voice acting in this game incl. fully voiced protagonists (male/female) as in Fallout 4/Mass Effect/Saints Row/ games. \n-Combat is something that I feel was an improvement.\n-Graphics are decent for a 17-year-old game.\n-Should appeal to old school gamers that like futuristic, sci-fi games.\n-Soundtrack was fine.\n-Multiple endings. Most of them were satisfying (I checked out alternate endings on YouTube).\n-Cinematics are well done (cutscenes were very important back then; both for presentation and marketing). \n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nThe original Deus Ex from 2000 is one of the greatest PC games of all time and addressing why it\u2019s so special would take hours of explaining. It\u2019s not that Invisible War is a bad game by any means (it\u2019s really a decent game but as a huge fan of Deus Ex series this is far below my expectations. If this is your first Deus Ex game then you might even love this game!! It\u2019s a good sci-fi shooter. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nIt\u2019s just that this game was a huge letdown after the excellent original. It was really hard not to look back and keep comparing these two games as a fan. There was so much potential, they had the budget, they had the technology! Half Life 2, Halo 2, Doom 3, Far Cry, SW:KOR, Thief 3 were proof of concepts that making games with high production values wasn\u2019t impossible in 2004. \n\nSince IW is canon to Deus Ex official timeline it becomes a little hard to not recommend this game but if you\u2019re a fan of the original you owe it to yourself to try it once.\n \n[h1]My Rating: 5/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1596291992, "timestamp_updated": 1596292166, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777682185173034668", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "73607754": {"recommendationid": "73607754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000520484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3069, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2571, "last_played": 1629848779}, "language": "english", "review": "All the problems that Invisible War faces can be attributed to one of two things, consolitus and it was a sequel to Deus Ex. For example, the small maps can be attributed to the fact the game was made primarily for consoles at the time and the gameplay in and of itself is not \"Bad\" but it is so simplified and basic in comparison to the complexity of Deus Ex that it feels shallow empty, about the only complexity is in your selection of augments (biomods) which allows for more variety in gameplay approach, but again in comparison to the Original game, is shallow and empty, we have less augments, we have less equipment, we have zero skills to upgrade, about the only positive in comparison that could be considered is that the augments can be hotswitched, whether you consider them being in a separate inventory system is debatable, because thanks to hotswitching, you have alot of flexibility and there's a reason to go seeking them all out. On the other hand however, if we had access to the same number of augments as in the first game (though some were wisely consolidated, arm strength giving more melee damage as well as the ability to move heavier objects and more inventory space is a nice example) then hotswitching your augments may not have been a needed feature. \n\nSo in summary: As a standalone game, it is good. the characters are engaging, the story is interesting and the ragdoll physics for bodies are a joy.

This game is rather more the other way around.\n\nThink of it as a true Deus Ex game and you are likely to be disappointed. Think of it as, say, a Star Wars game with some Deus Ex elements, and this game starts to make much more sense.

However, I break from that tradition with [i]Invisible War[/i] for two reasons.\n\nFirst, I couldn't get it to work with a base install. Fixing this didn't take long, there are mods to make the game work, but I feel like the very minimum a game should do is be playable. In fact even after this fix I was still getting crashes in the Trier Templar base. So that was strike one.\n\nSecondly, the game is just kind of lame. Not abysmal, not anger-inducing, but an undeniable letdown after [i]Deus Ex[/i]'s brilliance. It's a hard act to follow for sure, but I feel the quality of everything compared to the first game just goes off a cliff. There's no upgradeable skills, and the biomod system has been scaled down so that you'll have everything installed within the first few areas of the game. This takes away customisation as well as the incentive to explore for canisters and skill points. The wide open spaces and complex maps of [i]Deus Ex[/i] have been replaced with much smaller areas to fit on consoles, and the game is much shorter too. I couldn't quite believe it when I was at the final level, we just didn't seem to have [i]done[/i] much.\n\nNow there are some good things about the game. Though the story has been dumbed down a lot, there are still glimpses of interesting concepts and writing. I liked the feud between the two rival coffee shops, both of the names of which are references to Starbucks. It all seems very early 21st century somehow, along with setting the early game in Seattle of all places (pity we couldn't get NPC expys of Frasier and Niles Crane.) The concept of the virtual celebrity AI \"NG Resonance\" was intriguing, and some of the NPC conversations were well-written and voiced. One conversation between a businesswoman and an aspiring novelist in the Cairo Arcology actually got me thinking I was in the game for real for a second, it sounded so natural, like something you'd overhear in an airport lounge. However, for the most part the game's locations don't really draw you in because everything feels sort of unfinished and limited, like they were in a hurry and couldn't do all the things they wanted with the game.\n\nTo summarise, I think this is for [i]Deus Ex[/i] die-hards only, and even then only for completion's sake. There are multiple endings to the game but I honestly didn't feel like going for them...the different factions seemed far less nuanced than in the first game, so I wasn't inspired to join any of them (though the Omar body-mod freaks were entertaining I guess.) There aren't any achievements either.

Not only it is severely outdated and does not support any of the modern features, including aspect ratios above 4:3. Some people also reported that the game doesn't even start, so you have to go out of your way to fix this. Fortunately, I quickly found the solution in Visible Upgrade mod, that fixes most of the issues and adds some helpful features (you can download it by clicking [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-2-visible-upgrade/downloads/visible-upgrade-full-edition]this link[/url], if you want to play this thing anyway). But even after that you have to deal with a lot of issues, like small bugs with the invertory items, or random crashes that can ruin you save file (always have back-up save). I also have to mentions the world of the game is broken i a lot of tiny locations, that are separated by loading screens, which result in the fact that you will see a lot of loading screens. Hope you have a good HDD or an SSD, because otherwise this is going to get very annoying. I honestly have no idea what was going on during the developmant of this game, but i'm sure it was pretty bad. This is the most busted game I've played since Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, but that game is actually good.\n\nSo even if you going to look past all of this nonsense you get a mediocre FPS with RPG elements, that can't stand even close to the legacy of Deus Ex. \nThe story of the game follows Alex D. The student of Tarsus Academy and living experiment in advanced biological modifications. After destruction of his hometown Alex finds himself in the middle of global conspiracy between variety of factions that are over global control over the world and will ultimately lead to the future of humankind. \nUnlike the first game, that had a slow build-up to the initial reveal of the conspiracy behind UNATCO, IW wastes no time and makes you choose between different factions to push further someones interest depending on your role-play. This is probably the best thing that IW has going for it, each faction represents a specific ideology and there is no good or bad choices in deciding who to side with (except Templar). You can be a loyal follower of a specific faction, or be a renegade that will that double and triple cross anyone for his own benefit. Most of the time, even if you betray a specific faction you will have the chance to side with them again, giving you plenty of room to experiment. \nI would say the plot of the game is pretty game is pretty good, but the main problem with it comes from characters, almost all of which are annoying and insufferable. Your fellow trainees of Tarsus are the set of stupid cliches, leaders of factions are self-centered assholes. There is just no one to relate or even care about. Only thing that was stopping me from killing those characters outright was plot convinience, else I would erase those idiots the moment i got a chance. And don't even get me started on what they did to characters from the first game, they were butchered beyond any recognition.\n\nAnd then there is the gameplay. My god, this is terrible. First off, the game was completely dumbed down from the previous installment. Skills were cut from the game, so the only progression comes from biomods, but you can equip only one biomod from 6 different slots. There are 3 possible biomods that you can equip in each slot, bringing total number of mods to 18. Each mod can be upgraded 3 times and if you try to change any mods, it will completely replace your previous mod in that slot, reducing your options drastically compared to previous game. \n\nUI of the game is embodiment of \"style over substance', it is very unintuitive and covers 50% of the screen all the time. Inventory is so small you can carry just handful of items and everything takes one spot in it, from small multiotools to giant rocket launchers. I get that not everyone enjoys inventory tetris of Deus Ex, but system at least made sense and allowed for enough room in creativity in picking what you want to carry. At least we could have slots to work with maybe? And for some reason we can carry only 10 small items in one slot, anything more will take other slot. The biomod ant info menues are also unintuitive, instead of simple diagram or list of things, every little element of the interface tkaes up entire screen and you have to scroll throgu a lot of things to find what you actually need. Want to find a map of your location? Then you have to scroll through every image saved in your database before you can look at map. \n\nThen there is combat, which is terrible. Weapons lack any feedback, have hit-detection issues, have completely incosisted damage and also for some reason have universal ammunition, which means that pistol and SMG use ammo from the same pool as flamethrower and rocket launcher. This leads to complete imbalance of weapons. Melee is most of the time suicide, since you can't upgrade your health to tank enough damage to use it, and misses half the time even if you try to hit enemy point-blank. Grenades can fall trough the floor and take too much time to explode anyway, so enemies can just walk away from them. Most of the game i relied on pistol, because it does not consume too much ammo and can kill most of human enemies in a couple of headshots. Unfortunately, that led to the problem in late game where you fight heavily augmented and/or armored enemies, since they required much more firepower to kill, so you have to use something like rocket launcher. This is completely different from DX1 where you could beat the whole game with just starting pistol, provided you invest some skill-points in it and had enough ammo, because you could kill even toughest of enemies with well placed shot. \n\nAnother pillar of DX game design is stealth which is also completely busted. Enemy AI is very basic and reacts  to everything in nery predictable manner. Enemies react to sound and can't see you in the dark. Cameras have extremely obvious outline and always have convenient security terminal next to them which can be hacked with right mod and allows to bypass any security. There is only two states that enemy can be in, patrolling and alerted, there is no inbetween, which is stupid since Deus Ex has figured it out 3 years before the release of this game. We also had MGS and Splinter Cell and Hitman before IW, but stealth in IW is handled in such stupid way there is no reason for it, once you've been seen, enemies just gather to your location and start blasting in your direction. Also for some reason silencers just do not work, people hear shots with it anyway. \n\nThe only reason I would recommend this to anyone is only you're very curious about history of Deus Ex games or the genre of Immersive Sim games. Otherwise this mediocre game is not worth your time and money. Fortunately now we have a true successor to Deus Ex and a bunch of good games in the Immersive Sim genre. So yeah, you should probably stay away from this one.", "timestamp_created": 1594920573, "timestamp_updated": 1594920573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

que en este  apartado  ha perdido gran parte del carisma y encanto  que tenia el primero,donde antes tenias a JC Denton y sus bromas ahora tienes a Alex que bueno....es bastante plano.\n\nJugablemente es.....es...bastante mediocre y es un paso atras bastante grande con respecto al juego original, los escenarios son muy simples,sin ofrecer muchas rutas y la exploracion es una broma en este juego, las armas son practicamente inutiles y muy poco satisfactorias,es mejor usar una espada y una porra de policia y pasarte casi todo el juego a melee con mejoras que te permitan hacer mas da\u00f1o a melee y acabaras matando o quedando ko a casi todos los enemigos de 2-3 golpes con la excepcion de los enemigos finales que son mas pu\u00f1eteros y necesitaras armas de fuego o granadas.\n\nUn punto \"gris\" es el sistema de mejoras de personaje que es muy simple,demasiado quiza, por lo que esto dependera de como lo veas como jugador, te podra parecer muy aburrido por su simpleza o muy bueno porque no supone un quebradero de cabeza.\n\nUn punto muy negativo es que el juego usa un sistema unificado de municion, todas las armas usan la misma fuente de municion, lo cual es una mierda como una casa porque no te da para llevar mucha municion y si te quedas sin municion estaras bastante jodido en algunas zonas.\n\nEl que haya dise\u00f1ado el HUD del juego puede darse una palmadita en la espalda por crear semejante mierda, es horrible visualmente hablando y para mi gusto llena mucho espacio de la pantalla .\n\nLa Inteligencia artifical tiene mas de artificial que de inteligencia.\n\nGraficamente es una costra muy grande, no tiene nada en especial incluso para un juego de 2004(bueno quiza las sombras e iluminacion pero nada mas), se ve generico,simple y sin nada que llame la atencion a excepcion de 2 o 3 zonas ,acabas aburriendote de lo que ves en muy poco tiempo ademas la resolucion del juego no sube de 1280x1024 y te cambia ademas la resolucion de windows lo cual tienes que estar cambiando la resolucion  cada vez que sales del juego.\n\n\nPunto muy negativo es que el juego tiene pantallas de carga cada 2x3 ,es ridiculo el tama\u00f1o de los mapas y absurdo que tenga que estar cargando una nueva zona cada 2 pasos ,es demasiado molesto incluso aunque a dia de hoy cargues las zonas rapidamente.\n\nEn cuanto a dise\u00f1o de audio y banda sonora tampoco  hay nada bueno ni destacable en general con la unica excepcion del la cancion del menu principal que es un 10/10 pero el resto del juego es como si no existiera la BSO, un paso muy hacia atras con respecto Deus Ex 1 y sus miticas canciones ambientales o el tema principal.", "timestamp_created": 1594911931, "timestamp_updated": 1594912702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Loved it. Played on the 360, got all the achievements and played it like four times... Fantastic game. Played the original Deus Ex after that on my laptop. Was blown away by it. Played Mankind Divided too, excellent game with a lot of untapped potential in terms of it's butchered story. Still loved it though. Could've been the best Deus Ex in my opinion if they hadn't chopped it in half. Got all the important cheevos for that too. Recently I replayed the original Deus Ex (still a banging game) and decided to try Invisible War. It'd always alluded me since I could never get it to work on my laptop as a kid. I'd always heard stuff like \"Oh, it's underrated.\" \"It's better than Human Revolution.\" \"So overlooked.\" Hearing stuff like this down the years got me excited, as you'd expect from someone who really loves Deus Ex and grew up with it. So I installed the Visible Upgrade and got to playing it.\n\nWell. This game is fucking trash.\n\nIt's fucking doodoo. I don't know what Harvey Smith and Warren Spector were smoking, but I wanna try it! First of all it has to be the most claustrophobic video game I've EVER played. And I've played Deus Ex's PS2 port! I understand the original Xbox's RAM size was the limiting factor for this but oh my god. Am I supposed to believe Seattle, despite the absolutely bleak cyberpunk setting is a hive of tiny favelas? The RPG systems are so dumb compared to the original Deus Ex as well, to the point I felt almost insulted with the lack of choice coming straight off the original game. FIVE biomod slots? Seriously? The dialogue is also weird as fuck, with long pauses between each line. I picked the white guy, as I am also a white guy so that is very relatable. So looking at this Jersey Shore-looking motherfucker with his jaw agape about some nonsense for a second didn't exactly enhance my enjoyment of the game\n\nIt also feels like the game has a super form of mouse acceleration? The first few minutes in playing a Deus Ex game, you shouldn't think 'I should play this with my Xbox controller.'  I will give it that the gunplay is better than the original (that's not particularly hard.) and I do like that you have the choice of faction. One thing I did wish for in the original is the choice to stay with UNATCO, but they did improve on that by letting you choose what you want here, instead of pressing a button for a different ending. So bonus points for improving how the world reacts to your choices. \n\nBut no, otherwise, this is garbage. Maybe there is a good game in here and I'll put my big boy pants on to finish it, but I'll pretend I'm not playing a Deus Ex game. I'm pretty sure now anyone who says this game is underrated and better than Human Revolution is sniffing ketamine off a toilet seat.

Console gamers still didn't get it, because it wasn't Super Mario Brothers and didn't have enough bright cheerful colours, so it didn't do well there and it didn't do well on PC either.  While it has been fixed up a little, the game still runs poorly on PC. \n\nConsoles make gaming worse.  It's with great sorrow, this gets a thumbs down.  If it wasn't made for Xbox instead of PC, it wouldn't have these problems and it would be a bargain at $10.

This game is such a letdown and a downgrade from the original Deus Ex game, which was released 3 years prior to this game:\n\n- [b]The story is more simplified[/b]: This is such a letdown considering that the first game had more depth when it came to story, now it is just basic, all character feel generic and uninteresting, and some of the story elements don't make sense and are not even close to realistic. \n\n- [b]The protagonist is dull[/b]: their writing and dialogue options are awful and just looking at them makes me want to vomit.\n\n- [b]Awful writing[/b]: the writing is so simplified and the dialogue choices are downright terrible.\n\n- [b]Terrible HUD[/b]: The HUD is a downgrade from its predecessor. I hate the circular HUD; it's distracting and doesn't look good at all ingame.\n\n- [b]Bad tutorials[/b]: The game bombards you with tutorials in the first few levels, and some of which are ridiculous and just unnecessary. \n\n- [b]Universal ammo[/b]: all weapons use the same ammo, ALL OF THEM. I mean why? why would they do that?\n\n- [b]Health system downgraded[/b] now it's just one health bar instead of one for each body region (head, right leg, left leg, etc.), which defeats the purpose of being a cyborg.\n\n- [b]Skills completely removed[/b]: no specializations, which makes our character even more bland and generic.\n\n- [b]Atrocious level design[/b]: remember how big Liberty City and Area 51 were in the first Deus Ex? since this is a console game they made the maps smaller and claustrophobic. They focused more on their new lighting system and added minor upgrades in textures instead of map size.\n\n- [b]Doesn't work on modern PCs[/b]: why is it that I can play the first Deus Ex fine with no issues and not this game? Apparently playing it on GOG fixes most of the game's problems.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nI don't have anything else to say; I won't even praise some of its new features as it doesn't deserve it.

Removed from the hype of IW's release and by judging the game on its own merits as opposed to how it stacked up to the previous instalment, one of PC gaming's greatest RPGs, IW's retrospective reviews have been a lot kinder to the stealth/shooter (not RPG) sequel.\n\nGraphically the game holds up with nice lighting and textures. Ironically it was these great looks that were one of the reasons that fans were divided in 2003, as only the top gaming rigs of the time could power IW; while those on Xbox had no trouble. Unfortunately the environments outshine the character models who look, sound, and stand about like shop floor mannequins. The HUD is also big and ugly and obscures a lot. The worlds themselves are a big step down from the original. They don't feel alive and inhabited like New York and Hong Kong did in the first Deus Ex. They're a lot smaller too, with the final battle against Bob Page in the first game taking up more room than Seattle and Cairo do in this one. The 'open worlds' are one of the ways IW really shows off its Xboxness. Every 50 meters you'll be met with a loading screen taking you to another small, explorable area, a far cry from the mostly seem-less worlds of Deus Ex.\n\nGameplay wise IW keeps the lackluster stealth system of the original, where enemies run around screaming with three tranq darts sticking out of their heads, but this time also fails to make a compelling FPS. I can understand a silenced pistol not downing an enemy in one quick headshot, but when it takes three point blank headshots from a high-powered shotgun before an enemy turns into an admittedly fun rag doll, I start to wonder what the correct play style is. And its not like your character is going to get any better at handling high-powered shotguns at pointblank ranges either, in the first game a gun's kickback made you feel like a little girl but by the end a careful distribution of experience points meant you could run through Area 51 while little girly MJ12 super soldiers were blasted apart by your GEP gun. But IW has no skill tree or character progression, hence my earlier refusal to call it an RPG.\n\nFollowing the pattern of not living up to the original, IW's story falls well short of the Alex Jones inspiring conspiracy of Deus Ex. I mean all the sames pieces are there: globetrotting, shadow governments, post-human bio modifications, foreign and domestic terror cells, post-9/11 defence and privacy Acts made to curb foreign and domestic terror cells, plagues, aliens, alien plagues, the Illuminati, but this time the conspiracy fails to inspire. The story this time is simpler and easier to follow, but that's far from an improvement. And it's a lot easier to engross oneself in a fictional conspiracy when you can look up the Trilateral Commission and see that it's a real thing with real political influence. The only Omar I know is my Pakistani school friend. And I highly doubt the major religions of the world are going to start co-existing in a one-world global faith any time soon.\n\nWhether on its own or as a sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War fails to excite. The game can't save the story and the story can't save the game; and if you really want to know what happens to humanity after the defeat of Bob Page, the ambiguity and moral greyness of Deus Ex's endings are much more thought-provoking than anything offered here.", "timestamp_created": 1590307982, "timestamp_updated": 1590307982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69681014": {"recommendationid": "69681014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060378451", "num_games_owned": 1445, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 883, "last_played": 1590258296}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as the first one but still an amazing game only downsides are that its short, bad UI and things like biomods, inventory management, notes etc. are worse than the first game.

Want to find your objective, no matter what part of the game you're in or what your objective is? It's just down the hall. That's because DX:IW was designed to run on a console with less than 100 megabytes of DDR1 RAM, which will go down in history as one of the worst development blunders of its time. It takes place exclusively in sparsely populated hallways, which is exactly as jarring and unrealistic as it seems on paper, and results in a game that's far too short and too easy. It's also stuffed to the gills with the awful voice acting of its era.\n\nWith that said, it's still my favorite Deus Ex game. What's to like? The controls, to start with, are much better than DX1's - there's no more looking for the semicolon key in the middle of a gunfight. Several returning biomods (Light, Combat Strength, Microfibral Muscle, Run Silent) no longer drain energy, and manual biomod activation is only required when it makes sense (e.g. Light is manually activated, Run Silent is passive). The soundtrack is also the best in the series; it perfectly matches the tone and atmosphere of the game.\n\nWhat makes IW one of my all-time favorites is the nearly unrivaled variety of ways to approach every part of it. By that I don't simply mean \"every mission objective has multiple branches\", but \"every last item container, door, and NPC can be dealt with in at least 4 distinct ways\". It makes a game that's already too easy even easier, but it's worth it. It's the type of game where \"I'm going to set that guy on fire\" is usually a valid plan, yet you're never required to set anyone or anything on fire, even during the quest that's explicitly about setting coffee beans on fire. It's one of the few games that doesn't invoke the feeling of an invisible, clueless middleman \"correcting\" your decisions in realtime by artificially limiting the solutions to problems.\n\ntl;dr Deus Ex: Invisible War was an innovative, but severely flawed game. 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1587843832, "timestamp_updated": 1587843832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480686336755752563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67839335": {"recommendationid": "67839335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019582300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 608, "last_played": 1471359192}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't understand the bashing this game has received for 16 years.

Deus Ex: Invisible War is perhaps the most controversial title in the community. Some think it's a giant disrespect to its predecessor, some consider it simply being misunderstood and overly ambitous. In this review, I will try to describe the good, the bad and straight up ugly of the sequel to one of the most treasured titles in gaming history.\n\n[b]FOLLOWING REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE[/b]\n\nDE:IW picks up several years after the ending of the original Deus Ex. Or, I should rather say, endings. Deus Ex (2000) had three possible endings. Developers at Ion Storm, in an effort to appease every player, instead of choosing one canonical ending, combined all three endings of the original into one. This left hardcore fans confused as they questioned why JC (protagonist of Deus Ex) would ever make such conflicting decisions. However, this is the story we got.\n\nIn DE:IW we follow Alex D (some writer really must have thought it sounds cool and edgy). Alex can be either male or female and can choose a color of their skin, a feature returning from Deus Ex (2000). One of the criticisms of its predecessor was the fact that players were unable to side with a faction until the last mission. Invisible War offers you quests from four vastly different political and ideological groups:\n- Order Church (spiritual, envitoment-friendly, religious movement)\n- Knights Templar (purists fighting for augmentation-free future)\n- World Trade Organization (international organization looking to control the world through trade)\n- Omar (society of heavily augmented cyborgs)\n\nTheir quests are often contradicting, so you will have to keep making decisions. After everything is said and done, it doesn't really matter who you side with. That is because the only \"true\" choice which has any impact on the story, comes at the very end. You approach a security console and pick your ending. The only original ending is for the Omar who ask you to [spoiler]kill all faction leaders thus plunging the world into apocalypse[/spoiler].\n\nThe biggest change came in terms of gameplay. While Deus Ex (2000) had several big open sandbox missions (e.g. Liberty Island) with multiple styles of approach, Invisible War had to make cuts wherever possible. The game was primarily developed for consoles which resulted in small areas obstructed with loading zones. Steam says I beat DE:IW in 12 hours (also completing every side quest and achieving every ending). Out of those 12 hours, around 2 are spent just waching loading bars. The game also likes to crash and doesn't like any OS other than Windows XP. Good luck getting this to work on Windows 7 and higher.\n\nIW also cut corners in the augmentation system. In Deus Ex (2000) player had the option to augment various parts of their body (cranial, eyes, torso, arms, legs and subdermal). Some parts (e.g. torso) were able to hold up to 3 augments and each augment could be upgraded to level 4. Deus Ex (2000) on top of it featured upgradable skills like picklocking, hacking, swimming, melee damage etc. This allowed each player to create their own playstyle and build a character focused on stealth, a skilled hacker or a walking tank. IW simplifies the entire augmentation system. The skill tree is gone completely and Alex can now only hold 6 augments, each upgradable up to level 3, severely limiting freedom of player\u2019s choice.\n\nNPC AI isn\u2018t something to write home about. Enemies are sometimes able to spot you in pitch darkness and can hear your footsteps even while crouching and installing the \u201edampen your footsteps\u201c augment. This puts stealth players at disadvantage. Frankly, the only viable way to play is to rush enemies. Your character is 10x more powerful than any NPC anyway and bots can be shut down with a couple of EMP grenades. In Deus Ex (2000) JC was powerful too but only at later stages of the story and with proper augments. One shot from a sniper rifle could kill you instantly. In IW, you are showered with augmenation canisters during the tutorial mission.\n\nThe only redeeming factors of IW are the story and graphics. The story is very much in style with Deus Ex universe, intended for mature audiences. The globetrotting element is still present, you will visit cities like Seattle, Cairo and even Antarctica at one point. Smaller areas allowed developers to put greater detail in environment with dynamic lighting and shadows and realistic physics.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n+ story\n+ graphics\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- gameplay limitations\n- broken stealth system\n- doesn\u2019t run well on newer OS\n\n[b]SUMMARY:[/b]\nDE:IW is not a great starting point to the franchise. For that, I would suggest Human Revolution. If you are a fan and thirsty for a Deus Ex experience, give IW a go.

It goes nowhere near Deus Ex 1, but I'm gonna leave my review as recommending just as a counterweight to mixed reviews and to encourage people to be patient with this game.\n\nAs the continuity of Deus Ex: 3/10\nAs the standalone game: 5.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1587414544, "timestamp_updated": 1596488346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757445216178894043", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67540486": {"recommendationid": "67540486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026509471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1541049479}, "language": "english", "review": "if you ever compare the game with the first part, it becomes pathetic, its not going to get you moving to figure out its story and all. and It feels kind of uninspired.Its average game otherwise by itself and something to kill time with.", "timestamp_created": 1587190062, "timestamp_updated": 1587190062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67458990": {"recommendationid": "67458990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360330464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 324, "last_played": 1592718981}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1587075555, "timestamp_updated": 1587075555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479797959327697754", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67401722": {"recommendationid": "67401722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137284043", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 732, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 868, "last_played": 1586997388}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's the thing with this game: It's not terrible by itself, but it barely adds anything to the first game.\n\nThe gunplay is somewhat better, even though all weapons use the same ammo.

The game crashed on my computer (which is well above the baseline requirements), and when it did run it ran at a very low framerate. It also has no controller support, but granted the original Deus Ex didn't either (but you'd think it would have controller support since it was made for the Xbox). It's terribly optimized because, as aforementioned, it was made for the original Xbox with it's hardware limitations and controller scheme in mind. Design wise, the HUD is terrible and disorienting. It's super claustrophobic, and it reduces the field of view a ton. You're basically controlling Alex Denton through one of those small portholes that are in cheap cruise rooms.\n\nIf you're really into the story, just read up on it. You can obviously see that I haven't beat the whole game, but I've read up on it because I was a fan of the first Deus Ex and basically it's not nearly as good. The only really likable characters are Paul Denton and JC Denton, who miraculously is still a well written and intriguing character. If you really care about the story just go read it.\n\nEverything feels very dumbed down. The roleplaying mechanics are simplified and streamlined (think from Elder Scrolls IV to V) in favor of making it more appealing to an FPS audience. Speaking of which, the shooting mechanics are also terrible. When you pull a gun out, it will flail around on your screen as you move (the guns are also surprisingly small). And shooting enemies is not fun at all; from the get go the firefights were very lame and involved standing almost still because I could barely maneuver with the bad field of view and HUD screaming at me to \"Press F for flashlight\" or \"Press left mouse to shoot\" every time I pulled my pistol out.\n\nThere's so many better games you can play.\n\nTL/DR: It's original Deus Ex as a mediocre action movie.

Many of the criticisms along that line are sensible; Invisible War does remove/change much of what made Deus Ex a great game (the realism, the RPG system, etc.).  However, the amount of angst this game attracts is unreasonable.\n\nThis is still a good, solid, playable game.  You have an RPG system in which you choose dialogue responses and can opt to side with several different factions (though I find it funny that you can side with any one of them right up to the very end of the game and that each one wants you to do so; you'd think one or two of these groups would have written you off as a possibility after you killed squad after squad of their troops).  I enjoyed the RPG elements, though I missed the skill system from the first game.  Combat was never a strength of the original; more so even than other Unreal Engine games, moving and shooting in Deus Ex was incredibly awkward; Invisible War is definitely more fluid; also, you start the game out being able to aim accurately, whereas in Deus Ex your crosshair wanders back and forth until you level up your aiming skills (y'know, because advanced cyborg agents who, by Walton Simons's account, cost 50 billion dollars would totally be sent out into the field without having been trained/upgraded to be deadly marksmen; granted, inflation by 2052 would make 50 billion worth 10-20 billion in today's dollars, but that's still pretty expensive).  The music for both games was composed by Alexander Brandon; interestingly, he took different approaches; the first game has very defined themes; the second has much more ambient, moody music.  I know some people dislike it, but I found it to be fine; it created a bit of a sense of wonder, thinking about what had become humanity in 2072 and how I could affect it.  \n\nJust as in Deus Ex (and the BioShock series), the right combination of biomods will be OP as all hell.  Come at me world; I'm Alex Goddamn D.  \n\nProbably the biggest criticism against Invisible War is the restrictive level design coupled with long loading times (loading times initiated by the game crashing itself and reopening in order to load the next zone).  I imagine those times must have been awful on machines at the time of release; nowadays they're pretty quick.  Still, perhaps the biggest strength of Deus Ex was how BIG and intricate it was, both in terms of story and level design.  Here, it's small and intricate.  This one has standing with fans because this change is a result of developing the game for the Xbox, a machine with RAM about equal to my TI-83 graphing calculator from high school; with the console plebs to blame for the downfall of their favorite game, the PC master race has stoned Invisible War with gusto ever since.  \n\nInvisible War is different compared to Deus Ex; in some ways it is inferior, in some it is better.  I think it's a worthwhile game to play.  Also, this game has aged rather gracefully in terms of looks (besides the NPCs with their Marty Feldman eyes; they look a bit demented; that made me chuckle quite a bit while playing).  For a 2003 game, it holds up visually quite well.  Sure, it's not Half-Life 2 or PainKiller in terms of aging like Jennifer Connelly, but I find it a good-looking game today.", "timestamp_created": 1584452007, "timestamp_updated": 1584457730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65126899": {"recommendationid": "65126899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198871168112", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 3424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1204, "last_played": 1654387518}, "language": "english", "review": "I Don't think its as bad as some say it is, def not as good as the 1st", "timestamp_created": 1584331404, "timestamp_updated": 1584331404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65069887": {"recommendationid": "65069887", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989778270", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1584167635}, "language": "english", "review": "FOR\nBetter than Deus Ex (1st release) for story, visuals and fluid movement\n\nAGAINST\nVery slow progression of RPG skills and capabilities\nHopelessly limited storage in backpack.

Well I ain't hopping on that train cause I enjoyed 'Invisible War' even more than the original. What is there not to love about this game? You get a great story, one that's perhaps just a little less sophisticated than that in 'Deus Ex', but great nonetheless. You get amazing gameplay created in Unreal Engine 2 and reinforced with Havok v2.0 physics. You get the same kinda atmosphere that the original had. The levels are a bit smaller, but personally I liked them even better. So why hate this game so much?

It took me a few hours to get over the chunky dead-eyed graphics and painful console interface but after I did I was surprised how similar it felt to the original. Sure the skill tree is completely gone and the biomods have been way stripped back (I ended up with a huge surplus by the end of the game) but it still feels very Deus Ex. Plenty of vents to crawl through and side missions to keep you occupied.\n\nThe universal ammo system was a controversial decision at the time but it does mean you can just use your favorite gun the entire game without worrying about having to switch to something else due to lack of ammo. Inventory space also feels very limited, especially considering there about 10 different types of grenades/mines available. Also the grenade throwing is horrible in this game, you throw everything about 100m and they bounce around like crazy, making it a total crap-shoot.\n\nFaction-based quest system is pretty much what you'd expect except there is zero loyalty recorded throughout the game so can you consequence-free pick-up/drop faction quests whenever you like, right up until the final stage. The AI is also dumb as bricks. Shoot a guard with a silenced sniper rifle, anyone nearby will run to inspect the body. Repeat until you have a pile of corpses consisting of every guard in the area.\n\nAlso no-kill runs are basically impossible in this game due to these armored types that show up later in the game (there is no biomod to sneak past humans in this game, only bots), though from what I could tell it doesn't actually make any difference to the story or NPC interactions whether you kill or knockout people. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are a fan of the original you owe it to yourself to suck up the first few hours and get to the good stuff, there's a kernel of a good game here.

Well, after playing this game for myself several years ago and finishing it (somehow), I can say with confidence that 90% of the derision is justified.\n\nThis is not a good game, not by a long shot. It's no secret that all aspects of the gameplay have been simplified to the point that it feels like a budget FPS title. Levels are stupidly small and are literally a series of corridors and small rooms off them. The city hubs don't feel expansive enough at all. Highlight in terms of levels is Antarctica but even that place is dull in Deus Ex 2. \n\nThe story was really uninteresting, until you meet JC Denton, suspended in ice and there he gives you an ultimatum for the story that really makes sense, at least for a well-thought out sci-fi world like Deus Ex.

It had too much to live up to. This is all wrong. The game's just shite. Even if it wasn't coming directly after Deus Ex, it would still be shite.\n\nThis game was released in a time after plenty of great immersive sims. It tries to be an immersive sim itself, but it shits on so many of the core concepts of the genre. Between being a technical mess and a creative mess, there's really not much to like.\n\nA couple of huge bugs ruined the game for me. It took me a solid hour to just get the game running at 1920 x 1080, with a respectable field of view, good controls and the ability to play for more than a few minutes without crashes. Even after fixing this mess, I ended up causing another issue. Now the game wouldn't even boot from Steam. I had to launch it from its folder every time. Then, it started crashing badly enough to prevent any other programs from appearing over it. I had to keep a command prompt open with a 'taskkill' command in history just to shut the game down sometimes. At random times, the game might also just decide that a certain save you made is a bad save, and then crash the game every time you load it.\n\nBut sure, there's still a game underneath. What's it like? Kinda terrible. \n\nAugmentations (biomods) are limited severely. There are only five biomod slots, and the kind of abilities you could buy using skill points are locked to these biomods now. With only five slots, you're forced to choose between some basic abilities. If you want to be able to hack computers, you've gotta give up your cloaking ability. If you want to use spy drones, you have to give up the ability to regenerate. This wouldn't be so bad if certain biomods weren't absolutely essential to playing the game.\n\nCloaking and thermal masking are practically mandatory to even maintain a semblance of stealth. Even with those augs, stealth was usually impossible. Footsteps are far too loud. People will hear you crouch walking from about five meters away. There's a biomod to quiet your footsteps, but if you take that, you'll never be able to use any other biomods in that slot. Choose at the beginning of the game whether you want to be able to sneak or jump high. There's no middleground.\n\nWithout a proper skill point system, you basically decide on your character's \"build\" right at the beginning of the game. You're just as powerful at the beginning as you are at the end, except for a couple of upgrades to your augs. There's no character progression as you'd expect in an immersive sim. You're not building up to that point where you're unstoppable.\n\nAmmo is also pretty weird. Every weapon in the game draws from a central pool of this abstract thing called \"ammo\". A top-secret, highly-experimental railgun uses the same ammo that your pistol does. A flamethrower uses the same ammo your pistol does. You might not be getting this concept, because it's really fucking strange. Imagine that your magazines are somehow telekinetically-linked across each weapon. If you fire one shot of your pistol then it'll also drain one shot from the magazines of all your other guns. Even flamethrowers. Fucking strange. And also there's no reload button...\n\nYeah, weird for that to be missing, right? I looked it up, too. There's just no way to reload. Since your magazines are shared across every weapon, you could fire three shots from your shotgun, then swap to your hitherto fully-loaded SMG to find that there's only one bullet left in its mag. Stupid system. Takes all the complexity away from managing ammo like in System Shock or the original Deus Ex. A designer actually looked at this and thought \"yeah, that's good enough\".\n\nThe story is interesting. Not good, not bad. It feels almost pointless, and alien to the world that the first game started to build. In true Deus Ex fashion though, it puts you in the middle of a couple of powerful people and asks you to consider which person is right.\n\nNo music, for some reason. You can make out faint whispers of an actual soundtrack in some places, but most of the game is just dead quiet. Coming from the original's monumental fucking two hour long soundtrack, this game's half hour soundtrack is just disappointing.\n\nI guess there's some traces of Deus Ex in here, but ultimately it's just a frustrating mess that left me wanting to play the original again. There are a couple of other minor issues like not being able to enter keycodes or logins manually and the physics engine treating every object like it's made of feathers. You can't really stack objects and stand on them anymore.\n\nIt's really just an immersive sim and RPG with the trademark mechanics of those genres dumbed down or stripped out entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1569188196, "timestamp_updated": 1593607832, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43790242075920105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55191316": {"recommendationid": "55191316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801485790", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1694052185}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, I try all the steps and my screen goes BLACK!

DX 1 should be played before this game.\n\n\nDeus Ex 2 takes place years after the events of the first game and is the same type of game; that being a story focused first person shooter with stealth and RPG elements.  Compared to the first game some elements have been simplified, particularly in the RPG department.\n\nThe largest and first noticed change is the complete removal of skills, and by extension XP.  You will no longer gain XP rewards for completing objectives and exploring.  Instead, all rewards are either: augments, money or items.  This gives less incentive to explore for those alternate paths (there are almost always multiple ways to get through an area and complete objectives).  The lack of skills also means that there is less variation in which alternate paths are suited for your build.  All weapons are used at the equivalent of master skill level and lockpicks and multitools have been merged into a single item, with each lock taking a fixed amount of tools to open.  Hacking has been changed into an augment.\n\nThe augment system is less complicated than the first game.  Whether or not it is better and more balanced is debatable, though I believe it to be an overall improvement.  Rather than having augment items fixed to specific slots, you are free to install them however you want.  Each slot has 3 options to choose from; one of which is always a black market option which requires a special black market canister that is entirely separate from the regular canister items.  The same items are also used to upgrade augments, so you can fully customize the order in which you obtain and level up your augments.  An interesting feature is that you can replace augments with others by using the canisters; a kind of respec.  \n\nThe inventory has been changed to a simple system where every item takes up a single slot; a rocket launcher and grenade take up the same amount of \u201cspace\u201d.  This means you can carry more weapons but limits the amount of small consumable items that you would be able to carry in lieu of a variety of weapons.  There are 2 features that stand out: one is that food stacks in a single slot to a high number, such that a full stack of food might offer more healing than a full stack of med kits (I did not test this).  Like in Dx 1, you can simply pause the game to eat as much as you want to restore health, even in the middle of battle.  The other is that multi tools seem to come in 2 varieties that will not stack.  I suspect this is a coding holdover from the lockpicks and multitools from the first game; it is annoying and should not have made it past testing.\n\nMost of the weapons from the original return and all guns have a Perfect Dark style alternate fire mode bound to right click, which are useful and fun to use.  The sniper rifle is the only weapon with any kind of aim down sight/scope, though there is nothing wrong with the gunplay.  All guns use the same ammo in varying amounts.  This feels like an actual futuristic innovation because universal ammo is tactically and logistically superior; kind of reminds me of the ammo blocks from Mass Effect.  Upgrades are stronger, often come with unique effects and multiple copies of the same cannot be installed.  Grenades and mines have alternate fire modes but otherwise lack the universal nature of ammo; each type of grenade and mine takes up an inventory slot making it difficult to carry a variety.\n\nStealth is a major focus of the game and has been improved from the first game.  Firstly, stealth is more difficult because your own footsteps can alert enemies, even while crouched.  This is more pronounced on hard surfaces (which are the most prevalent surface) and makes the move silently augment more valuable than it was in the first game.  Enemies will become suspicious and make comments on some unusual things, such as disabled cameras and turrets.  There was one time where I took out a guard and hid the body.  When another guard walked by he became suspicious, possibly because he could see the other guard\u2019s dropped weapon and ammo.  This only happened a single time so I am not sure of how deep the stealth system actually goes.  I can say that the enemy AI is reasonably good.\n\nHacking is simplified from the previous game.  Computer passwords are treated more like physical keys in that you are not able to use a computer without first finding the password.  No guessing or looking up passwords outside the game.  I like this system better precisely because you can\u2019t cheat by looking up the passwords!  The main structure of the levels and how the game plays is largely the same as the first game; there are plenty of optional things to do, multiple ways to complete objectives, actions that have repercussions later on and different factions to side with.  \n\nInvisible War both simplifies and innovates upon Deus Ex while giving an overall similar gameplay experience.  Though there are a few bugs and steps backward, the only really lacklustre aspect of the game is its length, which is significantly shorter than both 1 and 3.\n\n\nPro\n[list]\n [*]Great user customization for augment progression\n [*]Can climb up onto things like crates, and into vents that are not at floor level\n [*]All weapons use the same ammo pool, which gives a strong sense of future tech\n [*]Good story, setting, characters and voice acting\n [*]Alternate modes for each weapon/explosive\n [*]Levels and objectives with multiple routes\n [*]Good immersive enemy AI\n [*]Can mostly freely backtrack through current level and you choose when to progress to the next level\n[/list]\n\nCon\n[list]\n [*]Fewer inventory spots for small items\n [*]Less keybinding options.

What this mainly lacks in comparison to original is that it has a worse upgrade system, tinier areas and in general this game features constant loading screens. But worst of all is how glitchy this game is, starting from basic technical aspects like aspect ratio, okay, I can play in the square, but after each loading screen it kills my recording software from recording as well as force my PC's default screen resolution as game's... It's somewhat annoying that everytime i quit the game I have to go to settings and change screen resolution back to normal. Also, game sometimes crashes, luckily in my case only about 5 times in my whole playthrough, so it's acceptable.\n\nThen there are in-game glitches, there are dozens of them. Starting from minor ones like side NPCs dialogue skips, dialogues with no sound, different dialogue being said than what's in subtitles, dialogue sound shifting between louder and more silent.\nAnd then there are major ones... Climbing ladders and stairs is broken, you sometimes can get stuck on them or get insane slow-downs in your speed, sometimes you can climb stairs and get stuck a bit under floor and in such occasion the only fix is to get back to the stairs or you'll walk 5x slower. Same with ladder, you climb and suddenly get 5x slower you get back to normal when you finish climbing, but you can't even jump off, you have to climb up the whole way. Another annoying glitches include physics that fire the me off if i climb on them. But worst of all is that inventory is broken, sometimes it lets me pick items when the inventory is full and the item is then forever gone to the unknown. Also, a few times the game made all of my food supply just disappear after getting to a new area, it only happens with food though (and that is very lucky, because it would be even more awful if I lost my guns or something more important), but it happened 3 or 4 times... I lost about 70-90 food items in total...\n\nBesides everything, in later game the enemy health becomes ridiculously huge, I know I'm supposed to be stealthy, but you can't even do stealthy takedows since their health is too big to take them down unnoticed.\n\nBut even though the game is quite broken from start to finish it is still worth playing because gameplay is quite fun, stealth and exploration are pretty great, but what really shines is the story and missions. How many of the side and main missions are connected and tangled with each other is truly great writing.

Unfortunately, it's steeped in many infamous flaws which seek to downright ruin the game for Deus Ex fans, and people who stumble upon it in particular alike.\n\nIt took me two years after my Deus Ex 1 playthrough to finally get around to playing it's heavily divided, and controversial sequel. After finishing the game, I can definitely see why people don't mind this game, and also why people hate this game with all of their heart.\n\nInvisible War strips away so many mechanics, depth, and other things people loved about the first game. It is horrendously butchered in many areas, and over-simplified. As far as I know, the game was developed as an [b]original Xbox release[/b], with it's PC version feeling like a port of their game developed specifically for a console. Deus Ex as a series has been on consoles before the prequels. Deus Ex 1 found it's way on the PS2 as \"Deus Ex: The Conspiracy\", a few years before this game's release. However, although the PS2 port was minorly dumbed down to put on a console, It wasn't built for a console from the ground up. Invisible War unfortunately, carries that stench that's immediately obvious as soon as you see the game's UI for the first time. Console limitations are very much abundant. \n\nThe gameplay is still in it's own way, Deus Ex. Just unfortunately, it all comes together to feel watered down to myself, and probably most people considering this game's negative reputation. Invisible War still has augmentations, weapon upgrades, and different approaches to problems. Areas are also much smaller than you'd expect (most likely because of the weird limitations stuff). It's definitely enjoyable and playable, if you set your mind to it.\n\nThe story is alright, although littered with info dumps that feel lazy & rushed. I preferred the lategame story rather than the early to midgame story. It ramps up really well, and the different endings are still great like you'd expect in a Deus Ex game.\n\nThis specific steam release is hot garbage. I started up the game and was greeted with a beautiful cursed resolution of 10x10 (not literally 10x10 but it was one of the lowest ive ever seen my desktop go to). What you need to do to fix that, is download the \"Deus Ex 2 Visible Upgrade\" mod. It implements many QoLs to make the game run on modern systems, while also containing a texture update pack that was lost to time. Here's a link to said mod. [b]https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=147423[/b]\n\nAll in all, it's enjoyable if you go in without high expectations, and if you wait a while like I did after a Deus Ex 1 playthrough.\n\nI haven't played the mobile port \"The Fall\", so I can't tell you if I enjoy this over that. But I can tell you that this is the weakest link in comparison to Deus Ex 1, Human Revolution, and Mankind Divided.

The original is one of my favorite games of all time but I'd actually say this is the 2nd best in the franchise (haven't played MD). This game is a great fit for the right audience.\n\nCons:\n- Everything feels kind of soft. Graphics have a soft feel, level designs and objects are beveled or rounded, the tactile \"feel\" of combat is soft. (Although combat is still satisfying in its way.)\n- Areas are made of many small zones. Game was also released for Xbox so they had to build for that.\n- Somewhat short. But for $7 I'd definitely say its worth it.\n\nPros:\n- Writing. Writing. Writing. Especially if you're looking for subtle, realistic, intelligent writing. It's practically as good as the original. (DE:IW had the same lead writer.) Almost every NPC has a subtle and complete personality; they're not going to tell you their life story because people don't actually do that with strangers. But you can feel it. You're meant to read between the lines. And what they say - and how they say it - isn't designed to spoon-feed the player with simple lessons, easy morals, or simple caricatures. Nor does it make a point of showing \"How People Can Be Complex\". They're not complex and subtle to make a point, they're complex and subtle because real people are. And the intelligent characters actually speak and act as intelligent characters. The characters who are supposed to be skilled deceivers are likely to deceive you (compare Human Revolution where Taggart sounds obviously superficial). Nor does the game pick one theme that dominates almost every quest and conversation (compare Human Revolution where people hardly talk about anything besides augmentation). This kind of subtlety and realism isn't what everyone wants in a game; that's totally fine. But if it's what you're looking for then this game (and the original) are top-of-class. Said another way: the lead writer got a degree in math from MIT and English from Harvard, simultaneously. IF you want to interact with characters written by someone like that, when the writer is not holding back, then check this game out.\n- Plot/Story, separate from characters. The plot holds up quiet well. The plot makes sense with the world they've set up. Things are thought through. Almost every fiction (book/film/game etc) has plot holes but some fictions, like this one, have few. There are some story elements or character actions that didn't make sense to me but years later I understood them. The drama isn't tacked-on or manufactured by emotional NPCs telling you that something matters; if you're paying attention you will learn on your own how important the events of the game world are to the people in it. The world is consistent and the consequences are logical.\n- Acting is pretty good, honestly. It's frequently subtle and restrained, however. This is by design but it's not to everyone's taste. (Personally I like it.)\n\nIn summary, really great immersive sim.

The Mixed Reviews status this game has threw me off for a moment, but I wanted to figure out why it was in this state.\n\nand god frickin darn it i should have stayed away from this game\n\nFirst, the story felt pale in comparison to Deus Ex, or otherwise known as the GOTY Edition on Steam.\nGame was built to fit both the PC and Xbox (big mistake) so that may or may not have led into issues within the PC version of the game... notably, the size of the locations throughout the game. I felt so crunched in with every world, it actually made me feel claustrophobic.\nCrash issues out the ass. At first, I thought it was due to the weapons, specifically the SMG, firing on my screen all at once. Then, I began running into crashes in the lower Antarctica, even in the Arcology in Cairo which I had no idea why. I can't tell what it's all about.\nSoundtrack was really, really, REALLY boring to me. Not a single track (besides the licensed ones from Kidneythieves) appealed to me at all.\nWeapon mods were nerfed.\nStorage space nerfed, too.\nBiomods, though a neat change with upgrading, kinda felt lackluster.\nBesides Tong, Chad and Nicolette, we don't even know what happened to the remaining cast of Deus Ex. No Jacobson, no Reyes, no Jock.\nOh, and I pretty much let everyone Alex knew from the Academy die. Klara, Leo, and Billie, all on my first playthrough. To be fair, they dawned onto me as pretty bland characters. Besides Leo, he's kinda alright.\n\nOh, and I also fell off the map and to my death in that Germany map because I collided with a fucking box.\n\nThat's pretty much all I can say about this game, really. I was expecting a bit more from this sequel, but all I got in return was disappointment. Not the worst game, though - I've seen worse.

In Invisible war, you just don't care about anyone, kill them all and stuff them in dumpsters.\n\n* Music: The music is almost non exsistant, in some parts it remixes the music from the first game, or adds generic ambient sound, nothing memorable.\n\n* Gameplay: Extremly dumbed down, 12 slots to store items, by the end of the game you have thousands of credits that you have no use for since you reach max upgrades too fast. Lockpicking and Electronics bypassing is now a single tool. Bio mods are few and uninteresting. Ammo is a single universal meter, completely removing everything that made the first game interesting, stripping all the details of the world. \n\nOverall its an extremly dumbed down game, you walk trough boring corridors troughout the whole game with a ton of loading screens, talk to boring characters.

Those cute little beasts that are responsible for the death of the [b]AAA[/b] PC gaming as we used to know it. When you hear \u201cbad port\u201d nowadays, it usually means things like low [b]FPS[/b] and other technical stuff. While the game itself stays pretty much the same on all platforms. But it wasn't always like that. Back in the days, when they wanted the game to be represented on both PCs and consoles, very often they've made two drastically different versions. Up until some smartass appeared and said: \u201cHey! Let's just make one version for all systems! It'll save us a lot of money!\u201d. And that was when s***t hit the fan. The thing is \u2013 even though both consoles and computers are totally cool in their own way, they are completely different by their nature. Just look at [b]DCS World[/b] and [b]Ace Combat[/b]. Both are a lot of fun, but... it's a different kind of fun. For different people / different needs. Computers allow more complicated gameplay, while consoles are famous for more basic, but addictive fun. Unfortunately, when the \u201cbig change\u201d began, a lot of the complicated PC titles were downgraded to consoles' level and became pretty dumb. And [b]Deus Ex[/b] was one of those.\n\nThe original [b]Deus Ex[/b] was ported to [b]PS 2[/b], but it took a lot of effort to achieve that. And when it was time to make sequel, [b]ION STORM[/b] was no longer able to afford such things. Suffering the consequences of [b]Anachronox[/b]' poor sales, both [b]John Romero[/b] and [b]Tom Hall[/b] (founders of the company) have left, closing their main office in [b]Dallas[/b]. [b]Warren Spector[/b] and his [b]Austin[/b] team stayed, but... even though the new game got much bigger budget for things like fully voiced dialogues, they were unable to focus on the PC version of the game with the console port coming \u201csometime later\u201d (the original [b]Deus Ex[/b] appeared on PS2 only two years after the initial release). They needed [b]Deus Ex 2[/b] on both PCs and consoles. At the same time. And the result... well... you can easily imagine what happened here. Almost exactly the same thing that happened with [b]The Elder Scrolls[/b] series after [b]Morrowind[/b].\n\nFirst of all, the game has [i]a lot[/i] of loading screens now. And as the result, feels way, [i]way[/i] worse than the original. In the original game we had big maps and we were able to fully explore them without all those nasty loadings. Here? It's like a loading screen after the every few minutes. Doesn't feel as bad nowadays, since hardware became more powerful, but back in the days? It was a disaster. And here's a question for you \u2013 why should people, who invested in their gaming PCs suffer just because some other people only paid for consoles? The answer is, of course, money. But OK. Maybe we can at least plug in the gamepad and enjoy the game in the consoles way? Sure, it's a different thing now, but maybe it'll be fun with the gamepad? Unfortunately, like many other multiplatform games from that period, [b]Deus Ex 2[/b] have a lot of problems with gamepads. I've tried [b]Logitech Rumblepad 2[/b] ([b]Direct Input[/b]), I've tried [b]Logitec F510[/b] (both [b]Direct Input[/b] and [b]XInput[/b]), I've tried wired [b]Xbox 360[/b] controller and I've tried the [b]Xbox One[/b] controller. Neither of them worked properly. Even though there's a juicy rumble feature in options. So, yeah, good luck getting a full experience here. Did I mention that the PC version also crashes quite a lot? Well, it does. Enjoy the inferior experience for far higher price, PC users.\n\nBut enough about technical stuff. What's about the game itself? Well, obviously, we're stuck with the gamepad-oriented interface that doesn't feel good with keyboard / mouse combo. But unfortunately, it isn't the worst thing about this game. Every single aspect of the original [b]Deus Ex[/b] became worse. The locations became smaller and feel much more dull and straightforward. Even the famous lock system was dumbed down. Some doors just can't be hacked now and require the right combination. And you can't just input the combination anymore. You'll need to find it. Sure, the original [b]Deus Ex[/b] allowed players to \u201ccheat\u201d by using the guide to get all those juicy codes, but [i]it was freakin' fun to be able to do that![/i] It was [i]fun[/i] to say \u201cNah, I'm not looking for your codes, I'm a bad, bad hacker and I'll hack the heck of your big and important door!\u201d Sorry, won't happen with some doors now. Because linear crap. The entire skill system also disappeared and not only the game won't reward you for the exploration (there's hardly something to explore anyway, just some basic choices between the doors and the ventilation shafts), most of the side-quests feel like a waste of time and resources. Stealth doesn't worth it either, since the game feels more like an advanced [b]FPS[/b] now.\n\nMaybe it's good as an [b]FPS[/b], though? Nope. Sorry, guys. [b]Deus Ex 2[/b] introduces two things that pretty much ruin it as an [b]FPS[/b]. First \u2013 there's one ammo to rule 'em all. All weapons use the same exact ammo. Just the different amount of it. No matter what you'll use \u2013 a poison dart, or the rocket launcher. It'll be the same exact ammo. Which is stupid. To say the least. But maybe, just maybe, it is fun? [i]NOPE[/i]. Because there's a second thing \u2013 it's freakin' hard to get the ammo in this game! And even enemies will not always drop it! The right combination of the biomods (yes, they're calling 'em like that now, because it's shorter) would help, but there's no way to guess what you'll need without reading the guise and with no respec option, it's totally possible to end up at the end of the game with just a sword against squads of the guys with rocket launchers. So much for the balance...\n\nThe story is not the worst thing here, though. It's a direct sequel to the original [b]Deus Ex[/b], it takes place 20 years later and it follows the merging with [b]Helios[/b] ending. The game even introduces a pretty neat \u201ceverything is a lie\u201d idea that will later be used in [b]Arkane Studios[/b]' [b]PREY[/b]. Unfortunately, there's still a lot of things that went wrong. First, instead of using the dark and realistic design of the original [b]Deus Ex[/b], the [b]Invisible War[/b] decided to be... like [b]Ghost in the Shell[/b]. Even by looking at cover, you can't help but ask yourself: \u201cWhat the heck is this anime-like crap?\u201d\n\nThe good thing, though, is that you'll be able to make a lot of choices. Pretty much every map have some. The bad thing, though... nothing in this game matters. Except of what will happen on the final map. Before that point \u2013 you're free to do whatever you want. And it doesn't feel as good as you may think. Quite the opposite. It feels [i]awful[/i]. Just because without the consequences, it feels like nothing you do matters. [i]That's[/i] the sequel to the game, in which even visiting the wrong restroom used to have consequences? I don't think so. Add pretty stupid writing, full of cheesy lines, ridiculously bad journal, which fails to explain the goals very often and the fact that the game can't even get its own crap together (sometimes it'll claim you've made choices that you didn't make) and you'll get the idea that it's really hard to enjoy the story here. Even though the initial idea and the endings (at least we still have multiple endings here) are not that bad.\n\nSo, yeah... [b]Deus Ex: Invisible War[/b] was one of those titles that came out between two eras and suffered just because of that. Not only it sucked as both [b]Deus Ex[/b] sequel and a good PC title, it also sucked as a console game. Sure, it's this game we should thank for the fact that [b]Thief: Deadly Shadows[/b] turned out to be OK. [b]Deus Ex: Invisible War[/b] was like the first try. But still, it's really, [i]really[/i] hard to like it.

There's no code-entering function like the first game, instead you have to find the code somewhere or use a multitool.\n\nThe biggest problem of this game, though, is not the game itself, but rather the optimization. DX:IW has a very small screen resolution, and if you try to enlarge it by modifying user.ini, the screen gets cropped. One way to fix is by downloading this mod: https://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-2-visible-upgrade.

It doesn't stand up to the original Deus Ex. That is for sure but it isn't THAT bad. \n\nFull disclosure: this was the first Deus Ex game that I finished (I played the original but didn't finish even the first mission and ended up kicking myself later for not finishing quite possibly one of the greatest games of all time). I had good memories of Invisible War because I wasn't comparing it to the original Deus Ex.\n\nI still maintain that the storyline is pretty good. IMO, that is the single most important aspect to any type of RPG and I think they at least got that right. Most of the characters were pretty good. They got me to care about them so that is good. Meeting NG Resonance gave me a chuckle. I liked Klara and Leo but I wish there were more interactions with them. Their characters could have been expanded a bit.\n\nAs much as I liked Human Revolution and even Mankind Divided, I really prefer the concept of biomodification to that of mechanical augmentations. Maybe it's just nostalgia from the older games but I just think it is a cooler concept. I didn't like the concept of not being able to use multiple biomod categories but that didn't really bother me all that much.\n\nHands down, my biggest criticism is the universal ammo system. WTF is that? I want to know who suggested that this would be a good idea. Being designed for consoles was a big downfall to this game. As others have said, the maps were small and simplistic. This is subjective, but another criticism for me is having the canon ending from Deus Ex as the Helios ending. That ending was by far my least favorite. I preferred Tracer Tong's ending. The Helios ending didn't really fit with JC's libertarian proclivities. Should have been Tong's ending or even the Illuminati ending. Speaking of endings, I didn't really care for Invisible War's endings. I felt like a jerk for killing a certain character but I don't like their ending so I do it every time.\n\nSummary: I suggest buying this game with an understanding of a few things:\n\n-Invisible War is good but not great\n\n-The game has a great story and cool characters if you don't compare it to the original\n\n-The game mechanics and level design suck. Accept it. Just try to enjoy other aspects of the game.\n\n-The graphics have not aged well but the same can be said of the original Deus Ex and you can't call yourself a Deus Ex fan until you have played the original\n\nThere really needs to be a sequel to this game.

But it ain't that good. \n\nSo, DX:IW was made with consoles in mind. As a result, we've had a lot of weird design decisions and compromises: universal ammo (your pistol and your shotgun now share the same ammo!), the world's worst inventory system where your medkits are now as big as your laser sword, the game now doesn't punish you for choosing weird augments too. There's no skill points -- just augmentation levels.\n\nThe maps are chopped up into tiny little pieces instead of being huge, intricately designed mazes that reward you for exploration. \n\nThe aesthetic of the game is some early 2000s ugliness, but what do you expect when baggy jeans and frosted tips were the in thing? Alex Denton either looks like a stretched 100x100 image of an anime girl or a lumpy clay gorilla with spiky hair. The guns in the game are no longer as grounded as they once are. The scenario of the game is still undoubtly cyber punk, but the aesthetic feels like schlocky sci-fi. Floating robots? Come on dawg. The OG DX didn't even play with any of that. \n\nIt does some things kind of okay. Like the being able to switch augment paths mid-playthough (seriously, you get augmentation canisters like fucking candy in this game), it's a really short game so you can easily do multiple playthroughs if you want (if you're on crack). \n\nYou don't have to wait 10 seconds to steady your pistols despite you being a genetic super agent! But that's like the only thing I really kind of appreciate. Combat still feels wonky as hell and it doesn't have that visceral feeling of doinking somebody with a 10mm pistol that the original DX had.\n\nI've played way worse games.\n\nOh yeah, and there's literally no reloading.

I would implore that it be thought of as a spinoff rather than \"Deus Ex 2\" but it [i]does[/i] follow up on the events of the first Deus Ex - which harms its expectations by making it a deliberate successor. I'd only recommend playing it if you want to see a more conclusive culmination of what effects the ending of the first Deus Ex had on the world, of which it provides in gratuitous amounts. It took me a leisurely 25 hours to finish (and would be much shorter for \"normal\" people) so it's not a game that overstays its welcome.\n\nA solid spinoff, but a bad sequel.\n\nHere's some bullet points of my most obvious observations of the game. This is written for people looking to compare Deus Ex 1 against Invisible War, in order to temper their expectations.\n\n[h1]Pro's[/h1]\n\u2022 Play fully voice-acted male or female protagonist.\n\u2022 A few more interesting weapon mods. EMP ammo, explosive rounds, and glass despirsal rounds that can break glass without triggering alarms.\n\u2022 Human NPCs in combat do more than just stand around waiting for you to shoot them; they can effectively use flashbangs and will side-roll.\n\u2022 Grenades have an alternate \"on contact\" detonation, rather than just timed.\n\n\n[h1]Subjective[/h1][i]if you're a diehard DX1 fan, most (or all) of these will be Cons.[/i]\n\u2022 Inventory is slot-based rather than grid-based. Food items stack regardless of what they are.\n\u2022 Ammunition is universal across all weapons, though some use it more efficiently than others.\n\u2022 No lockpicks. Multitools have adopted their utility. You'll automatically equip a multitool when interacting with a secured object.\n\u2022 Augmentations are obtained and upgraded with one canister resource, the exception only being \"black market\" biomods.\n\u2022 Some augmentations are passive and don't drain energy, like Move Silent (Silent Run from DX1). Eye lights won't drain energy either.\n\u2022 No skills or skill points. I have mixed feelings for this, which is why it isn't a Con. On one hand, it removes traditional RPG elements and delegates the remaining scraps to augmentations, and also removes the \"reward\" system of getting skill points from exploring. On the other hand, DX1's RPG system was frankly just a series of flawed artificial road bumps/shortcuts, rather than a true RPG system. It either needed to be revamped from the ground up or just cut out, and Invisible War chose the latter.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1][i]parts I thought were outright worse in comparison to DX1.[/i]\n\u2022 A main menu built to be used by controllers. ie, select options on one side of a reticle, and options appear on the other side of the reticle.\n\u2022 No corner leaning, probably a limitation of the Xbox controller which this game was made for.\n\u2022 No walk toggle, only hold Shift to walk.\n\u2022 No locational hp, just a singular health bar.\n\u2022 Can't add notes to your datavault images or create new note entries.\n\u2022 Objective tracking menu is atrocious; you can only view one at a time.\n\u2022 You can't input keycodes manually; you need to obtain the code.

The player travels to a number of different locations throughout the game, such as Cairo, Antarctica and Seattle, noticeably showing the impressive level design.\nAt times there are literally half a dozen ways to complete even a simple objective, and the only limits seem to be your imagination and the equipment you happen to be carrying- excellent. Some very fundamental changes are evident in the skills and augmentation systems too - biomod canisters can be installed in one of 5 slots, each of which corresponds to an area of the body, and can hold either an official or black market biomod. The abilities they give tend to influence your style of play far more than in Deus Ex, and this is a good thing in my opinion.\nThe plot is a little loose at the beginning, but progresses smoothly, and with superb realism. There is a great sense of freedom in your actions, and no matter what you do, the game has been designed to react accurately, and characters will often refer back to decisions you made several levels ago - this is impressive and creates a real sense of cause and effect.

And not just in comparison to somewhat overrated original.\n\nAn engine that barely supports itself, the physics going woopity-woop-woop easily and game crashing sometimes. Game employed high-end lighting while also being designed for XBox which resulted in tiny levels. Tiny to the point where epic locations are just few small rooms. Stealth being wonky because devs implemented \"you make more noises on certain surfaces\" like in Thief but failed to give the proper sound feedback for you to judge this. More gamey interaction than original's sim like. Boring sci-fi world where nano is like magic. Fails to provide a good illusion of consequences of your actions. You get all the stuff by the middle of a game while having lotsa money. Side quests mostly make you a bad person and have a gamey feel to them, people just giving you them just because. Enemies felt more bullet-spongy, which is due to bad combat feedback and just not exciting combat mechanic. Stealth is just Gordon Freeman Air Duct Crawling simulator mostly. And oh god, universal ammo, which I found to be so much more horrible than any kind of regenerative health or other things. Who needs multiple backup weapons. You run out of ammo, you are left with no ranged backup weapon. It sure makes the game so much less strategic on FPS side.\n\nNot to say that it doesn't have good spots. I liked that your character can finally shoot straight from a start. I also liked how they simplified augmentations and skills into one small fancy system which still allows you to specialize and make fun combos. I also liked few parts of setting such as AI of a celebrity acting like a surveliance bot.\nNot to mention that you can set penguins on fire.\n\nAlso, if you ARE going to the game, install a fan-patch \"visible update\".

However it introduced some good philosophical musings typical for the Deus Ex series (particularly NG resonance who has the best dialogue). There are unfortunately some bizarre plot points and some very wooden characters. It's still a Deus Ex game though, but it just can't reach it's predecessor's lofty standards.\n\nThe plot gets more awkward and weird the more you go through with it, and the clunky and dreadful game engine was pretuned for consoles of the day. The physics in the game engine becomes hilariously rubber-bandlike as objects get stuck in walls and there are plenty of fourth-wall-breaking moments of pure comedy where it just doesn't belong because of this. The horrible presentation means that your belief is suspended for so long it may as well be Wile E Coyote hanging over a cliff waiting for gravity to kick in. \n\nI remember the game being a lot better than this - even though it was not great at the time - but time has not been kind to it at all. We're used to so much more from our games these days.

I digress...\n\nNo it doesn't add up to its prequel, which was one of the best games of all times, but it does retain much of what made the original great. It even improves on a few concepts.\n\nIt improves:\n\n- Graphics\n\n- Super strength mod is ten times more fun. Kill enemies with crates or throw their bodies over the city.\n\n- While it loses much in its complete simplication of gameplay, it does eliminate a lot of annoyances. No more creeping around without legs anticlimatically after a prolonged gunfight, or constantly running out of bioenergy. No more having to spend ten minutes during the game trying to fit the sniper rifle around your throwing knifes and rocket launcher. Either you can take it or you can't.\n\nIt retains:\n\n- The complete freedom of choice in much of the gameplay, with 4 massively different endings. Moral choice after moral choice abounds in this game. You can make it through the game without killing anyone, or you can be a complete sociopath.\n\n- Diverse mod choices that affect your style of play\n\n- Abundant philosphical commentary, found in books conversations and the story itself. \n\n- Great gameplay (imo)\n\n- The laughable nightclubs with like 2 people going nuts on the huge floor.\n\n- The awful enemy AI\n\nIt loses:\n\n- Character interest. There is your own character who is no longer the bad ass (if slightly ridiculous) Denton but who is now a robotic mouthpiece. As for the secondary characters, I never felt attached at any point to any of them. They were ALL annoying or completely reprehensible, if not both. Where was the Paul Denton I would gladly fight off an army for?\n\n- The complexity of character skills. Back to the dumbing down. You can mod your weapons still and upgrade mods, but you can no longer improve your different skills. Which was a loss in my opinion.\n\n- The length and depth of the story wasn't quite as good.\n\n- The soundtrack didn't measure up at all. They hired a band and they really tried, but the band was the most cliched, awful thing you ever heard.\n\nBut, all said and done, it's an enjoyable enough experience and if you value choice as much as I do in your games, you'll enjoy this game a lot.

Story. The story is nice and buried under a gazillion awful design flaws there are some nice concepts in this game. Your affiliation with the different factions changes the game overall to some extend and you may get different goals linked to it.\n\nHowever, the entire gameplay has been awfully dumbed down to fit evrything onto a console controller interface. In theory you can still take different approaches like in the first game but stealth does not feel rewarding at all, it just feels pointless. It's way easier to just run in guns blazing because you will never even come close to ammo shortage on any weapons because of the shared ammo system. There's also not a lot of exploration or different ways into a room.\n\nJust as atrocious are the really small and claustrophobic levels and sheer number of loading screens you will witness. Each of them, even on an SSD, will take a couple of seconds, because for some reason the exe closes and reboots for every level. On top of that, this game is known for having problems on newer systems. I got my save files corrupted twice because of game crashes. You also can't use a proper high resolution unless you install the Visual Upgrade mod (so get it).\n\nDespite all the errors, the story is pretty nice. It's not as great as DX1 but it's enjoyable.

I understand that it must have been frustrating to suffer short levels with load waits and to see the decisions of the skill tree obliterated and simplified after the first Deus Ex. Indeed these things must make one lament the influence of the console on games of this period in general. However, these things do not detract from this actually being a rather good game. \n\nThey make up for the introduction of universal ammo by creating a dynamic that different weapons will use up different amounts of ammo, forcing a choice of weapons for suitability to task in order to conserve ammo. This adequately makes up for the loss of decision making with gun specific ammo. The load times between levels really aren't that bad. \n\nThe game does a good job of presenting you with genuine choices to make about what you want to do, but it is here that 'Invisible War' probably has its biggest failing. You can side with whomever you like all the way up to the final showdown; this makes all choices beforehand actually redundant.\n\n\nSo yes, there are things that make this a lesser game than Deus Ex, however there are still multiple ways and orders to approach and complete tasks. This is satisfying and allows you to choose a play style. Biomods will allow you to maximise this style and there are enough of them throughout the game to alter the way you play later on and that's probably needed. Graphics are good and movement is secure and fluid, except occasionally on ladders. In this sense the game is good. As I say, choices are interesting, although most of them (not all) prove pointless in the end. The cut scenes explain the game well as does repeated interaction with NPCs in the spirit of the first Deus Ex. However the music is sparse and poor; rarely is your experience heightened by the soundtrack. \n\n\nOverall though, it's fun and wandering round the ruined UNATCO base at the end brings back a lot of memories of how it used to look. For the price it's available for its worth playing. I mean you can often buy this bay for a dollar or less; at that price, money really doesn't come into the issue. \n\n\nSo is it worth your time? Yes, if you can accept the simplification of it, then there is still a good game to enjoy here. For the record, I played on a Laptop with Windows 10 and had not one single problem.

It's hard not to compare it to the original, considering the only reason you'd play it is if you've played the first. I'm hesitant to recommend it, but the game frequently goes on sale for about dollar, so it's not like you're losing a lot if you don't like it.\n\nFirst off, the levels are small: typically about the size of UNATCO's interior from the first game. There are some slightly larger levels, but they're usually open areas without much detail. For each section of the game, there are usually 3 or 4 of these levels joined by loading zones. Second, later parts of the game discourage non-lethal gameplay by having heavily armored enemies that immune to knockout darts and explode when they die. They also explode if you manage to knock them unconscious with melee. A similar enemy that starts to appear at about the same time disintegrates into a radiation cloud on death or falling unconscious.\n\nAs for the story, the game takes place after the events of the first one (with a mix of all the endings). You play as Alex D, a student at an academy where he has gained cutting edge biomods. You meet 3 other students and the academy is attacked. These students are recurring characters that you meet throughout the game, with each one aligned with one of the game's factions. None of them are as interesting or memorable as Gunther or Anna were in DX1. I suppose the intent was to make them relatable by putting you in the same situation as them at the start, but you have 1 conversation with each of them before they split off. As a plus, you aren't forced into a faction like in DX1. On the other hand, it's weird that at the end of the game, you can just join the faction that you've been fighting for most of the game.\n\nThe inventory system is simplified into 1 item = 1 slot, and you don't have many slots. Not that you'll need a lot, since ammo doesn't take up inventory space. Speaking of ammo, all weapons use the same ammo now. This makes it unclear exactly how much ammo that you have since there's just an ammo \"bar\" rather than an ammo counter. Multitools now open any type of locked thing (doors, keypads, chests, etc), taking between 1-3 multitools. One annoying thing is that there's a bug in the game where there are 2 types of multitools that don't stack with each other. These 2 types look and act the same, but for whatever reason, the game considers them to be different items. This means that you'll probably end up devoting 2 inventory slots to multitools until you have enough of one type.\n\nAugmentations are simplified to 4 slots (+1 more for the flashlight) with 3 choices each. Two out of three of these choices are standard biomods. The third choice for each is a black market biomod. You can only have 1 active biomod per slot and each biomod can be upgraded twice (up to level 3, with the exception of the flashlight, which can't be upgraded). Biomod canisters are used to acquire and upgrade biomods, and there are 2 types matching the 2 types of biomods: standard and black market. Black market canisters are rarer than standard canisters.\n\nIf you end up buying this game you should be aware of the loading issues on modern systems. The game uses a second executable to switch levels. This second exe closes the first exe (old level) and opens a new instance of it (new level). Many programs can stop the first exe from closing, which causes the game to crash. I played this game on Win10-64bit, and to get the game to run, I did the following things:\n\u2022 Installed the Visible Upgrade (this unofficial patch allows the game to run at modern resolutions, among other things). This also has the side-effect of not notifying Steam that you're playing, hence my seemingly low playtime.\n\u2022 Disabled any overlay programs (Steam overlay, Discord overlay, Nvidia overlay, etc).\n\u2022 Set dx2.exe, DX2Main.exe, and Ion_Launcher.exe to run in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2). This may not be necessary, but it didn't cause it to crash for me.\n\nIf it still crashes during load screens you can keep the task manager open (preferably on a second monitor) and close the game exe during a loading sequence (leaving the newly-opened exe running). This isn't ideal, but it works.\n\nSome other things to mention:\n\u2022 The cheesy voice-overs make a return.\n\u2022 The music isn't as memorable as DX1. Don't expect anything on the level of the Hong Kong or UNATCO themes.\n\u2022 AI seems about the same as DX1.

It comes with major performance problems on some machines. \n\nBut there was one particular, totally random moment, where my disappointment turned into warped joy, and the whole thing felt worthwhile. \n\nAn important NPC was lecturing me on politics, conspiracy, power, and his vision for the future. As he did so, however, he got too close to a flaming barrel and was set alight. For some way into his speech he didn\u2019t notice, and kept talking while burning. It was a moment of accidental satire that fit perfectly with the game\u2019s themes. \n\nI\u2019d been hoping to resolve things peacefully, but the choice was taken out of my hands when he eventually realised he was on fire and became hostile. I was laughing almost too hard to fight back. \n\nSuch accidental emergent gameplay moments became my favourite thing. While attempting a stealthy infiltration across rival gang territory, something set them off and the two factions destroyed each other, leaving me alone in an alley of bodies. I was thanking my luck when the sight of all the bodies triggered a neutral guard patrol to turn all the guards in the level hostile to me. I faced a bigger firefight than if I had just taken on the gangs. \u201cOfficers, I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026!\u201d\n\nInvisible War is more about wreaking chaos than saving the world. I think that\u2019s one minor reason it\u2019s inferior to the more idealistic original. Your quests are usually grubbier, rather than noble, and everyone, including your character, has to make so many compromises between lesser evils it\u2019s hard to know or care about what you\u2019re fighting for. It rewards a different playstyle, because there\u2019s less incentive to be pacifistic, and even if you try, emergent gameplay moments like I described might derail your plan. \n\nInvisible War\u2019s take on the politics and ending of the original is far more cynical and disillusioned, but its best moments, including references to the original, work with this. It\u2019s a pessimistic, critical reinterpretation of the story, with enough ideas and wry humour to make it worth following.

Only one ended up being justified in my eyes, the \"small\" levels.  This is not a big issue in itself, but what it did create is some very claustrophobic environments.  This is no where more apparent than when you first arrive in Seattle and the \"outdoors\" felt like a bunch of connected small rooms.  I don't opine that this \"issue\" was solved until Antarctica where it finally felt like there was some \"space\" around you to maneuver and take some long shots.  \n\nThe actual story was interesting and riddled with choices that had ripple effects throughout the game.  Eventually I sided with the family and chose that ending.  \n\nThe major \"complaint\" I had with the original was the combat felt very week in the beginning.

So, the combat enhancements are definitely a big step up.  \n\nI didn't mind the other changes (radial menu, universal ammo etc) as the biomods were very fun (Robot Domination!) and I always relied on my quick keys F1-F6 and 1-6 to select.

First game was simply amazing. The gameplay compared to this game is godlike. In this one... wtf happened ? I feel like they changed dev and publishers but they didn't. Same guys made this game but it doesn't feel like it.\n\nSimply put, this is a game made for casuals. I don't mean this in a insulting way but this is a washed down version of the first game. Less items, less weapons, no skills, less hours to finish the game and so on. I do recommend this game but wait till theres at least a 50% rebate on it. Don't pay full price.\n\nGRAPHICS\nOn the graphics side, its good. Better than the first one of course but the color palette is bright and colorful compared to the first.\n\nSOUND\nFor the sound, its wierd. I didn't get into it since in some places the music was stuck in loop; that can be frustrating and annoying. I noticed that some grenades didn't sound or looked spectacular on the sound side. When they exploded, you didn't hear the sound... that was disappointing.\n\nSTORY\nStory was just a wierd experience. Throughout the ENTIRE game, I didn't know what side to choose as I didn't get enough information from them so at the end I finally made my decision. This shouldn't be the case. Around the developement stage of the story I should be able to change my mind unless new information springs in my face. In here it wasn't the case unfortunately. So the entire story was just lacking in my opinion.\nThey want you to choose but don't give you enough reasons to tip on a side.\n\nTECHNICAL\nThank god I learned to save often.

acting\n+Non-linear levels remain(though the previous game had more variety)\n+HUD now includes a compass, makes navigating easier \n+Improved combat, feels more solid\n+Biomods(augmentations) more balanced + swappable\n\nSubjective:\n+/-Universal ammo system\n+/-100% ambient soundtrack other than NG Resonance songs(no more upbeat techno tracks here)\n+/-Ragdoll physics(it's \"so bad, it's good\")\n+/-Realistic turned Futuristic-fantasy aesthetics, looks somewhat cartoonish\n+/-Story easier to follow with philosophic and gray morality elements still remaining however execution may feel somewhat lacking/different\n+/-Simplified mechanics:\n[list]\n[*]automatic hacking(no more input username and pw)\n[*]skill system removed \n[*]multitool and lockpick combined into one\n[*]less biomods(augmentations) slots\n(but that also means more biomod(canister) upgrades to assign e.g. swap out regeneration for spy drone to highest level immediately)\n[/list]\n\n+/-Ability to switch between factions until the very end\n+/-No consequences for committing undesirable actions against factions other than ending(and yelling)\n+/-Protagonist is a blank slate(first one had more personality)\n+/-Game playtime seems to be only about 1/3 of Deus Ex 1's playtime\n\nCons:\n-NPCs and dialogue lost their relatability/realism\n-Stealth seems to require biomods to stealth properly\n-AI is still on the dumb side\n-Excessive loading screens(although load time is quick enough)  \n-Crashes constantly in fullscreen even with Visible Upgrade mod(less in windowed)\n-Simplified UI:\n[list]\n[*]custom note taking removed \n[*]conversation history removed \n[*]thumbnail in saves removed \n[*]game log removed \n[*]less inventory slots than the first\n[/list]\n-Semi-open areas still exist, but areas are more cramped overall\n\nSome opinions:\nIf you're wondering if you should get the game, perhaps the question is not \"Do you like the first game?\" because there is a significant presentation change, but rather \"Do you really want to see the aftermath of Deus Ex 1 endings?\" because that's what the game expanded on.\n\nIf you found the first game endings perfect in and of itself and really liked the atmosphere and presentation of the first game, you may not like this game.\n\nIf you're wondering if you should play this game first before Deus Ex 1 expect spoilers, though you might not get the spoilers until you play the first game.\n\nStory picks up after the 3rd level - Cairo so some patience may be warranted\n\nIf you do decide to get the game, get the Visible upgrade mod.

Invisible War was an attempt to catch the console bandwagon and so suffers the sort of limitations you would expect and it does play like a console game.\n\nThe Indeterminate: I've seen people post about technical issues with the PC port. I've not encountered any of these on Windows 7 x64 - be sure to check out if others with your specifications report problems!\n\nThe Good: I enjoyed my time in Invisible War, and every few years or so, I boot it back up and enjoy it again. There are a limited number of augment modules, so it pays to specialise in certain methods of play. The part I most enjoyed was the story - conspiracy theories, a world on the brink of chaos, and I think a fair take on the whole human-consciousness / A.I. issue. Who you decide to help out will change aspects of certain missions, and the final mission feels pretty rewarding when you work with your team to achieve your objective.

Just like Alex. \nThis isn't a bad game. Far from it. Its endings are a lot better compared to DX1, factions really do mean something and biomods offer a unique twist on an FPS game. This isn't a typical RPG with skills. Biomods allow you to switch up your gameplay midway if you so want to, whether you want more stealth focus biomods instead of combat ones and vice versa for example. The freedom presented here in the world despite how small each environment is incredible, and the levels themselves have a distinct artstyle that holds well for its age compared to its predecesor.\nBut, compared to Deus Ex, it's clearly an inferior game. Its philosophical content is somewhat dumbed down compared to its predecessor, and the game never really lives up to its theme. \"The Future War On Terror\" is a great tagline, hinting at discussion of a post 9/11 world, but it never does this on a relatable scale. Compare terrorists blowing up a few important buildings to losing ALL INFRASTRUCTURE. The latter is much more impactful on the world, and resulted in poverty going through the roof and general corruption throughout the world (like there wasn't any before though). However, this is never portrayed well in the game, just simple rich and poor districts. It's only really prevalent in the Cairo levels where you interact with citizens of both Old and New Cairo in small but meaningful ways.\nYet, despite me playing this game for it's commentary, I was sucked in by its gameplay of all things. It's a slow shooter, and that appeals to me somewhat when I want some casual play that challenges me a few times. The gunplay is solid enough to keep me entertained, rewarding you for being a few steps ahead of the enemy, although universal ammo can be quite annoying at times.\nI recommend this game, but before you even start a new game, go download the Visual Upgrade. Everyone says that this game is hard to get running on Windows 10. It isn't. The Visual Upgrade is literally just an .exe file that gives you a Visual Tweaker to mess around with the settings, and the interface is very manageable. On top of that, most of the compatibility issues are resolved and you can now play at higher resolutions with the mod. Here's the link http://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-2-visible-upgrade/downloads/visible-upgrade-full-edition You're welcome. Get it when it's on sale for like a dollar though. Even for the original Deus Ex, I am not paying $7 dollars for it. I may just be that way, but when you catch all of the Deus Ex games on sale, they are a steal.\nDon't just buy this game.

This game is very poorly optimized for modern systems and an unofficial patch (found at http://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=147423) is the only way to get it to run reasonably. I couldn't get the game to run at my monitor's resolution and it ran like total garbage without, and even with the patch I still had several ctds. I was able to finish the game though and it did only cost a dollar when I bought it, but it is still something to be aware of.\n\nNow on to the game itself. This game is mostly remembered for being \"consolified (it was designed for the original Xbox), and for not being as good as the original. Both of these statements are true, but I would argue that it is still a good game regardless. The simplification required to work on the Xbox does lead to some downgrades, such as game areas not being as big as they were before or datapads having to be shorter, but some things actually feel more streamlined. The inventory system has some improvements (though the circle UI realyl kind of sucks), food is now all kept in one slot (huzzah) and they merged lockpicks and multitools into one item. Universal ammo has its ups and downs, it can be convenient, but it's so dumb that the stun prod uses the same ammo as a rocket launcher. Like what?\n\nI must say that it feels like there's less of an emphasis on stealth here, even on realistic difficulty. Guns pack more punch than the original and are much easier to use and the only enemies that I had trouble with towards the end were the Templar and WTO commandos. Again its' a bit of a trade off. The option is still there though and in some areas is more viable. The augmentations, here called biomods, are what really make the gameplay for me. They're absolutely ridiculous and I love it. There's a speed aug that, once maxed out, basically makes you Sanic. I was actually able to skip a lot of enemy encounters because of how good it was, even though sometimes my character went so fast she became hard to control. The Omar biomods are really fun though, obviously, I had to get the one that lets you hack into security terminals and turn enemy turrets against them, but there's also one that lets you take over mechs. I'd speed over to a massive enemy mech, start the hack, run back to my hiding place, then use the mech to mow down the enemy guards, it's very satisfying.\n\nThe story is actually solid too, not as good as the original of course, but still having most other games beat. It takes the series much more in the Sci-Fi direction than the grounded original. I expected it to be dumbed down but it actually does manage to explore some interesting themes throughout, largely through the various factions and their interactions, or often surprising similarities, whether it be the WTO and Order, Templar and Omar, Denton and Illuminati, or even two rival coffee shops. Meanwhile, the merits of bioengineering and collective consciousness are discussed as Alexis de Tocqueville is quoted, and I'm not going to spoil it but the Denton ending feels like something Arthur C. Clarke might have written.

The original Deus Ex was (and probably still is) my favourite game, period, so I was really pumped to revist the world.  I remember being really impressed by the visuals, as the real-time lighting system was very impressive for the time, and the ragdoll physics were also lots of fun to play with.  The shooting also felt like an improvement over the original.  However even in my overhyped state of optimism, it was clear to me that some major concessions had been made on the level design.  The levels were far smaller than anything from the original Deus Ex, and felt claustrophobic in comparison.  The storyline also had no sense of pace, jumping straight into the twists far too soon, and the tone just seemed off in the dialogue.  I revisted the game recently when doing a playthrough of all the Deus Ex games, and now that the graphics are no longer impressive and the physics seem positively ropey, the problems with the levels stood out much more.  I would actually say this game has aged a lot worse than the original.  Invisible War still has some interesting hub areas and some cool side-quests, and it does consistently give you choice about how you approach missions.  However the choice is more a narrative choice about which faction to support, rather than the sneak/shoot/hack approach of the other Deus Ex games.  There is a little of that too, but not separated to the degree seen in the other games.  I'll still recommend playing the game for historical interest, and there are some interesting ideas in here both narratively and mechanically (universal ammo, for instance, was probably a mistake but nonethless a novel idea).  There's also some rather poignant moments revisiting some former locations from the original game.  So whilst I don't claim this as a good game, it's still something you should play if you haven't.  And if you only played it back in 2003, it's worth revisiting for it's curiosity value.

I also liked the protagonist. \n\n[*]\tThe updated graphics look nice, especially in locations like Medina. \n\n[*]\tI found the augmentations useful, especially the invisibility.  \n\n[*]\tPlenty of side quests. \n\n[*]\tInteresting story. You get to choose sides. The game also has multiple endings.       \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n\n[*]\tCrappy interface. The interface has been simplified too much. I remember in the original Deus ex you could hack or enter the username and password, to gain access to a person\u2019s account. When you hacked security terminals in the original game, it displayed all the different camera angles and controls; which was cool, but now it just gives you a menu; you have to click to access each security angle. The original game also displayed the players anatomy and you could heal individual body parts. The original also provided the transcripts of each conversation. \n\n[*]\tNo skill points. Hacking has been made into an augmentation. In the original game, Skill points allowed each character build to feel different. \n\n[*]\tNo lockpicks. The multitool does both lock picking and keypad hacking. The multitool looks shit, it looks like a wand, which fires lightning. \n\n[*]\tThe game is short. You don\u2019t visit half as many locations like you did in the original. The levels are also very compacted; the levels are not big and open like in the first game. The levels quite limited.   \n\n[*]\tStealth in this game is awful. You can\u2019t take advantage of the dark, enemies can easily spot you. The stun prod makes too much noise and there isn\u2019t a dart crossbow  \n\n[*]\tWasn\u2019t keen on the weapon models (except the SMG).   \n\n[*]\tNot many augmentations. The flash light takes up one slot. I wish they combined both invisibility augmentations. The drone augmentation looked a bit crap; just a floating ball of electricity.    \n\n[*]\tMore dialogue with NPCS. \n\n[*]\tBuggy and glitchy. When the game loads, it closes and then reopens the game. The player can go through objects. Sometimes multitools don\u2019t work despite having the correct amount. \n[/list]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nAverage game. The game is nothing compared to its predecessor. It has been simplified too much. It could have been so much more. If you want to know what happens in this Deus ex timeline, then I recommend you buy this game at a discount. \n\n[h1]6/10 = Okay[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1512430474, "timestamp_updated": 1512430505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38019551": {"recommendationid": "38019551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075481511", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1649130102}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game trapped in the worst engine ever (It was a modified version of Unreal Engine 2 called the Flesh Engine)", "timestamp_created": 1512263387, "timestamp_updated": 1512263387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37884499": {"recommendationid": "37884499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036186781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1500842084}, "language": "english", "review": "Lets pretend this never existed in the deus ex line up", "timestamp_created": 1511878619, "timestamp_updated": 1511878619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461485534906387329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37734597": {"recommendationid": "37734597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051230899", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1522, "last_played": 1511649895}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not Deus Ex.", "timestamp_created": 1511743115, "timestamp_updated": 1511743115, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.403970509767532349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37596182": {"recommendationid": "37596182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025448195", "num_games_owned": 1220, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3922, "last_played": 1606587223}, "language": "english", "review": "I've owned this game since it came out, and despite its age and some well-deserved criticisms, I still now and then go on a binge and play it through a few times in a row. The game has enough depth that you can do that and still find new ways of doing things. \n\nWhen this game came out, there was a lot of negative press about it. Even once you filter through the hyperbole, there are some disappointments and flaws. The three major criticisms of any substance that you hear most often are:\n\n[olist]\n [*] Small areas and frequent load screens. This was the result of making a game for both the PC and the consoles of the day.\n [*] Universal ammo. It was an experiment that didn't quite work out. It's an interesting idea, and as long as you pay attention, it doesn't affect game play that much.\n [*] It isn't as good as the first Deus Ex. Very, very few things are.\n[/olist]\n\nOne warning: Windows 10 (and I think 8) don't play nice with the game. If you check the message boards for tips, everyone will recommend VisibleTweaker and for good reason. It was the only way I could get it going after I upgraded, plus it incorporates various higher resolution texture mods. After I upgraded to Windows 10, I couldn't reinstall because the original disks and some horrible content protection, so I re-purchased on Steam, so I do know that VisibleTweaker will work with a Steam version.\n\nLike the original and the prequels, Invisible War has enough richness that you can pick biomods and weapons to suit (or challenge) your play style; there are enough side quests and alternative paths to suit your mood, sense of humor, or sense of ethics. Pacifist, non-lethal, or unnecessarily lethal are all legitimate options. Myself, I tend to either sneak past or knock unconscious clock-punching security guards and frustrated working-class stiffs. deal with soldiers pragmatically, but when it comes to the Templars (uniform-loving purists), I like to set them on fire and watch them run around screaming. If that's not your style, then there is an exclusive boarding school for girls, and you can kill everyone inside if you'd like.\n\nThere are male and female versions of the protagonist, Alex D. (Skin tone can also be adjusted). Gender doesn't make a huge difference, but a side-quest or two have different possibilities depending on which you choose.\n\nThe dialog is solid and has the same attitude that the series is known for. The voice actor for the male Alex D is good, but personally, I think the voice actor for the female Alex D nails the delivery perfectly. She is probably a big part of why I keep replaying it; her verbal smackdowns are that good.\n\nOverall, I think it has aged quite well. I've forgotten most of the other games from its generation, and of the ones that I can remember without going back and looking through what I own, this is the only one I still play. With the one caveat that you might have to do some tweaking before it will work, I think it is worth it.

Oddly, as an individual, that group divide pretty much summarizes my feelings toward the game.  Just before playing this game, I re-played the original \"Deus Ex.\"  As I played it, the overriding emotion for the game was awe.  On the other hand, for \"Invisible War,\" my overriding emotion was disappointment.  Why?  In a nutshell, it's because the developers dumbed the game down.  Since this was written for the consoles of the time and ported over to the PC, I can understand the reduced gameplay:\n\n- Small levels,\n- Long loading times (15 seconds),\n- Fewer Biomod upgrades (I fully upgraded about half way through the game and ended up with 14 standard and 8 black market upgrade canisters sitting unused in my inventory),\n- No exploration points (heck, no points at all),\n- No skills to apply for each upgrade,\n- Very restricted weapon mod ability (as with Biomod canisters, I finished the game with 25 unused weapon mods sitting in my inventory),\n- Ridiculously tiny inventory.\n\nBut, the big problem is the dumbing down of the philosophical, social, and political thought in the game.  I guess I can understand that, too:  there are probably far more people who want to just play a game than those who enjoy thinking about the philosophical underpinnings of the game.\n\nAnother problem is that this game seems to target a much younger audience than did the original game.  That's especially noticable at the beginning where all the characters behave pretty simplistically.  But, that does get better by the end.\n\nSo, why am I recommending the game?  Because about 14 hours through, I realized I was still playing.  As a sequel to \"Deus Ex,\" yes, this game is disappointing.  But, on its own, it's actually pretty good.  Again, it's no \"Deus Ex.\"  But, a list price of about $7 (and I paid a whole lot less for the total \"Deus Ex Collection\" bundle) for 27.5 hours of reasonable game play justifies it.\n\nNote:  I used the full Visible Upgrade mod to this game to update the graphics and fix a lot of the problems:\n\nhttp://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=147423\\", "timestamp_created": 1511052813, "timestamp_updated": 1511052951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589839398860931396", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36559239": {"recommendationid": "36559239", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980795510", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1771, "last_played": 1510860898}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing through the whole game, I honestly don't get the hate or denial of this game's existence. It has areas that are inferior to both Deus Ex 1 (DX1) and DX: HR, but also many areas that are just as good or simply different. Sadly, that widespread opinion is one of the reasons why I waited longer to play this than I should have. Although, in this case I guess it's fitting, because Deus Ex are about global AI's with their own opinions/agendas and the Internet can seem like that at times, although with a major case of split personality and other mental issues. \n\nIW has lots of things that I associate with Deus Ex and other games like it, e.g. Knights of the Old Republic, The Witcher and VtM:Bloodlines. The mentioned games are all personal favorites of mine, because they give you quest/gameplay/dialogue options and let's you roleplay a character or attitude, which says something about how I view IW. \n\nThere's quite a lot of voice acting, something I look for in every game. Even most no-name NPC's say 5-6 lines of dialogues before they start repeating themselves. This helps with immersing you into the game world, makes the whole gaming experience more interesting, encourages you to explore and, above all, pester everyone until they've run out of dialogue lines, even if they tell you to go away, heh heh. On that account, IW is every bit as good as DX1 and it also has several references to the first game, both small and large. \n\nThe story and world created through that voice acting is intricate like in DX1. I play Deus Ex games for the gameplay options, but I enjoyed the story. You have several different companies/factions/people to keep track of. with several story twists along the way. The characters themselves aren't as memorable (or amusingly stereotypical) as those from DX1, but I wouldn't say they are one-dimensional or boring. \n\nThe level design is also very Deus Ex-y, with the vents and being able to approach an objective/mission area in different ways. Perhaps not entirely as well made as DX1, but it's nothing that made me stop and think that I wanted to play DX1 instead. \n\nThe biomod and tools/weapons are great and I was able to get most of what I wanted early on for my non-lethal stealth playstyle. However, it's here that I first realized what people had against IW, since like in DX1, you have to choose between 3 options in five categories. For some reason, hacking and invisibilty is in the same category, which didn't bother me at first, because I rarely found the need for either. At the end of the game, I wished I could have had both at the same time. \n\nThe end stages are where you encounter heavily armed/armored troops that you can't knock out via tranquilizing darts/gas and can't backstab like in DX1 (DX1 had the Dragon's Tooth nano blade, IW has an energy blade that is much less effective). It's possible that I could have just sneaked/run away from them and I did at one point, because I didn't have enough ammo or desire to to take them all out. I had switched from invisibility to hacking by then and even when crouching, enemies hear you very well and are able to locate you. It was much easier to ghost my way around in DX1, while IW practically requires the \"soft feet\" and invisibility biomod for successful sneaking (not many large spaces because it had to work on the Xbox as well), which means you can't use the hacking or jumping biomod at the same time.\n\nExploring the area by jumping up on stuff and hacking were two of my favorite activities in DX1. They don't work as well in IW. The jumping mechanic is odd, seems like you jump higher if you jump up on a small ledge and then jump again. It's imprecise and unintuitive and you most often push away boxes when trying to jump up on them. DX1 had excellent box stacking mechanics, something I really miss in IW. Hacking might be more useful than it seemed, but money is quickly a non-issue and there were too few (well placed) security terminals to hack, so you could turn the tables on your enemies or simply turn off cameras.\n\nA large source of hate for IW is perhaps because one of the factions wants you to kill certain people. Being loyal to one faction all throughout the game doesn't make you feel good, they both want you to do stuff at times that doesn't rhyme well with how I want to roleplay my character (a good-natured hero). The Witcher 1 was better at making factions be both good and bad, I didn't feel at home with either of IW's factions, because of the things they asked me to do. \n\nMost of my complaints are from the end stages. It made it much harder to sneak/knock out people and I found my health/ ammo reserves depleted, couldn't keep on playing like I had before. I was ready to say \"it's been great, but now it's over, time to start a new game from the backlog\" like five hours before the actual ending revealed itself. It has good moment-to-moment gameplay, I never felt like I wanted to quit, but I sometimes felt like it didn't matter if I continued playing or not. Each point in the game felt as good as any to stop playing or to continue. \n\nThen again, it was at the end that I realized how I could have done some things better, things that would have nullified some of my complaints and annoyances. This is a game best played twice to get the most out of it and I'll do so one day (will choose the female protagonist then, to hear a new voice do all the hero's voice acting), but the backlog beckons and I have had my fill of IW for now.", "timestamp_created": 1510867831, "timestamp_updated": 1510868362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548358321189880371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36290327": {"recommendationid": "36290327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090639179", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1659401263}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it is inferior to the original in every way except for graphics, it isn't a bad game.

Even if you're coming in fresh, this is a below-average FPS that has not withheld the test of time. Fans of the series, FPS enthusiasts or nostalgics desperately craving another hit of Deus Ex should forget that this game ever existed for the following reasons:\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Because the game had to be developed for both PC and the original Xbox, loading times are long and the levels are simple. While this may be due to the graphical limitations of the Xbox, large environments that offer many paths to complete objectives are iconic to the franchise. It's just not here. These seemingly large environments are segmented into much smaller areas. Because the environment is so segmented, you're forced to focus on how painfully linear these smaller environments are. This also gives way to limitations in terms of the amount of AI present in certain areas (in some areas there were only 3-5 enemies)\n\n[*] Much like its level design, Invisible War suffers from an array of shallow storylines. [spoiler]There are two factions that are revealed to be under the same veil of the Illuminati despite having polarizingly different methods of solving weighty in-game conflicts. No matter which side you choose, it always feels that your choices really do not matter. Your in-game actions towards other members of the factions do not matter, either. For instance, I had wiped out an entire WTO security compound only for their leader to say that he was disappointed. He gave me a biomod canister anyways. [/spoiler] While I will say that the scenarios seemed well thought out, I just didn't like how unoriginal [spoiler] the illuminati reveal was, and this rush to revive JC Denton because the main protagonist is a clone of him. [/spoiler] This then paves the way to an ending that is [spoiler] painfully predictable and in the same vein as other games. However, because the other games give you a more visceral look into the world's social problems, I felt more attached to the end-game choice [/spoiler]\n\n[*] Tedious sidequests offered piddly rewards or sums of credits. This gave me a poor incentive to really do them. Because Invisible War  became a game where [spoiler] you could not buy or rank up for your augmentations and largely relied on finding them, you got to a point where you had enough credits early on in the game to not worry about them. Because the levels were not all that complex, it didn't even make sense to grind for rewards or interact with merchants since you could find everything you're looking for in the levels anyways. [/spoiler]\n\n[*] Stock weapons and basic weapon customization complimented the augmentation system rather well, I felt that the one-ammo-fits-all weapon aspect a serious cop out. This was largely because of how small the inventory system was, and ultimately the weak selection of weapons. In that vein, this game has very few explosive options, which was an element that really made the other games a lot more interesting. They compensated for this by including a lot of [spoiler]multi-tools[/spoiler], but sometimes you really just wanted to blow up a door or so instead of hucking explosive crates that often lead to you getting killed in the process. \n\n[*] Because of how old the game is, I needed to rely on mods to get the resolution right and make the game more presentable in terms of graphics. Visible Upgrade was what I used, and I was pleased with the changes it made to the game. But even without mods, the game is quite prone to difficult crashes that can mess up your saves and progress. Although there are quick save and load features for you to abuse, there is only one quick save. Seldom do you receive current saves from the beginning of some levels. Luckily, [spoiler] because you are told how the game is going to end before going to two other main locations in the game, the game just saved me anywhere between 2-4 hours of my life chasing a story I already knew the end of. [/spoiler]\n\n[/list]\n\nWith those points in mind, I would ask you to not buy this title. Because of how contained the story is and how much it banks off of the first game, you can miss this title entirely. For people looking to enter the series, start with the first game or the prequels. I will credit it for its high concept story and execution of neat augs, though it's poorly executed through weak plot and level design - the two things the Deus Ex franchise rests its laurels on.", "timestamp_created": 1508605641, "timestamp_updated": 1508605641, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651923179626464844", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35616202": {"recommendationid": "35616202", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963298686", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1471697112}, "language": "english", "review": "Dues Ex: Invisible War is a 2004 RPG, Action-Cyberpunk game is that is developed by Ion Storm.

PC titles tended to be more complex, have a ton of hotkeys that just couldn't be fit onto a controller, and were larger in just about every way owing to the same factors that make PC's technologically superior to consoles to this day. More RAM, more HD space, better graphical capabilities, etc etc etc. \n\nWell into the 2000's this reality was still prevalent, and no game better encapsulates this contrast and mentality turned reality than Deus Ex: Invisible War-a title made with consoles in mind first and foremost.\n\nWhereas Deus Ex had massive maps that are still respectable to this day. Invisible War entraps you in confined rooms and locales seperated by doorways and gates that lead to loading times. Necessary as the XBox hardware wouldn't allow massive areas. Invisible War attempts to create the illusion of being outside when not in a building, but you might as well be since everything is still corridors and rather tight spaces. The only difference is that there is now a skybox (sometimes) when 'outside', but that skybox is hidden by conveniently large buildings that make the difference between being outdoors and indoors a question of how high the ceiling is and if the ceiling is a solid ceiling or a skybox.\n\nI can't fault this too much as it *is* a game of its time, but it's worth noting since Deus Ex 1 didn't suffer these limitations and it's 5 years older than this title at the point of release. It's taking a step back. To its defense its not a massive deal or anything that would deter the creation of just as engaging a game as the first.\n\nBut that's where this title fails again. \n\nContinuing its console syndrome, this game eliminates a vital aspect of the first game: the RPG elements. You don't receive differing damage on your various appendages. You don't have as robust or intriguing an upgrade system to your biomodifications. Gone are the various abilities you could level up from the previous game (proficiency in weapons, heavy weapons, computers, etc). There are no more computers where you can read characters' emails that build the lore and world. You don't hack anymore, you don't talk to as many NPC's and engage in the various side quests that have you building lore and the world. I do not understand why they engaged the subtraction game in aspects that made the first title unique. That was basically all of Deus Ex there.\n\nIf they focused on the gunplay and enhanced it, that would be fine, but it's the same as before. Meaning, below average, only now all weapons share the same ammo pool which is just confusing. There is no reason to carry anything past a sniper rifle and perhaps an SMG or shotgun since all weapons have the same ammo pool. It completely defeats the purpose of carrying variety, its just....I don't understand it. I'll have to google the logic behind that.\n\nWhat of the story and side missions? Well, just as with everything else this area has also been downsized....severely. God has it been downsized. As stated, the sidequests and various characters to talk to are gone for the most part. There just isn't as much there, and what is there is typically rather linear. Wheras in Deus Ex you would engage in quests and be able to maneuver the ordeal and side with parties, here you just get quests and do them. Very few of them require siding with any party. It's just quests to do. There are no repricussions, or rewards for that matter.\n\nSurprisingly, the story isn't *that* bad. Deus Ex had three endings, and here we have a sort of mixture of all three. It actually makes sense, and is rather basic. So basic that I can't really poke too many holes in it, only to say that for a franchise of this caliber this is really....tiny. Deus Ex built on the underlying concepts of the plot through character conversations, books, and logs. You'd delve into the nature of Democracy, Governance, and Free Will which underlied a game about massive institutions lead by a few governing the many. It was a philisophical work.\n\nInvisible War, on the other hand, gives you character dialogue and....that's it. Rather short discussions with no explenation or delving into the underlying concepts. It's rather sad; when they got rid of the RPG elements they *really* did a disservice to the plot. It's as if they had a general outline for the plot....and shipped the game out like that. \n\nAnd the plot is alright. Some character motives and elements are just left at simple, \"it is what it is\" explanations. *Slight spoiler warning* the Illuminati is involved once more, and when told that they control factions, including oppositional factions, not much is said as to how contradictory and braindead that is other than, \"yeah, its weird right? You gotta build and control\" or some other such nonsense. It's a GLARING PLOTHOLE THAT REQUIRED A LOT MORE EXPLENATION\n\nA LOT MORE.\n\nBut you know, for convenience sake and to have you follow a linear route lets just say the factions were one in the same. It's such a cop out.\n\nSpeaking of which, its difficult to take this game seriously when you can kill faction leaders and...just really disgrace a faction but the ability to still partner with it is available and they merely chastise you over the radio for not following orders. \"Well, anyway, please do follow this next order....\"\n\nI understand its so that the player can still make his choice in endings, and its much appreaciated. At the same time, it deligitimizes your plot points; you can allow options in endings without disrespecting your world and characters within it. \n\nAll in all I'd say its rather mediocre. Wiki the plot or something; its actually decent even if barebones. It follows logically from the first title and makes some familiar faces into villains if you view their actions as villanous...which you totally can. Otherwise, as its own title it really is bad. Only the most dedicated of Deus Ex fans will play it, and only for the plot...and this is assuming they don't just retcon the hell out of this.", "timestamp_created": 1505639475, "timestamp_updated": 1505639915, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617547869682312012", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34780571": {"recommendationid": "34780571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057600383", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1503637008}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're into deus ex for the story then you should totally get it.

Esta entrega, a diferencia de la primera, posee un [b] Gameplay m\u00e1s pulido [/b] y, de cierta manera, es mucho \"mejor\" Shooter que el primero, pero sin descuidar los puzles que caraterizaron al primero juego (puedes resolver los niveles de much\u00edsimas maneras, ya sea siendo sigiloso, de manera violenta, sabiendo con qu\u00e9 personajes hablar [b] o usando CAJAS [/b]) o el Juego de Rol.\n\nComo en todo RPG, el personaje (o los personajes) del jugador evolucionan a conveniencia de este, y normalmente pueden llegar a ser muy distintos del personaje (o personajes) de otros jugador. El jugador deber\u00e1 de decidir qu\u00e9 Aumentos son los importantes para su personaje, y, aunque paresca que hay una gran falta de aumentos, porque parecen ser pocos, la verdad es que son suficientes para hacer pensar a cualquiera durante horas qu\u00e9 aumento es m\u00e1s conveniente, y, de hecho, en muchos casos da la sensaci\u00f3n de que sin ese aumento por el que te decidiste nunca habr\u00edas pasado de cierta parte del juego.\n\nEn cuanto a mec\u00e1nicas: Son las mismas del juego original, con alguna que otra simplificaci\u00f3n, pero la m\u00e1s destacable es el hecho de que las municiones son universales (cosa que a muchos gust\u00f3 por lo problem\u00e1tico que era llevar muchos tipos de munici\u00f3n en el Deus Ex original, y cosa que a muchos disgust\u00f3 porque lo vieron como algo simplista)\n\nEn cuanto a dificultad: Es m\u00e1s dificil que el primero (The Conspiracy) y el tercero (Human Revolution), aunque obviamente depende del estilo de juego por el cual el jugador se decida.\n\nEn cuanto a controles: Yo jugu\u00e9 usando un Gamepad, l\u00e1stima que no es totalmente compatible y en algunos momentos tuve que usar el teclado y el rat\u00f3n...\n\nEn cuanto a m\u00fasica: Excelente, en especial su versi\u00f3n del Tema del Deus Ex original.\n\nEn cuanto a gr\u00e1ficos: Igualmente excelentes, luces y sombras din\u00e1micas, me soprend\u00ed al ver que hace tantos a\u00f1os exist\u00eda esa tecnolog\u00eda que yo pensaba era de tiempos m\u00e1s modernos. El \u00fanico punto negativo aqu\u00ed es que los modelos de los personajes puede llegar a parecer feos y el HUD no gust\u00f3 a muchos.\n\nEn cuanto a Rendimiento: Este es, sin dudas, el m\u00e1s fuerte de los puntos negativos, ya que parece ser que el desarrollo de este t\u00edtulo fue bastante problem\u00e1tico y tuvieron que recurrir a diversos \"trucos\" para hacer que el juego pudiera funcionar perfectamente, mapas peque\u00f1os (caminas unos pasos y te salta una pantalla de carga), muchas pantallas de carga, y el juego se reinicia cada vez que cambias de mapa (me refiero a que, al pasar de un mapa a otro, el juego se cierra y se vuelve a abrir, pero cargando el otro mapa, quiz\u00e1 porque era la manera m\u00e1s eficiente de limpiar la memoria).

I had fun playing it most of the time but at the same time there were so many annoying things I had to deal with. I've never really written any \"not recommended\" reviews. Here I was close to doing so, but I changed my mind. I finished the game, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great. Let's not be too harsh.\n\nI liked the story. I liked doing missions for different factions and feeling that I have to make some decisions in order to form my own story. Meeting some familiar faces from the first Deus Ex game was also very nice. The voice acting in Invisible War made me laugh so much. For example the grays (the creatures looking like aliens) or the biomodified  cyborgs smugglers called Omars have very funny voices. And of course people say silly things. The reactions in some situations don't feel realistic but it's not a bad thing in my opinion. How could we possibly take a game seriously when there are violent toilets which are trying to kill you, right? [url=https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractiveCloudyPenguinPastaThat] Fancy toilet-killers Twitch Clip\t[/url]\n\nThe most annoying thing in the game are loading screens. Everytime you want to enter a location, BOOM loading screen! That's not all. The game will shut down before loading a new location. My Steam friends were suffering almost 20 hours by \"PlasmaWasp just started playing Deus Ex: Invisible War\". I am so sorry, guys and girls ;)\n\nI was a bit disappointed that Invisible War ignores my decision from the first Deus Ex game. I don't want to include any spoilers but this game will completely ignore your Deus Ex (2000) ending. It's not like in Mass Effect where you can import your save files and continue.\n\nThe game was much more fun for me at the beginning. I felt like there was less and less exploration and less missions as the game progressed. In the end there was almost nothing. Just OP Paladin patrols and not enough supplies to take them down. It stopped being a tactical game. The only thing which worked for me was running fast through them while healing with biomodes. It didn't feel right. It didn't feel smart. I think part of the problem was universal ammo. Really bad idea if you ask me. The controls are bad. Obviously made for consoles. It got me killed several times just because switching weapons and inventory management are unnecessarily complicated, Definitely not what I am used to on PC. It should be simple and it should be fast!\n\nIt felt like they rushed the ending because they didn't have enough time to finish it properly. I don't really mind. At least I can start playing Human Revolution! It was a nice experience, I don't regret playing this game. I recommend Invisible War to big fans of Deus Ex games and its enviroment.

Nevertheless, I don\u2019t regret completing it, because now I can get enough of mocking this game and show you, why things are so bad and what\u2019s broken here (though it is easier to show what is not broken here).   \n\nInitially the review turned out to be bigger than I thought - 2500 words. And I think it's obvious that it hasn't fit into Steam limits. So, if you are willing to read the whole text with details - [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kdy4YB3vWiToGiK8bSZIBoSdmEjHLTsM/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=115064339293618789031&rtpof=true&sd=true]here is the link[/url]. Others can read this short review or, if they are tl;dr type of people \u2013 scroll down right to the end. Let us begin!\n\n[h1][b] To begin with, surprisingly, pros of this game: [/b][/h1]\n\n1) All food is now stacked in one slit without dividing into bars, soda, beer and etc.\n\n2) Now there are 3-4 side quests on level, and sometimes it can turn out that one contradicts another and you have to choose which side to take. \n\n3) Occasionally nice ambient is played in the background.\n\n[h1][b]  Pros are over\u2026 Here the cons go\u2026 [/b][/h1]\n\n1) Inventory, interface and resources\n\nNow, instead of nice RPG inventory with limited space, we have some semicircular crap with a bunch of slots where you can put anything you want. Body distribution damage system is changed with usual HP bar. Lock picks were removed, multitools now both hack electonics and open usual doors.Skills and augmentations are now comdined into one system\n(not a bad idea actually, but how they combined them\u2026).\n\n2) Augmentations\n\nAnd from here I honestly wanna start swearing. Dear developers, what the f*cking hell did you make? \n\nCanisters are no more divided by abilites, any usual or black market canister can give you any of its abilites. Okay, it\u2019s even more convenient, but the division of these augmentation\u2026 oh, sh*t\u2026 \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t exist, the same thing as with the inventory: there are 5 slots, that are kinda arms, legs, eyes, noggin, torso. But in reality \u2013 nope! For instance, \u201cinto the head\u201d you can implant: a) computer hacking b) invisibility for organic creatures c) toxic protection. And I think it\u2019s already obvious that this is a complete bullsh*t. Cause you will need all 3 of these augmentations for stealth but you can put in only one of course. And this is not some kind of difficulty, no \u2013 this is just idiocy. Also I think you\u2019ve already got that balance is totally screwed, cause the choice between two augmentations was just discarded, because invisibility for tech is put in into torso. \n\n3) Gameplay \n\nOh, heavens!.. It\u2019s just something I dunno\u2026 something unseen. Our dear b*tches developers decided to remove the ability to look round the corner\u2026 remove the ability to look round in stealh-action\u2026 Why? What\u2019s the point of it? What had you been thinking with while doing it? \n\nThe game\u2019s locations are f*cking tiny! They are 1\\10 times size of those, which were in the original, and during transferring between them and save loading the game relaunches (f*cking relaunches), and then a loading follows. All in all, the whole process takes about 30-40 seconds, during which the whole presence effect fades away (though it was never here\u2026 see below). The design of these locations is also a sight to behold. In 99% cases there are only two ways: a) here are a gun and a mine, kill the guard and blow the door b) there is a vent on the right, go by it and you will get behind the door. So the whole interest with tactical approach just flows away. \n\nI think that after all of the above, mentioning that AI is kinda stupid here will seem like a fly in the pile of sh*t. And as a subtotal, if all of this is combined together, you will understand that playing \u201cthis\u201d is sometimes painful. \n\nI\u2019ve completed first title in about 50 hours, thoroughly exploring all the levels. The second title with the same attitude was completed by me in 15 hours. Of course, considering pain from the gameplay, this is even got, but in reality\u2026 the game is 3 times shorter than the original.  \n\n4) Atmosphere \n\nIt is completely f*cked up here. Maybe because of the engine, maybe because of the handlessness of the developers, maybe because it\u2019s the sequel \u2013 I do not know. Anyways, you do not sense yourself as a part of this world at all. Everything seems kinda toy and unrealistic. During the walkthrough I felt the game not like a dark cyberpunk world, that survived an apocalypse, but like a playground where children decided to play soldiers. And not that it\u2019s a bad feeling, but man, not in a f*cking Deus Ex! \n\n5) Story\n\nWell, it\u2019s veeery so-so here. Really interesting it stars to be only at the end of the game, when you meet JC Denton. And I am sure that if you cut off the beginning and the middle of the game nothing is gonna change. At all! Because all the game characters, except those which were in the original (though these were messed a bit too), are dull and hardly memorable. Characters do not develop in any way, except JC which does a little bit. But he is nearly the main hero of this series and leaving his branch untouched would be a complete screw-up.And our hero or heroine \u2013 their gender does not really change anything - Alex D is on the same level as other characters: also dull, also hardly memorable. So, not to get into deep and complicated notions, I am gonna just say that I loved JC since the very first dialog with Paul on the Liberty Island and I didn\u2019t give a hell about Alex up to the end of the game. \n\nAnd, after all, now actually the main drawback of the game that creates all the cons \u2013 the game was casualed! Man\u2026 this game\u2026 it was not even casualed\u2026 here a thoroughly thought-out gameplay system was thoroughly r*ped and f*cked!   \n\nDamage distribution \u2013 f*ck it, different ammo for weapons \u2013 f*ck it, classical RPG inventory and resource management \u2013 f*ck it! And you know why it did get casualed? You\u2019ll never guess\u2026\n  \nRATING!\nRATING!\nF*CKING RATING!\nSH*TTY RATING!\nRAITING, B*TCH! \t\nM RATING! \n\nSo, school-attenders could also play Deus Ex! You think schoolers would like making difficult moral choices think about global story and compare facts? No!  As an end\u2026 a good moral choice is only the ending choice, and facts with the plot were not given sh*t about.\n\nSumming all up\u2026 \n\nIs Deus Ex Invisible War a bad game? Surprisingly \u2013 no! In fact it has everything to give you a nice stealth-action experience or shooter with not really a complicated plot. Is Deus Ex Invisible War a bad game in the series? Definitely \u2013 yes! It has nothing of what fans like about the series, and even if it is presented, it\u2019s totally broken. The second title could be completed one time just to get what\u2019s going to happen in the future of Deus Ex\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to Ion Storm by 2004: harmonic convergence, collective intelligence disable or sequel fever \u2013 but second Deus Ex came out the most hideous and the worst title in the series, nevertheless, in 2005 they released Thief Deadly Shadows. Yeah, the  game also was far from perfection: small locations, long loadings between them, but, man, the game had an atmosphere, gameplay and story. And the engine was the same! Why couldn\u2019t you perform like this with Deus Ex Invisible War? C\u2019mon you had made the first title! Of course, maybe, after second Deus Ex release you understood your mistakes and fixed them in third Thief, but anyways! Didn\u2019t nobody get a feeling during alpha or beta test that that\u2019s some kind of crap and not a Deus Ex game?..\n\nP.S.

Or was this a bad game?\n\nEventually, I came to the conclusion that the answer was none of the above.\n\nAt its best, it felt like the original Deus Ex. \nAt its worst, it was nearly unplayable (I'm looking at you: escape from Antarctica levels)\n\nThe game itself is broken from a Deus Ex standard: the levels are broken, the freedom of gameplay is limited, the sound design is worse than Deus Ex GOTY and many functions which made the original fun are reworked so that what made them interesting in the first place was gone.\n\nBearing this mind, the game (obvious down grade from the original) still surprised and even impressed me in certain points, and occasionally managed to capture the original's atmosphere.\n\n[i]Pros[/i]\n\n-interesting story which follows Dues Ex.\n-Contains many of characters from the previous Deus Ex game such as: Tracer Tong, JC Denton and friends.\n-HUD, either you like it or you don't.

So no stealthily ninja melee only (melee is broken) moments. Nuff said.\n-worst jump ever.\n-Voice acting: bland and uninteresting for the most part.\n-music: bland and just a single cord been pressed for a minute. However, there are some interesting half-decent tracks present here and there.\n\n-Simplification of mechanics: honestly expect the worst. Even after thoroughly researching the downsides of this game. I was still disappointed on so many levels.

No widescreen resolution support\n\nThis game does not natively support widescreen resolutions,  bummer for all of us running widescreen resolutions on modern hardware.  You can stretch to fit one of the very few supported 4 x 3 resolutions, but it just plain looks terrible no matter what you do.  However there is a simple mod that allows the game to play pretty much any widescreen resolution without any graphical, aspect ratio, HUD or FOV bugs.  It is called Deus Ex Widescreen Utility V2.2  It is available on the internet if you choose to search for it.  Just place it in the system folder of Deus Ex Invisble War directory and run the EXE, it will walk you through it.  \n\n\n2,  No controller support\n\nIf you are casual gamer like me and play from a couch in the living room on a home theater system, you will be disappointed to find out this game does not natively support the xbox or xinput controllers.  They will work in the menus but the keys and axis will not fucntion or map properly.  This game does however have full directinput joystick support.  So if you have an xinput to directinput emulator, an old directinput controller or a logitech controller with a xinput to directinput toggle switch, then you are in luck.  Just map the controls to the appropriate buttons and sticks of your controller and the game will play just like it did back in the old xbox days.  You will have some buttons left over so you might want to map the start button on your controller to the escape key because you cannot map the menu button.  It not you will have to press the escape key on your keyboard any time you wish to bring up the main menu to save.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499368906, "timestamp_updated": 1499368906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33246830": {"recommendationid": "33246830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057221241", "num_games_owned": 1034, "num_reviews": 500, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1499179892}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game", "timestamp_created": 1499199606, "timestamp_updated": 1499199606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474683523178100586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33207271": {"recommendationid": "33207271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075117469", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1696378106}, "language": "english", "review": "I've enjoyed IW despite its flaws.

JC Denton's existance is almost mythical as he has merged with the Helios AI.  In Invisible War you play as Alex Denton, a genetic offspring project of JC Denton.  Unlike the original JC Denton who already had a goal from the beginning working for UNATCO, in here you'll have the options throughout all the levels to aid certain factions in their goals.  Of course, more of the \"conspiracy\" stuff is strewn about.  Although unlike the last game which was red pilling anyone who played it, in here it's more of a convenient plotline.\n\nThis is essentially a watered down and more buggy Deus Ex.  It's also a lot shorter.  This game receives a lot of flack for not being as good as its predecessor, but the original was so damn good that it's almost asking the impossible.  So although this has many flaws it's still a good game worth playing.  Some of the improvements:  the \"nanokey\" and all the door codes that you'd otherwise have to check your notes for have all been condensed into one system.  This means that while speaking with characters who give you codes, or reading datacubes that have passwords/codes, all of them are automatically logged onto your keyholder, or whatever it's called here.  Also the voice acting and dialoge is great.  The graphics, as expected, look a lot better.  Also this game's color scheme is very different from the original and a lot of the places look great.  Some of the locations are unique, like the Mosque in Cairo.  You'll also revisit places from the original game which is a nice treat for prior fans.\n\nAnd now for the bad.  This game is buggy.  Enemies may end up blowing themselves up.  The game crashed on me every other time I played it.  Loading takes forever.  The ammo system is awful.  Instead of each gun having its own ammunition, in this world you have universal ammo clips.  What this means is you'll have a little bar in the corner of the screen that shows how much ammo you have left.  Each gun requires its own amount of ammo used.  There's no number to track it, you just see the bar go down and the clips get used up as you use the gun.  This would not be the worst thing, but the guns take so much damn ammo.  I was running on empty nearly the second half of the game.  Somehow I made it through but this gets really frustrating.  Also the biomod system is screwed up.  Originally if you had a biomod canister you'd simply use it on whatever feature you'd like improved.  Here though it's not so simple.  There are two types of canisters - regular and black market.  Further, the features you want to improve are divided into a few catagories, which then have subcatagories of their own.  You can only choose one of these subcatagories EACH.  So if you have strength upgraded fully under one main catagory but then you choose to upgrade the black market biomod, your melee attacks are gonna hit like a wet noodle because you will lose it.  I didn't figure this out until it was too late and I was swapping biomods, essentially wasting the precious canisters and wondering why all my upgraded levels for certain things was reverting back to nothing.  This is frustrating and not necessary.  Also the inventory system is weird.  You'll have six main switchable items where you can hit 1-6 on the keyboard and switch to it quickly.  To access the other items you need to press \"V\" (because all the menus are awkwardly divided) and then switch from the storage to the main 1-6 to use it.  Not a gamebreaker, but again, frustrating and not necessary, especially considering how the original game got all this stuff right the first try.  Characters are unlikeable and easily forgotten.  The only good thing is you'll get a chance to kill some of them off as you play through the game.  \n\nAnd of course there are multiple endings to keep with Deus Ex tradition.  Although in the first game I blew up everything up and reverted man back into the stone age, the official ending was JC Denton merging with the AI.  Since that had already been done, I decided to merge my own character with the AI.  The ending was weird with a speech from Helios about how humanity is becoming a hive mind or some crap like that.  With the lack of impact from the story and overall inferiority to the original, I'm probably not going to remember this game way down the line like I did with the original.  Everything is simply watered down.  Still, I will say play it.  It's a good game, we just have our expectations too high.

This is a game that takes a lot of forgiving some of the bizarre choices the developers made to get enjoyment from this installment.\n\nFirst off, this game needs to be played with the Visible Mod to improve some of the more awful aspects of this game. It will improve resolution and load times plus more. \n\nThe biggest thing that you will notice right off the bat is that the whole UI has been given this circular look, where part of the inventory is shown on the left side of the screen. Accessing the rest of your inventory, biomods, and objectives/images is done with hotkeys. The change was made to accommodate console players more, however the pc crowd will reject this new look, as it is less convenient, and feels clunky to work with.\nThe inventory system has been changed dramatically to simplify things. Every weapon and item, regardless of size, will take up the same amount of space in your inventory. This change was unnecessary, since it creates more frustration with items, punishing the value of small items. Resident evil 4 used the box method and it worked fine, and it was made for consoles. Ion Storm has enough good developers to make the system work on console.\nAll ammo is now universal which may not sound like a huge issue, but this system shows its flaws when you use certain weapons a lot, and the issue really shows in the last level. As absurd that it is that a rocket launcher and a flame thrower use the same ammo as a pistol, the real issue is how the weapons use the ammo. Certain weapons will use more ammo per shot than others, typically reflected by their strength. However, to conserve ammo, (since some enemies that become much more common cannot be realistically killed with melee weapons), you will not use certain strong weapons, which takes a lot of joy out of these weapons. The more powerful, interesting weapons would be more attractive to use if each weapon had their own ammo type, and balancing the weapons would\u2019ve been more successful in this case.\nSkills are completely removed from this game, taking this franchise from a first person rpg to a clunky shooter with stealth elements that poorly implemented. All depth from the combat is removed, taking most of the strategy out of fighting, and it\u2019s no longer fun to try to stealth your way through most rooms. The game puts a large focus on shooting, which isn\u2019t what the franchise was known for. \nThe endings of the first game were genius in the sense that people can argue about which one they think was the best. Invisible War\u2019s endings are not nearly as debatable, with some of them being awful, and others being just meh. They left less of an impression on me than the first game did.\nThe biggest problem I had with Invisible War was the awful worldbuilding the game did for the first 3-5 hours. With the first game, it was clear as to what you were supposed to be doing always; the intro of the game covered that perfectly. Invisible War goes out of its way to not tell the player who anyone is, why they do what they do, and why should I care about any of this. The characters in the beginning of the game won\u2019t tell Alex who is doing what, what the state of the world is, or how he\u2019s tied up into all of it. The first parts of the game are extremely slow plot wise because of this. I had so much trouble staying interested throughout the first 3-5 hours because of the complete lack of knowledge about the world. However, once you learn more about the factions involved, it shows that the factions themselves are what they appear to be, and don\u2019t operate under the same shades of grey that the factions in the first game did. \n\n\nThe game does do a good number of things right. The soundtrack is excellent, as well as most of the voice acting. Once the plot starts existing, it is well told, and is interesting throughout the rest of the game. Levels are designed well, and the places that Alex will travel are interesting and one of the strong parts. The lore is interesting. The game does a great job covering philosophy, and certain characters can convey their thoughts in a coherent, and new way. It\u2019s one of the few hallmarks of a Deus Ex game that remain here.\n\n\nTL:DR\nOverall the game isn\u2019t bad, but meh. If you aren\u2019t willing to forgive the awful worldbuilding, the move away from rpg elements, and the mostly forgettable cast, then you will not enjoy this game. If you are a hardcore Deus Ex fan and you can forgive these shortcomings, there is enjoyment to be had, and is worth picking up when the game is on sale.

But... it doesn't matter anymore.\n\nI remember seeing the first screenshots from the so-called Deus Ex2. I was totally impressed by the dynamic lights, the graphics and rest of the stuff, it seemed to me that the news Deus Ex will be one dark and awesome game, full of conspiracy and great cyberpunk atmosphere. And it's REALLY hard to me to not compare its world-shattering predecessor. I was absorbed by it fully, after all. Because it's one bad Deus Ex game, stripped from all the best features we all loved - the skills, the weapon-mod and the ammo system. On the other hand it's one easy and mediocre FPS, which would not be remembered if the company named it \"Invisible War\" instead. \n\nPlaying it for the first time (and returning to the game for the third time in ten years) I must say that something feels off from the very beginning. It's about the intro movie and the graphics, they feel cheap, not fitting the whole Deus Ex universe. And then it gets worse, once you spot the famous Oblivion like game physics. Claustrophobic maps are the biggest problem here, as well. How the hell is it possible that the first map in the original Deus Ex was almost 10 times bigger than the city hub in this one? No loader screens, no interrupting, you were free to explore. Here, on the other hand, you are just like a rat, closed in your small, not-so-cozy cage. \n\nThe story doesn't make you going either. You just play to kill, to get more ammo, because you ALWAYS need it. No stealth, no other way, no picking or guessing the code. It doesn't matter if you kill the guards or commit homicide in the whole hub, you simply do not care about the people (even the main characters), they are void of emotions, like robots. \n\nIt's recommended to play with the most recent unofficial patch, it resolves some compatibility errors in windows 10 and fixes AI and graphic glitches. \n\nThe fnal rating - 4/10\n\n+ It's still a Deus Ex game.

Later in the game, I had about 10 of the illegal biomodification and about 8 of the regular ones.

No more skills, experience, biomods are no longer permanent and can be re-allocated. What hurts this game the most is the general cluelessness of the main protagonist, the AI is both a little dumb and goes berserk if provoked by hacking.\n\nThe game compares fairly well to say system shock 2, with a similar level of complexity, a more approachable level design.\n\nThe plot has some layers and some reveals, and multiple factions with different objectives will all try to sway the main protagonist's actions in their favor, it is sometimes, even often, possible to play the game trying to maximize rewards by playing on multiple fronts but the game might be more enjoyable picking a side, and living with the consequences of treating the opposing camp as enemy. There are at least three different endings with vastly different choices.\n\nThe game does not tie-in very well with the rest of the deus ex series, although it is the second in the series, the events happen last chronologically in the deus ex lore, and it is sometimes easier to treat this world as an alternate universe version of the deus ex franchise than a direct continuation and makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nConclusion: Worth a playthrough if you adjust your expectations and have nothing better in the genre on standby", "timestamp_created": 1490278597, "timestamp_updated": 1506052466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478152602910995483", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30502289": {"recommendationid": "30502289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006077632", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1489374469}, "language": "english", "review": "When people say that games are controversial, that usually involves two sides screaming at each other, saying their opinion is the correct one.\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible War is controversial in the sense that you have the majority of people saying that it's a hyper-streamlined mess, and a smaller, more demure audience saying that \"Well, I mean, it's an okay game, just not a great Deus Ex game\".\n\nThat second audience has a point. Or would, if I could fit the rest of the sentence in without a 15-second long loadpoint inbetween. \n\n[h1]\"When ability becomes a public resource, what will distinguish people will be what they decide to do with it.

The qualities we would choose as the bedrock to the new society.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Paul Denton[/i]\n\nHere's Invisible War in a nutshell; Remember Liberty Island from the first game? Nice place, good view. \n\nNow remove everything in the middle, the statue and complex, and quite a bit off the sides. Remove the bunker, that's a loading zone. Remove all the objects, all those walls and suchlike, replace them with some scattered crates. Split what's remaining into 2 different loading zones that you can and will have to repeatedly travel back and forth between. Because that's the final level.\n\nKneecaps the game straight off the bat. 15 seconds of loading every two minutes. Even less downtime if you're trying to complete a sidequest. \n\nReal shame. Mechanically it's not even bad. Probably enjoyed running a Terminator build better than the first game, energy cells are liberally thrown at you along with unlimited recharge points, and it wants you to use augments whenever you feel like it.\n\nAugments themselves are fun to play it, and weapon mods actually have a couple of interesting effects over just damage and range. Only real issue itself is that your character progression caps out almost immediately if you don't decide to respec with the amount of initial biomods and weapons thrown at you.\n\nAlso hacking is an augment now because reasons.\n\n[h1]\"I have no enemies, merely topographies of ignorance.\"[/h1]\n[i]- JC Denton[/i]\n\nGameplay itself is standard console FPS stuff. Nothing broken, nothing to write home about.\n\nUnless you're packing the speed augment, movement is slow and enemies, apart from one lategame enemy type, are fairly stationary. There's multiple enemy types to incentivize carrying both EMP and ballistics weapon types, but the universal ammo system, the fairly small ammo cap and that enemies will never really hit you when you're sprinting with the speed augment on, means you can probably just run past them.\n\nUniversal ammo and the ammo cap being so small does make it a weird balancing act of strafing and concentrating on actually hitting people in the head. Stop n start pacing. If that sounds strategic, it's not. It's generally pretty good about \"refunding\" your ammo loss through ammo drops and the environment but there's a lategame enemy type the game loves to spam that doesn't drop ammo and explodes immediately when it dies, making melee a no-go.\n\nThere's presumably some stealth stuff, I didn't bother with it. \n\n[h1]\"Now for the REAL endgame\"[/h1]\n[i]- The secret party level with 150 pages of quotes in it[/i]\n\nWith your choice of either teen dream pop star with gelled hair, or girl with her eyes textured directly onto her face and looking in slightly different directions, you solve the rather rushed mystery of why your secret biomod academy was raided.\n\nLet's stop this review to say that you don't get to say it's an Invisible War when your main enemy has recruitment booths in the mall. \n\nInvisible War does have the distinction of being the one Deus Ex with decent endings, but the writing does have some anti-climactic pacing issues. It's pretty underwritten and doubles as a tumble of reveals and plot twists without buildup. Ends up feeling floaty. \n\nThe best paced reveal in the game is about two competing coffee shops.\n\nSo the only real, crippling problem with Invisible War is the tiny levels and constant, unending load times. And that's a very real, crippling problem. So crippling it's booted to the footnotes of history, despite the very real care and effort that went into the game proper.\n\nIf you're playing this, you're playing it to see just exactly what happened for this game to end up so ignored.

Where do I begin? Well, first off, no, I don't think it's the worst Deus Ex game (that unfortunate honor goes to The Fall, and don't even get me started on GO), but that doesn't mean I think it's the best, either. There are some things I even believe go above and beyond what Deus Ex 1 did, like the fact that you can choose which faction you can side with, and it actually has consequences for who you decide to help. Granted, you can change sides at a whim, but it was much better than having the game say \"nope, you're on this side now because your brother told you so\" like the first game, and definitely miles above the later games in the franchise, which have no excuse for how linear they are. Hell, I'd even go as far to say that I prefer IW to the Squeenix DX titles in a good amount of ways.\n\nBut, of course, as you've probably all heard, there are some issues with the game. Glaring issues, at that, the largest and most pervasive of which is the dumbing down of the systems relative to Deus Ex 1 in order to get the game running (and selling) on the original Xbox. Skill points are gone, with the skills they represented either gone completely or implemented into augmentations. Individual weapon ammunition gets the boot as well, with a universal ammo system that sounds good on paper but fails in implementation in their place. Independent limb damage also gets the boot, meaning that you can't blow your arms and legs off and crawl around using your nipples anymore. The levels have been shrunk in order to fit into the Xbox's 64 MB of RAM (a limitation that the PC port is also upheld to), which means more loading times as well. And, to top it all off, the script complexity got chopped down heavily in order to get it to look good at 480i on a CRT television.\n\nUnfortunately, on top of that, the game has not aged well in the slightest. Without a patch, it wigs out whenever it's played on a multi-core processor, it crashes frequently, and sometimes even refuses to boot for no discernable reason until you reboot your system. It also doesn't support widescreen displays without hex editing or special tools, and even then, it looks absolutely awful. The visuals (which I'm led to believe were a major cause for the levels being so small) are absolutely horrid by today's standards, even when compared to Deus Ex 1. This mainly comes down to the fact that all the humans rest firmly in the uncanny valley. The DX1 characters were awkward, blocky, and all looked the same, but it worked in their favor because the animation matched that. DX2 characters look realistic in comparison, but... Jesus, they're all grotesque. This falls on the animation, mainly. They animate almost exactly like the DX1 characters, and if you've ever seen DX1 with the HDTP models, you know how bad decent models look with that. \n\nBut, overall, I enjoyed Invisible War in spite of its flaws. It's the last game made by the original DX crew, and it's definitely got the same spirit as the first, and is quite fun even if it was cut down. You can do much worse for games, hell, you can do much worse for Deus Ex games than Invisible War, and I'd say it's at least worth one go through for you to decide for yourself if this really is the worst DX game like everyone says it is.", "timestamp_created": 1487670421, "timestamp_updated": 1487670421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539130508899688721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30050057": {"recommendationid": "30050057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032080471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1487540110}, "language": "english", "review": "The invisible game that some people insist doesn't exist, despite it being better than some of the major titles released in the past year or so. As others have stated, this game would probably have a much bigger fanbase if it simply didn't have \"Deus Ex\" in the title.\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible War is a sequel to the original Deus Ex, taking place 20 years after a combination of all three of the original game's endings. The world has suffered from \"The Collapse\", where all global communication was shut down due to what happened in Area 51 at the end of Deus Ex. In the aftermath, the WTO and the Order helped the world recover. But the conspiracies of those who would control the fate of the world--and humanity--didn't end at Area 51. After a terrorist attack that destroys Chicago, the player is put into the shoes of a biomodified agent-in-training that discovers the truth behind the governments and organizations that run the world in 2072.\n\nAs one might expect from how many Deus Ex fans pretend the game doesn't exist, there are a few flaws with Invisible War. Said flaws are important to know in advance to give a proper framework for enjoying the game. One of the big ones is that the game was designed specifically to run on the original Xbox as well as the PC, which means that it doesn't always play nice with modern (Windows 7 and onward) PCs and doesn't make use of multiple CPU cores. This also reflects in the level design, which cuts up some areas into smaller sub-areas with loading screens. The Xbox platform also ended up causing a simplification of the interface, which can go a little too far in some cases (such as the low number of potential keybinds).\n\nAnother issue with the game, which it shares with the original game, is the blandness of the voice acting. Aside from the voice-modulated Omar cyborgs, a lot of characters sound more like students reading lines from a textbook than characters in a conspiracy thriller. Sometimes it was intentional or justified (such as JC's monotone in both games, which has reasons that the developers have stated), but most of the time you'll have to add inflection mentally to really get into the story.\n\nOn the good side of things, Invisible War allows the same kind of emergent solution-finding as any other Deus Ex game. If you really try, you can play the game in almost any way you want. With the right gear and biomods, you'll almost always have at least two ways to accomplish an objective (and you'll probably have an alternate objective that still continues the story). Stealth, combat (lethal or non-lethal), diplomacy, hacking, lockpicking, and vent-crawling are all encouraged. There are a few overpowered builds (such as melee strength + stealth + baton for near-instant KOs of unarmored human enemies), but almost every option has at least some use. And unlike some games, you'll get more than enough upgrade points to upgrade every biomod, and you have the ability to swap out biomods if you don't like them (at the cost of losing the spent points in the rejected mod). So if you regret your choice in biomods, you don't always have to start over to try again.\n\nThe story is much shorter than the original game and Human Revolution, clocking in at about 10 hours if you do ~90% of the content. However, there are enough alternate scenes and objectives that it can be worth replaying if a single playthrough isn't enough. The story itself is decent as a more sci-fi followup to the ending of Deus Ex, but there are some important characters that don't get enough development or screentime and the pacing ramps up a bit too quickly near the end (and leads to an area with so many enemies that some playstyles will be extra difficult at the end). The final choices in the last location are interesting from a philosophical standpoint, but the endings don't seem to fully develop these ideas (many of which were better handled in the ending monologues of Human Revolution).\n\nAll in all, it is a good game that gets more bad press than it deserves. It won't ever be able to step out of the shadow of the original Deus Ex or the more recent revival prequels, but it's still a good diversion for those who enjoy cyberpunk games that allow for the freedom of problem-solving that Deus Ex is known for.", "timestamp_created": 1487562940, "timestamp_updated": 1487563054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55070960521697998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30034796": {"recommendationid": "30034796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129373115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1645739162}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing but never works, i fell in love with this game on original Xbox and wanted to play it on my PC but it runs for a while and then crashes at random points.", "timestamp_created": 1487511025, "timestamp_updated": 1487511025, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535830080509185791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29841047": {"recommendationid": "29841047", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992945153", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2142, "last_played": 1686506699}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, I don't get all the negative reviews about this game.  Although, I agree with the general consensus that this is not on the level of the first Deus Ex in terms of overall game mechanics, depth of story, and function; I still think this game in and of itself is worthy of at least a decent rating to say the least.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nI personally liked how the game integrated weapon upgrades and I liked how the weapons themselves functioned, although I do agree that the biomods and overall mechanics are more deeper in Deus Ex 1, this games mechanics while not as intricate are still good in their own right, and you have to remember this was made for both PC and consoles simultaneously so naturally there are going to be some hardware limitations both in function and overall game layout (now weither that is the way it should or was intended to have been is up for debate).\n\nI also liked the very deep explanation and reasoning that JC Denton gave for his world plan, I thought some of the end game speeches were very emotional in terms of philosphy and relatability to the current state of affairs in our world and evolution.  I also liked how alot of the side quests had some end-ties that made you think about people and morality (like the 'coffee wars' and the 'real' NG resonance).\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nWhat I disliked about the game were its minor bugs and quirky mechanics (like the jumping sometimes was springy and ascending and descending ladders sometimes was glitchy as well).  I also disliked the loading screens and I think the devs should have addressed this for the PC release, but as for a console the loading screens are justified due to obvious hardware constraints.  \n\nI also disliked the random crashes when simultaneously alt-tabbing and using google chrome, as well as some very rare crash(es) that only happened 1 or 2 times out of 30+ hours of gameplay.  I also thought the keymapping wasn't very well implemented and the fact the steam overlay didn't work due to some .exe anomoly was kinda lazy to not be addressed for the steam release in my opinion. And lastly I thought some of the dialogue was dry and uneventful during some parts of the game. \n\nWhat is up for debate:\n\nThe universal ammo system could be a tossup in terms of it being good or bad as well as how the limited augmentations are implemented, althought the limited augs/biomods and the ability to interchange them mid-game somewhat makes sense in terms of form and function.  As well as how the devs decided to merge all three past endings to be the cannon for this game is all up for debate and is not either good or bad in my opinion.\n\n\nPros:\n\n+Very good mid-game and end-game story dialogue that really has some deep morality and philsophical messages.\n+Good weapon mechanics and entertaining ragdoll physics.\n+Stylish weapons and atmosphere that really capture the futuristic cyberpunk lore.\n+Game title that really fits the layout of the game (the wars really are invisible as they are mostly all internal).  As well as some good cannonical endings and happenings that mostly tie in well with the first deus ex (although the implementation of all 3 endings of Deus Ex 1 is debatable in terms of how it was implemented).\n+Good music/ambiance and implementation of throwback remixes from Deus Ex 1\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Load times that should have been addressed for the PC port.\n-Poorly implemented steam interface in terms of in-game functionality of the overlay that should have been addressed pre-release in steam.\n-some minor mechanic bugs that seem obvious (namely the jump mechanic and ladder climbing seemed like it had clippng issues at times).\n-debatable mechanics in terms of form and function (namely universal ammo and a debatable sneak detection mechanic)\n\nOverall I give this game a strong 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1486797374, "timestamp_updated": 1486798776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740792334079742432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29766257": {"recommendationid": "29766257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012371813", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1490535285}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is like a peacock in a small, metal cage.\n\nPlay it once to understand the overall story, but don\u2019t expect replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1486489977, "timestamp_updated": 1486489977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466302633285522461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "29764509": {"recommendationid": "29764509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999267556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2501, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2453, "last_played": 1483401771}, "language": "english", "review": "Of course it's not like the first one but I found it funny.

That won't stop me from bagging it for the majority of this review, however...\n\nI'm not going to be saying anything new here. Invisible War is inferior to the original masterpiece in almost every single respect, but that's not to say it has no redeeming features. Firstly, the soundtrack is underappreciated. It's nowhere near on the level of the glorious original, but it is still some solid ambience that suits the game's atmosphere well. Secondly, the game still delivers when it comes to player choice. While few decisions truly impact future outcomes outside of the endings, there are many choices you can make that have immediate benefits and detriments, so it feels like you're making a difference in the world regardless. Lastly, while the game's artstyle has been drastically changed for the worst, featuring a more generic sci-fi aesthetic rather than the cyberpunk, near-future vibe crucial to the theme of the first game, this is still a very impressive looking game for its time with awesome dynamic lighting and detailed character models.\n\nWhat drags IW down most of all is the level design. All paths available are immediately evident to you because areas are so small that the opportunity for exploration is greatly restricted. There's no real need for creativity or ingenuity because there's always a vent right in front of you or a front door to blast through. There's not enough wiggle room to offer genuine freedom and stealth is a joke. These levels are truly tiny and sneaking in this game revolves almost exclusively around going invisible with your augmentation and running past enemies rather than circumventing threats via alternate paths, distraction or timing. The game's also braindead easy. You're going to get hurt a lot in combat, but the game dumps ammo and healing on you at all times to the point of making damage and ammo quantity negligible, and the game offers almost all available weapons, weapon mods and augs to you by the third hour. There's no consequence to bruteforcing your way to objectives because there's no challenge anyway.\n\nThe worst thing about this game is the story. I don't understand what went wrong here. The original was a relatively realistic depiction of where humanity would be in fifty years - except that every conspiracy theory ever is true. It was greatly exaggerated at times, but there was typically a believable explanation for everything and nothing felt extraordinary given the time and world it took place in. It was deep, philosophical, political, conspiratorial and relevant. It touched upon a broad range of topics and cultures. It also had plenty of heart. You developed relationships across the game and saw the blights of humantity, but there were also many moments of brevity from the bleakness with humour. It's a game that raised a lot of questions and tackled real-world concerns and it feels shockingly relevant even 23 years later because it was just so intelligent and insightful. It didn't so much \"predict\" the future so much as it presented the possibilities of the future based on the current world events in the time that it was created - both tangible and... less tangible. Invisible War doesn't really accomplish any of these things. It doesn't say anything particularly profound or ask any questions not already pondered over previously. When it does, it lacks subtelty. It's more interested in its immediate plot - a lacklustre retread of ideas from the original featuring recurring characters with twisted motivations, lame plot-twists and ridiculous faction objectives and contrivances set in a post-societal collapse yet simultaneously hyper sci-fi world that has no valid explanation for existing - rather than keeping things grounded and offering insight into the current world we exist in. It's too far, too silly and feels a whole lot too much like fan-fiction. There's little emotional weight and none of the characters are likable. The new ones are forgettable and largely one-dimensional with few notable exceptions (the Omar and NG Resonance), and as previously mentioned, the reintroductions of old ones are highly questionable. I don't think anyone would have predicted the decisions the original cast would have made in this sequel and that's because they're not them. They don't have the same traits or motivations and where they end up and how is just odd. See for yourself and ask yourself if any of them align in any way with the characters you were once familiar with. Perhaps one or two do... the rest? I don't see it. Lastly, of the four Deus Ex protagonists, Alex D is definitely the least interesting. He/she doesn't have much of a backstory or character arc, only being a servant to other people for the entire game and a clone of JC and Paul Denton in more ways than one (this isn't really a spoiler because the game makes it obvious from the start and announces it unceremoniously). This game is almost more about JC Denton than Alex - in which case, I'd rather we had just played as JC again. They also don't have the charm of Adam or JC. No James Bond one-liners, no lengthy debates on philosophy and politics and just generally barely any emotional response to the world around them. No line of dialogue comes remotely close here to even the dullest of the original game and Human Revolution's moments.\n\nAnother terrible letdown about Invisible War is its generally janky nature. Physics are absurd, movement is clunky, and it is bugs galore. Don't get me wrong, the original had more than its fair share of unintended goofiness, but unlike Invisible War, it rarely took you out of the experience.\n\nWith all that being said, what I like about IW isn't outweighed by its necessary comparisons to its predecessor and successors. Ultimately, while simple, combat is really satisfying. Blasting people in the face with an explosive shotgun then watching their ragdoll's limbs twist and morph as they fly into a bunch of physics objects never gets old. The story has moments of intrigue and interacting with the citizens of the world can be a joy when it isn't directly relating to a certain other game. Participating in petty corporate wars? Amusing. Being tasked to break into a club's basement to steal data to a group of blackmarket cyborgs? Entertaining. Probing the AI facade of an international popstar for being a blatant piece of spyware? Intriguing. Even hearing the ideologies of a universal religion, no matter how unbelievable they may be, is still deeper and more interesting than what most games can offer. Exploring these bite-sized environments (breaking into apartments, bartering with snake oil merchants, completing side-quests) is still a ton of fun too and while I think overall the story is a joke, there are again moments where it holds up on its own. Dude Sex: Invisible Whore is a satisfying shooter that gives you more flexibility in approaching objectives than most and honestly, that's enough to make a good game.\n\nIf this was 2003 and we had been eagerly anticipating the sequel to what I consider to be the greatest game ever released, only to be served a significantly shorter, pitifully underwhelming experience at full price, there's no way in hell I'd recommend it... but given that there's a simple mod to improve compatibility on modern platforms and the game is only a little over a dollar on sale, it's a pretty easy recommendation given that it's still a fairly solid game. Just forget about trying to stealth through it, be rewarded for thinking outside the box or being immersed in a relatable world because this game's inept at those things.

Before it is even installed, it is expected to be at least as good and preferably better than one of the greatest games of all time. Hardly fair odds.\n\nAs a result many people don't see anything other than the fact that Invisible War is not the same as the original Deus Ex. It doen't get a chance to stand on it's own and be judged on merit.\nIt's like starting a music career by being told that if you don't do better than The Beatles, you are a complete failure.\n\nIMO Invisible War should be seen not as the sequel to Deus Ex, but as a different game in the same universe. The was Thor is not a sequel to Iron Man, but simply a different film set in the same universe.\nWhile there are many of the same themes and elements, the end products are not the same.\n\nIf judged on it's own merit, Invisible War is a pretty great game. Sure, the levels are small, but they are well designed and offer many gameplay options.\nThe shooting is competent. Much better than it ever was in Deus Ex. Controls are well above most games of it's time.\n\nIt's no secret that many things were dumbed down from Deus Ex. While I do prefer the old, more advanced system which gave more player options, the new, simpler system is perfectly functional. And given the in-game time gap between the two games, such changes can easily be explained by technological development. Just look at the difference in weapons from WW1 to WW2.\n\nOne major point that divides people is the universal ammo. Personally, I think it's interesting. While it doesn't make much logical sense that all types of weapons would use the same ammo, it does bring something new to the game.\nSince different weapons use different amounts of ammo with each shot, inventory management becomes more important. Especially for people like me who in most games are used to just using the pistol 95% of the time and therefore always having plenty of ammo for the big guns. In Invisible War you can't just squirrel away lots of ammo for the big guns and save it for the big enemies. Now you actually have to plan ahead from time to time.\nWhile it's not a system I would like to see widely used in games, I do find it interesting.\n\nBottom line:\nI personally think Invisible War is a very solid game.

To put that in perspective it took me roughly 25-26 hours to beat the first Deus Ex the first time and around 15-16 to beat Mankind Divided, which almost everyone agrees is too short. This game is very short for a Deus Ex game, so don't expect the same amount of build up and revelation that you might have gotten in other games. For instance, in the first hour you discover that the illuminati still exist and are up to no good in the neighborhood. All of that being said, for the price that you can get this game on sale (around $2.49 I think) it's a solid chunk o' fun. You end up going to like 4 cities, so if you were pissed that all of Mankind Divided took place in Prague, then this game might suit you.\nThe most obvious problem with the game is that it was made for consoles, and by consoles I mean OLD consoles (like the first xbox). Therefore you won't get any large areas or levels. Even when they redo liberty island from the first game it is split into 3 different sections (not including UNATCO headquarters). The game was certainly not optimized for PCs and the game engine will crash if there are too many objects with physics. There were a few times when I was stuck because the game would spawn in enemies right after I had made a save and them spawning would crash the game. The way that I found would fix this was to destroy boxes and such that were using the physics engine, but such a problem shouldn't exist in such a simple (both graphically and mechanically) game. Sometimes it feels like no work went into the areas of the game because you generally run into the same features in each city.\n-A bar where you hire a pilot and progress the main objective\n-A locked off area where the final objective in that area will end up taking you\n-Apartments where you have to kill someone or something\n-The same factions and coffee shops (I know that it's important to the narrative for both of these, but seriously)\nIF I were to commend the game on one thing, it is that each city has roughly the same amount of secondary objectives. I remember when I played the first Deus Ex that all the side quests were in New York and places like Hong Kong had literally nothing to do but follow the main quest (despite Hong Kong being larger and better designed than New York).\nReally the only other reason I would recommend this game besides the fact that I like Deus Ex is that this game has some interesting lore. This game doesn't cling on to companies and characters from the first game (although it does include them) and the developers seem to have taken the time to try to develop new ideas. The most interesting that comes to mind is the Omar, who are like a more extreme version of Helios's final phase.\nWhatever. I like the game, it was okay, and most importantly it was cheap.

Invisible War's faction system that provides you with different groups to give your loyalty to, and the ways that these groups may still ask you to do things that make you uncomfortable are an impressive reflection of the not-so-black-and-white situation of being affiliated with any group. I appreciated the faction system and their contrary objectives in a given stage.\n\nGameplay was a bit clunky though. That ring-shaped HUD, for one, was a massive, epic fail in my opinion that obscured far too much of the line of sight than I would have liked. Additionally, the limitations on the holding capacity were just silly. Beyond this, the game didn't give you much of an opportunity to stick to a non-lethal approach when it came to the armoured Templars. There was absolutely zero way for you take them down without blowing them up.\n\nThere were a few things I really thought were good. I really liked the spiderbombs and the Mag Rail. I really liked the differences in the storyline that you could encounter depending on if you were playing as a female character or male one. I also really, really loved all of the little storyline details that connected the first and second games, such as the Gunther Hermann Skul-Gun request. The reproduction of the original stages and transgenics were also nice to see. I like how those details were reworked into this game.\n\nAll in all, if you were a massive fan of the first game, this one might be worth playing if you just want to see what they managed to do with the plot.  It might not be an enjoyable experience, but it might give you a sense of achievement, and might be entertaining to see how they address some of the details that went into the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1479936628, "timestamp_updated": 1479936628, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668642222881317139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26688569": {"recommendationid": "26688569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021687939", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1478320259}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the Deus Ex series because it has a deep, thought provoking narrative and it challenges you to make tough philosophical and moral choices.\n\nThe gameplay of Deus Ex: Invisible War does not live up to the Deus Ex name.

With some problems, sure.\n\nIts biggest problem may be that it has to live up to the incredible success of the first game. A hard task by itself. And does it? Yes and no. While it does not start with the same atmosphere as the first game, after a few levels, and after a few biomod upgrades, it becomes more obvious that it really does exist in the same game world as the opiginal. It is not as long of a game, and its a pity that it ends not very long after reaching its full momentum, but there is enough Role Playing and Action to be fresh and entertaining.\n\nThe zones are divided into sections makes it feel less open world in the \"safe areas\" (i.e. non combat zones where as opposed to zones with 90% combat) that, say, Hong Kong did in the first game. And even on a modern (2016) pc, loading is a bit slow. On Windows 10, you get to see your desktop for at least 10 seconds of loading, and I doubt there will be any patch to fix this in the future. This just means that loading between sub areas can break the momentum and mood slightly. However, there is enough complexity and there are enough missions in the \"safe areas\". Also each map, while following the city architecture, is different enough to justify it being stored in seperate zones. It would be nice if it was remade in one unified map, but that is unlikely to ever happen. However, it shouldnt ruin the experience.\n\nI've seen many people complain about the UI, which is different to most first person games. I personally liked it. Its circular rather than linear, and that is really the only difference compared to other first person games. Unlike most games, you get to choosethe UI colour. I liked that I could choose a nice subtle red colouor. However, I had some minor issues with the controls. Pressing action on locked objects like doors or chests automatically changed your currently held item to the multi-tool lockpick. Which is fine when you arent in combat, but, if you accidently hit action during combat while beside a locked door or chest, you find yourself trying to defeat the opponent with a lockpick instead of your weapon of choice. The other minor thing, you dont have a \"put the item away\" button, so its possible to forget you have your weapon out in a non combat zone and accidently shoot an npc. Two minor issues that generally shouldnt be a problem if you are paying attention to what you are doing.\n\nAnd that is about it. But to summarise:\n- It can take some time to setup on a 2016 PC, but there are community guides in the game's section on steam to help with this. Get the improved textures and resolution fixes.\n- Its slow to get into the pace of a Deus Ex game, but well worth giving the time to reach its full pace. Sadly I would have liked that pace to have lasted 2-3 additional levels but it is stilla  full complete game that is worth the time.\n- There will be many loading screens, but do not let that give you the feeling that the game itself is small.\n- There are some minor UI issues but nothing truely problematic.", "timestamp_created": 1473774459, "timestamp_updated": 1473774459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567886710166931152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25486722": {"recommendationid": "25486722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051011214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1280, "last_played": 1458087737}, "language": "english", "review": "There's some enjoyment to be had here for fans of the franchise in discovering the creators' vision of a far-flung, nano-augmented future and the eventual fate of the original games' protagonists, but the lack of options in tackling your objectives due to the segmented, claustrophobic game world, and the blank-stared, unmemorable characters make this hard to truly recommend.

I've been trying to force myself to play through this game since about 2007 on multiple computers and the original Xbox... and I just can't do it.  To me, it looks worse, runs worse, and feels worse than its predecessor.\n\nYes, I'd rather play through the original Deus Ex with its stiff, robotic character animations and relatively simplistic engine than this bloated, compartmentalized, rushed-out cash-grab of a game.\n\nThere is nothing about Invisible War that isn't disappointing.  The HUD is atrocious and obtrusive, the game engine is obviously the same one Ion Storm used for the (equally disappointing) Thief: Deadly Shadows... complete with floppy bodies and almost nonexistant light sources (did it really need to be this dark EVERYWHERE?), there's universal ammo, switching weapons and items is a chore, there's no character customization beyond biomods (of which you can only have up to five TOTAL - yes, you read that right), skills are gone, and with them, any reason to play this game as anything other than an action FPS (non-lethal is pointless, exploration is pointless), your inventory is tiny, the plot is shamefully bad, the NPCs stare at you with these creepy, wide open, unblinking eyes (again, even with worse graphics, the original Deus Ex did it better), a lot of items in the environment lack even basic textures, and then there are the load times... THE LOAD TIMES!\n\nAs Invisible War was developed concurrently with the Xbox version, it was built from the ground up with the Xbox in mind... which meant lots of tiny level segments with loads between each.  However, even on current hardware, this game takes forever to load.  I dread level transitions because of this.\n\nThis game is pure amateur hour and, as I mentioned, feels rushed and unfinished.  Even for its time, this is just bad.  Thief: Deadly Shadows, which came out about the same time, was made by the same people, and used the same engine, is better and more polished than this (though strangely, it seems Ion Storm had a fixation on forcing the player to choose between multiple, one-dimensional factions during this period, much to the detriment of both games).\n\nSo that's it.  I just can't force myself to try to play it anymore.  I'm done.  I'm not going to waste any more time on what will eventually be as much of a disappointment at the end as it was at the beginning.  It will forever be the black sheep of the Deus Ex universe (even with Square Enix at the helm of the series).  This is absolutely not a recommended game.  Play something - anything - else.

The game needed 5 minutes of work after it was installed on my Windows 10, i7, gtx1080, but I solved the problem I had (where game was always in window mode but not filling the whole screen since I kept seeing my desktop which was annoying) by selecting the second highest resolution in the graphics options and that solved the issue for good. Since then I had no issues. Each time the game loads however your screen flickers around as if you would crash back to desktop, but the game each time gets a grip of itself and the map still loads normally, thus, I so far did not even have one game crash, as it runs smooth and stable.\n\nThe graphics are very good for a game of that time period, but be aware, this is a much more simplified version from Deus Ex. No more manual input of codes, no more lock picks (multitool does all), no more different ammo types, as MAKO is the only weapons manufacturer which all require the same ammo type (whether a pistol or a rocket launcher). The voice acting also had a bit of a downgrade compared to its predecessor, so let's say the predecessor was a 10, this here would be a 7. For instance, when you traveled to Hong Kong in the predecessor, all NPCs spoke English with a Chinese accent, but this time when you go to Germany or Egypt, most still speak with American accents but there are NPCs that speak English with Arabic or German accents as well. If such minor details do not concern you, you will still love the voice acting. If you play as a male (Alex Denton), your voice seems very tired, which can be a bit frustrating, but then again, the rest of the voice acting is still top notch for today's standards! \n\nGraphics as mentioned before are good. But too bad no more in-game animations like in Deus Ex, where you could see your chopper fly off. Another minor detail but I believe it added a lot of quality to a game for its time, and now it is gone. You just click your aerial transport (Jet or Helicopter, you pick your pilot!) and that is all. Then again, each pilot drops you off in different locations, which was kind of neat, but then again, with the maps so small it won't really matter.\n\nWeapon controls. This is a bit of a disappointment. It is extremely easy to kill now as compared to the predecessor, and another downside is that they completely removed the skill system, so you have the same shooting abilities from the start to the end of the game. Also, you carry much fewer mods than before, and upgrading your mods is extremely easy, so you are already at max strength before even reaching mid-game. If that is good or bad, you tell me, but I liked it better when I used to be JC.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nPros:\n+ Continous great storyline right after where the predecessor ended (Key point in Deus Ex universe!!!)\n+ Still pretty good voice acting overall\n+ Some nice locations!\n+ Fun side quests\n+ You can sometimes make some funny choices!!\n+ Sound in the night clubs! Real Band known as \"Kidney thieves\". Good stuff!\n+ Plenty hours of gameplay for the price.\n\nCons:\n- Apparently unstable in many systems. Took me 5 mins for it to work well, others apparently need more time.\n- Small maps.\n- Simplified weapon usage\n- no skills, no lockpicks, multi tool does all now. \n- Overall simplified game from its predecessor. \n- Much more linear gameplay than predecessor.\n- Less Augmentations and augmentations very easily upgradeable (simplifying game).\n- Less in-game notes (less newspapers, books, texts, logs, screenshots, etc. In Deus Ex you really felt the conspiracy, here not as much).\n\nMy advice:\n\nIf you just just got into Human Revolutions and then Mankind Divided and find yourself intrigued by the Deus Ex story, then pick up Deus Ex GOTY edition which runs smooth, enjoy that amazing classic, and then afterwards, play through this game as well. Both are worth the money and the first Deus Ex has probably the best replay value for any Single Player game of all time, I play it once a year since 15 years and each time still encounter new hidden areas and locations and outcomes!!!

Gunplay is far more responsive but less detailed and you cannot instantly kill with headshots or a spinal tap with a pistol/baton. Skill points have been removed, replaced more or less with \"augmentation biomods\" - these change your characters build in a roundabout way.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\nFurther answers the plot of the first Deus Ex game, introduces old characters in states of improved power.

Yes, cringe. The female version isn't any better.\n\n[h1]Criticisms; Major[/h1]\n\nSeverely lacking depth in a lot of it's mechanics. Gone are skills that would dictate your avatar's capacity for overcoming the obstacles in the past game. Due to the level design, jumping augmentations are extremely imbalanced and as such can be used to break the game.\n\nRemarkably poorer, isolated level design.

J.C Denton and Paul Denton in particular were given a lot of detail, realizing them in a new age.\n\nA majority of cities, hubs now have full 3D skybox support, adding a massive range of immersion\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\n\nA few decades had past after J.C Denton and Paul Denton, agents of UNATCO revealed the massive conspiracy\nof shadow governments and the Illuminatus bloodline fighting within. J.C Denton merged himself, nano-technologically becoming Helios-Human hybrid, exploded Area 51 and left the area in ruins. However, this caused an event called \"The Collapse\" which resulted in many proxy wars and economical depression. Eventually, Alex Denton was enrolled after these events making J.C and Paul terrorists but also living mythos, like Aquinas, the mythical Hill of the Gods. Alex Denton is eventually surrounded by factions he has never heard of before, becoming entrenched in the conspiracy  similarity J.C Denton had became involved in.\n\n[h1]Evaluation[/h1]\n\nDeus Ex Invisible War is a game that suffers from a rather ironic lack of transparency regarding the structure of the story, gameplay and the engine's capacity for graphical fidelity (Unreal 2) and a disturbingly awful port seen for a game of it's time requiring a dedicated GPU capable of Shader 3.0 (this used to cost hundreds and wasn't exactly compatible with many motherboards). Invisible War is a horribly camoflagued console port and Warren Spector, Ion Storm's creative director back in it's hayday should realized half-way into it's beta that it is not a Deus Ex game nor a game that would be held in high regard.", "timestamp_created": 1472814601, "timestamp_updated": 1698397026, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25300750": {"recommendationid": "25300750", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999217003", "num_games_owned": 2564, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 1947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1552, "last_played": 1608930804}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 2 | 3 *4* 5] = ~75% (67%-83%)[/h1]\n\nI've played through this game [i]many times[/i], at least well above 10. That's not as often as through its predecessor, the original Deus Ex, which must have been well over 20.\n\nI agree that this game is limited in comparison to DX1: The locations are small-scale - Upper Seattle seems like a set of rooms and corridors instead of a city, and the loaded maps themselves are small, so you'll often load a new section, but it's not much higher in frequency than in DX1. There are no skills. There is only one type of ammunition which happily feeds into every weapon. The dialog feels cheaper and rushed (probably to keep the data size small). There's also a lot [i]less[/i] dialog/writing. The user interface is simplified, its functionality is limited, and the inventory is small. Quite a few angles from which the console origin shines through. And there must be other reasons that I only played [i]this often[/i] instead of [i]very often[/i].\n\nBut I don't agree in the least that the game looks crappy or is considerably worse than DX1. I like the graphics, especially the realtime lighting engine, it's fun to physically toss unconscious/dead people around, and I like exploring / sneaking through the (small) environments. And by the way, the too narrow FOV can be [url=http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Invisible_War#Video_settings]fixed[/url], apparently the resolution can even be cranked up.\n\n\"Invisible War\" is a proper entry of the Deus Ex franchise, because it's all there: Lone wolf 1st person superhuman experience, choice of passive/stealthy/aggressive gameplay, alternative routes to objectives (incl. vent crawling), free exploration incl. looting, and a story that starts slow and small, then expands into various factions incl. conspiracy ingredients, then becomes increasingly big just like in DX.\n\nIf you think about it, the ending is even done better than in DX1 because while DX1 mostly relied on an end-o-matic solution like DX:HR except the buttons and panels were spread around the map more, DX:IW's ending choices involve battle (incl. all strategic freedom of the franchise except \"just sneaking past it\"), dialog (Faction relations partially kept open to the very end.), button pushing, and more.\n\nYou can even choose whether to play a man or a woman (both conveniently called \"Alex\").\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible War is a really well done game. It does not live up to the original, but a good part of the reason would be that it follows a template established by DX1 instead of pioneering said template. You play it with expectations instead of not yet knowing what's up and getting your mind blown. Player freedom is also clearly lower.\n\nBut it's a firm double-thumbs-up recommendation that, if you haven't played it yet, should be on your list, especially if you love the Deus Ex universe.

Slap universal ammo on it (Which means once you are out of ammo, you are out of it for EVERY WEAPON YOU HAVE) \u2014 and all the talks about ability to choose right tool for the job go down the drain since the only weapon that can manage scarcity of ammo is unique (assassin) pistol with Damage Upgrade and Ammo Scavenger.\n\nBut what about good sides? Yep, that's what makes just terrible game PAINFULLY terrible one. It's got good sides!\n\nFirst, the most responsive climbing mechanic. Ever. No more stupid waist-high walls, you may pull yourself up. You can stack crates high enough for your head to touch the railing at the highest point of jump? You can pull yourself up. And it's not based on some stupid special places to climb - if you can reach it and there is sufficient place to fit while crouched - you'll make it.\n\nSecond, EVERY weapon got a secondary mode. SMG with flashbangs? I'll take two. Railgun with alt fire allowing to shoot through walls? Awesome. Flamethrower with alt-fire that allows to bring the flame into mid-range? Neat. Sure, these days everyone and their mothers got weapons with two or more modes, but back in 2003 it was that or Unreal. And Unreal hasn't any RPG elements.\n\nThird, grenade goods. You got regular, flashbangs, smoke, gas, noise (Yep. Extremely rare, and since it's one use\u2026), emp, scramble and\u2026 spider grenade. Which spawns actual spider bot, complete with cute zapper and funny turn animation. Same as above, nothing Unreal hadn't, but Unreal is not an RPG in any way.\n\nFourth, very cool bot hacking mechanic. You stay hidden, then you charge at turret/bot, \"tag\" him and then you try to hide somewhere waiting for timer to expire. Cha-ching, you are now controlling a piece electronic. Want to shoot the baddies? Not so fast, they don't even know that bot is no longer on their side. Take your time, pick the best position for massacre \u2014 fun starts when YOU trigger it.\n\nFifth, this game got awesome hidden pony \u2014 Omars (Appreciating your bussiness, yeah, right), who succesfully achieved hivemind (In other words, creating succesfuly that Helios failed to achieve) and, well, the prosper while rest of the world is crumbling. While they have limited role, they are interesting as concept for post-apocalyptic world. And they got somewhat justified ending should you kill every major faction members in the end (All the wannabe rulers die in a nuclear fire, world is fading out while Omars prosper, later advancing enough to leave the Earth behind).\n\n\nConclusion: I wish Steam had ability to be neutral about \"Thumbs up\" and \"Thumbs down\".", "timestamp_created": 1471626474, "timestamp_updated": 1471626474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684661805629730225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24938547": {"recommendationid": "24938547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011937104", "num_games_owned": 3784, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1637043868}, "language": "english", "review": "A somewhat entertaining albeit forgettable sequel to Deus Ex.\n\nThe only truly dreadful thing about this game is the UI which looks like it was designed for consoles.

When I tried either of these, the text in menus often disappeared, and sometimes the game just didn't render at all.\n\nLoading screens often took minutes to load, I believe I fixed this by closing the Logitech Gaming Framework (lcore.exe).

[/h1]\n\n[u] Short Answer: [/u]\nWhether or not I recommend you play this game depends on your answer to one question. [b] How much did you like the story and universe of the original Deus Ex? [/b] If you really liked it, then I definitely recommend playing this game because I really think that, for all of the game's shortcomings, the story is not one of them- and it carried me through to the end. On the other hand, if you didn't much like the story and universe of the original Deus Ex, then I wouldn't recommend this game- because I found that the story is its one saving grace. Without this factor, you're left with a decidedly subpar game, especially when compared to the original Deus Ex.\n\n[u] Long Answer: [/u]\n\n[b] Background Info: [/b]\nAction role-playing game developed by Ion Storm, as a sequel to the hugely successful original Deus Ex on PC. The game was released for PC and the original Xbox- with the developers seeming to focus heavily on optimising the game for the latter. \n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b]\nThe game itself plays out as a fairly rudimentary action RPG. It feels like the developers took the in-depth systems of Deus Ex and stripped them down to their bare essentials- probably in order to downsize the game for the benefit of the Xbox. As a consequence, the \u201cskills\u201d system has been completely removed; ammo is universal for all weapons and multitools/lockpicks are now a single item. However, there is one saving grace in the form of the biomodification system. This system plays out in much the same way as the augmentation system from the original Deus Ex, with plenty of scope to craft a character that will cater to your playstyle. The augmentation system was one of the most interesting parts about the original Deus Ex; so I\u2019m glad to see that the developers at least had their priorities in order in this regard when creating Invisible War. \n\nGameplay itself resembles the original Deus Ex, and the options available to the player in order to achieve certain objectives are much the same. Stealth, combat and hacking are viable options. Similarly you can choose between a non-lethal/lethal playstyle. These options are very rudimentary compared to the original Deus Ex; however their inclusion is appreciated. On the other hand, a major problem of the game is how easy it is. I played on the hardest difficulty (realistic) and didn\u2019t get stuck at all. For the record, I played a stealth character; however I did try out combat as well and wasn\u2019t impressed. \n\nHowever, hands down the biggest problem for me is the game\u2019s miniscule areas. It\u2019s no secret that the original Deus Ex had massive areas, which you could explore for hours and continue to find new things. The areas in Invisible War are so small that you can finish each in 10 minutes, tops. And after each area you are forced to endure another painfully long loading screen. Any tension or momentum that the game might create is utterly sapped by the repulsively frequent and lengthy loading screens. This is a huge issue, and I would be much more tempted to recommend the game were it not for this problem. Finally, the physics engine is hilariously bad- so be prepared for some unintentionally funny moments if you do decide to play this game! \n\n[i]Final Verdict:[/i] Adequate. Feels like the developers downsized the original Deus Ex\u2019s systems and were left with incredibly subpar gameplay mechanics and insufferable load times. \n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b]\nIt's no embellishment to say that the original Deus Ex had an outstanding soundtrack- with not a single unmemorable tune in the whole repertoire. The sequel to this game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, also had a great, fitting, memorable soundtrack. Invisible War, once again, falls short of these lofty standards. Tunes aren't particularly memorable, and there aren't too many of them either. Nevertheless, I would say that the soundtrack fits the cyberpunk setting of the game- so it deserves credit in that regard. Similarly, the soundtrack does have SOME particularly good tunes, such as the \"Heron's Loft\" theme and the title theme. \n\n[i]Final Verdict:[/i] Adequate. Some standout tracks, but for the most part unmemorable. Nevertheless appropriate for the setting of the game- which is worthy of credit, I think. \n\n[b]Story and Setting:[/b]\nDeus Ex: Invisible War, takes place 20 years after the original Deus Ex. An interesting point of note is that the original Deus Ex had multiple endings, so you may be wondering how Invisible War could continue such a story. Interestingly enough, Invisible War does not commit to a single ending- instead melding aspects of each ending into one, and building off of that. I acknowledge that some may not be a fan of this decision- as it essentially invalidates the endgame choices of the original Deus Ex. However, I found this design decision interesting, and was intrigued to see how the game would continue such a story. Overall, I think it did it well. Thematically, Invisible War is extremely similar to the original- tackling the ethics of body modification, as well governments and secret societies and how they influence the world at large. In other words, the game is rich in conspiracy- in true Deus Ex style. \n\nThe plot starts out fairly slow- with a tedious tutorial area followed by being ejected into the first \u201chub area\u201d of the game- Seattle. I found that Seattle was the hub with the most activity; boasting lots of areas and a lot of side missions. However, at the same time I found it to be the least interesting. Instead I think Seattle serves as the area where all of the main factions of the game are introduced, offering the player choice in terms of who to side with at a very early stage. Thankfully you don\u2019t have to commit to a faction for the whole game; you\u2019re given plenty of time to ponder individual ideologies and motivations. In a way, Invisible War trumps even the original Deus Ex in this regard, wherein a lot of the decisions pertaining to \u201cchoosing a side\u201d were out of the player\u2019s hands (at least until the end of the game). \n\n[i]Final Verdict:[/i] Invisible War\u2019s one true claim to fame in my opinion. Not as enthralling as the original Deus Ex\u2019s plot, but it still kept me going until the end. I consider that the plot gains traction when you reach the second hub area, as this is the point where I felt connected to the story, and the compulsion to see it through superseded the subpar gameplay mechanics. \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nIf you\u2019ve stayed with me for this whole review, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have noticed the amount of comparisons to the original Deus Ex. This just goes to show how the odds were stacked against Invisible War from the get-go. It came in with a TON of sequel baggage: the pressure to surpass what many consider to be the greatest game of all time. Couple that with being majorly downsized in order to appeal to the console demographic and it seems that Invisible War was doomed from the start. However, as a huge Deus Ex fan, I find myself recommending this game. Yes all of the gameplay systems are \u201cadequate\u201d instead of \u201csuperb\u201d; yes the soundtrack is \u201cokay\u201d instead of \u201cincredible\u201d, but as an entry into the Deus Ex universe of conspiracy and intrigue, it\u2019s just as worthy as Human Revolution in my opinion. \n\nSo, if you really want to see where the Deus Ex chronology ends, then I definitely recommend buying this game. On the other hand, if you have absolutely no connection with the story and universe of Deus Ex, then there really is no reason to buy this game- as there are much better alternatives in terms of gameplay. To conclude, I\u2019m perfectly fine with accepting this game into the Deus Ex universe; however it certainly doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the original Deus Ex and Human Revolution. Here\u2019s hoping Mankind Divided will be another worthy addition to the franchise! \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1469044938, "timestamp_updated": 1469044938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729770898818969727", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24397448": {"recommendationid": "24397448", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990570513", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1431329272}, "language": "english", "review": "do not buy. really bad port.", "timestamp_created": 1468878065, "timestamp_updated": 1468878065, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455551475286483765", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24304743": {"recommendationid": "24304743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229247296", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1720, "last_played": 1468450157}, "language": "english", "review": "Deus Ex: Invisible War is a fun game, and it stays true to most of the things that made Deus Ex so incredible; however, it seems to be an overall downgrade. Here is a list of some of Deus Ex: Invisible War's major shortcomings compared to it's predecessor:\n-The loading times are much more severe\n-The levels are less open and feel more like a series of long hallways than an open map\n-Important statistics for various items and abilities that used to be displayed in the menus are no longer viewable, which harms the RPG aspect of the game significantly\n-The upgrade systems for weapons, biomods, and your character in general have been harshly simplified and minimalized so that they now lack many of what I considered to be essential aspects of the first Deus Ex\n-The game has a lot of bugs that make it difficult to play, whereas the first Deus Ex game was relatively glitch free\n-The game no longer features equipment (which, granted, felt relatively useless for most play-styles)\n-The notes and various acquired data is less detailed and less diverse; I frequently come across duplicate datapads and books, whereas every datapad and book in the original Deus Ex was unique\n-You can no longer assign custom keys for biomods or quick save/load, which is surprisingly tedious in the middle of combat when I have to hit \u201cfn + f6\u201d just to activate my enhanced speed mod, when I\u2019d much rather hit \u201cv\u201d like I could in the first Deus Ex game\n-Acquired data, passwords, and passcodes are no longer saved and viewable at any time. Additionally, passwords and passcodes are no longer managed by a player, and the player never has to enter or remember passwords or passcodes in the game. This especially bothers me, because having to manage passwords on your own made hacking feel more like actual hacking, like an achievement of the player. I\u2019d always find myself searching a room for clues as to what a password might be, which felt cool, but I never do that in Deus Ex Invisible War.\n-You get so much goddamn money within the first 5th of the game that it loses it\u2019s value. Every other mission or \u201cquest\u201d in the game gives you money, and your rarely use it.\n\nThere were some improvements, however. that Deus Ex: Invisible War made to the original game:\n-The stealth system is more complex and requires more strategy than the first Deus Ex\n-There were many new and interesting weapons and biomods, which give the player even more gameplay options, many of which were very fun to play around with\n-The game utilizes factions and loyalty systems to add a level of depth to the RPG experience\n-The graphics, obviously, are much better\n-The ragdoll physics are really cool, and they make moving bodies way more fun\n-The game allows you to play as a female, which is nice\n-The characters are slightly more developed, though completely static (as in the first game)\n-I imagine that for most people, it\u2019s actually very convenient not having to manage passcodes and passwords themselves\n-The narrative in Invisible War is a bit better and more central to the game. In the original Deus Ex, I remember the story being very rough, and the characters to flat to care about. The narrative isn\u2019t great in Invisible War, but it is an improvement.\n\nThat was, of course, just a brief list of changes made between Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War. Even that, however, is likely more information than necessary. In all honesty, there are only a few things to consider if you\u2019re thinking about buying this game: did you really enjoy the original Deus Ex? If the answer is yes, than you should buy this game. As a fan of the first Deus Ex, I thoroughly enjoyed Deus Ex: Invisible War. I would say that the original Deus Ex was better, but Invisible War is still a good sequel that does not betray the aspects that made the original so good.\n\nOveral Score = 6.3/10 (Good, but nothing special)\n", "timestamp_created": 1468450330, "timestamp_updated": 1468450330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544072985649108887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24263203": {"recommendationid": "24263203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016497743", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1468597639}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy Game !!!", "timestamp_created": 1468276460, "timestamp_updated": 1468276460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470168620347976685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24198976": {"recommendationid": "24198976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238709208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 214, "last_played": 1619498070}, "language": "english", "review": "Deus Ex: Invisible War is a bit dissapointing sequel of Deus Ex. yet it delivers a great graphic, combat and 3d model. the story is quite undercooked because i feel some parts of the story can be better and more meaningful but it succesfully delivers deep choices about humanity, conspiracies, conflict which makes the player think even more.\nthat being said, Deus Ex: Invisible Wars lacks of character developments expecially for Alex D. . the lack of Alex D's character developemnt makes the players fail to connect with Alex. i also always choose female Alex because i think she has deeper personality and is quite likeable but nevertheless Alex D doesn't really do something to really make the players invested to her character but some characters in Invisible War are really good, such as JC Denton and TracerTong and other characters who tells you about many things that is kept secret in the world, etc etc. even though i can clearly say IW's story fails short if it's compared with Deus Ex or Human Revolution.  \non the other hand, the gameplay and graphic significantly improved, it also has a very good atmposhere to each locations and it's really great to see the developer (Ion Storm) experimented with the HUD and other stuff. but there's one thing i can't forgive about this game is it has multiple .exe(s) which means that on Steam, you can't take screenshots via Steam Overlay because Steam is connected with the the main menu.exe where the in game is connected to in-game.exe , it's a mystery why Ion Storm set up this multiple .exe which causes other issues in the game which is if you travel to other location, you instantly are brought back to Steam and 1 second later you are back in the game, which is totally annoying.\nDeus Ex: Invisible War made me a little dissapointed but it also made me fresh to look at Deus Ex universe with a broader view.

The first Deus Ex was a work on art in every sense.  Now, I'm not saying that Invisible War had nothing to say.  It had numerous useful witicisms and social and political-economic comentary.  But it wasn't quite as refined as Deus Ex the first.  But, honestly, there's a lot in this game to enjoy.  The hacking gameplay is just a blast, as you vicariously mow down enemies with the robot or turret of your choice, though it certainly could have been more.  The graphics is acceptable for the time, if uninspired, and you have a lot of options with how to take your character in terms of both story and gameplay, though you top out way too early, and there's really not much mechanical reason to do everything there is to do other than the fun of doing it.  The character development isn't nearly as involved (or excellent) as the original either.  I mean, you get money, but you won't have much to spend it on.  The game is also pretty short and somewhat lacking in the challenge department, though it does have the admirable quality of awarding intelligent tactics.

I barely left the academy (first level) before I decided to not play this game again. As subjective as my opinion is, I cannot see any way of recommending people to put money into it; and I would be reluctant to even say 'go for it' if it was a free game out of fear I will create personal vendettas against me by wasting time.\n\nFrom the intro alone it has no Deus Ex feeling at all in my opinion; it looks less like a dystopian cyberpunk and more like a bad sci-fi that has none of the charm of the original Deus Ex, if you're pondering on trying the game because it has the name in the title, I recommend looking up the intro on youtube and ask yourself if it's still what you're hoping for.\n\nThe second thing I noticed was how utterly difficult it was for me to even get the game to run at all because of the outdated engine that is damn near incompatiable with anything that has multi-cores (which is to say every modern computer) that made it a pain requiring me to down a few hours in searching for a fix online in various forums; which is already a major nono for anything that gets put on steam, if it's on a platform like Steam asking for money to play it, it should at the very least work by default.\nIf anyone is interested, I'll leave the link that finally made the game run for everyone's convenience: http://yoni0505.blogspot.se/2012/08/deus-ex-invisible-war-windows-7-fix.html\n\nWith the game finally running and having recently finished the original Deus Ex (Revision), I was eager to try the game for myself and see the continuation of the previous game and what effects the events of it would have on the world of the sequel. I knew it was widely hated, but somehow the arguments never quite ran. Small levels and clunky UI sounded like something you could overcome if you were interested in the story, and I really wanted to explore Chicago and Seattle of the future. \nSo the first thing I do is to set the keymapping to be more akin to the original Deus Ex's controls as much as possible for my own comfort and fixing the mouse sensitivity to be lower. Then I start the game.\n\nFirst I get that intro cutscene and realize that exploring Chicago is not really on the agenda here. Maybe I should've read into it more, but I guess it just gets destroyed in the cutscene and welcome to Seattle. Okay, fair enough I think.\nThen there is Seattle where I try to immerse myself and get comfortable with the controls before I get earthquakes shoved in my face; no time to rest there. When I get into my first conversation I experience a rarity for me: graphics cringe. I'm not one to typically care about graphics; I like the old styles such as the original ones over things like Crysis even, but fuck me they couldn't have made a poorer job with these. This is without mentioning how lackluster and horribly paced the conversations are.\n\nGo to a let's play and check just the first conversation with Billie to determine it for yourself. If it becomes unbearable, save your money to something more productive. Maybe there's a hobo nearby who could use a cup of coffee for the dollar or whatever that Steam wants for the game.\n\nAnyway the next thing I notice is that the criticisms of small levels well, the fans were not exaggerating; imagine UNATCO HQ in the original game from the moment you step into the upper level where Manderley and your office etc is. Know how there is a lower level too? In IW, that lower level would be behind a loading screen; and the upper level doesn't contain the eye scanner or anything of the sort either. That should give an idea of how small the maps are, and I'm even unsure if that's an exaggeration.\n\nWhat kills it for me though is how a game riddled more loading screens than semen in an elephant's cum seem to have an unhealthy obsession with resetting everything upon a new loading screen; it's like the game restarts itself before the loading screen itself appears, and when it's done loading all the key mappings are reset and all the items- including weapons -are gone. This world of item-vaporizing elevators/doorways becomes especially bothersome if you wanna cap some heads, because good luck getting anything done in terms of combat if you don't have any weapons on you; and weapons aren't in a habit of just laying around everywhere either.\nAt the final bit of the Seattle Tarsus Academy I just gave up and casually ran past everyone in full view, not even caring about getting shot twice or thrice (which took less than half my hp) and just kept going to see if I could at least get value out of seeing Upper Seattle. Some story blocks along the way I didn't care about later and I realized.. Pretty much no. \n\nThe environment is stale and uninspired and conversations don't get anymore interesting from the three or so places in the level that had people. You get more character interaction and personality from a Choice of Games than what I got in Upper Seattle. And that's where I finally lost my last interest and justification for having spent any money on this even at a sale. The only thing I got from that money spent is buyer's remorse; but hey, at least the buyer's remorse is consistent unlike the fucking keymapping in IW.\n\n=TL;DR=\nI only played so much, but if you are interested in seeing this game then I would say don't waste your money on it; look up a let's play of someone else who wasted money on it instead and save yourself the effort. If it still looks appealing after an episode or two of said let's play; only then should it ever be considered.\n\n*Poor environments.\n*Poor voice acting and conversation pacing.\n*Poor graphics and character models.\n*No cyberpunk or Deus Ex feeling.\n*Difficult to run on a modern system and requires a lot of system fuckery to at all get started.\n\nThat's my experience after less than an hour with no real expectation going for it coming in; I should've listened.", "timestamp_created": 1462126086, "timestamp_updated": 1462126086, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22727155": {"recommendationid": "22727155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093086747", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1568144742}, "language": "english", "review": "I finished a playthrough of this recently and I'm happy I can uninstall it again. \n\nThe story is kinda ok and kinda lame but it's just terribly told.

that this is the last true deus ex game from the true devs ( i highly recommend you to play the first DE to understand what is happening in this one) .\n-starting with the plot ( a short and slow but non lineaire plot) , it takes off 20 years after the events of the first game you can play as a male or female clone of JC Danton you got multiple quests ( mains and side quests) from different factors that affect the progression of the main plot ( 4 different ending ) i find it a bit short compared to the first deus ex game 15h compared to 35h ( it feels kinda rushed) .\n-graphicly it's not that bad of course it did not age well but you can find an HD texture pack that makes the game looks a bit better and some tweaks to make it run at widescreen resolution .\n-perfect voice acting ( + the different accents i love that in a game ), sound effects are also great , music is excellent just like in deus ex 1.\n-gameplay didnt change a lot from the first game, changing plot + multiple quests , but what they changed is the inventory and the augmentation, the inventory is limited to 10 slots ( doesnt matter the size of the thing ) and you can only get 5 augmentations so you have to choose wisely ( depends on your style ) people will hate it like i did in the beginning but i think it was a good chose what they did (you play as a low quality-like clone of JC so its normal to get limitation in power)\n-there is flaws and crashes (took almost 10 years to correct them by the community) so you just have to go to google or the steam community and you will find the fixed.\n-no achievements or cards and no steam chat during gameplay .\n-worth the price but you can get it for like 1.5$ on sales.\ni recommend this one for those who like slow and non lineaire intriguing

This is no exception to that.\n\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, I'm going to do something a little different than what other reviewers do and repeat what I did with the Duke Nukem Forever review. Instead of pointing out the postivies and negatives, I'm going to say that my opinion is more valid than yours and that most of the negatives I see are either non existent or actually positives.\n\n1. The combat is clunky.\nI don't understand this complaint. I played it on the XBox and it was terrible on that system, yeah. But on the PC? It really isn't that terrible and it's more than managable. I think maybe the reason for this is people were playing this like they played the original Deus Ex. In the first game when you first started you sucked with every single ranged weapon ever and had to aim your gun for like 30 minutes before you could actually hit somebody. What I assume is happening is people are doing that in this game, and you really don't need to do that because you actually know how to use a firearm. I'd actually go as far as saying that makes the combat in this game better than in the first game. For some reason, in Deus Ex a highly trained cybernetic special forces operative has no idea how to use a basic handgun.\n\n2. It was dumbed down for consoles.\nWell, yes and no. First off, the original Deus Ex engine was basically a bunch of PVC pipes and calculators glued together. It was very simple and didn't eat up a lot of hardware so you could put a crapload of shit in the game and not worry about running out of space on the install disk along with not worrying about overworking the system memory. This game uses a (for the time) modern next gen engine with (for the time) amazing graphics and effects and stuff, not to mention a (for the time) decent physics engine as well. The short length and small size of levels allowed this to be put on XBox, yeah, but it also made it so we wouldn't have to use like 20 discs on PC. Sure, it would have been cool for the game to be the size of the original and use 20 discs, but come on.\n\n3. The story is dumb.\nI agree to some extent. The game is short, and since it's a Deus Ex game there's a plot twist like every 10 minutes so I can't really say much without spoiling like 35% of the story. Basically, at one point in the game you get two huge plot twists at the same exact time, and both of them got completely different reactions from me. The first one I saw coming from a mile away and was so obvious I could have sworn was already mentioned like two hours earlier or something. The second one I didn't see coming from a mile away but felt like a total idiot because I didn't in that it was completely logical. Sudden plot twists, especially of this caliber, are rarely done in such a way that it seems like the perfect conclusion to every single event that preceded. While elements of the story are really, REALLY stupid, for the most part it's very well written and worth your time.\n\n4. Too many RPG elements were removed/Character progression is gimped too much.\nI disagree here in that I like to play both of these games when I have completely different mindsets. If I want to play System Shock 1 or 2 but without horror elements I'll play the original Deus Ex, and if I want to play Bioshock 1 or 2 without the horror elements I'll play this. In my opinion, just because a sequel is different, doesn't mean it's bad.\n\n5. There's no multiplayer.\nYes. This is a complaint I've seen people actually make. The original Deus Ex actually had deathmatch multiplayer for some really stupid reason that nobody but total nerds actually played. My guess is this was just one more feature they could complain about being removed from the game so they'd have another bullet to put in IW's skull.\n\nOverall, I give this game 8 out of 10, Deus Ex 9 out of 10 and Deus Ex: HR 8.5 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1459984807, "timestamp_updated": 1459984807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483149707317352295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22260152": {"recommendationid": "22260152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164290963", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2158, "last_played": 1512091464}, "language": "english", "review": "I gave Deus Ex: Invisible War a negative review over a year ago.

Throughtout the game, there are various factions that you must work either with or against often times with competing goals for the same objective. Weapons share a universal ammo and can be customized with up to two upgrades. This will make you want to carry a variety of weapons and upgrade combinations for certain situations.... until the last quarter of the game but more on that later.\n\nIt takes place some time after the first deus ex and the graphics haven't aged too terribly over the years. The story isn't quite as good as the first one but then again, not many stories can compete with such a high bar. It doesn't have quite the same dark grittiness of the original in presentation to the point where when your character makes a threat it almost comes off as comical. \n\nThe gun play and physics are much improved from the first one but its still an early 2000s game so there will be shenanigans here and there but its shouldn't be anything too gamebreaking or distracting. What will be distracting and must be learned to be embraced is that everytime you enter a new zone or a previous zone or a sub zone within a zone, there will be a loading screen that in my experience actually takes you out of the game and shows a poorly res'd version of your steam launcher until it comes back on. Luckily these screens don't take long (atleast on my device) and after a while they're not as jarring. \n\nNow, for the one major con in this game. The gun play is fairly balanced for the most part until the end when one of the factions starts using troops with what is essentially power armor. The power armor has a weak spot but it isn't a critical weak spot so even if you hit them in it with a damage enhanced sniper rifle (which easily wipes the floor with any other kind of opposition except for robots) it will only hurt them alittle bit and then they pursue you and never show you their back again. The solution to this is simple albeit really damaging to the fun of the fps aspect of the game. \n\nYou get a rocket launcher, you attach an ammo saving augment to it and thats all you use for the rest of the game. They usualy use rocket launchers as well so having the gun play devolve into rocket launcher duels is very very disappointing. Don't get me wrong, you can use other guns at that point but the amount of ammo it takes to take out just one of them with a conventional firearm is completely ridiculous let alone when there's multiple of them (which there will be).\n\nAll of that taken into consideration, I think its worth a couple playthroughs taking different paths each time to get a feel for the entire package it has to offer.

I'd read countless reviews of how this game was a disappointment, tried to familiarize myself with its flaws without spoiling the story for myself, and made my decision: I would buy it when it went on crazy sale. $1.40 was sale enough for me. I don't regret the purchase, but I don't recommend the game, and the reasons are manifold.\n\nFirst, ignore any review that says \"if this game weren't a Deus Ex game, it would be regarded better\". No. Even ignoring the Deus Ex aspects, what you're left with is a piss poor shooter with a trashy story, ass-ugly character models, glitchy gameplay, and poor mechanics choices. \n\nThis game is both figuratively and literally a narrow hallway. Half of the time, you're dropped into an area that has little to no hiding spaces and relatively few alternate paths. What few areas do have alternate paths to your objective are circular and do a poor job of telegraphing that you're going backwards. The area maps are practically microscopic, and you're hard pressed to go even three minutes of normal gameplay without having to load up a new area. This makes exploring a chore, so after the first hour of gameplay I gave up and decided I would just plow through the story and get it over with. Also, just by the way, there's a glitch where the game crashes to the desktop or hangs on a black screen during every loading screen, and upon reaching the final area, it has crashed for me five times with no possible fix in sight. Just a heads up if you really want to try to see this through.\n\nSo, let's talk about the story. Where Deus Ex was a political commentary through the eyes of a conspiracy theorist, Deus Ex: Invisible War is a sociopolitical commentary through the eyes of a gender studies major, and if I let my inner conspiracy theorist come forward, I might just have to say that this is one of the first games ruined by the thoughtless inclusion of female main characters for the sake of having more \"gender diversity\". Default avatar gender? Female. The Order? Female dominated. WTO? Majority female. \n\nBorderline genocidal maniacs/nazi looking motherfucker templars? Male leader, almost completely male dominated organization.  All of that aside:\n\nYou're cast into the world of Deus Ex: Invisible War by being treated to an uncanny valley cutscene the likes of which only 2003 CGI can produce. A faceless terrorist unleashes grey goo on Chicago and later you're told it was fire. That's all well and good though, because Chicago isn't important, you're in Seattle, in what is essentially a high school anime gone wrong. With no warning or buildup, the Tarsus academy is under attack by \"the Order\", a group of religious zealots who think jihad is the way to go. You can follow orders from these maniacs later, while their second in command tries to convince you that they are indeed a religion of peace by explicitly asking you to murder their targets. Conversely, you can do the bidding of the World Trade Organization, who sits comfortably at the other end of the spectrum at what seems to be Lawful Neutral at worst. Following orders from them doesn't always feel right, but it doesn't make you feel like a sociopath.\n\nIt takes hours of gameplay to be drawn in even the smallest bit, and the writing never really recovers. Even the endings feel halfassed, though if you stew on them for long enough, they're just thought provoking enough to be worthy of discussion if you're bored.\n\nOverall, this game is bad. Not because it's an unworthy successor to much better game, but because it barely stands up as a game. It is nothing more than a seven hour long walking simulator with guns added here and there for flavor.", "timestamp_created": 1456458922, "timestamp_updated": 1456458931, "voted_up": false,

depending on the choices you make, you can change the style of the narrative or the relationship of certain NPC's toward the protagonist.\n- Is set on a Semi-Open World structure ala Wolfenstein

primary and secondary objectives to meet \n- Like the first part, there are multiple ways to meet the goals, reach a destination, get an item, etc.\n- Augmentations obtained and improved can be

are limited exclusively to augmentations (As long as you have the item that allows you to install or upgrade these).\n- Each weapon only accept two modifications (From a total of eight options).\n- Control over jumps is sometimes a bit disastrous.\n- Many times, the use of physics in certain situations, is erratic and not let the situation settle directly or at the first attempt (Which can be a bit frustrating ).\n- The Quick-Load is not so \"Quick\".\n- The campaign lasts half the first Deus Ex (We are talking about a campaign of approximately 30 hours, although this is much more than the

by itself, it's decidedly so in comparison to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/6910]original Deus Ex[/url]. I really, [i]really[/i] wish Steam reviews had a 'mixed' option, because I can't recommend IW over those two games except for series completionists or dedicated genre fans.\n\nSeriously, I had to try [i]twice[/i] to beat this game. I lost motivation on my first attempt because of how aggressively blah it gets.\n\n\nI'm not one to complain much about games being \"dumbed down\", and the original Deus Ex wasn't exactly an ergonomic masterpiece, but Invisible War was designed for the original Xbox in mind. That means they cut out and/or simplified a lot of what made the original game distinctive: skills, aug slots, lockpicks, hacking, keycodes & damage models. Without this stuff, Invisible War essentially becomes a subpar FPS with RPG elements tacked on the side. Small, weirdly-designed maps (albeit with some nonlinearity and interesting ideas here and there) and a smaller, awkward inventory - with no dragging - don't do it any favors either. That's not mentioning the bugs, general instability or handicapped AI.\n\nThe unified ammo system is nice in theory, but in practice it becomes annoying. You can only carry up to around 9 or so clips, and ammo is [i]rather[/i] scarce for players who use a number of weapons regularly. If you chew through most of them with one weapon, you might not have enough for another weapon when you need it. That said, it makes ammo and stealth that much more valuable and worth hunting for/investing in, so that's something.\n\nCombat controls themselves are smooth and simplified compared to DX's, but mouse movement is floaty, and it's never quite as satisfying thanks to the engine making fights janky as hell.\n\nOn that note, just like the core gameplay systems, the controls are simpler than the original...and yet somehow more clunky to use, mainly because of the fact that it was designed for use with an Xbox controller: again, no clicking and dragging are allowed. I missed leaning and I especially missed conversation transcriptions - it's difficult enough following the plot here without being distracted when someone contacts you over your infolink.\n\nThere are a few positives. Ragdoll physics may be dull sometimes, but when they're not, they're hilariously broken. Ladder climbing is improved, somehow. Automatic pull-ups over ledges are nice too, and the robot control augmentation is splendid to use.\n\nI'm on the fence about the fact that you can choose any aug from any canister, but that there are also two separate types of canisters. For what it's worth, it's possible to have both cloaking AND thermal masking, albeit at the cost of hacking abilities. Even if I liked being able to simply waltz past enemies and always have the initiative in my playthrough, I think there was a reason that both of those augs were mutually exclusive in the original game.\n\n\nBeyond core gameplay, the rest of the game doesn't fare very well.\n\nIt's pretty weird and 'convenient' that clubs and mosques and other such places have 'codes' that can disable ALL your weapons, even the blunt clubs. It's a rather clumsy implementation of plot-mandated invincibility - you can kill anyone anywhere in this game, so the devs turned off weapons in certain public places to keep players from destroying the plot.\n\nGraphics are plasticine and blockier than the original, and the original was on the blocky side already. I'd say Invisible War's looks have actually aged [i]more[/i]. Not good for the game's verisimillitude.\n\nBy far the worst part however is the fact that the game literally shuts down and relaunches itself [b]every time you load a new level[/b], supposedly to cut down on long-term runtime errors in the engine. It breaks the game's Steamworks functionality and it's just dumb as hell considering how small the levels are to begin with & how long the loading times are. I found myself deciding what to do based partially on the number of loading screens between me and my potential destinations.\n\n\nInvisible War has less bombast than the original Deus Ex. While I [i]guess[/i] it's a nice change of pace, I can't help but feel that's a liability for a game that also focuses on globetrotting power conspiracies, just like the original.\n\nCase in point: the voice acting is pretty damn bland. Gone is the memorable, if cheesy, voicework from the first game. I still kind of like Alex's voice, though - that character's actors seem to have found a comfortable spot to let the character grow his (or her) own snarky, deadpan personality, distinct from yet similar to JC Denton's. Being able to pick a male or female character is also a nice reminder of a time before hypermasculinity took over mainstream videogames for a decade. The dynamic music that changes by location in the same level is a good touch; it's not as distinct or awesome as DX's, but good nonetheless.\n\nI have a couple things to say about the story itself, since it's a pretty important element of any Deus Ex title, which means [b]spoilers for this game as well as the original.[/b] If you want further analysis without spoilers, you could try watching [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59PzmOLSf00]this Errant Signal video[/url].\n\nI do like how the factions this time around seem to be the most morally ambiguous of any in the series - except the Templar, who are pretty much cartoon evil. The actual writing might not be very good - the amount of typos and inaccurate subtitles are also surprising for a game supposedly this prominent - but it's not a complete wreck. The subjects it deals with are still rather unique in the world of games.\n\nBy the mid-game, however, the writers start trotting out characters, plot points and eventually locations from the original presumably for the purpose of keeping players going. At no point are you given any choices or quandaries to rival the original game. JC is essentially retconned into the Helios-merged being from one of the three endings in the original, which might not go over well for those who were really invested in making him their own character in that game.\n\nThere's one bright spot: the NG Resonance side story. I don't like her music, but her subplot has some of the most interesting writing in the game. All I'll say is that this game predates the Snowden leaks by a decade.\n\n\nOh yeah, [i]all three[/i] original Deus Ex endings are canon here. It feels like a cop-out.\n\nInvisible War has four different endings - including a 'renegade' option where you kill everyone, which you couldn't do in the original. Of course, these endings aren't really on par with DX's, considering that the outcomes of each ending aren't quite what you'd logically expect from each. The renegade ending has the Omar inheriting the planet after baseline humanity blows itself to pieces in revanchist warfare...despite the very [i]idea[/i] of nation-states supposedly being weaker than ever.\n\nThe neo-Helios ending I chose in my playthrough was kind of interesting, if only because it's apparently the [i]least bad[/i] ending, and even that one entailed forced evolution and sacrifice for all of humanity. Not exactly a good sign.\n\nThe worst part, though, is how anti-climactic the end really is. For three out of four endings, you make your way to a poorly-rendered recreation of an iconic area from the first game and literally just use a computer to select which ending you want. Compare that to Deus Ex's sprawling end-game compound, where each ending entailed committing to multiple different objectives. That's not to mention how poorly the real nature of the various factions is handled, especially the early-game ones. Pretty mediocre, really, which is how you could describe the game as a whole too.", "timestamp_created": 1455321574, "timestamp_updated": 1563144874, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73369210958480835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21035751": {"recommendationid": "21035751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199776042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 131, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1454860776}, "language": "english", "review": "Changes my resolution when i try to load a save", "timestamp_created": 1454876957, "timestamp_updated": 1454876981, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46777266263961792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21013793": {"recommendationid": "21013793", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999438801", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 835, "last_played": 1469305934}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is far from bad. \n\nI got carried away by the negative reception, and just pospone my playthough of this game, and even to the point that it affect my first impressions, I couldn\u00b4t stand this game at first. \n\nwith that out of the way, I\u00b4ll start with the bad, and the things that most people are right, this game is a technical mess, it will crash, the game takes you to desktop just to load the next area, and the level are just too small.\n\nIt really feels claustrophobic, it still have the same freedom of choice and consequences as the original Deus Ex have, but it really feels so small, in my opinion, compare to the big buildings and places of the original, also I dind\u00b4t like the simplification of the RPG mechanics and shooting, yes now where you point the gun shoot, but that doesn\u00b4t mean the gunplay is better (personally I like the way the first did it, it make you actually think ahead, instead as just go all guns blazing, as I did a lot here). \n\nAs for the RPG mechanics, there almost non, they just kept the biomod upgrade system and they dumb it down, like real bad, it have a few good Ideas that make you prioritize your character but compered to the original, I dind\u00b4t feel like a badass cyborg this time, only a cyborg. \n\nSo, why I recommend this game them? \n\nStill Deus Ex, Still fun, the story is really good and still the same cyberpunk conspiracy cyborg simulator that I love the first time, I this game make me crack out of laughter and make me high five myself more than onces by doing awesome deeds, and still a Role Playing game at hearth, you really play what you build... on my first run I build a Hacker, and no terminal was beyond my reach, and on the next playthourgh I was a cyborg assasin that was a ghost until it got to kill what it got to kill. \n\nAnd for the story, if there\u00b4s a reason to play this game, after the original is the way the game expand on the idiologies of the first game, I would say the way the game make take a choice It will feel overwhelming at first, but at the same time, that\u00b4s how your character have to feel. Also the game make use of returning character like I haven\u00b4t seen, it really feel like a justify sequel and it really expand of the deus Mythos, the endings tend to go in the absolute route, but at the same time, I though the same about the endings of the first deus ex, and some how the manage to make all three endings canon to this story. \n\nI haven\u00b4t played yet Human Revolution, but so far Deus Ex: The Fall is the worst game in the franchise, this one just blows it out of the water, and so far this is becoming my favorite videogame franchise of all time. \n", "timestamp_created": 1454812183, "timestamp_updated": 1454812183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525114178657531738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20950204": {"recommendationid": "20950204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117915037", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1015, "last_played": 1454550757}, "language": "english", "review": "I propose a new tag line: \"It really isn't that bad\". I avoided Invisible War for quite some time because the fan reception has been absolutely crushing. But since I found this on sale for a little over a dollar, I decided to give it a try and form my own opinion. And guess what? It's really not that bad. Sure, it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original, and I understand if the fans found the initial release in 2003 disappointing, but on its own it's actually a pretty good game.\n\nFor example, the levels themselves might be small, but even then it has a good amount of player freedom to progress however you wish. Violence, stealth, hacking, etcetera. In a way, it reminds me of Human Revolution (albeit in a lesser form). It had smaller levels compared to the original as well (though HR's levels are bigger and more complex than IW's), but it was dense enough to allow multiple ways through with different builds. Even better than both DX1 and HR was the different factions you could side with or do missions for. In the first half this gives it an extra dynamic of player freedom. Doing missions for one faction usually means not being able to complete a mission for the other groups. As a result, it adds a nice touch of choice and consequences, both in the main story and side quests you can complete.\n\nBut there are some issues with it. Most of them you probably already know if you're familiar with the fan reception. First of all, the levels are very tiny in comparison. Most likely due to the Xbox hardware. And because of the tiny levels, you're very frequently being bothered by loading screens. It's not the actual loading times that are the problem, but the amount of times you're looking at a loading screen to enter or leave areas. Also, I didn't find the augmentations (\"bio mods\") to be very interesting in this game. The Neural Interface is the only crucial one if you want to hack stuff, everything else is very basic. Also, there are some smaller things they've changed, some for the worse. Stuff like universal ammo, no attribute skills (not necessarily a bad thing since DX:HR doesn't have it either and that turned out to be an amazing game), less fleshed out in-game lore, and so on.\n\nIn short, Invisible War's biggest flaw is the lack of ambition. The very same ambition that made the original so loved.\n\nSo. Do I recommend it? Depends on several aspects. Do you already own DX1 and Human Revolution? If not, those two are vastly superior in all regards, so you might want to spend your money on that instead. But if you already own both, then yes, I do recommend you playing through Invisible War at least once.

Colours are great as well in the livelier areas, i also love the way the shadows are \"Painted\" to the environment, i kind of miss old Dynamic lighting. \n\nJust like the First Game you'll decide who to side with and choose what you say with certain important characters and side one's as well, you can threaten people, you can bug out and return and make game changing choices, you have a good amount of freedom and choices you'll make can alter your allegiance with your chosen faction negatively, neutrally or positively, an Example of this is in Cairo you have an option of breaking into an illegal food farm to find out where Dr Nassif is and find out more about her, you have the option of breaking in to find information and boost your allegiance with the WTO, however you can go the next level and destroy the Farmhouse which will boost your Allegiance with the WTO positively however very negatively effect your allegiance with The Order. \n\nStory is pretty good, you find out more about Alex him/herself, what happened to The Denton's, How the Illumanati effect the world and you are the one to decide how the world will end up, It can come under total Illumaniti control, you can cause anyone who use Biomods (The Replacement to Augmentation canisters) to be practically offed, Or you can cause another Great Collapse and practically turn the World into Fallout. The Endings are all great and are satisfying enough. \n\nGameplay is similar to the First Game, you'll often scout the area stealthily, hack terminals if you have the Hack Biomod, Talk to characters or take them out from afar/close, the biggest differences however is that the game has pinpoint accuracy, no more skills to upgrade and Biomods are replaced with Augmentations. While its very odd that you aim at your enemies heads and will practically have almost no spread which can make combat very easy it is still a good change and there's something satisfying about mowing down your enemies like a Badass. \n\nThe Removal of the Skill system however is really frustrating, In Deus Ex 1 you would have a simple goal, go from Point A to Point B however possible, it was up to you to find different ways to do so or free roam first before you go to your objective, this would often reward you with ammo, weapons, items and even skill points, sometimes even an Augmentation Canister which was always exciting and a real \"Awww yeah!\" moment. In Invisible War however you just get rewarded with Items and mabye a different way through. \n\nBiomods are a replacement for Augmentations and are kind of similar, you choose a body part which have their own respective Bimods (Around 3, 1 is reserved for Black Market Biomods), for example for your Feet you can install a Speed Booster to move faster and jump higher/further, or if you prefer stealthy approaches you could install a Biomod to make your footsteps quieter, you can level Biomods up to Level 3. Black Market Biomods are very rarely found when exploring the Environment but are often purchased from Omar Traders which are cyborg creepy robot like characters who sell items, Aside from having a RED Colour Black Market Biomods don't have any significant differences, They don't effect your character's appearance or whatever which is a bit of a shame. The Biomods in general all cater to a particular playstyle and are all generally well balanced and fortunately if you wanted to change your playstyle you could as LONG as you had Biomod canisters.\n\nEnemy A.I is both stupid and slightly smart, they hear any loud noises and they will patrol to find whatever caused the noise and alert other enemies, annoyingly however they stand still when they spot you, making them an easy headshot, the only exception is if you retreat which will cause them to slowly chase after you, still you are required to make a Lethal or Non Lethal approach in all situations. \n\nYou have a good variety of weapons to use as well and you can get weapon mods just like the first game, they aren't visible on your weapon sadly but its fun to equip your favourite weapon with Modifications to make them better for your playstyle or to better their faults, oddly however ammo is universal, a Pistol uses the same ammo as a Rocket Launcher for E.G, this was obviously done due to this game having a Port for the Xbox FIRST which is fair enough but for PC it a very strange design choice and its baffling. \n\nNow onto the bigger issues this game has; as it was originally developed for the Original Xbox we had to deal with that in a PC Port, its very obvious if you play Deus Ex 1 and then this you'll see what i mean, Environments are smaller, loading times are quite frequent and if you have a bad PC it'll take easily 30 seconds everytime you are entering a different area, Now as most people nowadays usually have a good or amazing PC this issue isn't that bad but back in the day you'd be waiting quite often.\n\nThe List of places you visit are also small as well, You'll travel to Seattle, Cairo, Trier Germany and more, also you'll return to several of these locations twice or mabye three times with not much else to them. \n\nHowever probably the coolest thing about this game is that it has Ragdoll Physics, and they are very entertaining, and due to the Ragdolls being very flexible and often times glitchy you can have real fun throwing bodies into dumpsters, behind corners and over railings, getting the Strength biomod at level 3 is pure fun as you peg bodies halfway across the map and see how much you can get them stuck and glitched (I once had a Female Body be bent backwards, her arms were stuck in an L position and her neck was also stretched and backwards, Yikes.) \n\nDespite being ported from the Xbox, Having odd design choices and no skill system i still enjoyed Deus Ex Invisible War, it was my First Deus Ex game and i loved it, i much prefer the vastly superior Deus Ex however but Invisible War is not that bad, it doesn't deserve its harsh criticism that it still gets, its an Underrated game and i'd recommend it for fans of the series easily, for RPG Fans i'd still recommend it however don't expect a futuristic Elder Scrolls or whatever.", "timestamp_created": 1453208691, "timestamp_updated": 1550294909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685231268405914307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "20584601": {"recommendationid": "20584601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056427562", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1453334278}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this game is really great if you play it on the consoles it was clearly designed for or an ancient pc, however if you run a modern system the game probably won't work.

Character customization is much more limited, the solutions to problems are all much simpler, and the storyline is just... sorry.  Ninety percent of the game consists of making choices that have zero effect on the endgame, despite feeling important at the time.

They wanted more Deus Ex, and this failed to deliver.\n\nThat said, this was the first Deus Ex game I ever played, and it was good enough to make me want to play the others.  It's a fun game, with fun gameplay and intriguing mechanics.  If I had played the other Deus Ex games first and played this one after, yes, I would have been disappointed.

You'll get the Deus Ex experience, but nowhere near the level of Deus Ex 1 or Human Revolution.  \n\nIt is worth playing, even as a Deus Ex game.  The plot is passable, as are the NPCs.  There is a \"true pacifist\" route to be taken if you desire, and there are some fun easter egg references to the first game buried in here.

I will play the 3rd one for the 5th time again soon. I had never played Invisible war before now, as i have with the 1st and 3rd games. I was looking for a \"segway\" to the 3rd game with the ending of this game and found myself unusure if I did or not. the choice wasnt obvious to me, but I think that if Human Revolution is infact in the same universe as Deus Ex and Invisible war, there is only one choice. The 3rd choice i made. I have seen 4/4 endings as far as I can tell. It is a good game for its own merits, with a few bugs. These may have been fixed thru mods, but i didnt install any, with the exception of the high res texture pack. Game is beautiful in 720, but it flashes to desktop to flash to a loading screen before continueing on to a new section or area. TERRIBLE. it is beyond annoying. This game also seems to take a long time to load. especially on my pc. I found that to be really weird. I still put up with it and continued on. I would say it is the weakest of the 4 games currently available, with some of the biomods being unavailable because you have installed others. its similar to the options in the other games, but far more restrictive. I was maxed out in all the ones i chose by the half way point though, and i played it on hard... which was easy enough. I made all the choices i wanted to throughout and it didnt really affect the choices at the last stage. ((save before \"uploading @ UNATCO if you want to see them all)) Can they ? maybe... im sure one or 2 can. I probably wont play this title again, but I will reccommend you buy it for $5 or less.

The stealth system was only helped by haveing at least 4 ways to do most levels / zones / whatever you want to call them with only the method of getting to the next being 2 choices each with advanages and disadvanages of their own.\n\nStory line is better than alot of newer games besides its sequal of course with it even includeing references to the previous game without breaking the plot line if you do not get them. The story line is of course a consipacy that is true like all of them are in this game series. The plot is told through the infolink thing though not explained how that works in the game play to which i wish they did as they did in all the other games in the series.\n\nGraphics well for a game made in 2004 they were good for 2004 but compared to modern day graphics or even the watered down ones in Dues Ex: The fall they are not that good about a 5/10 for the graphics when compared to modern day standards mainly due to probably not enough room on the disk back then and lack of the GPUs back then being able to do as much as now. With that said good for 2004 not so much for 2015.\n\nBugs and Gliches now .... on windows 2000 and XP it runs fine without any help, vista  and 7 you have to turn off themes to get it to run like that but in 8 and 8.1 the bugs / gliches are as follows: \n     first major one is with saveing you are allowed 2 saves not including the auto save of course before it makes you delete them both to save again the work around that i found is just to save over the last save which isnt that good if you are letting another person play or wanting to play it in 2 differnet ways at once thus needing 2 diffenret saves  \n      second major bug loading is a black screen then minimizes it then a white screen then the loading screen whenever changing areas and you do this alot when finishing up an area \n     third major bug failure of it to auto save when it should which is every time you go through a loading screen to another area\n     fourth major bug random crashing at random times ussualy at a loading screen it will just crash for no reason that i can see also crashing when you try to skip dialog to fast  \n     first minor bug it doesn't always remember to drain your bio energy for the default light bio-modifcation so it might or might not drain the bio energy at random times \n     second minor bug enemies some times stop being effected or are not effected when variable to the bolt caster weapon \n     third minor bug non biomodified human enemies some times being able to see you when you are using the cloak bio modification some times not some times so\n\nover all conclution of the game now. i think it is a good game wish it did not have so many issues on my system but the gameplay is good better than alot of games that i played recently too and the plot is excellent just the bugs i would not pay the $40 i paid for it back in 2004 for the console edition again as it is able to be gotten used to as the loading screens ussualy are not close to one another but when they are it is annoying with the bugs that might or might not happen also saveing whenever you think it is a good time to or just have a notion that you should save you save then as it might crash .... it is with the $6.99 it is now on steam and i urge you to get the collection of Deus Ex games too to make it cheaper and to understand the plot line more but this one has issues with windows 8.1 Pro anyways so the issues ruined its game play a few times for me\n\ni will recommened this to all my freinds as it is a good game just it has issues with the newer OSes is all and that is not good if you are reading this once you upgraded to windows 10 as they most likely are there too.", "timestamp_created": 1433683575, "timestamp_updated": 1433683575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16229396": {"recommendationid": "16229396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035400035", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1428243364}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are weird.

The story starts off with Alex, an Orphan, raised by a couple in Chicago and put into a special schoolfor gifted children, where she eventually found her way into the Taurus program, a human augmentation program. You start off being attacked by religious fanatics and are given both sides point of view, with each side trying to persuade you the other is the real threat. Interesting story, I like the concept and it had be playing for over an hour, when I only intended a short demo for the review. It appears to further the Deus Ex Canon, and while it has all the wonderful potential of a Deus Ex game, I will warn you now there are bugs.\n\nFirst of all, every time the game wants to load a new area, It jumps back to your desktop for a a few seconds and the resolution change makes your desktop appear to be supersized. It does this a lot. The graphics are not quite up to par for a sequel to Deus Ex, but it is passable. The game almost has a feel as though it were rushed or poorly ported from a handheld or console. I think it would be a prime candidate for a reboot, as it was interesting.

I assumed that it would at least be \"pretty ok\", and that its poor ratings were due to people comparing it to the first game. Holy cow, was I wrong.\n\nThis game is atrociously bad, and not just compared to its older brother. It's genuinely a waste of time and money completely by itself. In short: Had I known how frustratingly bad Invisible War was, I wouldn't even have picked it up for free.\n\nSome of the bad parts (no real spoilers):\n\n- The writing. While the story builds on Deus Ex, you get no build-up, no twists (excepting a few incredibly obvious attempts), no suspense, no room for wondering or doubting. You're never allowed to be curious about the world, the backstory or the events of the past, as most of this is just dumped bluntly at your feet. At one point you walk into a bunker, find some high-level people, and out of nowhere these complete strangers start telling you about their deepest, darkest secrets.\n\n- The pacing. At times, people will warn you that \"someone has a secret agenda for you\", and you can be certain that within two minutes that same \"someone\" will give you a call to explain their agenda for you, right to your face.\n\n- The level design. Pretty much every single level is a tiny, cramped area. For reference, the 'ton Hotel in Deus Ex is one of the smaller levels in that game, but it would easily fit in as one of the larger levels in Invisible War. This means you'll enjoy a lot more loading screens a lot more often, but it also makes the game feel so much more shallow: When security HQ is 15 meters from the doorstep of the terrorists, suspension of disbelief drops like a rock. It also means walking through four levels blasting bad guys, then walking back through four empty levels.\n\n- The loading screens. Loading time is usually not an issue for me, with a fast SSD in a fast PC. Invisible War doesn't care. Every so often it goes through a complicated series of steps to load a new level, which includes shutting down the rendering engine to flash you your desktop for a few seconds, then going all white for a while as it restarts, and then it starts actually loading, which takes another 10-15 seconds.\n\n- The number of loading screens. In one typical part of the game, you go through a door - loading screen - across a square - loading screen - across a room to talk to someone, then back out - loading screen - around a corner and down a street - loading screen - down some stairs, talk to a guy, and then retrace the whole route with all the loading screens all over again. Steam tells me I've had the game running some 12 hours, but my save game clock tells me I have 7,5 hours playtime. Including a little menu browsing, that means I have likely spent a quarter of my ingame time looking at loading screens.\n\n- The AI. It is so bad it can sometimes be an involuntary source of rare fun. At one point, members of two opposing factions are involved in a firefight, while a couple of guards stroll idly through the crossfire, taking no notice. As the fight ends, the same guards suddenly freak out over the bodies at their feet - \"Ah! A body! There's been a murder! You won't get away with this\", they exclaim, and then just keep walking. On a different occasion, an NPC shoots another NPC, and then freaks out over the body *which he just made*. \"There's been a murder!\" - no, really? And that's saying nothing of the shoddy combat AI, nor the incredibly poor search AI. You can actually hide from enemies by standing on the other side of a glass door, or by closing an air vent cover, and they will have no idea where you went.\n\n- Graphics \u2013 and I don't mean \"it's ugly\", I mean it's really poorly designed. Most weapons are close to identical both when equipped and as inventory icons. With a few exceptions, it's hard to tell what things you can pick up in the field really is (except blinky and futuristic). Are those credit chips, datacubes, or maybe weapon modifications? Who knows! Better break into this locker to find out.\n\n- User interface. Of all the compromises made to make this game possible to run for its intended Xbox, this is likely the worst. Honestly, the UI of Invisible War is worse than trying to do internet banking with a broken gamepad.\n\nI could go on for a long time - this is in no way a complete list - but honestly, if you still think it \"can't be that bad\", go right ahead and buy it. Or save your money, go on YouTube and find a \"let's play\" video. I enjoyed some 25 hours of fun on my last Deus Ex playthrough. In Invisible War, it took me less than 8 hours to reach the 2nd to last level. Then I just decided I couldn't be bothered, uninstalled it, and would rather just read about the ending than suffer through more.", "timestamp_created": 1429034313, "timestamp_updated": 1429034313, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 247, "votes_funny": 48, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806730389595031738", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15322818": {"recommendationid": "15322818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031004989", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 679, "last_played": 1429890452}, "language": "english", "review": "way worse atmosphere than DX1, but I like the story more than that or DX Human Revolution.\n\nWhats really bad: Levels are too small. \nWhats good (compared to HR, at least)\nNo \"save the damsel-in-distress\"-bullshit\nNo gold everywhere\nWhile not as interesting as those in DX1, there are at least some early companions (you may kill off later ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1428848486, "timestamp_updated": 1428848486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15290798": {"recommendationid": "15290798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150042738", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1557816698}, "language": "english", "review": "The loading screens need to load before they can load.\n\n10/10-Like Skyrim with spiderbombs.", "timestamp_created": 1428670816, "timestamp_updated": 1428670816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15284070": {"recommendationid": "15284070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989390503", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 189, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 146, "last_played": 1427756789}, "language": "english", "review": "I am kind of disappointed with this installment in the Deus Ex franchise, and not because of the content of the game.

Now that I've actually played it, I can safely say that this is a bad game even outside the context of the vastly superiror Deus Ex and Human Revolution.

I had to play offline because of an obnoxious design flaw that has the game start a new process every time you go to a new area - Steam interprets this as restarting the game and sends annoying popups to all your friends every 5 minutes. My actual time with the game was around 12 hours.)\n\nPros:\n\n- You can throw furniture at people's heads. Everyone has 5-7 lines of dialogue to complain about you doing this and a funny recoil animation. They'll never go hostile despite threatening to attack. It's fun, and I did it to basically everyone in the game once I realized it wasn't any good. \n\n- You can kill everyone. There are only lasting consequneces for killing plot characters, though, and even those are fairly negligible. See cons. \n\n- The voice acting is generally pretty good. A few minor NPCs do their best to ruin that. \n\nCons:\n\n- Bugs. So many bugs. A few of the ones I encountered: Multitools sometimes won't stack or count correctly because the devs couldn't ID things correctly, autosaves will randomly delete and send you back 30 minutes, one full CTD, ragdolls try to reach the fourth dimension when shot by turrets or patrol bots, and tons of minor inconveniences like small items not being accessible behind useless aesthetics with large hitboxes or the light from lamps not remotely matching where the bulb is pointed. \n\n- The story is terrible. It tries to be deep, but mostly ends up being nonsensical. International air travel hasn't existed for 20 years, supposedly, but there's a private pilot hanging out in a slum bar in the first area you visit. He owns a Harrier and can fly to Cairo from Seattle. \n\n- There's basically no music.\n\n- The AI is incredibly stupid. You can kill people by pushing flaming barrels into them and no one will care. In combat, they'll stand still with their backs to you for no reason and all try to be in exactly the same spot. The only real threat comes the lack of health restoration in the early game. \n\n- Once you get a sniper rifle, there is no reason to use anything else. It can kill any human enemy (with a very late game exception) in one shot from any distance provided you hit them in the head, which isn't challenging since they're so fond of standing still. Pistols do pathetic damage, shotgun damage dropoff is too high, and all other weapons drain ammo too quickly to be worth using. \n\n- Ammo is shared between all weapons and obnoxiously rare. Quite a few enemy types apparently fire using dark magic and will never drop ammo. \n\n- You can kill everyone, but nobody cares. I walked into a nightclub and proceeded to murder everyone, including a security chief and the Culture Minister of Seattle. The police outside didn't care, and no one ever brought it up again. \n\n- Quests that clearly should be mutually exclusive aren't. You can take a quest to become the enemy of the Omar and the ally of the Omar. If you finish the enemy quest first, you'll briefly be penalized, but then can still reach friend status by completing the other quest. Another early quest pair involving rival businesses can also have both halves completely for full reward. \n\n- No meaningful choices until the end. \n\n- Bad level design. Where Human Revolution and Deus Ex have multiple routes into everything and allow for a stealth approach, Invisible War rarely has alternate routes more interesting than air ducts and seemingly goes out of its way to make stealth unviable.\n\n-------\n\nSome good get a bad reputation for failing to live up to their predecessors.

After the sheer joy of the first Deus Ex, I was very excited to give this one a try; too bad for me.\n\nWhile you can still find echoes of the open, multi-method gameplay that Deus Ex is known for, the overall experience is dull.  The AI appears less capable, and the voice acting does nothing to make up for the limitations.  The story just feels less compelling, and they even have one massively contradicting feature from the previous narrative (no spoiler here).  The individual maps are tiny and relatively featureless, and lack enough NPCs to give them life (even the night club\u2019s population is a joke).  There are also no transition animations/mini-movies, which is painful given the amount of traveling you do (remember the small maps?).\n\nMoving on from the atmosphere, the gameplay reeks of a bad console port.  Your options for character customization are a far cry from the previous title; there are less augmentations and items to play with, too.  I also found a severe imbalance concerning ammunition.  If you don\u2019t play it safe and stockpile munitions by the time you\u2019ve got heavy hitters coming at you, and you didn\u2019t plan on using stealth the whole way through (kinda go hand-in-hand, right?) then things get painful.  Oh, and all weapons are supplied by one ammo type, and you can only carry so much.  Not to say, however, that this game is overly challenging all the way through (quite the opposite).\n\nJust everything about this game was \u201cless\u201d than its predecessor.  Unless you are planning to purchase just out of dedication to the Deus Ex franchise, don\u2019t waste your time with this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1428226689, "timestamp_updated": 1428226689, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15199433": {"recommendationid": "15199433", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986291714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1117, "last_played": 1428137983}, "language": "english", "review": "It is with some very mixed feelings that I DO recommend this game. I wouldn't call me playing it a waste of time, because I have played plenty of games worse than this one. The game is awash with bugs - but many are in my opinion only aestethic, and does not affect the general gameplay as much. Sure the floating objects, invisible spider-bots and massive amount of clipping (mostly in cinematics) are disturbing - but again, nothing that should deteriorate you from playing this game, because it does function still.\n\nThe ragdoll-graphics bring both joy and annoyance - at times they are hilarious (yes, mostly at the beginning of the game), but at other times they are just plainly frustrating. Not to mention even a bit surreal - but extremely surreal. Sure, this ordinary enemy takes 10 shots to his torso and still lives (like what?), but one shot to the head and he's tossed like 30 feet out from a balcony. From a pistol-shot. With a silencer.\n\nThe loading-screens are many, and extremely frustrating. My first (and only, thank God) play-through of this game is roughly 18 hours. Not 18 hours that I was tormented non-stop. More like 3 hours of \"damn, this is actually a very good game!\" and 15 hours of \"omg, I just wanna finish this game so I can move on\". Point is, without the extreme amount of loading-screens every 5-10 minutes, my play-time could have been shaved down to like 11 hours or something. Not to mention random crashes (five in my play-through), and the fact that every time the game moves on to another loading-screen it minimizes to my desktop - stays that way for about 20 seconds and then resumes to the loading-screen which is another 30-40 seconds of waiting. And it randomize my oh-so-carefully organized desktop each and every fucking time, too.\n\nI didn't really have a problem with the HUD, I thought it was aestethically acceptable and easy to learn and understand. What I did have a problem with was the over-simplification of the biomods, and inventory-screen. Only 5 slots to fill with biomods, and none the ordinary biomods (except for the muscle-thing that expand you inventory) are that appealing seeing as you get a hold of your first supposedly illeagal - and almost too helpful - biomod after about 1 hour of play.\n\nThe story of the game is good. Not as good as the first Deus Ex, mind you. But it is still good, and frankly was the only thing that kept me going and completing the game. I think the level-design negatively impact the story-line and sort of cramps the ability to go about everything the way you could in the first Deus Ex, but on the other end the level-design did promote a more direct, fast-paced sort of action (seeing as upgrading the speed-biomod to max-level could be done in about 2 hours of game-time, and thus could be activated basically non-stop the rest of the game due to low bioenergy-consumption and a complete overload of energy-cells throughout the game).\n\nTo sum it up: Play this game for the story. It will not perform miracles gameplay-wise. The storyline isn't fantastic either, but I can't call it a waste of time because I did enjoy building upon the legacy that JC Denton left in the original game. I think with a bit more effort from the developers, that this game could have been somewhat better and more of a worthy sequel to the 1st Deus Ex, as opposed to the bleak shadow of the 1st game that it is today. The game is worth 7 \u20ac, but I got it on a sale, which somehow eased the discomfort I experienced while playing it.\n\n60/100", "timestamp_created": 1428140554, "timestamp_updated": 1428140745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15165888": {"recommendationid": "15165888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101634433", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 194, "last_played": 1427872048}, "language": "spanish", "review": "(si no quieren leer todo: 8/10)\n\nok, desde el principio, ignoren el marcador de horas registradas que me lo pase en modo offline cuando el internet se iba\nsegundo, este juego esta bastante denso a ratos, puedes perderte, pero es de lo amsrecomendable, siempre vale la pena explorar y asi sacar un par de cosas, ahora de lleno:\n\nDeus Ex: Invisible war no tiene nada de invisible, en serio, puedes hacer el desastre que quieras y no va a pasar mucho, eso si, podria complicarse algunas veces, \u00bfte gusta el sigilo? adelante, ve con cuidado, \u00bfno te gusta? ten una granada y diviertete.\n\nAun asi no todo es ojuelas con miel, sobre todo que en este juego tienes menos espacios para aumentos y debes escogerlos con mas calma... al principio, despues encuentras latias con aumentos y puedes cambiarlos bastante facil, ademas de tener toda una nueva gamma de aumentos que te permiten controlar desde droides hasta devorar cadaveres y curarte (loco... me suena familiar)\nOtro punto es que en apariencia el inventario es mas peque\u00f1o, pero no es asi, ahora las armas ocupan un solo espacio en el, no varios dependiendo de su tama\u00f1o.\nPero ya que estamos con las armas, el peor punto en cuanto a armas es que solo aceptan dos modificaciones cada una, eso si, ahora hay nuevas modificaciones muy variadas.\nOtro punto que m desagrado bastante es que no puedes entrenar tus habilidades como en el primero, asi que si una cerradura necesita tres herramientas nunca bajara a dos o a una.\nLo peor en el juego en si es que cada escenario diferente una nueva carga y eso es horrible, de verdad, se van a artar de tantas cargas, pero valen la pena\n\nEn reusmen, un juego con una historia dificil de contar, pero una vez explorado es muy facil de entender, armas nuevas, funciones nuevas, conocidos viejos, escenarios familiares (ni tanto) y mucha diversion sabiendo que consecuencias generaste en el primer juego, yo definitivamente lo recomiendo", "timestamp_created": 1427960845, "timestamp_updated": 1427960845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632195770740509033", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15157664": {"recommendationid": "15157664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037253336", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1394337446}, "language": "english", "review": "Before anybody decides they want to say \"maybe your computer sucks.\" That's the biggest load of crap I've ever seen someone say in my life.

I went into this expecting an experience akin to that of arm wrestling with a chainsaw, but I guess that everyone's talk of this game lowered my expectations to unreasonable depths. Invisible War is, while not as good as its predecessor, a good game.\n\nA big complaint I notice is the \"consolization\", the clear downgrade in many aspects of the overall design of the first game, including large levels, complex controls, dynamic damage, skills, and swimming. (The multiplayer is gone as well.) There is a lack of control options, which correlated directly to removal of leaning, reduced toolbelt size and biomod (augmentation) slots, and an ugly HUD. As for the size of areas, I would chalk that up to incredibly sloppy coding and graphics that were ahead of their time. One might look at the game's system requirements and then remember that this released in North America in 2003. However, as far as I'm concerned, it is still little excuse; The smaller areas force a different style of gameplay, and the frequency and time of the loading screens is just annoying.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, there is nothing wrong. The graphics are great, and the story, a direct sequel, I would say surpasses that of the original, at least in terms of depth. In terms of how memorable the characters are... eh, I don't really have much to say. Open-ended missions change the flow of the game. Rather than being given one main objective at a time a la the first game, the player is given multiple objectives from warring factions that ultimately branch to the end, and make the ending seem like more of a result of the path taken throughout the game, rather than a rushed decision made at the last minute, though the latter is certainly still possible should you enjoy being chaotic in choosing your allies.\n\nSadly, if the story is more open than the original, the same cannot be said for weapons and inventory management. Multitools and lockpicks are now one and the same. Items now only take up one slot each, so there is no need for inventory Tetris, but the small size can only be increased by installing and upgrading a specific biomod. Food can be stacked regardless of the type. Firearms have universal ammo, which I saw to be a self-defeating mechanism. In the original Deus Ex, running out of ammo for a weapon forced me to rethink my entire combat strategy and apply it until I could renew my supplies. Here, run out for one gun, you run out for just about everything else. On top of that, weapons can only take two mods at a time, and mods cannot be removed once applied.\n\nEven with a decent variety of weapons, I found little point to using nonlethal tactics. At least during the first few hours of the first game, you would get reprimanded for it. Here, there is almost never a reason to not just kill enemies on the spot. Even when I do use a nonlethal weapon, the game treats the character as having died, and he or she will not appear again. The small area sizes, while not too restrictive, encourage more aggressive gameplay by giving very limited options as to approach.\n\nThe player has fewer biomods/augmentations at one time. Luckily, many of the classics are here, as well as some new ones to compensate for the ones which were pulled. The best change here is having three to choose from for any specific slot, and the ability to change between them should you have the materials. It's a fine way to keep the player from restarting when he's realized that the combination he's chosen to go with is ineffective.\n\nI'm certain I've left something out, but this review has to end sometime. Even with all of its simplification problems, it manages to cling enough to the core Deus Ex gameplay. I plan on coming back to this sometime in the future, as I'm certain there's a lot more for me to discover, and the mission structure provides a great deal of replay value. Methinks people would treat this game better were it not called Deus Ex, but as it stands, Invisible War is a fine addition to the series.", "timestamp_created": 1426807468, "timestamp_updated": 1427518182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608872652053833008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14963528": {"recommendationid": "14963528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020271711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1426794377}, "language": "english", "review": "What a pile of shrak!\n\"Open world\" my ass!\nPOS game!", "timestamp_created": 1426794420, "timestamp_updated": 1426794420, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471365660429000854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14909297": {"recommendationid": "14909297", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966510539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1426450677}, "language": "english", "review": "Best A-Hole simulator on the market.

Invisible War is a decent game I must stress this, but decent is simply not good enough if you are the direct followup to what many considered, even at the time, one of the greatest video games ever made. Invisible War has a distinction of taking away far too many of the original game's features and depth and offering very little in return aside from prettier graphics and the option to play as a female.\n\nFor starters, this is a port of a console game, while the original Deus Ex was custom built exclusively for the PC platform. This alone is a terrible thing, as the game is inherrently bound to the original Xbox's limitations, and these limitations negatively impact nearly every facet of the game. No environment is even half as big as the first level of the original, load times tend to take more screen time than gameplay, and your key binding options are much more limited. There are even actions that cannot be rebound to a different key! \n\nSecond of all, ammo across all weapons is universal, the health system is a standard percentage based system rather than one based of areas of the body inflicted (while Human Revolution also does this, that game allows such a system to be upgraded, thus adding depth), and you CANNOT MANUALLY RELOAD YOUR WEAPON. It stupefies gameplay to such a degree that it insults both console players new to this game as well as existing fans. It's the fisher-price version of Deus Ex, and it stars a protagonist that looks like a long-lost Backstreet Boy. There's a reason why it took so long between this and Human Revolution; the new devs had to figure out a proper way to unfuck this franchise.\n\nOther than all that shit I just said, it's not a broken game. It can be played and enjoyed, especially as a stealth or action game, but do know ahead of time that this is not the proper Deus Ex experience. Choices matter much less, and at times you simply HAVE to kill someone or HAVE to hack this thing. Player flexibility is discarded when seen useful, and that goes against the design philosophy of both the original and the excellent Human Revolution.

It blows chunks!\"\n\nWell, I'll say you're wrong.\n\nIt is DEFINATELY not the best game in the series, like the first one.  Like Deus Ex: The Fall you need to look at the game as what they wanted it to be and how accutare the game got to their target.  As we can see in the ad for it, most of what is shown is firefights and explosions.  Perhaps they wanted a more action-esque game?  Yes and no.\n\nI know it says that I'm played very little of the game here on steam, however I had a CD copy of this recently and decided to play it one day as it had only been opened a few times before.  My older cousins would come once in a while and since we had a desktop, cousin P would come and play his collection of PC games he would leave here.  Recently, within the last few months in the smmer, I found the stash and this was in it.\n\nAfter 6 hours of playing it off the CD I can say, yes the game IS NOT the first one.  Most scenes are better done by running and gunning rather than slow and comprehensive plans and watching the walking patterns.  And sure, it might crash once in a blue moon; who cares!  This is a windows 2000 game :D\n\nOther than the main RPG flaw being that you need a gun no matter what to go anywhere fast, you can definately play the game the old style if you want to.  This does prove to be tougher over all as the enemies don't USUALLY walk on a path anymore.  Nor do the have a specific walk area.  Enemies tend to explore, and if they find you you're done unless you flatten them ASAP.  Armor is indeed hard to come by as an upgrade so it is worth having health items as often as possible.  You will take a hit, even it a random fire starts.\n\nDifferent from the first game, where in the beginning you have to collect items from enemy guards and such instead of finding them in random places, in this game it is flipped:  you can just find random whatever anywhere on the map.  As I said earlier the RPG elements are indeed lowered.\n\nSo what were they aiming for?  While the first game revolutionized how we think of FPRPG's nowadays, at the time quake was the holyfartcow of the universe just as COD is now.  What was most likely being aimed for was the idea of being more like a shooter than an RPG, even though those elements are still there.  Not helpful in a stealth FPRPG.\n\nOverall score?  7.6 / 10.

Compared to the original game which actually seems to handle anything I threw at it fine (played the game in a window and used a tool to make it borderless) this game flat out refuses to cooperate.\n\nMax resolution available to me is 1280x1024, you can force change this in the ini but the game automatically re-writes settings when it reloads (which is often, more later) so I had to forcibly deny access via Windows security settings. \n\nWindowed mode is also an option via .ini edit however do not expect borderless, the game flips out and the window simply becomes invisible if you attempt to modify anything about the size of the window while it is open, whether that be borderless using a tool or maximizing it in task manager to get rid of the ugly gap beneath the window.\n\nThe game also reloads often, loading in any area seems to do this as do some cutscenes, and believe me this is often. As a result of the console release presumably and the limited hardware of said consoles at the time the actual areas loaded in at once are horrifically small (Funnily enough, a criticism of the newer \"The Fall\" title too). However, this is not just loading screens, the game actually reloads itself entirely each time it does so, other reviews were certainly not exaggerating when they said you will spend more time watching loading screens than in game.\n\nThere are some other minor issues arising already, the controls are certainly not as freely rebindable as the first game and the UI compared to the previous game is clearly console-based though workable on PC. Other issues of varying magnitude by individual preference are a somewhat lacking options menu and more.\n\nOverall, as far as a PC title goes this game has a whole host of issues, this game is certainly not for the impatient and many will find the port frustrating to work with (hopefully some of my points help people get the game working how they like it).\n\nAs for the story, o far it seems like it could be promising, seen a few Deus Ex 1 style options, the core mechanics are still there though I'm not well they're handled later down the line. So far the game has been very much like a tutorial (or perhaps the game as a whole is too linear). There is certainly a clear conspiracy style storyline (as you would expect for Deus Ex) though perhaps its a little forced this time, as I mentioned I haven't played much so far, only about to leave the first area and I am already being presented by two very distinct sides and making a major choice between the two.\n\nThis review isn't really to cover the storyline though, if you've previously played Deus Ex you already know the reputation of Invisible War and are considering playing it because you want to find out what happens after the 1st game, just keep in mind the hurdles in doing so I mentioned earlier. I do think I will play this to the end regardless, just might be in shorter bursts than HR and DX1.\n", "timestamp_created": 1417903807, "timestamp_updated": 1417903807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13236050": {"recommendationid": "13236050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995856662", "num_games_owned": 800, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1417209214}, "language": "english", "review": "Grossly underrated.

If you are looking for a clone of the first one than don't look here. \n\nPros: You can kill everyone if you want. Decent graphics for when it was made, especially for consoles.  Fun, yet confusing story that gives you many side quests and a good bit of moral and faction based choices. Many ways to complete a quest: stealth, run and gun, or let the machines do your work for you.  Good choice of weapons along with secret variant weapons that only the dilligent will find. Also has aome pretty cool weapon modifications you can add to your weapons. Decent physics.  The biomod system is fun and has you getting excited everytime you find a biomod canister.  There are also 4 different endings that you can receive depending on how you handle the last mission.\n\nCons:  Allthough the story is fun, it IS confusing.  The universal weapon ammo system sucks balls; so even though you are guaranteed ammo for every gun you have, you still have to ration ammo because some guns use more than others (I myself found myself out of ammo more than once and had to rely on my biomods to get me out of a jam).  Some might say that the religious stereotypes in the Templar and Order factions could be a con (I myself could care less but Im putting it here because someone else might).  \n\nI myself thouroughly enjoyed this game even though it did not live up to the expectations of the first.

There is a surprisingly large amount of choices which have a real impact on the story. I found the story and side stories to be interesting and supportive of the gameplay. The gameplay itself is pretty damn fun and comparable to the first game, involving stealth, gunplay, tech equipment, special abilities, etc.\n\nI've beaten both the original Deus Ex and now Invisible War and I must say, besides the changes to streamline certain gameplay aspects, Invisible War is just as high quality as the first. It definitely seemed like a true sequel to me, despite what I've read online. And hell, I'd even say the changes make the game a lot easier to get a handle on, as the first game at times felt a bit overwhelming to deal with. I actually felt a lot more engaged with the biomod system in Invisible War because of the fact that it laid out the details more clearly. \n\nThe main issue with this game is the loading screen issue. Levels are HEAVILY segmented into separate areas that must be loaded individually, and every time you enter a new area, the game minimizes for a few seconds, comes back up and then takes another few seconds to load. This process also occurs every time you load a save, meaning that even hitting quickload (F12) will force you to wait 10 seconds. The original game had instant quick loading, as MOST games do. \n\nIf you are wondering if you should play this after playing the first game, then the answer is yes. Don't let whiny comments about the game being terrible because it was \"consolized\" fool you.

I am sad to report that this game is a total piece of garbage. Overall, it was a very consolized and poorly designed sequel. Here is why I would recommend skipping this game:\n\n[b]1.  Loading screens. [/b] You will probably spend more time watching loading screens than actually playing the game. The game is set up so that only tiny pieces of each area are loaded at one time so that you have to watch loading screen after loading screen after loading screen just to move through the game. Even the main menu has a loading screen. It is so oppressive that it ruins the gameplay.\n\n[b]2.  Cramped level design. [/b] All the maps feel like you're moving through tunnels. Even the outdoor areas seem very close quarters and boxed in with loading barriers every 15 feet.\n\n[b]3.  Incessant bugs and crashing (which of course leads to more loading screens).[/b] This is kind of self-expanatory, but I personally had a particularly bad problem with random crashing and then corrupt savegames. There were also the other classic bugs such as stuff getting stuck in walls, NPCs battling each other when they're not supposed to, buggy objects jittering around the levels, etc. The camera angles during cutscenes were a joke. It's kind of hard to take the game seriously when the camera angles switch between close up of the floor and half a character's face during every cutscene.\n\n[b]4.  Flat characters and lame storyline.[/b] The game played like one of those choose your own adventure books with a little target shooting thrown in here and there. The designers really got into this 'choose between factions' idea and took it too far. All the interactions and cutscenes were nothing more than each faction trying to persuade you to join their side with very little underlying plot or consequences for your actions. The characters seemed so dull and one dimensional. The designers tried to get all philosophical with many elements of the game but failed to impress me with the depth of their ideas and understanding.\n\n[b]5.  Crawling in air ventilation.[/b] After a while, you start to realize that attached to every room it is a grate leading to a gigantic man-sized ventilation shaft with convenient ladders for all the vertical sections. Not only is this kind of silly, but it becomes annyoing when you spend half the game crawling through these vanilla cloned tunnels. Of course you don't HAVE to go that route, but when the alternative is to waste an item, ammo, or other resource, and vent crawling is free, you are encouraged to spend your time exploring the ducts.\n\n[b]6.  You get all firearms and items way too early.[/b] The game essentially gives you every item in the game in the first hour of playing. I had about 10 unused biomod upgrades at the end of the game with all my biomods maxed out. You are loaded up with so much stuff that it destroys all the fun of spontaneously finding a new item or upgrading your skill to a new level.\n\n[b]7.  Side quests for money to buy WHAT?[/b] There are quite a few \"secondary\" goals that typically result in a small cash reward. However, you are already overstocked and a millionaire with nowhere to go and nothing to buy. They add very little to the gameplay because the story underlying each quest is trivial (e.g. go find someone and talk to them to make sure they're ok) and you're so loaded with cash anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1416375268, "timestamp_updated": 1419892435, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 131, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.788443684577941895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12981817": {"recommendationid": "12981817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022497958", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 41, "last_played": 1410190015}, "language": "english", "review": "Come on, it's not THAT bad!

So interesting, in fact, that I would recomend playing the original game, skipping this title completely, and then playing Human Revolution. Anyway, if you care about my opinion, read on! Otherwise, I hope you have a nice day anyway.\n\nAs far as ambiance goes it is reminiscent of the original game. The dark and oppressive cityscape, the futuristic techno music, the neo-noir use of shadows and, of course, the color blue.\n\nThe one improvement this game has over it's predecesor is the ragdoll mechanic. Stuffing the limp bodies of victims into the ventillation grates is more entertaining than the story itself.\n\nThis, of course, leads into the story. I played this game for about five and a half hours. In that amount of time in the first game, I stopped numerous political terrorist plots, took out some nasty drug dealers, saved a girl from a pimp and many, many other things. I definitely felt like I was making a positive difference in the world.\nIn the first five hours of this game, I escaped from a bizarre super-soldier training prison that was under attack from generic religous terrorists and then wandered around for a while fighting mercenaries, killing random gang members, discovering that the terrorists were purposefully religously generic, cheated in some illeagel gambling, burglarized some rich dude's apartment, and wrecked a coffee shop. I felt like a roving psychopath.\n\nIn the first game, I felt torn between the urgency of completing the story missions and helping people by completing the side quests.\nIn this game I felt like there was something I was supposed to be doing, but I had no idea what that thing was or if it even mattered.\n\nThe first game eventually gives you a sense of moral ambiguity; over time you learn more and more about all the factions competing with each other and also that every side does varying amounts of honorable as well as evil actions. Aligning with a certain side doesn't make you feel any better than the other side, but you just feel like you need to go with the lesser evil in order to save humanity.\nThis game gives you an immediate feeling of moral ambivolence. You discover within the first hour that every faction you've encountered has a mixture of good and bad intentions which culminate in stupidity. There is no urgency. These people are just going to fight amongst each other for ambiguous reasons and they want to draw you into it. At that point I figured I'd just go and see if there was anything remotely interesting happening elsewhere. Cheat in some underground mutant lizard fighting betting? Why not. Get involved in a feud between rival coffee chains? Sure! It's more interesting than helping the Orwellian police force fight some self righteous murderers.\n\nLast and perhaps least, we have the player character. In the first game, you get to be the badass JC. Do you think his baggy coat is unnecessary and it's ridiculous that he wears sunglasses at night? He could not care less about your opinion. If you order him to do something he thinks is questionable, he will not blindly follow your orders. He will do what he thinks is right, and he will go about it however he wants. Playing as him, you feel like an awesome futuristic warrior as you gradually upgrade his nanotech and acquire new and better equipment.\nIn this game, you are Alex. His/her character was not developed at all in the time that I played. All in all, (s)he pretty much just lets the different factions tell him/her what to do with very little (if any) question or objection. Truely, a compelling character. Playing as this wimp, you get a bunch of weapons and upgrades almost immediately and not much of anything to do with them.\n\nThis game is not technically good. It is not even that fun. As an experience, it's a mediocre spiral into the depths of a deranged world. The prequel is amazing, and the first game is a masterpiece. This sequel is ultimately disappointing. It is basically just one of the many Godfather 3's of the game industry.\n\nThis is all, of course, just my opinion and I sincerely thank you for reading it. I hope it was helpful.

Then they looked at the limitations imposed by that console and they made the areas claustrophobically small and mangled the game engine they were using so that the far too frequent load screens take an inordinately long time to load (and bounce you to the desktop while they're doing it just to add to their immersion breaking act). It becomes at some points not unusual to spend 15 seconds traversing an area hitting a loading screen, waiting, spending another 15 seconds moving across the next area, waiting...\n\nSo so far they've mangled the game contents, the interface, the world detail and the engine. Oh yeah and the weird designs of some areas make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Whatever could be left? The story? Surely that's got to be good, after all that's part of what made this series great, right? Well, no. Between the odd character animations (which weirdly make the characters look *less* natural than the first game) and the god awful factions all of whom appear to be filled with entirely awful people who elicit no sympathy whatsoever you are left either having to roll a dice and decide which of the awful factions to join in with or alternatively just running missions for whoever you feel like. None of it really makes a huge difference though as (as per the first) you are offered a nice clear cut choice to get each ending in the end. In terms of the actual storyline, with everyone so unlikable as you learn to hate them all you'll also realise just how thoroughly they have butchered the story of the first game by trying to include all three of the endings from that in the current timeline which is a mistake because it massively reduces the possibilities going forwards, and also completely trivialises the (actually interesting) choice the player had to make at the end of Deus Ex.\n\nIf you enjoyed Deus Ex, don't buy this game.

For one, it's a sequel to one of the most heavily lauded games ever made. That automatically put it in the position of trying to live up to a nigh-impossible standard. But the game isn't bad, it's just very average. That's it's biggest problem, really: It's an average game that's a sequel to an amazing one. (Well, that and the stupid cover with the guy holding a pistol sideways.)\n\nInvisible War takes place about twenty years after Deus Ex. Events at the end of that game triggered something called \"The Collapse\", which basically crippled civilization and caused a wide variety of problems that people are still recovering from. In a way, the game implies that all three endings from DX1 sort-of happened: J.C. Denton attempted to merge with Helios but fails, which causes the global network to cease to function, which results in the downfall of national governments and the rise of \"city-states\". Some people have a problem with this, and while I'll certainly agree it could have been handled better, I'm not sure what people expected. Did they think that the developers would make three radically different settings depending on which ending you picked in the first game? \n\nYou play as Alex D, a nanoaugmented student in the Tarsus Academy. Of course, things aren't what they seem, and just as in the original Deus Ex, you have to uncover a conspiracy and puzzle out what's really going on.\n\nThe game plays out much as the original; you go from city to city performing missions, although in this game you get to choose whether you want to work for the Order (a religious group that springs up after the Collapse) or the World Trade Organization (which has more or less become the new version of the U.N. in this game). Which you choose does affect how the missions play out. However, it ultimately has no bearing on the way the game ends, which is another problem people have with it. I don't want to spoil the plot by explaining this, but I will say that I agree that the ultimate reveal is kind of dumb and renders a lot of your choices meaningless.\n\nAnother story element that some people complain about is how several characters from the first game return, but have radically different points of view than in the first game. However, this complaint seems rather naive to me. First of all, it's been twenty years. People change a lot over that period of time. But more importantly, the characters in question were all directly involved in the events that triggered the Collapse. If your ideals led to a catastrophic event causing untold amounts of death and devastation, don't you think that might change your outlook?\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is very similar to the original, but there are a few changes that were made to simplify things that ultimately work to the detriment of the game. The biomod system is less interesting, the level areas are smaller in order to accomodate the X-Box's memory limitations, but the worst change (and the one you will hear EVERYONE who plays this game bitch about) is the ammunition system. In the original game (as in real life and in most FPSes), each weapon had its own ammunition, and in many cases a weapon had multiple ammo types you could choose between (for instance, shotguns had both buckshot and armor-piercing rounds). In this game, someone decided it would be a good idea to have every weapon use the same ammunition counter. The conceit is that the weapons are using nanomachines to build ammunition, and that your \"ammo\" is actually the raw material used to make bullets and whatnot. The biggest problem with this is that the amount of this material that you can carry is severely restricted, and heavy weapons take a huge amount of material to fire. If you, say, use a rocket launcher a few times, you may suddenly find yourself having no ammo for your pistol.\n\nLike I said: Overall, it's not a terrible game; it's just not good, either.It's easy to see why, when they made a third game, they chose to make it a prequel. Even if this had been a great game, it's hard to see where the series could go from here. I think the only way we're ever going to get a Deus Ex game set after the first one is if they reboot the original first... which, depending on how it's done, could be pretty cool, actually.\n\n\n If you're a fan of the original Deus Ex, I would recommend playing through Invisible War at least once to see for yourself what's good and what's bad about it.", "timestamp_created": 1406360182, "timestamp_updated": 1406360283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583118677139282227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "11180957": {"recommendationid": "11180957", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972471964", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1395580727}, "language": "spanish", "review": "La trama de este juego se desarrolla 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s (si no me equivoco) de los acontecimientos del primero, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/?snr=1_7_15__13][i]Deus Ex Game Of The Year Edition[/i][/url]. Me result\u00f3 muy curioso que los hechos de este juego partan de una mezcla de los tres finales posibles del anterior. Aunque no es completamente imprescindible haberlo jugado, lo recomiendo fuertemente.\nDe hecho, voy a escribir este an\u00e1lisis suponiendo que hab\u00e9is jugado al primero (del cual tambi\u00e9n hice un [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/e_t_m/recommended/6910]an\u00e1lisis[/url]).\n\nHablando un poco de la [b]historia[/b], sigue un poco en la l\u00ednea de [i]cargas filos\u00f3ficas sobre hasta d\u00f3nde nos puede llevar la ambici\u00f3n por evolucionar[/i]. Hay una lucha constante entre los que defienden la evoluci\u00f3n mediante [u]biomodificaciones[/u] (habilidades introducidas en los humanos mediante nanotecnolog\u00eda que les permite realizar haza\u00f1as tales como dar saltos enormes o hacerse invisibles durante un tiempo) y los que argumentan que eso es una aberraci\u00f3n contra la humanidad. Aunque no encontraremos solamente dos bandos.\n\nEn relaci\u00f3n con el apartado anterior, tenemos la [b]toma de decisiones[/b]. Durante el transcurso del juego deberemos tomar decisiones que afectan en una medida [u]muy considerable[/u] los acontecimientos que ocurrir\u00e1n despu\u00e9s. Tambi\u00e9n influir\u00e1n sobre [i]de parte de qu\u00e9 bando estamos[/i],  y, por \u00faltimo, en el final que obtendremos (hay, si recuerdo bien, 4 finales distintos). Algo que [b]me gust\u00f3[/b] bastante es que [u]muchas decisiones no son definitivas[/u]. Es decir, que puedes ir favoreciendo a un bando y a otro alternativamente dependiendo de lo que m\u00e1s te convenza en cada momento (o sea, que, si, por ejemplo, la primera decisi\u00f3n que tomas apoya al bando [i]A[/i], eso no quiere decir que obtengas el final en el que [i]el bando A gana[/i]).\n\nEn cuanto a la [b]jugabilidad[/b], hay cambios importantes con respecto al primer juego. Dispones de un inventario en el que ocupa lo mismo un lanzacohetes que una barrita energ\u00e9tica (aunque puedes [i]stackear[/i] unas 50 barritas energ\u00e9ticas sin ocupar espacio adicional). Las biomodificaciones que eliges pueden ser cambiadas durante el juego (a diferencia de la precuela, en la que, biomodificaci\u00f3n que eleg\u00edas, biomodificaci\u00f3n que no pod\u00edas quitarte). Un aspecto que me llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n es que las armas no se recargan y todas usan el mismo tipo de munici\u00f3n (aunque no gasta lo mismo un disparo de escopeta que un disparo de pistola). Tambi\u00e9n encuentras a menudo modificaciones para tus armas (silenciadores, munici\u00f3n explosiva, etc.).\n\nAhora he de comentar un [b]aspecto que he odiado durante todo el juego[/b]: [u]los mapas son completamente herm\u00e9ticos[/u]. Me explico. En cualquier otro juego encuentras puertas cerradas, escombros, vallas\u2026 Es decir: ambientaci\u00f3n que te hace pensar [i]oh, no puedo pasar por aqu\u00ed, pero esto me hace deducir inconscientemente que estoy en un espacio grande y el mapa contin\u00faa por all\u00ed[/i]. En este juego no. Est\u00e1 todo lleno de paredes, y todas las puertas que hay, se abren. Esto me dio una sensaci\u00f3n horrible de claustrofobia, de estar todo el rato metido en una caja de zapatos. Por no haber, casi no hay ni ventanas que te ense\u00f1en [i]lo que hay fuera[/i].\n\nTerminando, mencionar\u00e9 [b]alg\u00fan otro aspecto[/b]. Hay much\u00edsimas misiones secundarias. Algunas armas tienen un disparo secundario. La inteligencia artificial no est\u00e1 mal. Hay unas f\u00edsicas un poco raras (desde la calle, puedes tirar un cad\u00e1ver hasta la cima de un edificio sin mayor esfuerzo). Aunque me parece un juego algo m\u00e1s lineal que el primero, tambi\u00e9n puedes elegir entre apa\u00f1\u00e1rtelas para entrar por los conductos o irrumpir por la puerta principal. Adem\u00e1s, para cambiar de escenario, a menudo tienes que contactar con un piloto, y existen dos opciones: hay una que te lleva gratis pero te deja un poco lejos de tu objetivo, y luego hay otro que te cobra pero que te deja en un lugar mejor. Luchas mayormente contra humanos (a veces biomodificados) y algunos [i]bots[/i] de seguridad, aunque alguna remota vez te encuentras a alg\u00fan [i]animal poco amigable[/i]. Me llev\u00f3 11 horas de juego en la m\u00e1xima dificultad (un poco corto, y eso que soy de los que inspeccionan mucho y dan un mont\u00f3n de vueltas), m\u00e1s luego un par de horas adicionales que emprend\u00ed para desbloquear todos los finales posibles. El juego no tiene traducci\u00f3n oficial; nivel de ingl\u00e9s requerido.\n\n[b]En definitiva[/b], si te gust\u00f3 el primero, probablemente te guste \u00e9ste. Es m\u00e1s corto y, en general, a m\u00ed me gust\u00f3 menos. Pero lo suficiente como para recomendarlo.

Furthermore, Deus Ex ends with 3 possible endings, and while Invisible War tries hard to tie these three endings together, it does not give the game full justice I feel as the plot feels incomplete. Characters from the first game are dragged back in for cameo roles, and this just feels redundant. Moreover to be questioned is which developer of the game decided to use generalised ammo throughout the game - I could garrote them for that move. I kid you not, I am unable to complete the game with ammunition without entering system files before playing and multiplying ammunition found in the world to 7 TIMES THEIR VALUE. Anything less, and I spend the last few levels of the game running around like a maniac because I have no ammunition at all, and the enemies later on require a lot to kill, and they drop so little ammunition!

The levels are much smaller, the the levelling system is massively neutered (you can only upgrade augments, as opposed to additional skills) combat is weaker in many ways.\n\nWith that said however, Invisible War is actually a pretty good game when taken on its own merits. First off, the atmosphere is fantastic. Even though the worlds are way smaller than those of Deus Ex 1, Invisible war uses lighting, music, and visuals to great effect, resulting in a moody world that draws you in, despite being so far removed from anything in the real world. The art direction is really fantastic. Furthermore, the storyline is really interesting. It doesn't start out quite as compelling as the original, but it picks up quickly and has loads of great twists. There were lots of memorable characters, as is series tradition, and it's great to see what became of certain characters from the first game (although I didn't care for what they did with JC Denton). Also, the fact that this game essentially provides closure for the Deus Ex Universe makes it very much worth seeing the game through to the ending.\n\nOne really interesting thing this game does that the first game didn't (and I'd even say Invisible War might be slightly better in this regard) is that you can actually choose which faction to work for during each mission. Invisible War carries on the first game's tradition of having your choices make a massive impact on how the story plays out (I've heard that your choice of character gender actually has an effect on some of what side-missions are available, but I haven't done a second playthrough so I'm not sure what extent this alters things to), and being able to choose who you work for brings this to a whole new level, as it lets you experience the story from different perspectives, and what you do at certain points in the game actually does effect which endings are available (as opposed to in the first and third game, where you essentially choose your ending at the last minute). How you interact with characters is key and your relationships with the characters can affect the gameplay in numerous ways. The dialogue plays out more naturally than in the first game (I do miss how all the random NPCs seemingly had PHD's in philosophy in the first game, as it was cheesy, but also really interesting and part of the original's charm) and the story covers some interesting topics. Interestingly, this game goes into a lot of the same pro-augmentation vs anti-augmentation debates that characters in Human Revolution had (this topic was in Deus Ex 1 a bit, but not to the extent of this game and HR), so it does seem to have at least had some influence on future installments of the series. Overall, the storyline is definitely a strong point, and worthy of the Deus Ex name.\n\nNow, about the gameplay. Yes, it isn't nearly as good as Deus Ex 1, but it's still better than many games. Whereas the original was an RPG played through the interface of a first person shooter, this game is more of a first-person shooter with light RPG elements. Overall the guns feel decent (although the pistol is pretty useless), but the melee attacks lack punch. You'll be progressing through a series of cramped, but surprisingly non-linear levels and are given the freedom to choose your objectives based on what faction you like. There are a surprising amount of side missions, and just like in the original game, you can opt to do a pacifist run. Your augmentations can let you do some crazy, almost game-breaking stuff (Bot Domination is particularly awesome. It lets you take control of enemy robots, and getting the jump on an enemy patrol who was hanging out with enemy robots is both awesome and hilarious), which can lead to some fun situations. Something that's interesting about how this game handles augments is that you can actually replace your augments with a different ones if you find yourself in a desperate situation where an augment you didn't choose would be helpful. This is a last-ditch strategy though, as the new augment starts out un-upgraded, so you'll usually have to carefully weigh your options. Unfortunately, the weight of this decision is lessened a great deal by the sheer abundance of upgrade cannisters in the game. By the time you finish, you'll probably have at least 10 or so extra cannisters laying around, meaning that if you swap augs for a situation, you can often easily swap back to what you had before and re-upgrade it to the maximum level. Swapping is still an interesting and useful mechanic, even though the abundance of upgrades hurts the design.\n\nThe inventory system is a bit awkward. You can only carry somewhat small amount of things, which makes sense from the standpoint that the developers want you to pick and choose a playstyle, but gets frustrating when you just want to pick up a medkit and all of your slots are full. Not too bad, but it does add up over time. Furthermore, there's a bug where sometimes more than one of the same item won't stack, which is especially frustrating for the lockpick multitools, as some doors need a certain amount (so if a door needs four tools, and you have two stacks of two, it won't open), which is incredibly frustrating. The interface of it is also a bit clunky, being clearly designed for a gamepad. It's not offensively bad, but moving an item to be equipped is a bit tedious, as you can't click and drag. Instead, you click the space for the item you want to move, and then click which slot you want it to go to.\n\nThe main flaw of the gameplay is the universal ammo system. Basically there's one type of ammo, and if you run out of it for one gun, you're out of luck for all of your guns. It's frustrating and you run out often, but there are some benefits. It does force you to use stealth in some places and it encourages an efficient style of play (always go for headshots if you can). It also leads to some tense situations (such as you versus 15 armored guys and some robots with little ammo) that force you to think way outside the box and come up with your own solutions to problems, and it was actually during these parts that the game felt the most like Deus Ex 1. Despite these interesting situations, Universal ammo is a pretty ham-handed way of of making these things happen, and the same effects could have been achieved in different ways with better design. For all the neat gameplay scenarios it causes, it also causes a noticeable amount of annoyance (although there's always some way out of your problem). \n\nThe level design is solid (despite levels being really small) and it does encourage you to expore the environment. You still have multiple ways to do things and what you do has a fascinating imact on the story. The real problem with the levels is that they're split up into many separate maps, which means you'll be seeing loading screens a ton. This isn't too bad as today's computers can load things rather quickly, but for some reason the game minimizes to the desktop each time a map loads, and then goes back to normal once everything is up. This is jarring and does take you out of the game abit, so an actual loading screen would have been nice. The levels themseles are densly packed with detail, and there is a great variety to the environments you'll be in. Most levels have a nice kind of back and forth flow, almost reminiscent in some ways of the level design in an oldschool Doom game (in a good way). The game mostly takes place in interiors as opposed to the large outdoors environments of Deus Ex 1, but the levels aren't bad.\n\nOverall, Invisible War falls short in many areas, especially compared to the original Deus Ex, but taken on its own it is a very interesting game that's definitely worth playing. There are a lot of unique ideas, and even though they don't all pan out, it mostly falls on the \"good\" side of things.

It unfortunately distills what made it's predecessor great down into mediocre banality.  Where computer skill would allow you to sift through people's personal emails in it's predecessor, learning important information, here you only need click on the computer with a hologram of a rotating letter above it - an insulting symptom of dumbing down of the core game mechanics into big signs that the dumbest of people can see, understand and use.  \n\nIn fact, gone are the experience points and skill leveling of the first game entirely.  Instead, the only leveling to be done is by biomod cannisters which add and improve abilities (strength, stealth, hacking, etc.) but is so uninteresting and rote in it's implementation that I wish it didn't even bother.  Any \"skill\" you choose to apply in excludes some others from consideration, but they max out at 3 cannisters each, leading you with a load of unusable biomod cannisters at the end of the game.  Unless you choose to experiment with another \"skill\" which you won't, because most of them kinda suck anyway.  \n\nWeapon modification is worse, because you can only add 2 mods to any weapon and some weapons can't be modded at all, so again, you'll have plenty of weapon mods you can't use.  It's almost pathetically comical that characters give you biomods and weapon mods as rewards in the last several hours of game when you've already settled into the biomod \"skills\" and weaponry of choice and have modded them all out already.\n\nThe story is mostly a rehash with some of the same characters returning for what amounts to the same end game:  control of a technology for world domination, or freedom, depending on your point of view.  The character conversations are sometimes so insipid I just skipped through them, and most of the choices involve either a \"yes\" or \"no\" style answer which has no impact on the actual story, because at the end of the game the ending you get is determined, literally, by which button you decide to press. \n\n I just played through it a second time, completely forgetting I had played through it previously, because the visual tone of the game is so bland, and the endings so bad.  It's 90% values of blue and gray.  Beginning of the game you're in a lab, then you're in a city, then you're in another city, and more labs, and another city, at some point you'll be in antartica and at another on Liberty Island (also looking like antartica).  The palate in this game is severely lacking.  And the 4 different endings are all kind of distasteful. \n\nThis game also had performance issues on every system I've ever played it on, except the Xbox.  Certain areas would have profound, inexplicable slowdown.  I've had similar performance issues with Thief 3, which was developed by the same peeps using the same Unreal engine,...  my guess is they optimized the engine for the Xbox at the expense of the PC versions.

It is a great underated gem. Did it level up to the hype? No to most. To me, i love the game despite its flaws. I can hear the fans yelling at me about that. \n\nI will give a basic opening to the story for you: \"Deus Ex Invisible War is set 20 years after Deus Ex, and is about the actions of JC Denton in the first game, (using a combination of all three endings from the first game) and how they caused the world to go into a state of war and \"economic depression\". It is known as THE COLLAPSE. Many factions then became into power, including the WTO and THE ORDER. Chicago gets attacked at the beginning of the game, and that is where you, Alex D, and your friend Billie Adams and others get evacuated to another Tarsus place. That gets attacked too, and you begin by doing side quests and must choose which faction you want to go with. \n\nLet me start with my personal favourite things about this great piece of gaming:\n- The graphics are great. Even by todays standards. It has aged well. (Made in 2004, it looks better than games released today)\n- The characters are fine. Not amazing, but ok. \n- THE BIOMODS! The Biomods are great. They add special abilities to the player for a mild amount of time, such as Cloaking, Increased Walk/jump speed, Increased strength, just to name a  few. \n- The menu's. Something small, but i like them.\n- The  weapons are simple and good, and there is several new weapons. \n- I always love craking something open or taking over something with my trusty Multitools. \n- Many more little tiny things. \n\nNow the bad. \n- The ai is basic, not bad but somewhat mediocre. \n- Some characters are bland, the order asian chick is my prime example. \n- the biomods are somewhat simpler to the first game. \n- Very minor technical hiccups. \n-  THE LOADING TIMES. THEY ARE BAD, THAT IS PROBABLY THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS. THEY ARE NOT INSANE, BUT THEY ARE BAD. \n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nI freakin' love this game. I look past it's supposed 'SHI*TYNESS'. Back at its release it recieved good reviews, but today everyone hates it. I love it, quite a bit, it's Well worth the price if you like RPG / FPS / Story driven obscure gems. \n\nScarcey Out.", "timestamp_created": 1401003733, "timestamp_updated": 1476692921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458970814943313599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10227190": {"recommendationid": "10227190", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043544855", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1533868236}, "language": "english", "review": "This game should be reported for false advertising.

I have to disagree with most of the negative feelings toward this title, because a \"bad\" connotation or \"worst in the series\" designation to a Deus Ex game still makes for a really great experience. Why? The vastly improved physics certainly don't hurt. That's fun in its own right. Most of the worst reviews I've ever seen lobbed at this sequel come from long-time fans of the original game, and if I had to choose my own least favorite difference between the two, honestly, it is the loss of the corner-leaning function that felt so good in the first; but to me, that is one of the few reductions where many other gameplay elements are definitely improved upon and streamlined. I know that can be a bad word in gaming. Streamlined can easily mean less. Here, it applies. \n\nOne of the most common critiques I've heard, from professional critics and caring fans alike, has to do with Invisible War's level design. This seems hollow, I think, given the way this refers almost exclusively to size and wide-open feeling areas. In fact, the generally smaller levels of this sequel are far more efficient in their use of space -- something that seems to help it run better, actually, apart from some crashing which might be rooted in the series' early, unlucky business choices over bad drivers/graphics support for their engine -- you will quickly find so many tasks to complete that your head will be spinning, each with multiple choices, outcomes, and courses to get there. If you play many angles and think on your feet, trying to outwit what only ~seem~ like restraints on the surface, you will not only feel like an absolute bada$$ very early in the game, but be gratified at what you can do with some good creative planning. This is very much in keeping with the spirit of the Deus Ex name, the first mission areas alone having as many or more different paths to victory as any level in the original (if you only look hard enough), with all the cleverness and depth of story and world as every competent fan has come to expect. It doesn't always look or sound pretty, but in plenty of moments remains reasonably passable. Indeed, the beauty of this one, a learning experience in terms of its basic design aspects, are the ways in which your decisions invariably tie together in an emergent fashion. The greatest showcase of its true depth is probably best explained by pointing out how no two walkthroughs for it seem to contain all of the same information, each being subtly different and personal with an active community of explorers necessary to continually discover new things. You might find something new and unexpected, too. I feel like I do each time I play Invisible War, no different than the original, no less than any other standard of the series. \n\nHeck, to provide one non-spoiling testimony, even the most obscure details such as the names of coffee chains they included as a side-plot/metaphorical example to hint at the greater whole of this mystery, are remarkably witty little nods to our every day real life... though they seem almost laughably dumb if you don't know, I realize, that's exactly the point -- the whole story highlights how ignorance can be taken advantage of and manipulated from above, after all... Pequod and Queequeg were two principle characters in Melville's \"MobyDick,\" and the name of the ship's first mate in that old, famous story just happened to be \"Starbuck.\" See the connection? Did you ever realize? It takes digging, sometimes. This game, like the whole series, is overflowing with little details of that sort, the creators working well with whatever they had at hand, and is no less rooted in literature, history, or the greatest schools of philosophical thought than its counterparts. If you are an avid reader, especially of classics, this will be a fun game for you -- as would any Deus Ex game. It is a title that means your brain will be taxed, you'll go to bed either dreaming about your experiences or lying restlessly awake over its implications, and left saying, \"wow,\" at every new twist. Yes, this one seems smaller, and yes, this might be the easiest of the series if you already have a grasp of how to play from the first, but there is a ton of detail within this title which can turn out to be just as rewarding as any other to carry that glorious logo. It's great.

Not only is the game - by far - not finished, it's almost completely broken. I mean, practically everything that made the first Deus Ex good has disappeared.\n\nThe large open levels from the first game were replaced with small, closed levels. A walk from one level-change door to the next takes less than a minute on all levels in the whole game! The only thing that prolongs them are conversations and enemies, of which you can either skip or run past. While load times has been reduced due to the advancement of computers overall, they were a real pain when DXIW was first released.\n\nThe story, and/or the world, has been transformed from the cyberpunk future of the previous game to some kind of anachronistic sci-fi future. Explanations are almost nonexistant. For instance, in 20 years since the Collapse (i.e. the end of the previous game), somehow, a weapons manufacturer managed to completely take over the global market AND develop universal ammo for all those weapons. Yet, airports do not exist or have been transformed to garbage dumps, people have stopped driving cars (or bicycles, or any other vehicle except helicopters). How was this possible?\n\nThe story isn't all that bad, but the smallness of the game makes it too big. There simply isn't room enough for exploration or any meaningful sidequests. The choices you make are also pointless, since loyalty is changed back and forth at the slightest wrongdoing, and, as another reviewer said, the missions you get are practically all \"kill this person or let it live\". \n\nThe character you play, as well as the game's NPCs, are almost all irritating fools. The voice acting is ridiculous, and the only two characters I liked were JC Denton and Luminon Saman, them also being the only two characters in the game who have anything interesting to say. The player, Alex D., have been made into an idiot, because it seems that he/she accepts anything another character tells him/her. Now, I know this was due to saving space to crunsh it inside an old X-Box console, but at least let the player read a datacube (which can store documents and so on). Parallell this with JC Denton's skepticism in the first game.\n\nGame mechanics are almost completely broken. Characters have to spin their whole body to face you straight on when they talk - even in a conversation between three people, and for EVERY new sentence. Something seems to be wrong with their eyes, because many NPCs look like they're on drugs. Combat is the only way forward. Want to sneak past an enemy or stun him in the back, like the previous game? Forget it. Get the \"silent running\" biomod if you want any sneaking, otherwise they will hear you miles away. Besides, where are you going to sneak about? The levels are too small for any kind of \"Thiefing\" around. Civilians become enemies without you ever touching them, even though they don't attack, but still. Why wasn't this refined for final release?\n\nSkill points are gone, and so are the choices of augmentations. Now there are biomods, and they are everywhere. You can also swap biomods at any point in the game, so it's not like your choice really matters. Besides, about halfway through the game, you have to use rocket launchers, sniper rifles or energy weapons to get anywhere, or you won't stand a chance against the enemy.\n\nMiss the techo-esque music from the first game? Too bad, it's now replaced with ambience. Some band, represented by NG Resonanse, also made it to the game, but they failed after like five songs (I think they were called \"Three Faced\" or some such). Now, I have no quarrel with ambience, or especially ambient game music (just listen to Fallout 1 & 2 soundtracks, for instance, or Mass Effect soundtracks). But imagine The Elder Scrolls soundtrack being replaced with, say, Viking rock or death metal, playing constantly? Not very moody.\n\nSo, is it all that bad? Well, the game is certainly playable. The graphics are pretty neat, but that can't be a \"positive\" aspect of the game, because games do evolve. New engines are developed. It comes \"naturally\" if you will. It's just like aging, it happens, people grow up, get jobs, whatever. Of course it will have better graphics. The funny thing is, would it be better if they had reused the Unreal 1 graphical engine? I think yes. It would certainly fit more content. It would be \"ugly\", but hey, Wasteland 1 is \"ugly\". Fallout 1 & 2 are \"ugly\". System Shock 2, the Thief series. That doesn't mean they are bad games.\n\nIn any case, get Deus Ex: Human Revolution instead. While it is a prequel, it is a good one in my opinion. Is Invisible War the worst game ever created? Of course not. But it certainly is not anything like the first game, or even close to the prequel.\n\nOh, wait, there is one good thing about this game - how to not make a sequel. Game developers should definitely try this game then, after playing the first one. The sad thing is that if they had just waited for a couple more years, just until X-Box 360, this game could probably have been better.\n\nSo; not recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1396795998, "timestamp_updated": 1396795998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9709643": {"recommendationid": "9709643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013026902", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1401151542}, "language": "english", "review": "With the exception of Deus Ex: The Fall, the Deus Ex games are, quite possibly, some of the greatest video games ever made.

I picked up the Three-Bundle of Deus Ex games during a sale last winter, and after completing and fully enjoying DE:HR, I thought I'd move over to the the original Deus Ex: Game of the Year Edition. Needless to say, it was fantastic, and my enjoyment of the series increased further.\n\nThen Deus Ex: Invisible War.\n\nI'd heard reviews, from YouTubers mainly, but from non-IGN sites as well (gotta keep it reeeel).

Luckily, I was well aware of how to change affinity, and this was not a hard fix.\n\nBut again, the game hung, and my mouse froze, effectively forcing me to force quit the entire game.\n\nWhile DE2.exe can be changed, it is Ion Launcher.exe that destroys my ability to play.

However, unfortunately, this game was the first game of its kind to bring this kind of frustration forth. I'm going to uninstall DE2, and I'm gonna push it to the furthest corner of my library.

Many fans of the original game were quick to slam this game on release for being a \"dumbed down\" mess built for the console gamers.\n\nLike its predecessor, Deus Ex 2 is a First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game with stealth elements. Set twenty years after the events of Deus Ex, you play the role of Alex D, a student at Tarsus Academy. After being rescued from a terrorist attack that destroyed the entire city of Chicago, you are woken in your room by an assault on the Tarsus Academy facility in which you live. From there, the plot thickens as you are thrown into a world of corporate, government and ancient global conspiracies.\n\nWriting a sequel for Deus Ex would always be a difficult task because the first Deus Ex has multiple endings depending on how the player wanted to complete the game. All the endings were radically different and so, for Deus Ex 2, they chose to set the game around a mixture of two of Deus Ex's endings, which might not make logical sense given the nature of those two particular endings which I won't spoil here.\n\nJust like the previous Deus Ex, from start to finish, you have multiple ways to deal with any given situation and depending on what you do, the game will adapt accordingly. People will react to how you behave and can affect the course of the game and the only way you can Game Over is if you die.\n\nThe game even offers a bit more flexibility with regards to factions over the previous game. Deus Ex had a few moments where some characters, even though they might have been killable later in the story, would be essentially invincible until their moment of demise arrives. Some might argue that this was necessary to keep the plot going but in Deus Ex 2, everyone is killable as soon as you meet them and the game can adapt with no problems. This is one of the moments in which Deus Ex 2 has an advantage over its predecessor, albeit a very small one.\n\nThe story is also very good. It is not as paranoid or as quirky as the first Deus Ex and in some places, especially at the beginning, it feels slightly rushed and not enough things feel very well explained. All becomes clear in time however and putting the pieces together is just as good as it ever was.\n\nThe game also has a very sci-fi feel to it. The art and sound design, devices you use and the omnipresent blue lighting all make the game feel as if its set further into the future than it probably intended to feel.\n\nBeing made for the Xbox as well as PC, Deus Ex 2 has a few differences in terms of its inventory and its level design. Gone is the intricate inventory management of the first game. Instead, it was been replaced with six simple slots. Each slot can store one object or a group of objects stacked which means that three packets of Soy food take up exactly the same amount of space in your inventory as a Rocket Launcher. Some items such as energy cells and multi-tools also have a problem stacking correctly and there is no way to stack them manually.\n\nThe level design also has undergone a huge change. Whilst the levels in the first Deus Ex were large but void of much detail, the levels in Deus Ex 2, whilst having dynamic lighting and were nicely detailed for a 2003 game, are extremely small in size. The modified Unreal engine they used for the game is butchered beyond belief. You will find yourself bumping into loading zones around every fifth corner. This probably has something to do with the game designed for the Xbox and its measly 64MB of RAM.\n\nThe skill system that was present in the first game has been completely removed and the augmentation system has been replaced with a more streamlined system where you can choose one of three potential upgrades for specific areas of the body. You can upgrade the ability three times or, if you no longer want that particular ability, replace it with another of your choosing, though you'll have to find the Biomod canisters to start and advance your newly chosen skill.\n\nAnd then there's the Universal Ammo system which is, depending in your point of view, the worst or an interesting aspect of the game. All the guns in the game use the same kind of ammunition simply known as Universal Ammo. Different guns use up a different amount of universal ammo per shot so, for example, the pistol will use a small amount of universal ammo whereas the sniper rifle will use up a bigger amount. Weapons can be modified to use less ammo, destroy glass without setting off alarms attached to them and more.\n\nFor all its small faults and bugs, Deus Ex 2 is a well made game and is head and shoulders above what was on store shelves around the time of its release. It's not a bad game and as long as you go into it not expecting it to be exactly like the first Deus Ex, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1394139605, "timestamp_updated": 1394139605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487191617488861084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9325237": {"recommendationid": "9325237", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998529661", "num_games_owned": 1656, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2098, "last_played": 1393878915}, "language": "english", "review": "The second part of the franchise came to us through the same creative team that developed the first part.

It was a 67 at best when it was brand new; it's aged badly since then. It suffers badly from having been designed for the memory and control constraints of the original X-Box. The levels are cramped and ugly. The field of view is far too tight (and requires using a hex editor to manually edit memory values in the executable to change to something tolerable). The guns are forgettable (with the exception of the gun mod that makes glass windows dissolve instead of shatter, that was mildly amusing) and all draw from the same universal ammo pool. Worst of all the main story is plain old tripe that not only does not hold up well to scrutiny but which commits the sin of trivializing the first game's ending by declaring that all three mutually exclusive endings in Deus Ex 1 happened simultaneously. By watering down and blending three very distinct and different endings they weakened and cheapened the story space for both Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex: Invisible War.\n\nThe three main factions in the game, the Templars (hypocrtical neo-Luddities in power armor), the Illuminati (representing capitalist concerns), and the Dentons (who are trying to properly finish the Helios ending from Deus Ex 1) are all easy to hate. By the middle of the game I was annoyed with all of them.

Although the sequel has become popular in nearly all forms of media, gaming is clearly one arena where its reigned supreme. In 2013, only 6 of the top 100 best selling games were entirely original works. Even critics in 2013 showed a preference towards established properties with only five original games scoring over 90 on MetaCritic. As such, there\u2019s a great deal of pressure on developers to match, if not exceed, their previous work, and when a game\u2019s considered a masterpiece, the expectations are magnified even further.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s no wonder that a game like Deus Ex: Invisible War has been so reviled by fans of the initial game, and many of the complaints are difficult to refute. Deus Ex has become one of my personal favorite games, and after having spent some time with War, I must concur with the majority that the first installment is a more complex and smarter game with vastly greater possibilities, but that\u2019s not to say that this sequel has no charms or is inferior to most.\n\nThe most marked change to the game\u2019s core play is the removal of the skills system, which had allowed gamers to customize their play style in drastic ways, giving the cyberpunk shooter a distinct RPG flavor. Invisible War still contains RPG elements, primarily in the dialogue options and in the inclusion of Biomod super powers, but even these seem less malleable than before. Thus it plays in a much more straightforward way. There usually are still several ways to get through an area, but there are fewer times in which creativity is profitable.\n\nLevel design philosophy has also shifted in major ways. The areas the player explores are significantly smaller and more straightforward, which results in a much greater amount of loading screens. This design choice was obviously made to make the console porting process smooth, but for what it\u2019s worth, they cram an awful lot into these areas. In the first game, the areas may have been large, but some of them were mostly empty. The reverse is true in Invisible War with almost none of the filler, inaccessible background areas that plagued the cities we explored in Deus Ex.\n\nWhether this is a welcome change or not could be debated, because it does make it easier to find relevant destinations and exploration was a major draw of the first game, but were this an entirely new game, I would likely think nothing of this decision, and the same could be said for many of the games \u2018flaws.\u2019 Take the oft-criticized universal ammo approach. While the ammo can be used in any weapon, each weapon uses a different amount of ammo. I found myself favoring the sniper rifle for it\u2019s accuracy and power, but this came at the cost of conservation, especially later in the game. Though most of the enemies drop ammunition, their clips do not cover the cost of a sniper shot, adding a strategic element that was lacking in the first game with its plentiful resources. Along with this the player has a smaller inventory, making management essential, serving as a stark counter to the comically large selection of weapons a player could carry in the first.\n\nBesides these controversial elements, the game is a major improvement in several areas. Even on release, Deus Ex was criticized for its bland art design and blocky textures, and the years have not done it a favor. Some of this blandness may have been to emphasize the destitute state of the poor, but that could also be a convenient excuse. Invisible War, however, has a vibrancy to it and is fairly detailed in spite of its age of over a decade. The difference in graphics becomes especially noticeable when comparing objects that appear in both games, such as the repair bot, which sports greater detail here but is instantly recognizable. The backgrounds are also better, effectively nailing the dystopian future.\n\nIt\u2019s the storytelling where the game really excels over its predecessor, though. The first game had plenty of interesting political and philosophical ideas, but since it was a longer game, the plot could get rather convoluted. It also featured rather poor dialogue and voice acting, although it could be humorous at times and sometimes even intentionally so. Though this game lacks some of those campy bits of fun, the writing feels a lot more professional and the story is concise enough that every section feels important, and it does this without losing the core debate between utility and freedom that was waged in the first game. The voice acting also has been given a boost. A few of the foreign accents are just as bad as in the first game, but the principle cast has been improved with a few small cameos from the first game thrown in for good measure.\n\nAlong with these upgrades, the approach towards female characters is also laudable, particularly for its time. The first Deus Ex was smart, but it was a game dominated by men with most of the female characters playing in menial, background roles such as secretaries and receptions or in less flattering positions like hostage and muggee. Here, there seems to have been a very conscious decision to level the playing field. Besides letting you choose the protagonist Alex D\u2019s race and gender, there are plenty of female enemies, and the majority of the figures that you encounter through the game from the pop star NG Resonance to your teacher Dr. Nassif to your classmates Billie and Klara to a potential pilot are women, and all of these figures are powerful in some ways or other. Although this sort of thing is much more common these days, it wasn\u2019t the case in 2003, and I would bet that the game\u2019s clear feminism has not received its due praise.\n\nWhether Deus Ex Invisible War is a good sequel is hard to say. It loses some of the things that made the first game such a joy to play and doesn\u2019t necessarily subtract for the sake of its strengths. When looking at the sequel to such a popular game, though, the more pertinent question might be whether it is simply a good game or not, and to that the answer is a definite yes. It may streamline much of what made its predecessor good to such an extent that it becomes barely recognizable, but after all, when it comes to a sequel, who really needs or wants a carbon copy? Invisible War makes a number of bold changes that don\u2019t always pay off, but it\u2019s a must play for fans of Action RPGs and 1st Person Shooters.", "timestamp_created": 1392646662, "timestamp_updated": 1392646662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547136962413787842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9133581": {"recommendationid": "9133581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000177663", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 133, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1450735781}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish this game was invisible.", "timestamp_created": 1392528684, "timestamp_updated": 1451649257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9040305": {"recommendationid": "9040305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044948020", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1391892318}, "language": "english", "review": "not deus ex", "timestamp_created": 1392006886, "timestamp_updated": 1392006886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436021864414215088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9020918": {"recommendationid": "9020918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018411659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "What i like about this game was the rpg element.

If you absolutely loved the story of Deus Ex, then this game is a must play, but not until half-way through when it really starts getting good. \nThat Deus Ex: Invisible War is an inferior sequel has been stated by many people before me. The interface has been streamlined to the point of ridiculousness. My favorite part of Deus Ex was that you actually felt like a hacker. The keypads and terminals had an interface where you actually typed in the numbers and logons. You felt cool. This one does it automatically.\nThe game is much shorter, which normally would be a knock, but considering the circumstances under which I played it, it was it's greatest asset.\nLet me explain. I never played it in 2003, but today, it is absolutely broken. The areas are small, which often force you onto the loading screen. The loading screen is a nightmare. I looked up every fix available, but none of them worked. Let me explain the situation (this will sound crazy, and unless you really care about the story, like I did, you will probably quit playing). The game freezes on every loading screen, without fail. Every loading screen, you must ctrl alt del and end the non responsive program. After about 1 minute or 2, the game pops up again without being prompted and will load normally. The areas are cramped, so there are a lot of loading screens, and every time you die, it goes back to the title screen, so you have to do this process again. Because I was so invested in the goings on, I developed a system. Every time the game loads, I would do homework until it popped up again. When the difficulty ramped up near the end, I edited the .ini file to make me invincible. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm hardcore. I can beat most games without cheats. I did it for my sanity.\nAnother problem with this system is that it doesn't track my playtime on Steam. The game is about 10 hours long, but Steam only shows me as having played an hour. That time is only the amount of time I waited for the game to load before I figured out how to play it.\nSo, the gameplay is weaker, the interface is terrible, and it's broken beyond belief. Why do I recommend it, then? Because, especially near the end, the story is fascinating and a great continuation of the plot of Deus Ex. I put up with the madness because I could not wait for what happened next. \nSo, if you are fully immersed in the universe and are able to put up with everything else, I recommend this game.

Its followup, released in 2003, received generally positive reviews from publications, although the general consensus was \"It falls short of the original.\" However, the fans overwhelmingly hated it, even refusing to think of it as a true Deus Ex game. Was it a case of inflated expectations or overzealous fanboys?\nIn my opinion, Invisible War is not as bad as its reputation, but the fans still have a point.\n\nThe first problem is it was designed from day one as a console title with mass appeal and simplification in mind. The skills system is gone, every item occupies one space in the inventory and all weapons accept a universal ammo type. That's a big problem because in the final levels, most enemies can be defeated only with heavy weapons, which drain ammo fast, and when you're out, you can't even switch to a standby. Oh, and did I mention there's no way to non-lethally pacify one particular enemy? The weapon mods are no longer a modular increase of stats, but singular installations that have a strategic use like breaking glass silently or dealing EMP damage. The boltcaster replaces the old crossbow, the stun prod makes a return and the baton is also non-lethal and several grenade types are also added to aid the player. The fairly rare noisemaker draws enemies wherever it lands and the flashbomb (you guessed it) blinds enemies for a few seconds. In addition, the gas grenade returns and the LAM (in the form of concussion grenades), the scrambler and the spiderbomb grenade, which spawns an allied spiderbot.\n\nThe levels are much smaller compared to the first game, almost claustrophobic and unsettlingly empty, yet they're even more confusing to navigate. Different areas are broken up by frequent, lengthy loading screens that not-so-subtly re-launch the application, which of course breaks the immersion like Hell. Just getting around can also be a pain because of the physics. For example, jumping on a create is a feat in patience and luck because although the physics are mostly sound, the weight of objects is severely flawed; The slightest bump sends even the massive, unliftable crates flying across the room like they were made of styrofoam.\n\nThe graphics still... technically hold up today. Being designed for the XBox, the engine utilizes dynamic light and shadow, bloom, ambient occlusion, facial animation and more, but aesthetically it's a different story. The world feels very \"Jetsons-ish\" for lack of a better word, everything covered in neon blue lights. The NPCs have been upgraded from a graphical standpoint, but still stand and animate like the first game, and some of the facial animation is just... Well, some NPCs look like they're perpetually surprised. Installing the unified texture pack massively improves the visual appeal, adding HD textures to almost everything and even toning down the cosmic horror of the facial animations.\n\nThe AI is still dim and will ignore you even in plain sight if you're about 20 feet away. You can pick away at them from behind cover and they may never confront you, watch their friends get blown up in their face and still wander aimlessly and when you're cloaked, they continue walking right into you without attacking. But they can still provide a challenge in numbers, especially the biohazard-spewing greasels and big, dumb, lumbering karkians. On several occasions, my maxed-out see-through-walls aug didn't detect them (yet another flaw) and I waltzed right up to one, getting the **** scared out of me.\n\nThe voice acting is, well... The major characters sound alright, but some of the NPCs just sound awful. Some of the sounds (especially the weapons) can be grating, but others are... kind of nice? The music is appropriately futuristic and retains the aesthetic from the first game, but is much less noticable and eargasmic, less memorable themes than ambient background music to put on before bed. That seems to be the way of this game: a mixed bag; some of it a ham sandwich, some of it stale vomit.\n\nThe story is the best thing about this game. Despite all its flaws, that's what kept me interested enough to keep pressing on. Without spoiling anything, you'll get wrapped up in many conspiracies (Even the coffee shops are part of one!) and be forced to take sides, which you can still switch even at the final moment of the game. That sounds like freedom, but then you realize that none of the choices you make effect the outcome of the game, beyond the last level or two and a pre-rendered end cutscene. But still, sociopolitics, government, privacy, ethics, enterprise, technology, religion, god itself ...politics, bureaucracy, mismanagement... are all discussed at some point. Two factions have a clear motivation, although others (which aren't revealed until late in the game) really don't give you a reason to carry out their bidding. Invisible War also connects with the original game through returning characters, and is set in a world still reeling from the effects of \"The Collapse\", a combination of two endgame choices the player could have made. Your role takes you through Seattle, Cairo, Trier, Antarctica, good old Liberty Island and of course, several secret bases in between, unraveling a web of deceit over which the player has the final choice. Invisible War expects the player to have finished the first game, but if you read books, listen to newscasts and talk with NPCs, it's enough to fill you in.\n\nBut Deus Ex was all about freedom-of-choice for the player, so does that still hold true? For the most part. You can play through most of the game without killing anyone (unless you side with the wrong faction) and incapacitate enemies from the shadows, or gun down everything in sight, multitool a locked door or coax a code out of NPCs. There are plenty of hacking opportunities and alternate entrances as well. The only thing I hate is being forced to do side missions for extra credits before I can travel to the next level, so take my advice: rescue Ava Johnson in Seattle; she flies you around for free! There are enough side missions to extend the game by a few hours and plenty of rewards for the explorer, such as supplies, weapon mods and rare secret weapons. You can also read plenty of datacubes and books, listen to the news terminals and talk to countless NPCs to learn more about the world you're in. But even if you complete every side mission, explore every area and talk to everyone, it's a pretty short game.\n\nAs for the technical flaws I played through the game until one of the final levels, saved and quit and when I returned, my saves were corrupted. But even though I rushed through the second time, I still felt intrigued to learn more about the story. The game crashed regularly and unpredictably as well, every 30 minutes the first playthrough and only twice the second time. And the second time was with mods!\n\nSo, is this the worst game ever? Far from it; but it is held back by design flaws and cursed by a poor PC port. Deus Ex had flaws too, but they were easily overlooked. With Invisible War, it's much harder. But does it deserve the \"Deus Ex\" name? In my opinion, yes. The story follows that familiar thread, full of conspiracies and philosophy and despite a shift toward FPS gameplay, it still manages to create that feeling of being an augmented agent, sneaking, hacking, fighting and completing the game in your own style.", "timestamp_created": 1388261675, "timestamp_updated": 1388262779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730215013027191162", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "8370650": {"recommendationid": "8370650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043999386", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1355644800}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game.\n\nAs a follow-up to Deus Ex?

Doesn't add to the plot at all either, as the other games were set before this one.\nLet's start with the Protagonist (I can't say \"Player character\" because there is absolutely no trace of character to be found in Alex D.) Nothing but a dull monotone voice and a refusal to commit to anything. \"I'll think about it\" is a catchphrase which Alex often repeats, but sadly this thought never leads to any resolution. Alex never truly expresses an opinion about anything, or takes a stand for any of the rival factions on offer.\nAfter the numbness of the main lead. the bland voice acting is another point where nobody seems willing to stand out. It's like a scene out of Equilibrium where everybody is terrified of showing some emotion, even when trying to convert you to a religion.\nThe many factions set against each other are equally apathetic. If you decide to gun their agents down for no reason and steal their stuff, or even to trash an entire building of theirs, they'll forgive you if you run a small fetch quest for them, and if you decide to slaughter them all again, they won't hold a grudge.\nAll of this combines to stifle any RPG aspects of the game. There's no role to play, and even if there were, there are no real choices by which to express that role. \nThe anti-rpg agenda is continued by the removal of skill points and even ammo types. Your crossbow takes exactly the same ammo as your rocket launcher, which results in tactical choices being minimised.\nIf all of this isn't bad enough to put you off, all the maps are ridiculously tiny, and yet still take over 90 seconds to load.

Sadly, DX: Invisible War received mostly mixed and somewhat negative reviews on this issue. At first, like most, I felt a little disappointed by the end of my first playthrough. For a game developed four years after the original, I expected some new, exciting ground to be explored and ideas for  improvement on the original. \n\nMany fans took an instant dislike to DX:IW for one, some, or all the following reasons: 1. The graphics weren't much of an improvement (and perhaps worse) than the original, 2. The maps seemed claustrophobic and clunky when compared to fantastic spacious environments featured in the original DX, 3. Combat wasn't much better (again, perhaps worse), 4. Voice dialogue for the most part fell flat, boring, without emotion and lacked credibility, equally less memorable as the characters themselves, 5.That the gameplay had been too simplified and lacked ambition, ie: loss of ammo variation, skills system dropped, no XP points, absence of lockpicks, etc, 6. That while Alex D could take on secondary missions, they turned out to be nothing more than minor distractions far too easily accomplished (amongst many things that DX: HR had got right), 7. That the game itself was too short - it could be completed in about 10 hours first playthrough, while completion of its predecessor perhaps required four times as long!\n\nBut then something pulled me back to play it again, even a third time....Certainly, if you can see past the shortcomings listed above, then you might be able to enjoy IW's more positive aspects. For example, I considered IW's weapon mods to be far more interesting than the ones in DX. I also enjoyed a couple of innovative ideas: spider-bot bombs were tremendous fun, while the health leech and bot-domination were fantastic ideas included in augmentation. Also, Alex doesn't share JC Denton's frustrating inability to climb over waist-high crates! \n\nAs the world has moved 20 years on from DX, so too has nano-augmentation: the cybernetically enhanced Omar deal in black market goods, while nanite detonaters and harmful nanite clouds lend IW an intriguing backdrop to the conspiratorial story. The Greys make a return and this time around given a more sentient role in IW's affairs.  \n\nHolograms also make a welcome return - although these are far more complex than the mere communication types featured in DX: such AI constucts styled in the image and voice of a fictitious pop star of this future, NG Resonance, are able to interact with people, even licensed to offer rewards for solving crimes (since as a precaution such holograms are connected to police databases)...not to mention report on everything said by someone suspicious. Another nice little idea. \n\nThe game music - while not quite as memorable as DX's - helped enhance the atmosphere of each mission. There were some great angles on the story itself: one particular mission meant a return to some place from DX (I don't want to spoil it for those yet to play IW!) as if everything had come full circle. It was quite a satisfying, if somewhat poignant moment. \n\nProject Leader Harvey Smith was given the chance to explain why events turned sour: DX:IW suffered a rushed development shipped with both good and bad ideas due to fan feedback mismanagement, there was little teamwork chemistry within the studio, and the need to cater for a console version confused matters even further. Not in the least he was going through a divorce. Later that same year, another big project by Ion Storm  was completed in the form of Thief: Deadly Shadows - and really that's what demanded DX director Warren Spector's attention. In hindsight, Invisible War should have been developed with a full studio complement in the same pioneering spirit as the original DX. Even if this meant waiting a couple of years for an improved engine to come along, the planning of more in-depth characters with credible dialogue, gameplay design and sharper mechanics, intriguing secondary missions, and complex map levels. Perhaps, one day, there will be a 'remake' of Deus Ex: Invisible War...?\n\nOne last note: if you have played Deus Ex, then be prepared that Inivisible War is a somewhat different beast to its predecessor.

This was the time of a new console generationt and these swallowed a large proportion of the gaming community - and this was one of the first games the developers clearly created with console gamers in mind.\nThis meant that the user interface was oversimplified and blocked half of the view, that the game was not properly optimized for PC, that the creators had to settle for smaller level size or decreased game complexity.\nAll the above meant that in the eyes of most PC gamers DX:IW was an unbecoming second installation to its truly amazing predecessor.\n\nI played it through then halfheartedly, and then again and again with more and more enthusiasm. Now, 10 years later I will summarize my opinion as I see this game today, sometimes in comparison with DX.\nFirst our old grievances:\n- 10 years passed, so the lack of optimization is not an issue anymore,\n- there are community packs to make it look bettter, looks good for its age,\n- smaller levels meant more loading (game settings were broken up into smaller levels) but with today's PCs this only takes a moment - also not a problem anymore,\n- hud can be customized via mods.\n\nBad that did not change (a matter of taste, for You all these can be aadvantagious):\n- still oversimplified: awkward inventory management, less augmentations, no skill system, universal ammo is stupid, less background info through holomail or newspapers, etc,\n- male protagonist looks and sounds like a member of a boy band,\n- stealth gaming style does not always work\n- no-kill approach does not work (in DX it was only one person You really had to kill to advance in the story)\n\nGood that will remain good til the end of times (some of these I have learnt to appreciate only on my subsequent walkthroughs):\n- somehow the writer(s) managed to incorporate all three DX game endings into the sequel, so whichever ending You are familiar with, You will easily find Your bearings and understand the premise,\n- sidequests are fun and inspired,\n- new augs (though fewer) are fun to use,\n- similarly the new weapon mods are useful and fun,\n- great level design means that most of the time You still can choose between covert or guns-blazing approach,\n- one of the best intros of its time,\n- great NPC additions like the OMAR or NG Resonance,\n- amazing places to visit like Antarctica, Trier or Cairo (including an arcology building which looks good and feels right)\n\nAll in all in my eyes funnily enough with age the game got better. It might feel disappointing after playing DX (or liberating, if You like less complexity), but a great game on its own right.

In practical, historical terms, that\u2019s about as good as it gets.\u201d[/i]\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing all that cool about cyberpunk visions of the future. They are dystopian nightmares of relentless technological progress at the expense of the human condition and the accumulation of vast wealth by a small, unaccountable few as billions live in squalor. It\u2019s hell, and we can say that with even greater confidence than the genre\u2019s pioneers: we\u2019re living it [i]now[/i].\n\nThe continued fascination with the genre is largely aesthetic, I guess; CDPR literally just made a game around the very [i]idea[/i] of the genre, drawing on the visual palettes of defining cyberpunk hallmarks throughout film and literature. But lighting the path to hell in attractive neon pinks and blues doesn\u2019t make it any less shitty, and it\u2019s time writers and creators started envisioning new futures instead of replicating old ones that have already transitioned into our dire present.\n\nBesides, gaming\u2019s own cyberpunk masterpiece was released in 2000. A paranoid melting pot of conspiracy theories, Ion Storm\u2019s [i]Deus Ex[/i] understood the dystopian roots of the cyberpunk genre, telling a story of institutions, government and otherwise, that failed to fulfil their basic pledges to the people they were meant to serve\u2014and the devastating consequences that ensued.\n\nAs a hypothetical future it was, and remains, remarkably prescient. And in its depiction of widespread and crippling inequality amidst a lethal plague, its echoes of our present moment are more than a little chilling.\n\nIt was followed a few years later by [i]Deus Ex: Invisible War[/i], which, as I\u2019m sure everyone reading this knows, was somewhat controversial for being seen as a considerably inferior experience to the original game. I think that\u2019s absolutely true, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s an important detail any more.\n\n[i]Invisible War[/i] is what it is.\n\nMy hope is that people reading this don\u2019t just roll their eyes when they read what I'm about to say, because I\u2019m not aiming to forward a deliberately contrarian viewpoint\u2014it\u2019s just how I see it. [i]Invisible War[/i], then, is the best [i]Deus Ex[/i] game after the original. And not by a small margin, either. [i]Human Revolution[/i] was a fantastic game, and taken on objective merits a slicker, top-shelf product compared to [i]Deus Ex\u2019s[/i] first (and, well, only) sequel.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think the defiantly cyberpunk [i]Human Revolution[/i] is a very interesting game, nor do I think it pulses with the spirit of the series\u2014and [i]Invisible War[/i] is and does.\n\nThe general consensus is fortified against this stance. Even some of [i]Invisible War's[/i] own developers now disregard its existence. \u2018Invisible Bore,\u2019 sneers one friend. \u2018In this house we love and appreciate the [i]Deus Ex[/i] games that are not Invisible War,\u2019 mocks another. Bad friends both, and a reminder that, really, it\u2019s not worth having friends at all.\n\n[i]Invisible War[/i] is set twenty years after the events of [i]Deus Ex[/i], which culminated in JC Denton merging with the Helios AI as he destroyed both Bob Page and Area 51, severing global communications and triggering an event known as the \u2018Collapse\u2019.\n\nThe post-Collapse world of [i]Invisible War[/i] bears plenty hallmarks of its cyberpunk past, but this is a science-fiction game first and foremost. This distinction might be the most important qualifier for [i]Invisible War's[/i] worthiness as a successor to [i]Deus Ex[/i]. It\u2019s something a lot of fans reacted negatively to, and I\u2019ve read some of its developers argue that the fans are right: the game strayed too far from the world of [i]Deus Ex[/i] (i.e, cyberpunk).\n\nYeah, it did\u2014but for the best possible reasons. It envisioned a new future, with its own stresses and anxieties, born out of the world [i]Deus Ex[/i] inhabited. It moved forward and the result, I think, is pretty fascinating.\n\nThis future is a weird and frightening place in which humanity is at last rising from the ashes of a shocking dark age, and where competing factions are at war over what shape the ultimate form this rising humanity will take.\n\nThe two factions central to this struggle are the WTO, led by former political revolutionary Chad Dumier, and the Order, a religious organisation which aims to subsume all faiths under the guidance of the mysterious \u2018Her Holiness\u2019. One speaks to the need for economic and political centralisation to enshrine human freedom, the other to the spiritual needs of the individual whilst espousing a collective movement away from industry and towards nature.\n\nBoth are seeing their power undermined by the reemergence of nanotechnology and its radical impact on the human body.\n\nThe technology that gave birth to the Denton brothers, and which Bob Page utilised in his failed attempt at world domination, is starting to flourish in new and unprecedented ways. It has inadvertently allowed the Templars to emerge\u2014a group of fanatics who seek to \u2018purify\u2019 the planet, namely by committing genocide against the biomodified.\n\nAt its heart, [i]Invisible War's[/i] narrative\u2014which is really fucking good, actually\u2014speaks to a shocking lack of imagination and political courage on the part of some of its key players\u2014and the terrifying power of bigotry to swell in number when enough people are left to fend for themselves in darkness.\n\nIs all of this to say that [i]Invisible War[/i] is some forgotten masterpiece? Absolutely not. It is a game hobbled by technical limitations, leading to tiny, often sparse levels that rely heavily on a few small flourishes to work.\n\nLike [i]Thief: Deadly Shadows[/i], which was released around the same time and built on the same engine, it comes with the ability for players to ally themselves with individual factions. This could\u2019ve been interesting, but the game undercuts its own efforts at every opportunity, as you can never really fall afoul of anyone. Ignored the WTO\u2019s instructions and assassinated a scientist at the Order\u2019s behest? It\u2019s okay, they\u2019ll still have another task for you.\n\nI would also question the logic of choice-based loyalty when the game features a clear-cut villain in the Templars and their leader, Luminon Saman. No matter how many times they try to kill you\u2014and oh, they will\u2014Saman still solicits your aid. It\u2019s all a bit laughable.\n\nAnd yet the game works.\n\nI think its tiny levels have an ambience all of their own, even when the engine can\u2019t be relied upon to faithfully depict its larger ideas, like Seattle having a city on top of a city, or a colossal arcology in Cairo. It\u2019s all still there in the details, partially lost in the mist of unrealised ambitions, but I can still reach out and touch it\u2014the idea that [i]Invisible War[/i] is something awful is just not true.\n\nThe gameplay has been streamlined since [i]Deus Ex[/i] and arguably for the better. Its menus, whilst simplistic, are far easier to navigate. Your nanotech upgrades have similarly been reworked, becoming \u2018biomods\u2019 that you can install throughout the game to improve your abilities. They\u2019re better deployed here than in [i]Deus Ex[/i], although the balance is poor: you will end up with a massive surplus come the end. Combat is also improved, but given it was atrocious in [i]Deus Ex[/i] I\u2019m not inclined to award it too much praise.\n\n[i]Invisible War[/i] deserves your time. If it can\u2019t keep it, that\u2019s fair enough, but give it a chance. It\u2019s well-written and thoughtful with a science-fiction world more interesting than many give it credit for.\n\nIt also has a notable sense of fun about it. In the Cairo arcology you will find a recruiting booth for the Templars. That\u2019s the [i]Knights[/i] Templars. A recruiting booth. It\u2019s eminently silly\u2026\n\n...but if you think it\u2019s [i]too[/i] silly, you probably haven't been paying attention to our own insane, dystopian present.", "timestamp_created": 1367846340, "timestamp_updated": 1608040324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551229417324066162", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "3585516": {"recommendationid": "3585516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025015311", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13, "last_played": 1393813974}, "language": "english", "review": "I **** better games than this", "timestamp_created": 1367763442, "timestamp_updated": 1393540760, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "1479589": {"recommendationid": "1479589", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993626713", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1648539582}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm so happy that I went back and played Invisible War again after so many years.

What I mean by that, is that Invisible War delivers an excellent plot with multiple endings and engrossing moral choices; often comical side missions, that stay well within the realms of possibility, leading to increased immersion while giving the player a little change-up from the main \"Spy-spy-genocide-jihad\" storyline - interestingly, something Human Revolution fails to do and is less of a game for it; and the abilty to access it all playing whichever way you want.

Dynamics shifted towards more action. But in ME  those changes made the core gameplay more fun and exciting. It was about less busywork, not oversimplification.
