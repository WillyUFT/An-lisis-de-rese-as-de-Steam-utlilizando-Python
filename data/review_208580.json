All of these things will probably happen. \n\nIn contrast to that; the game has cool cut scenes, stellar voice acting, a story and dialogue that are at times super engaging.

Its nuanced writing and dense shades of grey philosophy are leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor (which was well written mind you.) KOTOR 1 felt like a traditional over the top, swashbuckling, good vs evil kind of Star Wars tale (very much in line with the OT) whereas this one is a deconstruction of regular Star Wars stuff. Your protagonist (Meetra Surik) without spoiling is so many different things to so many different people.

It questions and critiques age-old tropes of the series like the hypocrisy and fallibility of the Jedi and the very fabric of the Force itself. \n\nThough it may sound counter-intuitive, the secret to this game's genius is the fact that it was written by legendary games writer Chris Avellone (Planescaper- Torment, Fallout: New Vegas), who, when tasked with writing KOTOR II, was admittedly not a huge fan of the IP. There's been a lot of this happening lately where Hollywood hires people who clearly have disdain for the very franchise they've been tapped to helm, with disastrous results. In Avellone's case, however, his outsider perspecctive, mixed with some very serious research into every piece of Star Wars media under the sun, and (surprise) his writing ability all lent themselves to making this one of the greatest, most simultaneously critical and loving Star Wars stories ever told, which is certainly in the top tier of the EU and wipes the floor with anything released since Lucas sold the property. \n\nIf you ever dreamt of there being a successful and mature deconstruction of Star Wars that did so without showing any hatred or mockery for its own audience, but instead a great amount of faith in them to follow along and grasp themes far darker and more complex than any of the films, including thoise by Lucas, well, what are you waiting for? Ignore the fact that this was notoriously released unfinished, which was once a major issue but no longer.

This game, despite its age, still holds up better than most modern single-player story games. I prefer it over the new Jedi games, (although I haven't played survivor), and it proves exactly why the old republic is so much more interesting than the Skywalker Saga era. \n\nSPOILERS!!: While it is much shorter and obviously rushed out the door, this game honestly beats out the first in every aspect for me, those being: the villains, planet progression, characters, story twists. I feel as if I had a lot more control in this game, allowing me to build my play style a lot easier. Some critiques I have are obviously going to be the movement and camera control, something that is honestly atrocious to experience, as well as certain progression bugs, but it overall runs extremely smoothly and fluidly. \n\nNihilus has to be my favorite Star Wars character behind Maul and Galen Marek, and his ability to consume planets is so badass, as well as the fact that hes a literal wound in the force. Treya is a close fourth, as she's such a backstabber and you never REALLY expect things from her until the end, as throughout the game she's much more of a grey Jedi teacher. The ability to go total darkside and have your character on the main menu, replacing the previous sith lords is a nice touch. too. \n\nI love the planet progression, and the interaction with certain characters, as this series overall has incredible world design and dialogue, with some of it being the most quotable pieces of fiction out there.

The story itself is a hefty deconstruction of not just Star Wars, but RPGs as a whole, providing some interesting commentary through jaded lenses, which is a sharp contrast to the first game which is good old fashioned Star Wars fun.\nAs for the game's characters, I'll confess I found them to be a mixed bag, some I found interesting in one way or another... and then you had others who could've been cut from the story and you'd lose little content, and lastly I will admit while I did enjoy the story, there are still a few sticking points that I'm not sure would've been solved by giving Obsidian more time to polish the game.\n\nSo how's the gameplay? It runs on a D20 style system like the first Kotor and the Baldur's Gate Series, and is one aspect of the game that is a major step up in comparison to the first, with such benefits like a higher level cap, more powers and feats and an expanded upgrade system (That really lets you turn your whole party into a force a nature), and starting as a Jedi is also a nice plus, I do admit I couldn't help but laugh at times do to how OP I got, and the rest of the party were nothing to sneeze at either. However I must make mention that both the beginning and the end of the game (In my mind at least) do have some issues. For the beginning of the game, it just kinda drags a bit, I don't think its awful but things kick into high gear once you can travel to different planets on a whim. As for the final level, there isn't too much beyond fighting some really tough enemies (Which made me really grateful that I was so powerful, cause even a simple mistake on your part can kill you)\n\nDespite my nitpicks, the game has been a blast to play (And the restored content mod on the workshop is like extra frosting on the cake) and to be honest, I'd even recommend this game (along with Kotor I) to someone who isn't a Star Wars fan.

It is a FAR, far, far better story, characters, vibe etc. I'm a dark side enthusiast but I like it for its sheer brutality and power, not some emo goth stuff.

Waaaaaaah.\n\nIf I could go back and save the couple bucks I spent on this I probably would, I don't regret it that much and it's certainly not \"bad\" especially as an Old Republic fan. But there's constant crashing, and when I go on reddit to fix it a different crash ends up happening. And happening. And performance issues on modern hardware.*\n\nFinished the game, opinion didn't change. I can't recommend it.\n\n*EDIT: I should add, because it's been nagging at me and the fanboys are going to give me Jester awards for saying a franchise I love could've done better (thanks for the Steam points, nerds): I would give this game a neutral, \"meh\" rating if it existed on Steam.

Developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts, this game delves deeper into the moral complexities of the STAR WARS universe while refining the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor. As someone who has journeyed through this dark and philosophical RPG multiple times over the years, I'm excited to share my detailed review of KOTOR II.\n\nGameplay (9/10):\nKOTOR II maintains the exceptional gameplay of its predecessor while introducing subtle improvements. Combat feels more refined, and the addition of new Force powers and character classes expands gameplay possibilities. The game also introduces the influential \"Influence\" system, allowing your choices to influence your companions and their abilities. However, some fans might find the combat slightly unbalanced at times, particularly in the late game.\n\nCharacter Development (10/10):\nCharacter development is at the heart of KOTOR II's brilliance. The game introduces a deeper exploration of morality, with morally ambiguous choices and characters who challenge traditional notions of good and evil in the STAR WARS universe. Kreia, the enigmatic mentor, stands out as one of the most complex and thought-provoking characters in video game history. The character-driven storytelling and the influence of your choices on your companions' fates make for a compelling narrative.\n\nStorytelling (9/10):\nKOTOR II's story is a dark and philosophical exploration of the consequences of war, betrayal, and the nature of the Force. The game presents a morally grey universe where Jedi and Sith alike grapple with their beliefs and choices. The narrative is rich in detail and world-building, though it suffers somewhat from pacing issues and an incomplete ending due to time constraints during development. Fortunately, modding communities have filled in the gaps, providing players with a more satisfying conclusion.\n\nGraphics and Sound (8/10):\nThe graphics in KOTOR II, like its predecessor, may not stand up to modern standards, but the art direction, character design, and world-building are still impressive. The game benefits from the iconic STAR WARS soundtrack, creating a familiar atmosphere for fans of the franchise.\n\nKOTOR II, while not as commercially successful as the original, left an indelible mark on the RPG genre. It continued the legacy of player choice and moral ambiguity in storytelling, further solidifying the influence of the first game. The deep philosophical themes explored in KOTOR II have sparked numerous discussions and analyses, elevating the game to cult status among fans of philosophical narratives in gaming.\n\nMy experiences with KOTOR II have been marked by its thought-provoking narrative and complex characters. The philosophical depth of the story has led me to ponder the moral dilemmas presented in the game long after I've finished playing. Despite its issues, KOTOR II remains a game that challenges players to think deeply about the nature of the STAR WARS universe and the choices we make in it.\n\nSTAR WARS\u2122 Knights of the Old Republic\u2122 II - The Sith Lords\u2122 is a dark and philosophical masterpiece that builds upon the foundation of its predecessor. Its exploration of moral ambiguity and complex character development make it a must-play for any fan of the STAR WARS universe and RPG enthusiasts seeking a deeper, more contemplative experience. Despite its imperfections, KOTOR II's enduring impact on gaming and its ability to provoke thought make it a timeless classic in its own right.", "timestamp_created": 1696057301, "timestamp_updated": 1696057301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693628132343292236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147330365": {"recommendationid": "147330365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388272766", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1696577977}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is  one of my favorite star wars games.

Unlike a lot of other media in the IP, KotoR 2 delves deeper in to a very human take on the universe with a lot of moral grey rather than pure good and evil. (Though playing as either is still possible if you want that experience).\n\nSet a handful of years after the previous entry in the series and 200 years prior to the MMO, the story is set in a galaxy reeling from a war that left the Republic crippled and the Jedi all but extinct. As \"The Exile\" your return into known space has not gone unnoticed by those who would hunt your kind. Throughout your journey you have the opportunity to pick up a fairly sizeable cast of companions each with hours of nuanced dialogue and quests that let you learn about their past and help shape their future in a very organic way that still holds up two decades later. Gone are the \"Good vs Bad\" arguments and in come deep questions about morality, what it means to be alive and how one exists in a galaxy where \"The Force\" pushes and pulls on us all.\n\nThe story itself is simple to follow and chocked full of memorable and impact-full moments, its character perspectives add a level to Star Wars that I personally haven't seen before or since and the sheer amount of things to do in the game never leave me short of options.\n\nI originally played this on the Xbox when it launched but since coming to PC the game is full of new life. Addressing the elephant in the room, yes you 100% should play with the restored content mod as the original release was pushed out on a short deadline but the quality is there with or without the mods (studio approved) restorations. For those who have played Fallout 3 and then New Vegas, you will be familiar with the magic Obsidian can pull off when given an existing work to flesh out.\n\nThe combat is entertaining and based off of the D&D stats system and plays out in real time turns with a pause option. This can be something that takes a little getting used to if you don't play these type of games but takes only a small amount of learning. The pace of the game and plethora of tool tips (which can be turned off if wanted on additional runs or reset if you took a break) mean that your never blindly dropped into a situation you cant handle unless you went out of your way to speed run to dangerous places with no level ups.\n\nI could go on for hours about the game but its still active fan-base, piles of novels based on its work and the YouTube content still being made today so far more than I can in this already lengthy review.\n\nPick it up if your a fan of RPG's, D&D inspired combat/stories and the Star Wars universe's more human

It's almost a masterpiece but falls short of being one and here's why: It's not finished and never will be.\n\nYears ago I bought KOTOR I on a sale and had a blast playing, then I bought KOTOR II because I craved more of it even tought I don't care about the Star Wars universe. What's special about Star Wars is not it's setting but the story told trough it's medium, some of the best have been told with the Star Wars universe as a backdrop.\n\nI played this game for 50 hours until one of the very last missions on Korriban, the Sith academy planet, then my game fucked itself and my companions and other NPCS simply refused to advance me through the story. I've searched for a fix but the only answer I got in the forums was to reload a save so far in the beginning that I might as well start the game over. And so I did. \n\nAfter reinstalling the game and making sure none of the mods were conflicting with each other (I will talk about mods in the end, but they are essential), I powered through another 50 hours of the same missions I had just  done just to experience the ending of the story and the conclusion of my companions arc. And guess what? The bug repeated itself. At that pont I closed the game and never experienced the ending. \n\nAnd then you wonder  why would anyone recommend this game even tough they had this bad of a experience? Well, you see, I've played KOTOR I from the beginning to the end but I have never finished KOTOR II and yet, KOTOR II is the one I keep renembering, especially its companions. As I've said the strenght of SW in the universe itself but the stories told throught its medium and this game has one of the best stories and some of the best characters you will get to know in a videogame ever. I will not spoil much of it but Obsidian managed to create a memorable cast of characters, both new and returning from the previous game, and with it crafted a truly fascinating journey that revolves around defeating a powerful, menancing and seemingly undefeatable foe and dwelves into the morality of the Jedi, your morality as a Jedi exile and the internal conflicts of the people that accompany you in this mission. KOTOR is not just rough around the edges, it's an uncut gem that will never be chiselled into what it was supposed to be.\n\nMods are essential to this game, its unfinished state makes its almost unplayable without them. TSLRCM is essential but make sure not to get the Steam version, download and install manually as the Steam version can create problems for you.\n", "timestamp_created": 1692405371, "timestamp_updated": 1692405371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144508539": {"recommendationid": "144508539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148224593", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3382, "last_played": 1692472087}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1692385075, "timestamp_updated": 1692385075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144459304": {"recommendationid": "144459304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281280231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4537, "last_played": 1697402389}, "language": "english", "review": "great game\n", "timestamp_created": 1692329930, "timestamp_updated": 1692329930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144450061": {"recommendationid": "144450061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829492405", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2591, "last_played": 1692506511}, "language": "english", "review": "The best star wars story", "timestamp_created": 1692318166, "timestamp_updated": 1692318166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144445720": {"recommendationid": "144445720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198988529984", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2142, "last_played": 1692310951}, "language": "english", "review": "Kreia is one of the best written Star Wars (EU) characters of all time, if not in all available SW canons.

Still a solid entry and solidifies the KOTOR duology as the one of the greatest stories in any duology ever.\n\nGameplay is outdated and I highly recommend using cheats in order to enjoy the game past it's very rough edges and non-functional storytelling at times (the game was released at an unfinished state and continues to remain largely unfinished despite major content overhauls like TSLRCM).

It was great back in its day (I played through it several times off a CD copy when it came out, so ignore my hours played on Steam).  Today?  Play Star Wars The Old Republic (the MMO) instead - it's a better game, believe it or not (see last paragraph).\n\nThe gameplay is very dated.  Your character can either be a Jedi Guardian, Sentinel or Consular.  Think of them as representing physical combat, balanced combat, or Force-heavy combat.  Three advanced classes unlock later on - you can mix and match if you wish, but it's always good to select the direct upgrade of your basic class.\n\nCombat uses an extremely simplistic RNG-based system with optional pause.  Select a target, select an attack, watch awkward attack animations until the target is dead, repeat.  As a Guardian you'll be spamming one single attack over and over the entire game (Power Strike, Flurry or Critical Strike) with the occasional Force power.  As a Consular you'll be spamming Force powers, but mostly the same ones (lightning etc.).  You can mess around with stealth if you want.  There's not much more to it.  Consumables exist, but aren't really needed on normal difficulty.  Playing on normal or below will be too easy for most modern gamers, as it's almost like an even more dumbed-down version of low-level MMORPG PVE gameplay.\n\nThere is an over-abundance of gear and the game suffers from \"crowded inventory syndrome.\"  Most of it will be sold for money to buy some of the items that are actually good.  Crafting exists, but is relatively basic.  Make a few things, slot a few items.  That's about it.  Purely optional on lower difficulties.\n\nThere are opportunities to min-max your character build (crit-focus, maximize DPS etc.), but it's all fairly basic character building compared to modern games and isn't even remotely necessary on normal difficulty.\n\nThe game wishes you to follow a Light Side or Dark Side path via dialogue choices.  Unfortunately, this game was written before the prevalence of nuanced characters in video games.  With some exceptions, in dialogues your Light Side character will be a classic do-gooder and your Dark Side character will tend to be a mustache-twirling villain.  Help the old lady cross the road or kick her grocery bag for laughs - that sort of thing.  It *is* possible to play a sort of neutral character, but the game doesn't really care much if you do.\n\nYour companions aren't badly-written (one or two are excellent - HK-47, for example), and it's neat to train some of them as Jedi or Sith.  They have decent back stories and plenty of opportunities to chat with them and gain influence points with them (they generally like or dislike your choices, sort of like Dragon Age Origins).  That's a big plus point for the game.\n\nThe planets you travel to are interesting and varied, and you deal with a nice selection of appropriate Star Wars scenarios.  There are memorable interactions with NPCs.  Another plus.\n\nThe game takes a long time to get going.  The prologue area is hours long and consists of navigating fairly linear hallways, opening the occasional container and slogging through numerous easy-peasy droid fights with a vibroblade or a blaster.  You won't have proper Jedi gear until you begin the 3rd area of the game, a good 5+ hours in.  The prologue is so notoriously dull that a mod exists to skip it, and most people who replay the game swear by it.\n\nIn short, good companions, interesting areas, varied and thematic quests, but boring and simplistic combat, very basic RPG systems, a slow start and a black-or-white morality system.  \n\nThe \"sequel\" MMORPG Star Wars the Old Republic is actually a better game in that it allows for you to be more than just a Jedi or Sith, and to play Light or Dark Side version of every character that is actually nuanced and interesting.  The Light Side Sith Warrior, for example, has scenes in which Jedi are confounded by your refusal to play along with stereotypes.  It's also quite possible to play single-player, and doesn't require you to grind or engage in the more tedious aspects of an MMO if you don't wish to.   Free, too.  I'd say play that and only resort to KOTOR II if you're desperate for something new.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1692264249, "timestamp_updated": 1692264823, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402703464031219482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144365089": {"recommendationid": "144365089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048145710", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3099, "last_played": 1692222982}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0417\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0422\u043e\u0442 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 - \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0448\u0438\u0437\u044b \u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1692223054, "timestamp_updated": 1692223054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490596920251846313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144296469": {"recommendationid": "144296469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009410879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 282, "last_played": 1692449434}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game so far.

I think this is for two main reasons: 1, it was largely overshadowed by the first KOTOR and other golden era Star Wars games, and 2, it's a fairly rushed, unfinished game. Yet despite all that it has going against it, KOTOR II manages to deliver a potent, engaging story about redemption, meaning, nuance, and friendship, in a way that feels unique and complex compared to the original.\n\nTo preface, I think it's almost necessary to play this game with mods. KOTOR II was notoriously rushed together in 16 months, leaving the game unfinished in some spots. The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod seeks to restore much of the cut content that resulted from the rush, and it makes the game much more playable. This and a suite of other mods were recommended in [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/wiki/kotor2modbuildspoilerfree/#wiki_ultimate_character_overhaul_patches]this Reddit thread[/url], which is what I used to mod my game. I'd highly recommend taking a look at it, since it made my playthrough 10x better.\n\nKOTOR II serves largely as an addendum to the events of KOTOR, following a different protagonist as they reconnect with the Force after being exiled from the Jedi Order. It's a direct sequel to the events from the first game as well, taking place less than a decade after the Jedi Civil War. With a crew of misfits, including droids, smugglers, assassins, warriors, and former Jedi, you are tasked with saving the galaxy from an encroaching new Sith threat.\n\nThe Obsidian DNA can be seen very plainly in this game, as did BioWare's in the original. The companions and planets are all engaging, the weapon systems are complex and nuanced, characters all have an influence meter... to me, I can see how such systems went on to inspire games like Fallout: New Vegas or The Outer Worlds. While the story was cryptic at times, these core aspects of Obsidian's game design made KOTOR II a good game and held things together during its shakier moments.\n\nSpeaking of shaky moments... the end was just okay. While the rest of the game was a good time, everything from Dantooine onward was weak, especially when compared to the previous game. The story felt pretty incoherent, and I feel like they could've incorporated more story or companion elements. The penultimate stage is pretty much just a big temple full of enemies, which felt pretty anticlimactic personally. I feel that this was probably a result of the rush, and it's a shame that we weren't able to see a more conclusive, fitting ending. Regardless, though, I think it's still worth playing to the ending, if only to see how the great story up until this point concludes. Just don't expect much.\n\nIf you're an RPG fan, give this game a try. While it's not as earth-shattering as KOTOR might be, KOTOR II has enough tricks up its sleeve to keep you coming back for more, with an endearing cast and set of systems comprising the core of the game's success.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1692082592, "timestamp_updated": 1692082608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650681436061859131", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144233894": {"recommendationid": "144233894", "author": {"steamid": "76561199258989840", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1134, "last_played": 1655453601}, "language": "english", "review": "This game allowed me to see through the lies of the Jedi and Sith.", "timestamp_created": 1692075971, "timestamp_updated": 1692076237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500189304351806641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144233727": {"recommendationid": "144233727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176789490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8263, "last_played": 1692078210}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game.

I'm not sure how many of my complaints would be addressed by removing it, but given the improvements I doubt they could ever be sufficient to make playing the game unpatched the preferable experience]\n\nSome of the best character writing I've ever seen in a game alongside a very interesting story that puts the rest of the Star Wars franchise to shame for how much it meaningfully engages with the universe compared to anything else I've seen. Yet I can still only give it a 7/10 because of just how much its brought down by a mess of bugs and some godawful combat that did so much to sour the overall experience.\n\nKotor 1 was an alright game. The story and characters were generally good an I enjoyed my time with it enough to warrant a recommendation. The combat, while bad, was also unobtrusive and easy enough that I didn't need to worry about it all that much, instead sticking to the areas where the game was at its best.\n\nKotor 2 took both the strengths and weaknesses of the first game and amplified them both. The writing was a substantial improvement both in regards to the main plot (which makes this game my favorite piece of Star Wars media) and especially in the characters (with this game's cast being consistently great). But just as Kotor's strengths were made better, its flaws were made so much worse.\n\nWhile the first game was buggy, it was never enough to outright hurt my experience. A few annoyances here and there but overall the glitches were of minimal importance. Kotor 2, by contrast, is a buggy mess than rendered the game nearly unplayable at multiple points and required me to close and reopen the game, adjust my settings, reload old saves, and more on dozens of occasions. And while I understand a lot of this is thanks to its very short development time, that doesn't make the final product any better to play.\n\nBut even more egregious for me was the combat. I didn't like Kotor 1's combat but it was simple and easy enough that I could get ignore it for the most part. This game (or perhaps just the Restored Content Mod?) made combat a far more integral part of the experience, ramping up the difficulty, adding far more encounters, and really forcing me to engage more deeply in what the system had to offer. Which would have been fine if the combat were actually enjoyable but that isn't the case. Its slow and boring, heavily reliant on RNG, poorly explained in-game, and wildly oscillates between painfully easy to frustratingly difficult. I legitimately had to cheat and turn on god mode in order to get through some sections because of the brick walls the game was expecting me to get past just while playing on Easy. Meanwhile I could get part the first game on Normal with barely any deaths outside of boss fights. I get the impression that the developers really enjoyed how the combat of the first game worked and wanted to give it a bigger role here, but for people like me who disliked the first game's combat their decision made Kotor 2 feel genuinely unplayable at points.\n\nIt really is a testament to the game's writing that I'm willing to put up with the gameplay and still recommend the game overall.

The extra force powers, the planets you visit, the enemies you fight, the outfits and armor. All of it is way better as well as the extra things they throw in for combat with lightsaber techniques. Darth Malak was always a really generic sith as well. In this you get a lot more varied and interesting enemies. Even the exchange and criminal groups are far more interesting. They also expand on Czerka Corporation which in the first game was really evil but in this they still around doing evil stuff. I prefer the post return of the jedi EU timeline but the old republic era is great as well. This is all just my own opinion I'm sure me saying Revan and Malak are over rated will enrage most star wars fans but I prefer Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus myself. And even though I love this game Kreia or Darth Traya is also over rated imo.

And I've decided this is my favourite thing in Star Wars. I remember when I first played this I expected a cool and epic journey and boy did I get that. But what I didn't expect was a lesson in philosophy. This game goes places where the movies never did, asking unique and interesting questions about good and bad which seemed so black and white in the OT and where the prequels just scratched the surface. It elevates Star wars into something so much more then a space opera about a family. This is what I think Star Wars should be. It is such a unique story for Star Wars and as a result still feels like one of the freshest stories since the creation of the I.P even 20 odd years later. The only flaw I have with this game is that even though it preaches ideals which challenge both the light and dark and finding a balance between often times your character is forced to choose between the a simple good guy or bad guy option. Which seems some what strange in a game with ideals like this. But I suppose that may be a result of the time the company had to finish it. This left me frustrated at times. Because if you start to actually agree or believe with the ideals the games characters are trying to teach you then you have no real way to act on them. Which is quite annoying. Besides that I would recommend you download the restored content mod and buckle in to have your view on the Star Wars universe altered massively.

With its compelling storytelling, complex characters, and deep exploration of moral ambiguity, KOTOR II deserves high praise and a well-deserved 4.9-star rating.\n\nOne of the standout features of KOTOR II is its engaging and thought-provoking storytelling. The game presents a morally gray narrative, delving into the consequences of war, the struggle for identity, and the complexities of the Force. The writing is sharp and introspective, challenging players to navigate the shades of gray within the Star Wars universe. KOTOR II's narrative depth offers a refreshing departure from the traditional Star Wars tropes, creating a more nuanced and mature experience.\n\nThe characters in KOTOR II are multi-dimensional and captivating, each with their own personal demons and philosophical dilemmas. From the enigmatic Kreia to the troubled Jedi Exile, the game explores the complexities of morality and the nature of power. The exceptional writing and voice acting breathe life into these characters, immersing players in their struggles and motivations. The character development is a highlight, as players are challenged to make choices that impact the growth and fate of the companions.\n\nDespite facing development constraints and a rushed release, KOTOR II still manages to shine. The game's development team, led by Obsidian Entertainment, demonstrated remarkable resilience and creativity in delivering a satisfying experience. While some content was cut and the ending may feel abrupt, the game's dialogue options, companion interactions, and intricate world-building compensate for these shortcomings. The dedication of the developers in crafting a compelling narrative with limited resources is commendable.\n\nVisually, KOTOR II showcases its age, but its art direction and iconic Star Wars aesthetics still leave a lasting impact. The environments, ranging from desolate planets to war-torn cities, are evocative and immersive. The sound design, including the iconic Star Wars soundtrack, adds to the atmosphere and reinforces the sense of being in the Star Wars universe.\n\nIn conclusion, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is a great game that demonstrates the triumph of developers in the face of adversity. Its compelling storytelling, complex characters, and exploration of moral ambiguity set it apart. Despite the development limitations, the game's depth and creativity warrant a highly respectable 4.9-star rating. Whether you are a fan of Star Wars or RPGs, KOTOR II offers a unique and thought-provoking experience that should not be missed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1689633218, "timestamp_updated": 1689633218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142280101": {"recommendationid": "142280101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355806922", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3617, "last_played": 1689615490}, "language": "english", "review": "it's the dark souls of star wars (or i am just bad at it)", "timestamp_created": 1689615565, "timestamp_updated": 1689615565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142271788": {"recommendationid": "142271788", "author": {"steamid": "76561199012955098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3662, "last_played": 1617330743}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic and retro.

There was also an attempt to tie in the actual gameplay mechanics to the story, \n\nIn terms of the combat, it is pretty simplistic and a little over reliant on random drops for materials and equipping multiple characters at once with decent gear. There are some builds that are so much better than the others that it makes repeatability less fun despite the obvious incentive to do so. The verbal jiu jitsu of dialogue combat can be more satisfying, long extended dialogue trees have never been better nor has reading all the choices before choosing an option.

We move 5 years into the future and play here as a Jedi expelled from the order, who will decide the fate of the balance of power in the galaxy. The game was released definitely too soon, and it lacks some content, so I recommend installing a mod that restores it.\n[h1]The Plot[/h1]\n5 years into the future, and the Jedi Order has fallen, Revan has vanished, and the Republic is collapsing due to the attacks of the extremely powerful Sith. Our enemies here are the Sith Triumvirate using agents of the dark side as assassins. The trumvirate includes; Darth Sion, or the definition of a man too pissed off to die, Darth Nihilus, the Sith version of Marvel's Galactus, and Darth Traya, the ultimate traitor. I mention them because I personally think they are some of the most interesting Sith in the Star Wars universe. What is incredibly painful, however, is that the game doesn't give them much time to develop, they appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly. We start the game at the mining station, and it's a typical prologue, but I have a big problem here. To get out of this location and clear it 100%, I spent 2 hours there, and since the surroundings were boring to explore, by the end I had enough. At least we're already Jedi-trained, and even though we don't have a lightsaber, it's a bit of a relief. We meet our first companions here, and speaking of them, I personally think that they are not very interesting. Of course, compared to most games they are great, but compared to the previous game, it is a definite step backwards, not to mention our mentor in this game always has a problem with our actions, and although her philosophy is insanely interesting, but commenting and picking on everything I do is incredibly annoying. The locations we visit during our mission to stop the Sith are interesting, although definitely smaller, which is a big improvement. We can also visit familiar locations from the previous game. There's also a light side and dark side system here, and as we're more of a Gray Jedi, this has a greater impact on the world and our companions, who themselves will change with our decisions. Of course, at the end, we also have the option to side with the Jedi or the Sith. Personally, I think this game has a lesson in forgiveness, or are we to forgive the Jedi Masters who unjustly rejected us. Personally, these masters are so annoying that I executed an early Order 66 on them (it's worth mentioning that the events of this game itself, are during the events of the first Jedi Purge).\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nMostly a big improvement over the first game. Lightsaber combat is much faster, there are more animations here and it looks much better overall. There is more interesting inventory and the maps are interesting and well structured. The character creator is better, we have better face choices, and there are a lot of new skills here so you can experiment more. And thank God that the character no longer gets stuck on literally everything around. It is also worth mentioning that the UI is much clearer and better for the eye. However, I feel like there's a step backwards in terms of side quests, a lot of them are typical \"go there, talk to someone and get me something\", which is really boring, but considering the game was released at an accelerated pace, then I understand that most of the interesting content was unfortunately cut out. You can see a lot of indicators in this game, that some things had not been finished, which is really annoying when some threads go nowhere.\n[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]\nA slight tragedy. Despite the improvement in the quality of the gameplay, good music, great work by the voice actors and improved quality of graphics and effects, the game has many annoying bugs. Some dialogues either activate too late, too quickly, or not at all, sometimes the voices and music cut off completely, and the game requires frequent restarts because of these bugs. There's a lot to list here, so I recommend installing a good mod from the workshop.\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nA very good game, which unfortunately suffers from lack of content and technical problems. It's really a shame that the developers didn't get more time to finish this game, but even so, it's still one of the best Star Wars games that ties in nicely with the previous game. It was supposed to be a trilogy, but unfortunately it didn't work out, and the story of Revan and Jedi Exile is continued in SWTOR, and in the books (which I definitely recommend).\nhttps://youtu.be/7Fl48HXJhSg", "timestamp_created": 1687463049, "timestamp_updated": 1687463049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545851528644561768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140504528": {"recommendationid": "140504528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185317255", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 3708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3001, "last_played": 1688065503}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la leche", "timestamp_created": 1687451083, "timestamp_updated": 1687451083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140494447": {"recommendationid": "140494447", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013374675", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 7173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6799, "last_played": 1697166839}, "language": "english", "review": "\"its such a quiet thing to fall but even worse to admit it.\"\nseriously doubt we're ever gonna get anything this close to morally grey SW content but game good", "timestamp_created": 1687439070, "timestamp_updated": 1687439070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140489580": {"recommendationid": "140489580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072792957", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11970, "last_played": 1687433182}, "language": "english", "review": "One the greatest western RPGs of all time made even better with mods.

If you'd prefer going in totally blind, in short: This is a fantastic RPG that does some unexpected things both as a sequel and as a Star Wars product, and holds up today despite bugs and some clunkiness.[/b]\n\nLook past the unrefined technical construction and antiquated visuals, and you'll find one of gaming's best stories: A cynical skewering of the Star Wars mythos and its ideals, with complex characters and distinct ideologies subject to your benign or malign influence as you determine a new ethos for the galaxy: Who does the Force really belong to? What is power without subjugation? Can failure and villainy really be redeemed?\n\n[i]KOTOR 2[/i] tears down the many assumptions of the Star Wars brand, the stories that inspired it, and the stories that emerged from it, with their reassuringly clear heroes and villains, clear intentions, clear plots, and clear moral stances. By jettisoning those foundational concepts out the airlock, it subjects you not to the bland fence-sitting of stereotypical \"morally grey\" chaotic neutrality, but to a genuine and surprising interrogation of the values we hold dear in contemporary - and sometimes ancient - storytelling.\n\nThis approach has greater weight in a galaxy that, several years after its predecessor, is a traumatised place shattered by terrible interplanetary conflict, with much of the proceedings adopting a drastically darker, even sinister tone, stretching everywhere from the grimmer writing to the literally darkened UI. The starry-eyed optimism of Star Wars proper is long gone; here lies a civilisation entombed under the ashes of a catastrophic war that has poisoned its survivor's minds with exhaustion and desperation, with an uneasy respite from the carnage only serving to raise tensions and set the stakes even higher into an ominous feeling that the slightest push in either direction could send the whole galaxy tumbling into collapse.\n\nIt also goes beyond the usual boundaries of Star Wars themes to seriously examine difficult subjects reflecting the real world's troubles. Should the poor and weak be blindly helped? Is manipulation admissible if it steers its victims into resilience or ignorant safety? What should we do when hierarchies become obsolete? Does empathy have practical value unto itself? What is the role of institutions when the system they serve has fallen into chaos? These and other questions all, ultimately, relate to the central theme of power - and how it is given, taken, and used. [I]KOTOR 2[/I] doesn't hate Star Wars: It's inseparably embedded in its tropes and stories, and gleefully delivers all the lightsaber action and interplanetary antics one could dream of, but what makes it such an unorthodox game is its self-aware metatextual introspection. It's something of a gamified postmodernist debate on the powerful cultural concepts that make classic Star Wars so enduring, with Luke's innocent, longing gaze at Tatooine's binary sunset or Darth Vader's tragic redemption giving us comforting assurances of the nobility of adventure and certainty of love, painting perhaps an overly simplified picture of humanity that echoes our need for existential self-justification. If [I]KOTOR 1[/I] uncritically (albeit remarkably skilfully) regurgitates this optimistic paradigm, [I]KOTOR 2[/I] challenges it - but never neglecting its value, and should you desire, even indulging it, but now with greater definition and understanding. Your new player character can be just as optimistic and constructive as in [I]1[/I], but now you can delve so much deeper into the how and why, and determine the details in the fuzzy ideological plasticity that [I]2[/I] offers, both to flesh out roleplaying possibilities, and to deliver a more believable and textured story.\n\nWhat's fascinating is the way these themes intersect with your player character. The admittedly tired trope of an amnesiac protagonist is used to great effect, repurposing what could have been a dull and impersonal blank slate into an opportunity to mold a new morality for yourself. Many games make the mistake of telling their story [I]at[/I] you, where your access to perfect information and total control over outcomes defines you as your own personal deus ex machina. Instead, there's now rarely a perfect solution to a problem; people will take advantage of you if you're not careful; you can't always save everyone; you'll have to make sacrifices; and often, there's simply no truly good outcome. You don't just show up, solve everyone's dilemmas, and leave as a hero; this is a galaxy that needs you, but now also suspects you, uses you, and pushes back. Crucially to the story, even the most helpess people are no longer quite so straightforwardly pliable, and much of [i]KOTOR 2[/i] is about debating your way into a position of power over those around you. The way you work within the confines of these limitations creates a vessel for subtle, philosophically expressive roleplaying in a way that binary moral choices or predictable writing never could. And these winding roads aren't a solo journey: Your companions react to your choices in complex ways, sometimes resisting them, sometimes supporting them, in some cases being so profoundly influenced by your actions that their world view may radically shift, changing their alignment and even their character class... Sometimes to shocking degrees. This flexibility in self-expression, and its accompanying reactivity from the uncertain world and its fluid characters - standing on the shoulders of fantastic writing - is extraordinary for its quality and rarity, and the main motivator for my replays every few years.\n\nI've discussed the writing almost exclusively so far, but the gameplay is similarly strong, if a bit archaic by today's standards. You're of course going to be slicing aliens up with lightsabers and playing card games in space cantinas. There's all the combat, dialogue, puzzles, trade, and exploration you'd expect from any western RPG, wrapped up in the rusty and dusty pre-sequels Star Wars imagery. If you have zero interest in the complex moral dilemmas or what is effectively entertainment iconoclasm, then this remains a fantastic time, with the same enjoyable D&D-inspired mechanics and captivating worlds as [i]KOTOR 1[/i], and some particularly impactful music again. But really, this game's greatest strength is its dialogue, especially if you keep Kreia in your party, which is like enduring a 20-hour questioning from a caustic but caring mentor-philosopher, whose poking and prodding masks a powerful desire to deepen your understanding of the world and your place in it. The wider cast is brilliant, and each character is delicately written and deftly acted, but Kreia stands out as one of the most fascinating characters in any game, even after two decades, for her unrelenting pondering of Star Wars's philosophical conventions.\n\nI passionately believe it's worth digging through some of the awkward presentation and unavoidable bugs to experience this sociological soul-searching, and all its delightfully Machiavellian twists and turns. If you take a deep breath and plunge into its murky waters, you might find yourself with a new perspective on the pop culture spearheaded by Star Wars, on the wider beliefs of our Western civilisation, and perhaps even on your own morality.

Lastly, I find it to be much, much, much, muuuch better than the original Knights of the Old Republic from BioWare. It takes the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor and improves upon them to a greater extent. There's no ridiculous level cap from the first game anymore either. Much more open freedom to build your character with the introduction of the Advanced Classes.\nLastly, the writing, story and characters are well-rounded and not drenched up in clich\u00e9s like the first game. Knights of the Old Republic 2 throws the whole Light vs Dark concept into a bin and then dump it on the dark side of the moon.\n\nIn retrospect - The game basically views the Jedi & Sith from a broader perspective and then concludes \"Hey, maybe they aren't so different after all\". They both wear morning gowns for a living and carry wide coloured willie exstented swords as a means of defense or offense. Essentially, there is no good or evil in this game, just various shades of grey. This philosophy is something one would find in the game's characters, especially the enigmatic woman, Kreia. Most of the characters are incredibly complex, even the Han Solo-esque ones have a dark secret hiding in the closet.\nThere's no suave, secret, paragon of the universe response that will unlock their hidden feelings and open up to you. There's an interesting approval system, which I do consider a bit flawed but in terms of role-playing, it works. Once you've finally gotten to the heart of their character you'll unlock new abilities for the said characters. The best part: Even when you've gotten that far it still feels like you don't quite know everything there is to know about these characters.\n\nI think it is best if I sum up the plot now -- The game takes place a few years after the events of the first game.\n\nIn classic Star Wars tradition, the Republic is on the verge of collapse alongside the Jedi... AGAIN. There are some tropes that Star Wars can never truly escape from I suppose. You play as an exiled Jedi... Knight? Master? Janitor? Whatever, the game is kinda vague about your previous ranking within the order - You've just returned to the known galaxy and thus missed out on the party of the first game -- I suppose this makes sense given that Star Wars doesn't seem to be restricted to one galaxy, but how the Exile have managed to NOT hear about the whole escapade in the first game is beyond me.. Guess she spent her time in a cave or a remote planet or something, ala Ben Kenobi. For some reason you find yourself onboard the ship of the Ebon Hawke, which people who've played the first game will recognize, and it has been badly damaged, explains a questionably-soothingly-female-voiced-sentient-AI as the tutorial begins.\n\nYou have the option of skipping this tutorial but it's probably best not to do it since it'll give you a better idea of what is going on and foreshadow danger to come. Not too long after your Exiled Jedi wakes up from her/his comatose sleep onboard an eerie space mining facility called Peragus. The whole place is mysteriously abandoned, and one of the only survivors seems to be an old woman named, Kreia. Like I mentioned she's an enigma and she seems to know a lot about you and the Force, so the next course of action is to figure out what has happened and get off the station. That pretty much sums up the beginning.\n\nOne of the other things I find that Kotor 2 does exceptionally well is that it allows the player to get easily integrated with the character of the Exile, despite her having an established background -- The well structured dialogue assignment paves way for role-playing a character who doesn't have a clue, as well as someone who's already familiar with the events of the first game. In addition to that - There's also the subtle choice of gender for the previous protagonist and selected occurences of the first game, without the use of an import system, in conversation with one of the characters. A smart way to build to connect both stories together as there'll be plenty of references.\n\nSo, I've talked a bit about what to expect from the characters, the story and gameplay -- Now I'd like to sum up some of the central themes. The game doesn't present itself as the \"Save the world from the ancient evil\" type of story. Instead, it sets itself up more as a personal story, about your protagonist and your followers. Every time you exit and enter your ship you'll usually find the party bantering with each other, alluding to a dark secret they are hiding or what have you. This is also brought to light in some of the story cutscenes, where Kreia will downright intimidate your crew by exposing their darkest secrets and have it consume them... Why? Because of The Exile. The Exile is unlike any Jedi or Sith and not because she drew the shortest stick, but because she did something in her past that none other could have done. Something that litterally draws the followers and Kreia alike, to the Exile, but one would have to play the game to understand. Most of the story is a lesson to the protagonist, and the player -- About the ideas of morality, and how being a nice & benevolent saint might not always be the right thing to do; Least of all being cruel and despicable.\nRelying heavily on the Force is brought up as a sign of weakness, and that true strength comes from not needing it. All of this is dictated through the enemies you fight, the choices you make, the characters you meet and certainly through the character of Kreia. It's\n\nKOTOR 2 is a story of self-realization, different shades of morality, confronting the past and learning from past mistakes to face the future. Knights of the Old Republic 2 gets a strong recommendation from me, simply for being unlike any other Star Wars game and with the Restoration Mod -- A much better game than BioWare's original Knights of the Old Republic! :)", "timestamp_created": 1686491765, "timestamp_updated": 1686491765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139885478": {"recommendationid": "139885478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046235330", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2165, "last_played": 1699325837}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion, this is THE SW RPG.

The companion arcs with light/dark are genuinely one of the best that exists, and you can follow stories of companions should you wish, treat them like absolute crap or use them as cannon fodder - it really doesn't stop you doing any of these things. You can be a god among men or the most backstabbing, selfish and deceitful Sith lord in the universe.\n\nThe story is basically loosely followed, and you can delve deeper into it if you so wish, or just plough through it and ignore it all - your choice.\n\nHundreds of side-quests, (maybe a slight exaggeration) all optional. Some are highly rewarding, some you get betrayed, others are worth nothing.  Side quests can also affect the wider story and side stories.\n\nThey really need to remake this game with new tech - nothing about the core game needs to change, except maybe restoring the cut content and general improvements/fixes done through mods.\n\nI don't think it really matters if you are a SW fan or not - I know a few people that loved this and didn't follow SW in any capacity, so there is that element of it, too.\n\nI really hope this gets a remake.

Why?\" but you kind of followed along the events that transcurred until the final planet, that's where things go really bad. You go into a rushed fight against the main villain and you're told very quickly the future of your companions (which by the way you don't see most of them in the final mission, which is incredibly stupid) and the villain dies, you get told that you must go to deep space to find Revan and Stop the true sith and you don't get to say yes, no or whatever, and the only thing you see is the Ebon Hawk departing the planet and the credits roll.

No entiendo como tiene tan buenas valoraciones. Vayamos por partes:\n- Este juego lo hizo Obsidian en vez de Bioware, con muchas prisas y sin tanta experiencia en este tipo de juegos. Se nota MUCH\u00cdSIMO.\n- Est\u00e1 plagado de bugs por todas partes.\n- El dise\u00f1o de niveles es HORRIBLE. Los caminos se dividen en tant\u00edsimos otros caminos que te terminas estresando vivo. No tienen alma los mapas, se sienten... mal hechos.\n- Los personajes, en su gran mayor\u00eda, son innecesarios y vac\u00edos. Si no te quieren matar se quieren unir a ti, y a veces se unen porqu\u00e9 s\u00ed, sin sentido alguno con la historia.\n- Lo de Kreia es para darle de comer a parte.\n- Las misiones parecen sacadas de un MMO. En serio, que pu\u00f1etero co\u00f1azo. Los textos y di\u00e1logos son exasperantes. Nunca sabes lo que est\u00e1s haciendo, vas como un pollo sin cabeza, rezando que hayas cumplido el objetivo de la misi\u00f3n, yendo de arriba a abajo todo el rato.\n\nAhora vayamos al problema real. A partir de aqu\u00ed [b]HAY SPOILERS. CUIDADO[/b].\nMe paso todo el juego sufriendo, porqu\u00e9 el primero me encant\u00f3 y quer\u00eda darle una oportunidad a este. Todo el juego ha sido una tortura tras otra, confiando en que el siguiente nivel fuera mejor. He seguido jugando solo para saber m\u00e1s de la historia, para poder entender que es lo que ocurre conmigo, Kreia y el consejo Jedi. Mi idea era llevar un personaje algo rebelde, neutral. Sin ser del lado oscuro, pero tampoco muy amigo de la idea Jedi, pero siendo del lado de la luz. Por el momento parec\u00eda funcionar, el juego te da esa opci\u00f3n en todo momento. Ahora bien, en una misi\u00f3n me pongo del lado de unos rebeldes que quieren independizarse de la rep\u00fablica, el juego ME OBLIGA a matar a un Jedi, y de pronto soy Sith porqu\u00e9 s\u00ed. De la nada, los otros Jedi que he encontrado, me quieren matar, soy malo maloso. Kreia me dice que he seguido el lado oscuro, que bla bla bla. De la puta nada, me he ido al lado oscuro, cuando estaba yendo por el camino de la luz. Tengo que matar a todos los Jedi que segu\u00edan vivos PORQU\u00c9 S\u00cd. Lo siguiente que veo, es que el juego me obliga a matar a Atria como la Doncella y ah\u00ed ya, ha sido demasiado. He cerrado el juego, y a tomar por culo.\n\nBioware [b]era[/b] un tit\u00e1n de este tipo de RPGs. Darle ese trabajo a Obsidian fue un error garrafal. El modelo de juego que pretend\u00edan hacer, ha salido horrible, pero horrible de verdad. Yo no entiendo las valoraciones que tiene este juego.

There's not ifs and buts to this, the \"vanilla\" version is just unfinished, plain and simple.\n\nSometimes I replay Kotor 1 because it has that fun \"A New Hope\" sense of Stars War adventure and silly tropey stuff, and one of the plot twists totally recontextualises almost everything on repeat playthroughs, but it's not super deep.\n\nWith Kotor 2 I just keep discovering these little tidbits that make me go \"dang, how did I not notice this before\" because the writing structure is just completely different. \n\nIt's all thematic and character focused as opposed to plot-driven, but the plot is still very complex and consists pretty much of nothing but galactic power players stacking gambit on top of gambit, all of them revolving around *you*, the player, and what your character has done nigh-on a decade ago. It's very much a \"personal epic\" \u2014 the plot events are massive, galaxy-defining, and yet none if it matters as much as your own journey of self-discovery, a journey of coming to terms with your past, your past deeds, and the main hurdle to overcome here is whether or not you can live with yourself, with what you've done, and who you are.\n\nGranted it kind of doomed the game from a popularity perspective because it was all so ambitious and uncompromising \u2014 and that, in part, alongside LucasArts meddling, pretty much made it inevitable that the project will never rise above a \"cult classic\" status. A real \"what could have been\" type situation, but in the end KotOR 2 being a beautiful, flawed gem of a game ended up killing the idea of KotOR the series. In a way, it's appropriate.\n\nAdmittedly putting the pieces of the plot together and figuring out character motivations can be frustrating and confusing, and the limited development cycle and the budget allocated to this game meant that a lot of the more ambitious plot and character hooks end up being presented in a very undynamic form, especially compared to KotOR 1. However I found that in a way it contributed to the overall feeling of isolation and alienation that permeates the game: your character cut themself off from everything that binds them to the world in an effort to avoid hurting others, and being hurt again.\n\nThe light side run is in the end, a story about overcoming trauma and learning how to open up to others.\n\nOne of the nifty ways Obsidian managed to write bits of Star Wars lore into that theme and use it for plot purposes, is how the Jedi Council in their reclusive dogmatism, lost their connection with their humanity.\n\nThe Jedi Exile is the most \"human\" of these Jedi because they were compelled to join the war effort because they could not stand idly by while others suffer.\n\nAnd the simple ability to build camaraderie with their troops, other beings, and connect with them on a personal level, presented by the lore explanation of \"force bonds\", was what caused them to break during the pivotal battle of the Mandalorian wars \u2014 the experience of feeling every single life being extinguished there, especially those with whom they served, whose lives they held in the palm of their hand as their leader \u2014 someone they looked up to.\n\nHowever that is just a nifty nerdy lore way of writing a character in terms of what you need for the plot.\n\nThematically however, it's just a representation of how any real person would feel after witnessing, participating in, or surviving an atrocity. Or tragedy. Or personal loss. Trauma. Getting into a fight where you get badly injured, surviving a car crash, getting bullied as a kid. Being alienated because of who you are, because of something you have no control over. The Exile is all that rolled into one package, and them being a war veteran that went through some of the most horrific battles of said war is just a compelling plot hook.\n\nProbably one of the best \"blank slate\" protagonists ever created for an RPG, and one of the most cleverly-written protagonists in RPG history.\n\nThis game blew my mind when I was twelve years old and I barely understood it at the time, but it *felt* different to any other game I've played, and it still managed to resonate with me on an emotional level. Revisiting it now as a grown adult made that connection even more personal and deep. It is a sad, melancholy game exploring sad, melancholy themes, with quite a few of them hitting at times uncomfortably close to home, and it's not something many would expect from a Star Wars game of all things \u2014 but if anything it makes it that much more impressive that the writers of this game found a way to work with a setting defined by its Light/Dark dichotomy, and make it feel *complex* and real.\n\nIt's janky, outdated, the gameplay is simplistic, the AI is braindead, and overall the game's bugged to all hell. But this game conquered a chunk of my heart and called it home. Playing it was like reading a novel.\n\nIt may require one to reside in a particular mental place during a particular period of their lives to really feel connected to this game, and if you are, then I am sorry that you have been forced to go through that kind of thing.

The game itself feels relatively rushed near the second half, even with all the restored content. However, the game's main strength is the writing, which is pretty top notch in any form of media, especially if you enjoy discussions about morality, philosophy, and the metaphysical. Being a Star Wars fan just makes it much more interesting because you have a strong attachment to the concept of the force, and the story itself is exceptionally engaging basically the entire way through, especially since the game itself could've been longer to begin with. The gameplay is fine, not exactly my favorite gameplay loop but it was carried by being a Star Wars RPG, so by the time you get a lightsaber you feel really badass.

The mystic vibe of the game, the story, twists, characters and its RPG elements is still one of the best till this day. And I can confidently say that it still is one of the best RPG game I've ever enountered.\n\nYou get to see the old stories and arcs in Star Wars which I'd wish were seen as canon. Even though you get to read a lot of stuff throughout the game, as a person who spent 80 hours on this, I can easily say that I never got bored of getting new information about the universe. \n\nThis game not only adds to the Star Wars universe but it expends and emphasizes the meaning to many stuff that we've see in the movies. You even change your perspective to the planets that you know and their original residents. For example after this series I've grown very deep feelings for the Sand People and their history. I used to see them as raiders but now I kind of see their point of view. Only The Book of Boba Fett has reached this perspective after KOTOR.\n\nIt might not give you the best gameplay since it's turn based but given that it's made in 2004 I can say it's acceptable. And especially for KOTOR 2 they've fixed that \"losing save\" issue. So it's much better.

Not necessarily even buggy or full of issues, but not containing everything that has been already prepared and shipped, but locked and normally inaccessible. And to me, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is the saddest example of them all. The first title of Obsidian Entertainment, a gathering of incredibly talented and experienced people from Black Isle Studios backed by new no less talented team members, it remains my personal favorite Star Wars story of them all. No really \u2013 there\u2019s not a single other piece of SW-related media that is as good as this. Yet, even with a fantastic The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification (TSLRCM for short) that restores a lot of cut content in its current 1.8.6 version, the game occasionally feels incomplete and playing the game can be a frustrating experience.\n\nSet several years after the end of the first KotOR, this game tells a story that is far more nuanced than anything the first game had to offer and, really, anything the SW media usually has to offer, as it delves far deeper into the concept of the Force and philosophy of the Jedi or the Sith. It is no longer a black and white story of Good People fighting Big Evil. It\u2019s more of an exploration of how The Galaxy Far Far Away lives with its constant connection to the unseen connecting energy that seems to decide the fates of people and influence their choices. And how this unexplained idea is weaponised by opposing world views, with no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d answers available.\n\nDue to this, unlike the first KotOR, it\u2019s not just the global story setting that is excellent, with the details and characters suffering. Everything is interesting and exciting to learn more about. Every companion you can get (and one of them even depends on your Light or Dark side path) is memorable and interesting, with their influence on you and your influence on them isn\u2019t just interesting, but an integral part of the story. This was also the game that established (or I suppose re-established if we count Black Isle) the love of this development team to give you long dialogues debating difficulty questions, being able to give the playable character a strong world view. And also to use skill checks everywhere applicable to give the choice in how you develop the character in the gamey RPG systems a place in the world, so it can influence the way your character acts and even be part of the story.\n\nThough, what\u2019s even more curious and not something I picked on in my previous playthroughs of the game, KotOR II very often gives important information to the players, without giving it to the player character. There are multiple moments, very smartly chosen and selected, where the players get to see cutscenes and dialogues that show important plot points and big twists, without the playable character being present and consciously aware of them. Almost as if implying that either those elements are being subconsciously felt by the main character, or giving the player a story role in the game as an agent of the Force, influencing the choices of characters. As your perceptions of things get influenced by what you know, what the character you control as does not. It seems intentional, as the game even justifies gameplay mechanics with the story in a very clever way\n\nWhatever the intentions may be, the resulting story and the way its told is amazing and might easily be the strongest tale from Obsidian even to this day. But\u2026 it also might be the weakest gameplay experience of all their titles. The game can be very hard and depending on how you develop characters it can be even harder. There are moments, where it almost feels as if the title would want you to not get into the trap of \u201ccleaning up the whole location\u201d or \u201cdoing everything\u201d, yet if you do play it \u201csmart\u201d you will be shooting yourself in the foot later, when you are forced into conflict and might find yourself underprepared. There are countless moments where your companions get to be the main character (even more in TSLRCM) and while they work fantastically story-wise, mechanically they often feel completely unbalanced. You have to smartly use every tool available to you, instead of just relying on attacks and normal offensive options, but even if you do, it might still not be enough to get through some areas without lowering the difficulty (which can be done at any point with no penalty) or save scumming your way through.\n\nThe game is in general more complicated in terms of gameplay, not just the story. Although, it is not always necessarily frustrating. A crafting system is introduced that expands the simple upgrade system from the first game. Interactions with companions also give or take away \u201cinfluence\u201d you have on them. Some skills are, actually, simplified instead \u2013 the implants are no longer tied to a skill, for example, and are now just dependent on the Constitution attribute. Mini-games are slightly reworked and the rather popular racing from the original game is now almost impossibly stupidly difficult for some reason. Multi-class as a concept returns, but is tweaked and an idea of prestige classes is introduced. Stuff still looks like it was straight up \u201cborrowed\u201d from DnD 3.5, but it mostly works just fine. Oh and what\u2019s very different in terms of pacing is how many extremely long linear sections the game has in comparison to the first \u2013 after a very long linear intro section and apart from the non-less extended \u201cend\u201d section, even when you visit a planet you might get locked into a very long section which you cannot back out of.\n\nFortunately, the PC port of the game nowadays works pretty well after it has been updated in 2015. It has decent widescreen support that can be easily enhanced by the mods. Mods are easier to install, especially on Steam, where the game supports Steam Workshop. So I recommend the TSLRCM, widescreen UI fix and lightsaber colour fix whenever you decide to play the game yourself. Also you might look up how to correctly run the game in 60Hz mode as, unfortunately, just using a V-sync option might not help and the game breaks if your refresh rate is higher than that by not letting you move after exiting combat mode. Occasionally the game may also crash, though it\u2019s relatively rare. And if you play the game for several hours suddenly all dialogues might start skipping without voices \u2013 restart the game to fix it. Sadly, no built-in fixes for these seem to exist right now. But the overall experience from the technical side of things is quite pleasant.\n\nWhereas Knights of the Old Republic is still entertaining, but is otherwise almost entirely superseded by Mass Effect and Dragon Age, where BioWare revisited almost every good idea and made it better, Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords remains unique and unsurpassed. It\u2019s a shame so much of its original intent is still lost or flawed in execution, even with the TSLRCM. And it\u2019s a shame it can be a very frustrating game to play in terms of balance and general design missteps. But it\u2019s a story unlike any other and I loved playing it again. If there could be a second chance or a remake given to a Star Wars game, this should be the one to get it, as even 19 years later KotOR II amazes and surprises. And I cannot recommend this game enough.", "timestamp_created": 1682769120, "timestamp_updated": 1682769120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137452798": {"recommendationid": "137452798", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961997267", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1823, "last_played": 1686357182}, "language": "english", "review": "Sometimes you need to play games in peace when the live player games  unravel..... this game has depth, and not complicated...stretches your brain  with solvable puzzles....not crazy though....fun combat....Four stars !", "timestamp_created": 1682729713, "timestamp_updated": 1682729713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137424777": {"recommendationid": "137424777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880416492", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1692490775}, "language": "english", "review": "played through most of it on Xbox, and it really would have been better if it had a static loot pool like the previous one. also unarmed strike builds are wonderful.

Characters were talking about events that hadn't transpired (or never transpired), and it was like I was being told a story completely out of order.\n\nSo after many years I thought I'd give them another go. The first game was amazing, the second... once again. Absolutely no idea what's going on. After beating it I read a recap, but I'm honestly not sure it's describing the same game I played. Perhaps you have to play the planets in a certain order for it to make sense, but I managed to get through the whole game with almost no idea what some of the villains were doing, and barely an idea of what the other was... but no idea why.\n\nSome people have stated that it has a darker, more nuanced tone. But I felt like Jolee Bindo and Juhani combined had a more nuanced view of the force (sad), and saying the game had a more serious tone than the predecessors is silly, except for the corny maniacal villain of Malak. Regardless, I honestly could not even identify any dark or nuanced tone from this game. I spoke to all the NPC's, I listened to everything. It was a garbled mess.\n\nI have not played with the restored content mod. I intend to do so, but out of the box... this is a painful experience if you have no nostalgic attachments to it.

Negative and positive influence have the same effects so you don't have to worry about that.

If you've spent whole nights in SW forums, clicking random links on Wookiepedia and having sincere discussions about the current state of the franchise, this game will feel like a love letter for someone that loves Star Wars as deeply as you and just wanted to leave a grain in the beach that is the legacy of Star Wars, and this is not just about Avellone, but rather that had some involvement in this game. \n\nWhether it's about the main developers at Obsidian, the ones from Bioware that set the foundations, or the legions of fans that have made things like TSLCRM, M4-78 and other efforts to reconstruct the game's original vision, it's clear that everyone involved was tied by an ethereal chain that tied them together in their opinions, knowledge and love about the universe that is Star Wars. \n\nI don't know whether it was intentional or not, but the game's main theme (or at least one of them) about how the force connects us feels like a beautiful fit for everyone that has helped this game survive and still be able to be played and resonate by everyone that is willing to give it a chance.", "timestamp_created": 1680825248, "timestamp_updated": 1681438695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853478074073791504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136237237": {"recommendationid": "136237237", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033061539", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 555, "last_played": 1680822783}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is near unplayable thanks to a bug where on newer PCs you can't move after combat and there is no easy or good fix for it, do not buy this game if you have a newer PC it is not worth it\n", "timestamp_created": 1680822441, "timestamp_updated": 1680822441, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434782594442367554", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136234528": {"recommendationid": "136234528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029274781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1684905658}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the first one and am now trying out the second.

These games are where they refined the mechanics that would go on to be used in the later franchises. If you like how either of those play then would very much recommend the KOTOR games. \n\nI had previously only played the base version without the restored content, which is good in it's own right, but I thoroughly recommend the restored content mod (can be found in the workshop) to get the best experience of the game. I find that I keep coming back to this game and it's predecessor (KOTOR 1) rather than playing newer games, they were just built differently back when this game was made: In this game there's so much more emphasis on nuance rather than the tired old trope of good guy vs bad guy with no other depth or plot, the lines are far more blurred than that in this game. Some of the characters are superbly written and with the restored content mod we get to see even more of that depth to their characters. I thought there couldn't be a better twist/reveal than the one in KOTOR 1 but as the story in this game unfolds and the plot is revealed it really does come out of left field the first time you play it, even more so if you fully explore the dialogue options and get all of the background information that there is to offer. It is also apparent that different playthroughs offer different loot at times - I have found an armour suit that I have never seen on any of my previous playthroughs, which is a big plus in my books as it prevents the game going stale if you play it more than once.\n\nAll in all, this game is so good that I would encourage anyone to look past the dated graphics and slower turn based combat, because underneath that is an absolute gem of a game that is just as compelling now as it was then.

I, Kreia, a former Jedi Master turned teacher, had forsaken the Jedi Order, disillusioned by their flawed teachings and their blindness to the true nature of the Force.\n\nGuided by my own unique perspective, I embarked on a journey with the exile, a Jedi cast aside and severed from the Force. Together, we traversed treacherous worlds, encountering allies and enemies alike. But our purpose was clear: to unravel the mysteries of the Sith Lords that plagued the galaxy.\n\nWith every step, I shared my wisdom, my doubts, and my vision of a galaxy liberated from the chains of the Force. I sought to enlighten my companions, to make them see beyond the superficial divisions of light and dark, Jedi and Sith. I challenged their beliefs, forcing them to confront their own inner demons and question the very nature of the Force that governed their lives.\n\nThrough our travels, we encountered various factions, each with their own agenda and hidden motivations. Mandalorians, Sith, Jedi, and even the droids that permeated the galaxy, all held a piece of the puzzle. With each encounter, I sought to peel back the layers, exposing the flaws and contradictions of their ideologies.\n\nYet, as we delved deeper into the secrets of the Sith Lords, I realized that darkness and light were not merely opposing forces, but two sides of the same coin. The Force, that eternal wellspring of power, was indifferent to morality. It was the choices we made, the intentions behind our actions that truly mattered.\n\nIn the end, the lines between Jedi and Sith blurred, as did the boundaries between my companions' loyalties. They were forced to make choices, not as pawns of destiny, but as individuals with the power to shape their own futures. And as they confronted their personal demons, I stood beside them, an advocate of free will and self-determination.\n\nIn the crucible of conflict, our understanding deepened. My vision of a galaxy liberated from the tyranny of the Force resonated with those who dared to listen. The teachings of the Jedi and Sith crumbled before the truth I offered, and the veil of illusion lifted, revealing the harmony that could exist beyond the dogmas that held the galaxy captive.\n\nAs the tale draws to a close, my companions and I stood united against the machinations of the Sith Lords. Our purpose, our journey, had shaped us all in profound ways. And in that pivotal moment, I knew that the teachings of Kreia, the renegade Jedi, would echo through the annals of history, forever challenging the notions of light and dark, and illuminating the path towards true understanding.\n\nThus concludes the story from the perspective of Kreia, a character steeped in wisdom and darkness, who sought to shatter the chains of the Force and guide her companions towards a new understanding. Remember, dear listener, that the Force is not bound by the definitions of Jedi and Sith, but rather by the choices we make and the truths we dare to uncover.\n\nP.S.

Bear that in mind.[/i]\n\nSo, I think the first thing to note is that I\u2019m in a clear minority here. KotOR 2 has a good reputation and I think I can see why. The shifting perspectives, the deep dives into lore and the discussions on morality are aspects of this game that you didn\u2019t, and to some extent still don\u2019t, see very much in games. With that said, I don\u2019t think KotOR 2 succeeds very well in its aims. The development was troubled, and it shows; the game is messy and constrained, with mostly flat characters and a conflicted story. I will explain further what I mean below, but know that I played the first game before this, and the sequel feels so much older to play despite sharing a lot of the same DNA. If you want a TLDR, that would be it.\n\nLets begin at the beginning, because it\u2019s pretty bad. You start as a Jedi on the run, with the Republic in shambles. Only five years have passed since the end of KotOR 1, and I say \u201conly\u201d because your victory in that game didn\u2019t seem to matter for the galaxy at large. Already a bit of a blow, making your actions meaningless in hindsight, but it\u2019s not a huge issue. What is an issue is the mining station you\u2019re stuck on. Two words: Corridors and droids. For five hours or more you are stuck running down limited paths, pushing a few buttons and fighting a lot of the same droid through section after section. There is a plot point connected to it, but it\u2019s weak when you consider that the cost is a tedious barrage of claustrophobic levels. On top of that, you only speak to a total of three (four if you count the R2-D2 clone) characters in the whole station. It\u2019s the worst part of the game, and that this was the first impression they chose to give boggles my mind.\n\nThe next planet isn\u2019t much better, but the game does gradually improve further down the runtime. With that said, the linearity and narrow levels does continue to be a problem pretty much throughout. I believe that it resulted from an attempt to solve a problem of KotOR 1, the fact that there was a lot of running back and forth between quest objectives; but instead of filling the empty space, they ended up shrinking the environments instead. They also leaned much too hard on combat encounters, with a lot of quests feeling like you\u2019re just running from one group of enemies to another (often within eyesight of each other, breaking immersion in the process when they just stand around as you kill their friends). The shifts in perspective, where you end up controlling characters other than your main, are absolutely ruined by this, turning an interesting mechanic into a chore as you simply fight a bunch of goons without your biggest gun.\n\nThese problems also reveal other technical limitations. Pathing is the one area where I thought that KotOR 2 had really improved, it\u2019s much smoother and your party members actually get out of the way when you want to walk past them. However, with how cramped the environments are, there are also more corners to get stuck on; and when fights are frequent, you might just suddenly realise that you\u2019re missing someone. The targeting system is another part of this problem, as your party members automatically attack any enemy they can see if combat is initiated. This means that if another group is off in the distance but inactive, your party will run off to attack them. Thus, one fight might very well chain into several in a row, all while you\u2019re constantly swearing at your supposed friends. To add to this, there is just a lot of jank: If a party member is wielding a long weapon, the tip of it will wave in front of your camera while walking around, which is fun. Cutscenes chain together if several different triggers happen at once, which happens several times and feels awkward every time, as you\u2019re thrown from one event to the next. There is a truly delicious bug I ran into at the very end of the game, where dialogue started skipping because of a memory leak, causing me to miss crucial conversations. Again, this game feels [b]old[/b] and on top of installing all the mods to fix problems, I had to wrangle with this game far more than the first.\n\nOn the same theme, there is the influence system. In the game, you can gain or lose influence with your party members, replacing the conversations being unlocked by leveling up in KotOR 1 with topics that get unlocked by influence. Sounds great \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t absolutely broken, that is. You can get influence with most characters by simply approaching and talking to them, so what happens is this: You approach a party member you just recruited, talk to them to know more about them and end up gaining enough influence to unlock one of locked topics. Then you go through that topic, and you get even more influence, enough to unlock the next one... [b]You can unlock every influence-based topic and max out your influence with most characters in one conversation[/b]. I don\u2019t know if it was somehow intended, but it feels extremely artificial, like your party members are puppets with canned responses that only activate by the right sequence of voice commands. Did I mention that the characters are flat in this game?\n\nAlright, maybe I should go into that a bit more, because I\u2019m sure that a lot of people actually do like the characters. They are likable enough, I liked the way that they interact with each other and argue with you, dialogue is better than the first game and they all have involved backstories. The problem is, I know a lot [u]about[/u] these characters, but I don\u2019t [i]know[/i] them. Their wants and needs for the future, their doubts and their guilt, what haunts them at night \u2013 nothing comes through. Instead, they\u2019re dark side or light side bots, only challenging you to make you think about your alignment and never having the opportunity to be challenged themselves. They never go beyond the character concept to become people. This is something the first game did better for several of its characters and it got lost here. \n\nMaybe that is because this game is so focused around the main character, the Exile, and your alignment. The whole story seems to be centered around questioning the dark and light side divide, with several choices that are delightfully challenging where you have to start thinking about what is moral for you, not about what is light and dark. This and the deep and human discussions about the Force and how it and its users affect people are the best parts of the game, and they are great. Sadly, it\u2019s not reflected in the gameplay, and it doesn\u2019t last. You get huge stat bonuses if you go towards the extremes, making it still a game about choosing light or dark; there are no incentives for choosing a greyer path. The plot also loses its grounded quality in galaxy-shattering Force powers, doomsday weapons and cartoony villains. There are plot points that are never resolved or forgotten entirely, with contradictions and anticlimaxes as a result. As such, even the best part of the game is troubled, which didn\u2019t help my overall impression of the game.\n\nI see a lot of people say that KotOR 2 is a great game. But I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t see the greatness. It\u2019s not a terrible game, it\u2019s fully playable and you might have fun with it, but there are so many games that are better than this. If you want to play some gaming history I would say go for it, though if you play the first one instead you actually get a great game on top. Otherwise, it\u2019s just too mangled and messy for me to recommend in good conscience.", "timestamp_created": 1679505774, "timestamp_updated": 1679505912, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.44932284951210022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135141350": {"recommendationid": "135141350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315092359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "playtime_at_review": 9851, "last_played": 1700682567}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Good.

This game made my childhood and it got me into RPG-style games. I remember not knowing how to play it and all I wanted to do was swing my lightsaber around and fight bad guys lol \n\n(Coming from the creators of Fallout New Vegas, which is considered to be the best Fallout game of all time, you're in for a ride.) \n\nThen i got older and figured out you can basically become a god in this game if you choose your powers and equipment carefully or find powerful gear if the RNG lets you. As you may figure out, there's a limited amount of loot you can actually get. I miss these days of gaming where every item actually has a purpose and is usable instead of just being junk or \"crafting materials\" that you'll never use. This game revolutionized what crafting in an RPG can truly be. If you actually put points into Repair or Treat Injury, you'll be able to craft some of the best items in the game. Newer games should take a look at this one and realize that if you put well-seasoned writers and good caring developers into the mix, you'll be unstoppable. \n\nHowever, I loathe to see what this game might be if it was made in modern times. I imagine I'd see a battlepass or mountains of DLC that contain shitty costumes. It's simplistic and minimalist without losing any valuable luster. Most games these days have tons of numbers, colors, and text flashing on the screen bordering on satirical that does nothing but trigger sensory overload and just make the experience overall unenjoyable. Add the pleasant UI into the dark, cloudy ambience, delve-worthy dialogue and lore, interesting characters and plot lines, menacing villains (one of which is comparable to an eldritch horror), and fun combat and you got a game that deserves all the praise it gets. Granted it was rushed toward the end and the devs had to cut corners, but modders today finished their work and made the game all the more memorable. Not to mention this game took a turn from the cartoonish, diabolical villains and cutscenes and made into a game with lore and backstory as deep as the mariana trench and dialogue that brings about questioning of real life morals. \n\nALSO: one last thing. The dialogue options are highly flexible according to the situation and allows you to place your own spin on the story depending on what you pick. You can go from a fallen jedi looking to revive the sith empire, an embarrassed exile looking to redeem their past sins, a beleaguered apprentice looking to get revenge on those who cast them out and cutting down sith, jedi, friend, foe, or whoever gets in their way, or a hesitant force-sensitive hero who is forced to pick up a lightsaber once again and fight an enemy that is worse than death itself. \n\nThere are games.

Yet this theme is contradicted through game play by making the player choose either the \"Good\" or \"Evil\" choice in dialogue options.\n\nAs for gameplay, there is none. Combat is so dated, and it tries to be smarter than it really is. Just put your XP points into force lightning, and charisma, you'll end up destroying every fight and skill check the game has to offer. There's no reason to fill your party full of jedi other than the fact that a certain character will get locked into a 1v1 boss fight with a villain later in the game, and if you never touched them once, you'll be soft locked and unable to progress forward. In my case it was Atton, against Darth Sion. \n\nI could forgive the poor RPG elements, and poor gameplay, if the story at least had a worthwhile conclusion. Unfortunately the ending is just boring. Darth Nihilus is one of the biggest missed opportunities, and there's zero satisfaction in defeating a character that was built up as a massive threat, due to how little the game actually does with him. Sion ends up being a dialogue skill check boss fight, and Darth _____  just sequel baits in the final fight before the game abruptly ends\n\nAll of it's problems are even further exasperated by the fact that KOTOR III didn't even exist to capitalize on what II spent so long setting up. SWTOR and the EU novels attempted to provide some closure, but they clearly weren't what the original vision was, and Revan was given such a lackluster fate. \n\nKOTOR II is a disappointing sequel, both as an RPG and a story.

The game has well-crafted settings, from it's diverse planets, unique cultures, the people and creatures you'll come across that shows one area isn't like the others as you explore, which can be appreciated by Star Wars fans.\n\nOne of the biggest strengths KOTOR II has is the large variety/freedom of choice you can have. A player can be a gun-toting smuggler like Han Solo, or a righteous Jedi such as the Skywalkers to put an example up. Your choices when interacting with your companions and the story as a whole do have an impact on how they are influenced by your decisions and what those consequences could be. \n\nOverall, if you've played other RPGs, this game is one I'll recommend you to play.

I know for some people this might not be a good sell, but to truly appreciate this game as the developers intended, I would recommend the Restored Content mod which as the name implies restores some of the content that was cut and also helps with patching the more serious bugs in the game. Highly recommended.\n\nBesides the Restored Content, the gameplay is similar to the first with all its pros and cons that come with it but there are some improvements like the crafting system has been expanded for instance giving the player more options how they can customize their character and companions. The powers have been expanded upon as well that one gains as they play through the game which makes playing as say a Jedi Consular more interesting and fun. The game also introduces the Lightsaber & Force forms which like the powers and crafting gives the player more options on how they want to approach the combat in the game.\n\nThe companion system of the first game has been improved, giving the player 12 instead of 10 of the first game. Some companions are exclusive to certain alignments and genders (ex. Hanharr & Mira). There is a system in the game that lets the player gain or lose 'Influence' over a character which gives the player more options for their playthrough. For those who played the first game, some companions form the first game appear here but I'll let you find who those companions are.\n\nMark Griskey's soundtrack is fantastic, it keeps that Star Wars feeling that you all know and love but enhances it as it complements the game's dark undertones and conveys the appropriate mood for each scene.\n\nFinally we get to the story/setting of KOTOR 2. The game is set about 5 years after the events of KOTOR 1, the Republic is at its worst point from the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil Wars, the Sith are back but stronger than ever, and the Jedi are either dead or hiding. Very grim setting we have here, which goes well with the themes that the game explores which makes it unique from other Star Wars stories. Without gushing over it and giving spoilers, the game improves over the sequel in terms of the plot, setting, themes, and characters in the game. The game with its dark setting, memorable dialogue, carefully crafted plot, villains that outshine the first game's antagonist, memorable characters, and themes dealing with the Force and the Light/Dark side conflict. \n\nFor those who played the first game, its not as well known but you can alter somewhat how the first game ended with your character without getting into spoilers like when you talk to a character named Atton in the first hour in the game, you guys talk about KOTOR 1 and the fate of your character. The only things you can change is if your character was either Male or Female and Light Side or Dark Side. Once you pick the options you want, your character in the first game would be referred to as the options you picked for the rest of KOTOR 2. Again this section is only for those who played KOTOR 1.\n\nSo, all in all, highly recommended, you won't regret it. I recommend that you play KOTOR 1, get the Restored Content mod for this game, and be immersed into one of the greatest if not possibly the greatest Star Wars story of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1677230455, "timestamp_updated": 1677230455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133466200": {"recommendationid": "133466200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198932189732", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1632734468}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, hands down, the greatest story in all of Star Wars.

Doing more with less. It is dedicated to \u2018art.\u2019[/i]\n\n[i]Secondary dedication: to the fourth proton core that never quite triggers for me.[/i]\n\nKnights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is a fantastic game. It is one of my favorite games along with the original.\n\nWhat can I say? I love the setting, the characterizations, voice acting, galactic conflict, and universal themes\u2014not to mention the lightsabers and Ithorians, man. It even includes a token Wookie (Leave Mira alone, you herculean fuzzball.)\n\nFor me, playing this game is like reading a favorite novella or comic book. Warts and all I truly enjoy the unfolding narrative. And the concept that a force user could become so unbelievably out of plumb as to threaten life on the scale depicted in the story is terrifying\u2026 [spoiler]Given the right circumstances, they have the potential to become wounds in the force; that is, walking black holes capable of wiping out life in the universe. Bruh, that ain\u2019t good[/spoiler] well, no spoilers here, move along. Let\u2019s just say that I can understand why the rank and file have difficulty differentiating between Jedi and Sith. The story makes a good case for hunting down all force users and their little dogs too\u2026\n\nAnd yet, this review would be remiss without mentioning the things that plague my playthroughs; that is, the galling turret vs. ships battle (only one, but I despised it\u2026 ok, ok\u2026 picky picky), the turret vs. Sith battle (Boooo!) and the ridiculously laborious swoop racing. Ugh. Your mileage may vary, but I truly despise those mini-games. Pazaak is still fun nevertheless. I also did not enjoy the random loot. There is a whole heck of a lot of it; and it is mostly irritating junk. Don't hate, bro. That's just how I see it.\n\n[i]Kotor II[/i] is entertaining. I just have a grand time playing. I find it fun visiting the planets, engaging in quests, and fighting for a better (or worse) tomorrow for the Republic.\n\nIf you want to give it a go, there are some very talented mod makers who create quality of life, gameplay, and graphic upgrades.

Definitely download the restored content mod for your first playthrough, it's pretty essential as the game shipped half finished. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1676488974, "timestamp_updated": 1676488974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132914009": {"recommendationid": "132914009", "author": {"steamid": "76561199272027437", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "playtime_at_review": 2205, "last_played": 1699647349}, "language": "english", "review": "best star wars ive played...not really.. but should be mandatory  before anyone is allowed to talk about star wars", "timestamp_created": 1676487867, "timestamp_updated": 1676487867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132908538": {"recommendationid": "132908538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036026934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2372, "last_played": 1677276308}, "language": "english", "review": "An all-classic.

Keep in mind if you want the game to run correctly you might have issues.\n\nStory, is much better then i remember\n\nAesthetics, have been updated from the 2004 version they look decent but you can mod them further.\n\nWorkshop integration, very surprising works great haven't run into many issues for the mods i've installed. I highly recommend modding, at the very least if you run into a bug and blame the mod you can usually find out it wasn't the mod and the .ini folder is just wrong.\n\nBugs, They \"patched\" a few of them since 2004 however the steam version's Ini file has borked coding and cutscenes crash your game there are \"fixes\" to these problems, that you'll probably have to bounce around the internet and forums that are 7-8 years old of people figuring out how to fix them.\n\nIs it Fun? i bought this purely because I bought the first one. KoToR 1 was one of my favorite game when i was a kid. Came free when I got my Xbox. When KoToR 2 dropped i was so excited. The bugs made it hard but i had for sure way more playtime of KoToR 2 over 1. I bought it purely for nostalgia, if it wasn't for the bugs KoToR 2 would be WAY better than KoToR 1. Even with the bugs it's probably still more enjoyable, with the new mechanics and rework on the mini games.\n\nI'd say this game is a 6/10, if you somehow don't have bugs i'm sure you're ranking would be way higher. Once you figure out how to fix the issues i'd say its a solid 8/10 but you have to work on it. Even then you'll probably still have grass textures strenched across dantooine.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1676035807, "timestamp_updated": 1676035807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132507269": {"recommendationid": "132507269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032137395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1407, "last_played": 1676272904}, "language": "english", "review": "games great but you cant run it above 60hz or even on a monitor that goes above 60hz, have to change my refresh rate in nvidia control panel down to 60hz whenever i wanna play otherwise great game\n", "timestamp_created": 1676012737, "timestamp_updated": 1676012737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132494910": {"recommendationid": "132494910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159055058", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4183, "last_played": 1678930315}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put: this is the greatest game ever made.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD.

While it shares many aspects, and I think the first one's story has a much better endgame, Sith Lords manages to have a much better flow to its gameplay loop, and also unlike the first game, I actually want to return to it and do another playthrough. Overall, I had a lot more fun in the minute to minute gameplay compared to KOTOR 1, which honestly felt more novelty then pure fun. Additionally, I think your party is a bit more memorable than the first game, although I think that might just be my personal preference.\n\nMy biggest complaint (aside from the bugs, which I still believe to be the biggest detractor for both this game and the previous) is that it doesn't really feel \"complete\". Almost like I was missing large parts of the game and story, and planets felt a lot smaller than they should've been, while \"dungeons\" (locations where there is nothing to do but kill and loot) felt empty and a bit too long for what they needed to be.\n\nWith all that said, however, if you had fun with the first game, I think I can confidently recommend this one as well.", "timestamp_created": 1674930542, "timestamp_updated": 1674930542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131726878": {"recommendationid": "131726878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018900716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1611, "last_played": 1675022658}, "language": "spanish", "review": "kotor2 =UwU=", "timestamp_created": 1674914641, "timestamp_updated": 1674914641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131720821": {"recommendationid": "131720821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970551896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2131, "last_played": 1674908517}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game 8.4/10 \ni highly recommend this game, however you need to download the restored content mod the game is almost unplayable without it.\nAlso if you have problems with the camera spinning follow this guide:\"\n\ngo to where you have installed it so for example go here\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Knights of the Old Republic II\n\nthen open a file called (swplayer) open it then find this\n\n[Control Options]\nEnable ScreenEdgeCameraTurn=1\n\nand change it to 0 so it should look like this\n\nEnable ScreenEdgeCameraTurn=0\n\nthen close it but but make sure you save it,\n\nEvery time you are on a new planet the camera will start rotating so just save and restart the game", "timestamp_created": 1674908810, "timestamp_updated": 1674908810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131702226": {"recommendationid": "131702226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064002064", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3404, "last_played": 1444532620}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as the first game, but still worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1674885260, "timestamp_updated": 1674885260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131677972": {"recommendationid": "131677972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122335465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 195, "last_played": 1698498389}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game but keeps crashing!!!", "timestamp_created": 1674853543, "timestamp_updated": 1674853543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131672541": {"recommendationid": "131672541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091526667", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1924, "last_played": 1676310055}, "language": "english", "review": "its kotor!

Be as it may with all the technical limitations of it's time, the game shines as a true spectacle of character building, narrative and design. \nIn order to avoid spoillers, all i want to evaluate here is the impact KOTOR 2 had on both my view of Star Wars and of the ways in which storytelling can be crafted for playing. \nFirst of all: I feel as if this was the essential bit of content that the franchise needed to leave a strong impression in me. Even from the perspective of 2023 and all the new stuff coming out, I was never impressed about the way in which their stories were built or delivered because they never got to change the nature of perspective and leave the hero-villain tunnel for a more wild and free storytelling of how the forces of status quo and chaos might play out. This is all personal taste, of course, but it leads me to appreciate even more of the capacities of a player-based medium, because only as a game it could have been possible to challenge a long tradition of archetypical narration and boring characters, only as a game does the storytelling invites us to think of how perspective is an inherent bond and neutrality is impossible.\nI recognize, of course, that the story is built of all the typical characters Star Wars content has to offer, but the effects of maneuvering through the complex array of choices and motivations as the exile, the one who unites these people and directs them (in a gameplay sense), is what really attracted me. Honestly, it'sooooo cool to explore all the ways in which one could fight, talk, and get to know the rich lore KOTOR has to offer; I loved to feel immersed in the technical aspects of gameplay when we build our fighting scheme and allignments. \nWell, this far i mostly talked about how games where choice matters are awesome, and indeed they are, but there's something in KOTOR that makes it feel even more special: the narrative. The story of a Jedi exile who roams the galaxy forever alone for reasons to be discovered, and overcome, is great!!! Really, we as players are allowed to fit perfectly into the galaxy far far way because of great design choices that led storytelling in a direction that challenges perspective, makes it intovbonding. The characters of this world are not just figures of a lager myth, but perspectives in which we throw ourselves and by whom we  try to understand this huge world, and our role in it. \nWell, i feel i've talked too much about it (even though i played it for 50 hours and that's crazy, I never do that), but there's always more to be gained from experiencing it.

If you can handle old games then buy it, it\u00b4s one of the best of the classic.\nIt\u00b4s basically a game in the star wars universe in which you control a squad of members that level up with you, each one with his own personality and skills. It\u00b4s a RPG choice-making game. And the choices here are awesome, they mean something, you can finish missions in different ways.\nThere was just one thing that annoyed me a lot, it was the dialogue with our partners, once a conversation has already been done it should be deleted to unclutter the conversation, and to avoid always hearing the same stuff to know if there is something new to say, because of this it seems those particular conversations don\u00b4t have any meaning. Also the relationship with your partners seems much worse than the first game, it seems as though it doesn\u00b4t develop a lot, for example, I just had 1 dialogue with Bau-Dur the entire game lol.\nThis is basically the same quality has the first game, the difference is the first game has better story and characters, this one has better UI, switchable weapons, achievements and controller support.

Peragus.\n\nThis game plays terribly; dated MMO combat, game breaking technical issues at high frame rates, and the obviously bad 2003 graphics. Yet, it's one of the most interesting RPGs I've ever played.\n\nThe writing of this game is the star of the show; Kreia being the obvious crown jewel of it. Still, there's a lot more to get out of this game than just her, and if you plan to play it I implore you to explore the stories of every party member and try to get their influence up as much as you can (which means going out of your way to use them, don't just rely on your Jedi friends to help you). \n\nUnlike the original KOTOR, there are almost no standout side quests, but I think that actually works out in the end. The writers are much more focused on characters in this game, and because of that, all the quests (even the main one) are designed with the intention of showing off your party members' personal philosophies; with them frequently interjecting and arguing with your choices. This would also happen in the first game, but with the addition of the influence system it actually makes a difference this time; it also doesn't just devolve into lightside-darkside bickering like it always would in that game. The influence system is just genius--you being able to change your party members' force affinities adds so much depth to the game, and allows for so many more possibilities in how your party ends up. I hate that other RPGs don't follow in this one's footsteps when it comes to your party; it's the best ever. Also for those who are fans of Fallout: New Vegas, you will be happy to know that skill based dialogue options actually originate from this game, and are as good as you would hope (spec into wisdom if you want more dialogue btw).\n\nThe main quest's ending is unfinished, plain and simple. The restored content mod (which you can easily add from the Steam Workshop) tries to alleviate this, but it can only do so much. Bao-Dur's fate is never explained, HK-47's final segment is a slog, it's so disjointed that almost nothing makes any sense, and it's ultimately an anti-climactic finish to what should have been a clear home-run wrap-up to everything that was so expertly setup. But what is there is great, and I'm glad if anything that Kreia's plot was fully completed--seems that was the main objective for them.\n\nIt may seem like I'm torn on whether or not to like this game, but no it's great. A must play if you like RPGs, not just if you like Star Wars. I could see someone waiting for an inevitable remake (arguable whether or not it's inevitable), and you would definitely get a better experience, but what is here is definitely worthwhile even today.", "timestamp_created": 1672033019, "timestamp_updated": 1672033997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129286319": {"recommendationid": "129286319", "author": {"steamid": "76561199033246841", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3363, "last_played": 1672156057}, "language": "spanish", "review": "q", "timestamp_created": 1672007885, "timestamp_updated": 1672007885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129268311": {"recommendationid": "129268311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226625980", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11481, "last_played": 1681183157}, "language": "english", "review": "great immersive game", "timestamp_created": 1671991261, "timestamp_updated": 1671991261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129262070": {"recommendationid": "129262070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975963408", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 342, "last_played": 1674896813}, "language": "english", "review": "The first level has to be done in a very specific manner or there is a glitch that requires a complete restart.

The world-building, like most obsidian games, is the main essence of the game; in order to experience the world-building players must endure the first 2 chapters, spanning a minimum of 4 hours if all areas and quests are fully explored. These areas are monotonous and the quests are linear but provide 2 paths, each that will always play out the same way. Dialogue options will change variably for seemingly no reason, players cannot choose to engage in combat, the other characters of the game will always initiate. Player micro-agency is minimized and instead the only meaningful choices lie on the grander scale such as which faction you will align with.

Lot of builds are able to beat the game making the character building fun, in fact I just beat the game using only blasters and no lightsaber and it was one of the funnest playthroughs I ever did.\n\n100% recommend picking this game up it is well worth the money and will give you many hours of a narrative side of Star Wars that has never been explored before!", "timestamp_created": 1671661260, "timestamp_updated": 1671661260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128979269": {"recommendationid": "128979269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252736042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7934, "last_played": 1671815329}, "language": "english", "review": "With the restored content mod, this is easily one of the greatest Star Wars games ever created.", "timestamp_created": 1671646584, "timestamp_updated": 1671646584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128963794": {"recommendationid": "128963794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348090864", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1677473432}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game but worse than the first one", "timestamp_created": 1671625923, "timestamp_updated": 1671625923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128951986": {"recommendationid": "128951986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385671462", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 115, "last_played": 1671422567}, "language": "english", "review": "Aside from the nuanced story and memorable characters, KOTOR II's gameplay has aged well.

7212, "last_played": 1670947654}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game (and its predecessor) over decades much, much more then Steam counter shows. For me it\u2019s one of GOATs. It just hit me that KotOR series is basically a forerunner for Mass Effect. Of course, ME is using newer/better engine and gameplay is different, much more leaning to action game then RPG, but there are a lot of similar gameplay mechanics to be found.\n\nFor those not aware, the series is set ~ four thousand years before the original Star Wars films, telling the story of the conflict between the original (Old) Republic and the Sith Empire (or so you would think). But as one character explains, conflict was never between Siths and Republic, but between Siths and Jedi Order, and Republic is just collateral damage.\nThis timeline has some of the most memorable bad guys in all of Star Wars. One is Darth Sion, a \u201cwalking corpse\u201d Sith Lord who is for all things and purposes immortal, shear force of his hate for everything, everyone and their mothers is keeping him alive/in one piece. Second is Darth Nihilus, essentially a Sith ghost, with very cool mask, who eats planets, or to be more precise, all the life from the hole planet, bacteria, and everything else included. There is excellent comic series published by Dark Horse comics, \u201cStar Wars: The Old Republic\u201d consisting of ~50 episode, that expands story of first game and explains some things that are happening in second one.\n\nIf you, like me, are fan of dark humour and irony in abundance, you will adore HK-47. That droid deserves his own (comedy?) show on Disney+. Writer(s) responsible for him should get some award for life achievement.\n\n[i]\"Recitation: Yes, as I said, I am an assassin droid. It is my primary function to burn holes through meatbags that you wish removed from the galaxy\u2026 Master. Oh, how I hate that term.\"[/i]\n\n[i]\"Mockery: Am I all right? Oh, yes, Master, why, I am fine. Statement: I mean, I have only just been re-activated, only to find that there are sub-standard duplicates of me running all over the galaxy, corroding my good name. But if they are, in fact, hunting you, then I look forward to the opportunity to meet these units\u2014and educate them in proper assassination protocols.\"[/i] ~ HK-47\n\nContrary to the first game, in KOTOR 2 you explore the dark(er) side of the galaxy and results of the war from the first game. To some extent, dialogs get to be philosophical in explorations of cause and effect that is often overlooked in other Star Wars games and especially movies. You get to realise that to the rest of the galaxy Jedi and Siths are same thing. People of Dantooine despise the Jedi for things that the Siths have done. In their eyes these are \u201ctwo factions of same religion\u201d, to use that metaphor, as almost all Siths are fallen Jedi. KotOR 2 is, at least to my knowledge, one of few games that try to depict how conflict changes people and world/galaxy.\n\nMandalorian war, that predates events of first game was in essence covert campaign for converting Jedi to Sith. Jedi would be mentally broken (if not physically) as results of being surrounded with killing and death on such scale, after which they would just \u201cslide\u201d to the dark(er) side. Most of the game\u2019s important characters are veterans or had their lives and identities shattered by warfare. KotOR 2 feels like the closest Star Wars ever comes to recognising the endless cycle of war, death, and destruction that the Sith and Jedi have doomed the galaxy to.\n\n Only thing that was left for me to say, for any first-timer or someone who is returning after long time it that \u201cTSL Restored Content Mod\u201d is a MUST and with it opportunity to play one mission solo as HK-47 in quest \u201cHK-50 factory\u201d. \u201cM4-78 Enhancement Project\u201d is fascinating peace of moding, but it\u2019s too buggy for my liking and I had a lot of problems with it :-/. \nOther things that you should \u201cinstall\u201d are \u201cKotOR 2 Remastered (AI Upscaled) Cutscenes\u201d, \u201cKotOR 2 Unlimited World Texture Mod\u201d, \u201cHigh Quality Skyboxes II\u201d, \u201cK2 Portrait Restored\u201d, \u201cUltimate Character Overhaul -REDUX-\u201c, \u201cUltimate Dantooine High Resolution\u201d, \u201cUltimate Dxun High Resolution\u201d, \u201cUltimate Korriban High Resolution\u201d, \u201cUltimate Malachor V High Resolution\u201d, \u201cUltimate Onderon High Resolution\u201d and finally \u201cUltimate Nar Shaddaa High Resolution\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to see Witcher 3 level of graphics after this texture packs are in place, after all this is game from 2005, but it is much nicer than original ones.\nOver & out.", "timestamp_created": 1670960944,

Even though this game is nearly two decades old, it is still quite fun to play...the only downside is that the game was unfinished when it was released, and some content that was important to the story ended up on the cutting room floor.

The graphics have also aged well for a game created in 2004 due to the style that the developers chose, which is slightly cartoony but realistic enough to take seriously. \n\nThe companions are more compellingly written and more interactive than most RPGs that I have ever played, both old and modern. My favorites were Atton, Kreia, the Handmaiden and Visas (in no particular order). Even the player character has a backstory, and although some details are set, you get the opportunity to determine this backstory through dialogue (which feels uniquely reactive). \n\nThe plot of the game is very intriguing, because its key characters defy and criticize the Light Side (typically Jedi) / Dark Side (typically Sith) binary of Star Wars. It has a political backstory that you actually care about, unlike the Prequel movies. Still, the game ultimately suffers from the very LS/DS binary that its characters nearly break down. For example, the dialogue is usually nuanced, but sometimes boils down to \"I will help you!\" or \"I will kill you!\" with nothing in-between. This is very forgivable in the grand scheme of things.\n\nMy only problems with this so far are on gender locking (ex: gender-locked companions), the sexualization of female characters, and the small amount of content. Sparse content make sense for a game created in 2004, especially one that was as rushed as KOTOR 2, but the sexualization in the character design and interactions of some of the companions is incredibly ridiculous, especially for characters who are otherwise very well-written.\n\nDefinitely play this game if you want a very compelling party-based RPG.

Then I strongly recommend playing 2 on here as it already has mods for the restored content and it is GOOD, and will be good and better and maybe the Switch version will compare to it once the content becomes an actual part of the game like they promised.", "timestamp_created": 1669084497, "timestamp_updated": 1669084497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125879851": {"recommendationid": "125879851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205183392", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2745, "last_played": 1669067261}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game since i was like 10 years old.

Coming off hot from Bioware's KotOR 1, this game turns it up to 11 and flips the typical Star Wars story formula on it's head, turning a rather simplistic light vs dark space fantasy adventure story into a darker and more nuanced interpretation of the universe. Instead of being a galactic adventure like in the first game, this game's story is more focused on isolation and survival against hidden forces. It's a very introspective story that questions a lot of the norms presented in the SW universe.\n\nThe gameplay is based on 3rd edition D&D and is piss easy. For newer players, you might find it challenging until just over halfway, where enemies inexplicably stop scaling with your level and cap out at level 20. I suspect this was carried over from the first game when the level cap was 20. The result is the later half of the game becomes a snooze-fest with no real challenge. The real challenge comes in understanding the game's archaic mechanics and how effectively build your character. There's a few options for different builds which lends to replayability, along with the choice to play either light or dark (Not neutral, though, unless you like gimping your build).\n\nSoundtrack is fully orchestral, sounds great but the ingame music looping can feel a bit janky.\n\nIt is a must to play this with Restored Content mod. The retail release is an incredibly stripped down version of what was meant to be. I don't know what it is with old school Obsidian, but they must have loved taking on projects with short deadlines because this has to be one of the most unfinished games ever released. From gameplay issues, to entire plotlines and character arcs staying unresolved forever (For example, the HK Factory existed in the retail release, but was totally inaccessible in-game no matter what, and rather than removing all references to it, the plot-line just hangs midway for eternity with no way to resolve it.), its just not worth playing vanilla for an objectively inferior experience. TSLRCM takes cut dialogue, voice lines, maps, items, quests (both side & main) etc... that was already on-disk and puts it all back where it was supposed to be in a cohesive way. It's not perfect, and not everything made it back in, but it's an incredible feat to be able to restore the game as close to it's intended vision as possible, and even the original developers themselves endorse this mod as the definitive way to play!", "timestamp_created": 1667046241, "timestamp_updated": 1667047508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124556901": {"recommendationid": "124556901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865608088", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 668, "last_played": 1667351354}, "language": "english", "review": "iv have always loved this games every one should play it once", "timestamp_created": 1667002010, "timestamp_updated": 1667002010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124520040": {"recommendationid": "124520040", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387779796", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 688, "last_played": 1667914304}, "language": "english", "review": "had this on the OG xbox and loved it, still holds up today due to a fantastic story, great characters and great pacing. highly recommended to RPG fans and star wars fanatics.", "timestamp_created": 1666957994, "timestamp_updated": 1666957994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124509212": {"recommendationid": "124509212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366657820", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5346, "last_played": 1666941745}, "language": "english", "review": "one of my favorites", "timestamp_created": 1666941767, "timestamp_updated": 1666941767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124494790": {"recommendationid": "124494790", "author": {"steamid": "76561199184994017", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1671325784}, "language": "english", "review": "Great in 09 and great now!

Even with the the restored content mod there's quite a lot i personally find to be just way too stripped back.

KOTOR 1 is a classic game and Star Wars story, but I would say flaws and all this game is too. In fact I find KOTOR 2 way more intriguing and I honestly hate how they did my man Revan In the Old Republic MMO. KOTOR 3 would've been nice but this game kind of leaves it open ended with questions on what was truly out there that had Revan so worried and willing to skirt the line of the dark and light but more importantly the general line of right and wrong. \nAnd i find that to be the most interesting part of unraveling this story, it made question what it truly meant to be a sith or jedi and opened my eyes to the grand ego and ignorance of the jedi order i never really thought about as a kid much growing up. \nThis game is also filled with interesting and unique character interactions and dialogue, unless it's aliens then its the same 9 audio clips. Your companions you meet along the way are fun and very interesting, It's easy to miss a lot about each one of these people because if they aren't tied directly into the main plot at hand, you may only scratch the surface of who they really are. \nOverall, i think it's better than the first, and better than anything that followed in the MMO.

Though the ending (without spoilers) didn\u2019t set me right, as it did leave off as a hinting of continuation for the third installment (which spoiler alert, the game was canceled long ago. So it will never see the day of light ever again). Graphics have been improved, combat is even better, and the companions are quite fleshed out. They\u2019re quite humorous and even have more character than the first one, as the first one they did but most of the time either argue or just annoy the hell out of you. \n\nBut this game is more fleshed out, as the atmosphere was quite outstanding. Even seeing the outside of Ebon Hawk from inside while warping lightspeed. It gave areas more life and depth, than like the stereotypical 2d background. There\u2019s more stuff you could do and even the stuff they brought back from the first game. They took the time to even expand it like swoop bike racing. Even though the story is longer than the first one, it feels easier to level up and gain credits. Since the first game it took maybe 2-3 hours to see a level up.  Now in this game you would see a level up every hour or so, depending on your grinding XP. \n\nNow onto the cons of things. They did fix the cutscene problems I had, but the dialogue is still a problem. Such as if the game has been running for too long, as sometimes if you get into dialogue. It goes into mach 5 and skips every line of dialogue, as if you are spamming the mouse to the point that your finger bone is broken in many ways. Which leaves you dumbfounded at the end of picking a choice of dialogue to something you didn\u2019t get a single lick of knowledge about. It irritated me, as you have to save and restart the whole game. Which would fix it temporarily for the time being. Another slight bug, which I didn\u2019t mention in the first game review. That after combat, you just get stuck out of nowhere. Such that you don\u2019t move anymore, but the only way to fix that is just to press X to make your character flex then it will fix itself. \n\nNow for the rating of this game, which is 9/10. Because the cutscene bugs or crashes from the first game didn\u2019t transfer over, but the original story of the first is a bit better, as this one is still really good. It just the story on this one still kinda left me scratching my head at times.", "timestamp_created": 1663923915, "timestamp_updated": 1663923915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122648068": {"recommendationid": "122648068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145689780", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 377, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1663875012}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a lot of good stuff to be said about the game.\nThe graphics are nicer than in the first game.\nThe game has an interesting story, including the cooler legends Mandalorians.\nThe game has a modern save feature, which is something I always appreciate.\nThe story branches off in the direction you desire.\nThe music still star wars still good.\nAnd you can play with a controller.\n \nHowever, the menus and inventory management are still really annoying.\nThe combat is like the first game very hit or miss, and I think it's gonna be a miss for me.\noverall a 6/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1663877534, "timestamp_updated": 1663877534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563658058643341064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122600424": {"recommendationid": "122600424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131156928", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 16689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6500, "last_played": 1668185860}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has been out long enough to hear the negative things that people have to say about it.  \n\nThat being said, this game is honestly pretty solid all around if you're looking for a laid back d20 RPG to play through.  \n\nIs it better than KOTOR 1?

When KOTOR released, Revenge of the Sith hadn\u2019t come out yet, and the notion that Jedi and Sith were two sides of the same coin was still an uncomfortable one for much of the audience. \n\nOn top of that, there were several popular Star Wars games at the time (like Jedi Knight) that let you make the choice to play as a Light Side or Dark Side user. These games were VERY binaristic. You could be a saint who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly\u2026or you could butcher orphans. Nuance wasn\u2019t exactly thick in the air - these stories tended towards schlocky escapism.  \n\nKOTOR 2 took an active stance against this trend. Light or Dark, Jedi or Sith, whoever you are is immaterial - the story of this game was written to challenge your commitment to an absolute philosophy. Your fantasies of pure good and pure evil are not welcome here.\n\nThe heart and soul of the game is Kreia, the mysterious old woman who appoints herself your mentor. She has no interest in teaching you how to be a Jedi Knight - she\u2019s more interested in teaching you how to be a human being. Almost twenty years on and people are still arguing about Kreia online - by that metric, I\u2019d call her one of the most successful characters in video games.\n\nSure, on the surface, this is an incredible party-building RPG with lightsaber and blaster based combat. Underneath that, it\u2019s a philosophical treatise, nestled within one of the largest and most successful intellectual properties of all time. It took what Lucas started and ran with it.\n\nTragically, corporate greed saw this game rushed out the door for Christmas before it was finished, but the momentum behind KOTOR is so huge that a restored content mod was eventually released, and I would highly recommend playing with it. This is from the first Xbox generation, and though it has aged beautifully, the lack of polish is glaringly obvious at times.\n\nSimply put, KOTOR 2 is one of the most elegant and well-renowned examples of \u2018meta-narrative\u2019 ever crafted. It redefined everything.\n\nBring on the remake!", "timestamp_created": 1663039159, "timestamp_updated": 1663039240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122164770": {"recommendationid": "122164770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034381148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6052, "last_played": 1663205418}, "language": "english", "review": "cant go wrong with KOTOR 2 TSL", "timestamp_created": 1663031940, "timestamp_updated": 1663031940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122154178": {"recommendationid": "122154178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116324458", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1663010472}, "language": "english", "review": "compare to first one this has been updated to support modern hardware along with steam workshop and achievements although its keep the worst part of the first game the trash RTS compact style", "timestamp_created": 1663010616, "timestamp_updated": 1663010616, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436507940292358398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122133215": {"recommendationid": "122133215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199063445015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2064, "last_played": 1663765279}, "language": "english", "review": "Cant go wrong with a classic like this", "timestamp_created": 1662975535, "timestamp_updated": 1662975535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122111437": {"recommendationid": "122111437", "author": {"steamid": "76561199201345415", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 930, "last_played": 1663421064}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game since 2009, was great then but with TSLRCM + M4-78 its more GREATER.

had a weird journey.  First it was released only 2/3rds finished to meet an unrealistic deadline.  Then the patch that was supposed to finish the game was cancelled by LucasArts.  The game languished unfinished, but still loved, for years.\n\nThen, lo and behold, modders finished \"The Sith Lord Restored Content Mod\" which took a lot f that unfinished content and well... finished it.  It also dropped a lot of bug fixes as well, and while the game still had problems, it could at last be called a finished product.  \n\nShortly thereafter, the impossible happened.  The company that made the PC port was given the funds to actually *upgrade* the game to run on modern systems.  While not a true HD remaster, it did provide widescreen support and did some bug fixing of its own.  This is nearly unheard of, especially from EA, who tends to let games that don't meet GTA-like sales figures go unsupported as not worth their time. \n\nCombine that with the continued efforts of its PC modding community, and Kotor 2 is one of the best RPGs you can play.  It does have its rough spots.  How much you like it will depend on how well you receive an incredibly preachy and sanctimonious character who will lecture you non-stop about their philosophy on the Star Wars universe.  Anyone familiar with Chris Avellone's work will instantly be familiar with this character type (See Ulysses from Fallout New Vegas and Durance from Pillars of Eternity for other examples).  Some think she's the greatest character ever.  I personally find her insufferable and obnoxious, and a prime example of how her writer has his head a little too far up his own ass at times.  \n\nWhat makes her frustrating is, that unlike the other two, you have to actively cater to her whims and kiss her ass to get enough influence to unlock additional dialogue which goes a great deal to explaining the game's backstory, and even character motivations.  So if you do like I want to do, and just tell her to shut up, and leave her on the ship, you'll be missing important chunks of narrative.  \n\nIf you don't mind humoring her, or actually like her, then the game's biggest narrative issue is pretty minor.", "timestamp_created": 1662477645, "timestamp_updated": 1662477645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121837617": {"recommendationid": "121837617", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230011092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 970, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 778, "last_played": 1662697951}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game", "timestamp_created": 1662475570, "timestamp_updated": 1662475570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121828627": {"recommendationid": "121828627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156401801", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1195, "last_played": 1586812181}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amazing game!

Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of \"melts\". Almost every \"grilled cheese\" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\n\nYou god damn heretics.

The unfinished classic Knights of the Old Republic II from Obsidian is arguably one of the best stories from SW Legends and any media in general.[/b]\n\nKOTOR2 turns Lucas' pure good/pure evil false dichotomy into moral playground that makes you question everything. The story is an intensely philosophical and reflection on war and morality. This is achieved thanks to the masterfully written dialogues. Every major character you meet frequently raises questions of responsibility and complicity, often manipulating the character/player and leaving it open for you to think about the choices you made and the nature of the Force itself. A great example is the philosophy and story of Kreia which highly mirrors the book from Friedrich Nietzsche \u2013 [b]\u201cThus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None\u201d[/b] and the concept of the \u00dcbermensch. The interwoven plot and rich storytelling of KOTOR2 couldn\u2019t be possible in any other media which proves that video game can indeed be art.\n\nThe only downside is that when KOTOR2 was released it wasn't complete due to LucasArts pressuring the developers for an early Christmas release date. Many parts of the game were cut out. But thanks to hard-core Star Wars fans out there they made the TSLRCM which is easy to download from Steam Workshop and allows you to play the game with the cut-out parts.\n \nOutside of being unfinished, KOTOR2 hasn\u2019t really aged well. The combat feels dated and it\u2019s too easy even on the highest difficulty. You\u2019ll die very little, outside some boss fights, and this leaves you feeling as if you are playing on rails. Dialogues are skipped over at unreadable speed when you play for couple of hours which is apparently some kind of bug where memory starts leaking. \n\n[b]Knights of the Old Republic II is a \u201cmust play\u201d tier RPG and the greatest piece of Star Wars media that Disney will never acknowledge. Let\u2019s hope for a proper remake![/b]\n\n[i]There must always be a Darth Traya.

I really liked the clunky combat system in the first KOTOR, but KOTOR 2 added and expanded on the combat system in a way which i liked. The game's deep and philosophical story was very interesting to explore, and while the game doesn't have a really good twist like the first, it really leaned in to new interpretations of the force and human empathy. I personally prefer KOTOR 2's characters more than the first, especially because of the game's new influence mechanic and because you can [spoiler]train certain members of the crew to be jedi[/spoiler]. The villains were incredibly unique and broke the mold. They challenged how to perceive the force and it's role in the galaxy. However, the end of the game leaves much to be desired. It is painfully obvious how low on time to work on the game near the end of KOTOR 2's story. Many plot points seem to have been rushed together or completely out of left field (and not in the good way). While the TSLRCM is a big help in making a more finished game, using cut content from the base game, it still is only a band-aid on a bullet wound. Some planets clearly have areas and quests completely cut out of the game. What's worse is that it will probably be the last KOTOR game ever, so some of the unanswered plot points leave a sour taste in my mouth. On top of all of that, Peragus is a very underwhelming and drawn out tutorial that turns you off to the rest of the game. It is overall a great game, but it's lack of development time sacrifices some of the amount of enjoyment you'll get from the story. KOTOR 2, if given just a little more development time, would have been a tremendous improvement compared to the first game and would clearly be the superior of the two. The uniqueness of the story made it a great Star Wars game and sequel. Even if they fumbled the bag on the ending act of the story and it could have been made a fuller game, it is probably my favorite KOTOR game. If you enjoyed the first KOTOR, you'll probably love this as well. \n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1660294703, "timestamp_updated": 1660294703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120480627": {"recommendationid": "120480627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240269624", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2075, "last_played": 1660611054}, "language": "english", "review": "KOTOR 2 (with the restored content mod) is the best story telling I\u2019ve ever seen in the Star Wars franchise.

The characters are all great, complex and interesting. Light and dark side mechanics make you Feel the power of the darkside....or light. It\u2019s decently open with exploration and travel. You pretty much get your own Falcon to use and operates as a fun hub for character interactions and crafting. Story choices matter. The crafting itself is as good as it need to be. \n\tThe actual combat I believe is where many will get turned off unfortunately. It operates as a real time with pause mechanics and a move queue. You can control the entire party, though you do not have too. I think it\u2019s a blast. If your turned off by it, you should really consider spending some extra time playing before quitting.

The title is not the only crazy thing about the game - it was developed in a crazy short time, it was bugged like crazy(fixed now) and it is also crazy good. \nFantastic even. Despite its short development time it's massive improvement over the first game - whether in gameplay, art direction, story, characters or just writing in general. Deals heavily with the themes of overcoming past trauma, but handles it incredibly well, with nuance.\n\nAfter the great reception of the first game, released by Bioware in 2003, Obsidian got the chance to work on the second one - which was a great choice. The wrong choice was Lucasarts rushing the game out as fast as possible, forcing Obsidian to release the game in 2004, despite the original release date being in 2005. \nGame had 14-16 months of development, which is a really short time for a game of this size. As comparison, Dragon Age 2 had similar length of development and you know how copypaste and rushed that was.\n\nThough the game was released in much rougher shape and was fixed over the years thanks to the fan mods. Those fan mods fix many bugs as well as restore a lot of cut content, resulting in meatier game. Since these mods are included by default with the Steam release, as well as support for higher resolutions(which KoTOR1 lacks), I think it's fine to take these in consideration when reviewing the game.\nDespite that, the game still feels rushed, especially towards the end, and lacks better, more satisfying conclusion. Some of the cut content could have been handled better as well, such as HK Factory.\n\nThe game's plot's set few years after the first game, with the Jedi Order being on the brink of annihilation again. You play as the Exile - jedi veteran of Mandalorian wars - as they return from Jedi Council's mandated exile back into Republic space, instantly becoming a target of the new titular Sith Lords.  Except that the Exile isn't really a jedi anymore - they lost their connection to the force.  \n\nOver the course of game you visit various planets and see how the Mandalorian and Jedi Civil War affected planets. You witness poverty, corruption, crime, refugees as well as people trying to rebuild, to get back on their feet, to recover. Which is the main theme of the game - moving on from past to the future and recovering. This theme is also reflected in (most) companions - who all were hurt and traumatised in the past and are trying to move on - as well as the Exile.\n\nOne companion who is especially stands out is Kreia - who serves as the foil to the choices you take - to provide different perspective on the Jedi, the Sith and the Force. This works because game is written with much more nuance than the previous game and it's way less cheesy Star Wars fare. \nA lot of concepts, cliches and tropes from SW or RPGs are flipped on their head, trying to make you think about them from different perspective. This results in the tone of game being much more sombre and mature compared to other SW media, which admittedly might not be to everyone's liking. Compared to the Last Jedi, it's much better as critique of SW, though to be fair, that's a very low bar.\nThankfully this also means the game should be fine for people who aren't fans or actually dislike Star Wars as well.\n\nAudiovisually, the game is a great improvement over the first one. Not as much as in the graphical fidelity itself, but rather the art direction. Character designs are much better and Darth Nihilus is extremely iconic design. The fact that jedi robes actually look like robes in this one, flowing and loose as compared to sticky pajamas they were in KoTOR1, is a great improvement by itself.  A lot of assets are reused from the first game though, but that was pretty common at that time.\nMusic is another thing that differs from usual SW thing and helps set the tone really well. My favourite track is \"Rebuilt Jedi Enclave\", and it's very memorable and encapsulates the sombre tone of the game perfectly.\n\nGameplay-wise there have been improvements as well. The UI is easier to navigate, you can keep two sets of weapons to switch instantly between, new feats such as finesse and more. The biggest overhaul is probably in the crafting and upgrade system. Weapons now have more slots for upgrades and there are multiple types of upgrades for each slot, allowing for much more in-depth customisation of weapons and armour. \nCompared to the first KoTOR you also start already as a Jedi, with one of standard classes - Guardian, Sentinel or Consular. It's something I prefer more compared to starting as a class I won't really play one third of the game in.\nOn top of the standard jedi classes, there have been added prestige classes for both Jedi and the Sith, resulting in much bigger build variety, especially mixed with the new upgrade system.\nOtherwise it's mostly identical to KoTOR1, but there was nothing to really fix there.\n\nOverall, game is great and must-play whether you like Star Wars or RPGs. If you can handle bit of jank, you'll find that the game still holds up really well and is a lot of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1659291857, "timestamp_updated": 1659291857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702470839023590088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119835506": {"recommendationid": "119835506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976840302", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 2767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2767, "last_played": 1553803310}, "language": "english", "review": "try's to live up as a successor, but needs more graphic and system improvements, as well as less time wasting events.", "timestamp_created": 1659289188, "timestamp_updated": 1659289188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119822040": {"recommendationid": "119822040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052861293", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1712, "last_played": 1642865521}, "language": "english", "review": "My absolute fav game of all time", "timestamp_created": 1659272739, "timestamp_updated": 1659272739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119805978": {"recommendationid": "119805978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980867875", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1106, "last_played": 1659378536}, "language": "english", "review": "anyone who loves the older style games should definitely give this game a try", "timestamp_created": 1659248366, "timestamp_updated": 1659248366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119805222": {"recommendationid": "119805222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073252028", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1659506540}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the whole thing.

The act of playing it, engaging with its mechanisms, is often fraught. There's numerous bugs and glitches, with some being minor and others requiring a game restart. The pacing is consistently inconsistent, with an incredibly sluggish and dull opening few hours that does its best to grind you down, as well as some other spots that are hampered by bizarre difficulty spikes that require a far more measured approach and culminating in an abrupt ending, albeit one that is conclusive for the main narratives and themes. \n\nIn many ways the actual playing of the game might be the worst part, but at its lowest it's typically dull rather than out-right bad or unplayable. There are of course many moments where you're manipulating your party to full effect and leaping from one enemy to the other with a lightsaber in hand. It takes a while to get there, but it is fun when you do. And hey, they kept the flourish button for when you want to twirl around your lightsaber, which is a pointless but always fun distraction.\n\nWhat makes TSL worth playing though, by far, is the writing. It inspects and critiques the conflicting dogma of the Jedi and the Sith, as well as dipping into a similar look at the genre of party-based RPGs. Through your ever growing group of adventurers and the events you find yourself caught in, TSL tries to highlight that slavish dedication to an absolute should not be seen as something admirable, more that it's important to understand what the general aim is of that absolute; doing 'good' things is not inherently reactive, whilst similarly you don't need to be assertive to do something 'evil'. \n\nThough it can take some time to really grapple with all of these themes, by the time the credits were rolling I was reflecting on all the characters in my group and all the events that had transpired. This is a game that uses the setting to talk about the setting itself, rather than as window dressing because lightsabers are cool and make fun sounds. They do, but what about the people who wield them? What's interesting about them?\n\nThe game is unquestionably flawed in ways that are too detrimental to ignore, but what's on offer here is something pretty rare for a game. As someone who is fairly ambivalent to Star Wars as a whole, there's a lot of fantastic ideas to tackle here. It's just a shame you've got to wade through so many problems to get there.\n\n*Played through using the Restored Content mod*", "timestamp_created": 1659057083, "timestamp_updated": 1659057083,

Get the remastered mod and it's easily one of (if not singularly) the best Star Wars game ever made. The first is also incredible but in the year 2023 it comes off a little too dated (deserves a solid remaster more than anything else) IMO.\n\nI just finished the new Jedi Survivor game (solid but not great; ~40 hours to 100% and I have no intention to ever boot the game up again) and felt compelled to update my review for this old gem.\n\nKOTOR2, to me, is the peak of the elusive gaming mountain of RPGs. 2 decades after release and there have only been a few contenders for more compelling story, characters, worlds, or gameplay. \nThe story is rich and open, ignore-able to those that want to Force Run past everything but incredibly immersive and broad in scope for those that want to interact with everything. \n\nThe main cast is potentially less interesting than the original KOTOR but still better than most modern RPGs. Choices cause changes that can be seen in the crew, specifically Handmaiden/Disciple and Atton have dramatic shifts and story plots based on their relationship with the Main Character. The sheer power of Kreias character and story arc (predictable as it is now-a-days), or the beloved comedic relief of the classic droids (and a few new ones).\nThese supporting characters are what leads to so much replayability, different party members have flavor lines and even cause different choices if they are in your party at different times which means sometimes 2 or 3 play-throughs in you might find a fun new dialog or interaction you missed.\n\nThe different worlds are fun but somehow feel smaller than the first game. That really just shows how much the original did with so little; the map sizes in this game are essentially the same as the new Jedi Survivor. But it still fun to explore the new zones, check out some of the planets you visited in the first game and see some of the repercussions to your actions there.\n\nGood game.", "timestamp_created": 1658738384, "timestamp_updated": 1683915566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119422984": {"recommendationid": "119422984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072228136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5068, "last_played": 1659959130}, "language": "english", "review": "love it", "timestamp_created": 1658721874, "timestamp_updated": 1658721874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119422520": {"recommendationid": "119422520", "author": {"steamid": "76561199075003347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10922, "last_played": 1688068411}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Manso juego", "timestamp_created": 1658721090, "timestamp_updated": 1658721090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 17012, "total_negative": 1100, "total_reviews": 18112}, "cursors": {"AoJwnefemYIDeOPHxwM=": "Thu Nov 23 23:29:59 2023", "AoJ4ncOjvYsDdr3nuAQ=": "Thu Nov 23 23:55:59 2023"}}
