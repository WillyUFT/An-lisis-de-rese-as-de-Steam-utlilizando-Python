This game has given me confidence, I know I can find a beautiful waifu if I just follow the steps of this game! \n\n10/10 IGN\n#StripedPantiesForever\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1682057744, "timestamp_updated": 1682057744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749081611633301", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136769313": {"recommendationid": "136769313", "author": {"steamid": "76561199496377669", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 437, "last_played": 1682286618}, "language": "english", "review": "Goku approve of this", "timestamp_created": 1681598036, "timestamp_updated": 1681598036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136176457": {"recommendationid": "136176457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083998767", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 134, "last_played": 1585623084}, "language": "english", "review": "hm", "timestamp_created": 1680734103, "timestamp_updated": 1680734103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135703962": {"recommendationid": "135703962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013409616", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1563905235}, "language": "english", "review": "Schizoid personality disorder\nAlso called: SPD\n\nA condition in which people avoid social activities and interacting with others.

The story is very boring, there is no replayability and you can tell what is going to happen before it happens most of the time. There are several melodramatic moments that go nowhere, no real emotion, and because it was made cheaply there are very few actual images for the characters. These poor girls have like, one outfit each that they wear everywhere that is also for school, except for some sexy outfits that are in single posed pictures. Every early scene meant to be erotic is overlaid with horrific circus music that made me laugh in pure joy/revulsion.

Well, I've forgotten how many times I said this sentence, but I still have to say what I have to say. The plot of the game is as boring as ever and has no highlights. You still have to spend a lot of time skipping many meaningless conversations.\nOf course, the main purpose of playing this game is to see CG. Personally, I think this game only has a little CG, which is not very enjoyable. But it is gratifying that you can still open the harem in the game. However, after I played many games of Sakura series, I found an unfortunate fact. That is, there are only two girlfriends in each Sakura series game. Why can't developer add more female roles in one game? What a pity! After all, since you have opened the harem, why can't you have more female confidants or sexual partners? Eight or ten are not too many! So, are developers playing hunger marketing? If so, I am dissatisfied with the developer's malicious purpose.\nIn the end, I still hope that the Sakura series can change its style in the future.

Compared to the more modern entries, the protagonist here had a higher level of depth to him (when compared to other male MCs, e.g. Succubus' MC) and it is possible to learn more about said backstory if the correct route is taken. The setting, as well as the other characters, also have decent character depth, however I would say that it is less than the protagonist. The story also does a great job of displaying the MC's mental state throughout the game, however to avoid potential spoilers I will not disclose that.\nOne large downside I would like to mention is that there are two specific scenes in which some good character development is given to the girls, however it is followed up by scenes that don't feel like they should be there that quickly.

It's got enough plot to be a good hentai game, but not enough to be an amazing one.\n-It's short but sweet, although it has a relatively abrupt ending to be honest.\n-The MC is relatable... almost too relatable sometimes.\n-The smut scenes are great; \"interesting\" yet not too invasive (most of the time) while still also being interesting enough to go back to.\n-Replayability is subjective, but decent for a ten-dollar game, even though it is only a 2-hour experience.\n-Romance is... interesting to say the least. Their behaviors are gradually affected in a way that it feels more natural, at least. Both waifus are kind of stereotypes, but the way it pans out in the end feels a bit pandering, and even a little forced, but you'd have to play it to get what I mean.\n\nOverall, it's a worthy buy for any \"hentai entrepreneur\", even when it's not on sale. It gets a solid [b]8/10[/b]. Now, if it were something made more recently, it'd probably be a 7/10; it's a classic and if we put it by today's standards it wouldn't be that great, but seeing how it affected the western-oriented hentai romance scene, it's worthy of a 9/10.\n\n[i]\"Now, engineer child of a male gender the 9000th, you just said 8/10, where did that 9/10 come from?\"[/i]  is what you may be asking; the problem lies in the patch. See, there's an uncensored patch for this game, which locks off the most important part of the experience behind a difficult paywall that isn't even that easy to circumvent even with the money needed. The only way to get the patch is to either go to old patreon page they have, or to obtain it from patching sites. \n\nNow, despite the fact that Winged Cloud hasn't done much other than a finger wag against these sites, I'll have to note that using them may classify as pirating. As such, I'll have to say that you [i]probably[/i] shouldn't go to sites like 'UncensorPat.ch' (*winks*) even though Winged Cloud doesn't care about it that much, even if you wish for the entire experience that isn't provided in full by Steam.\n\nSo, in the end, if the patch ever put into the main game on Steam, no strings attached, i'd give it a 9/10 overall; definitely worth buying.\n\nP.S. The site I mentioned that you [i]probably[/i]  shouldn't go to is safe, but I can't really vouch for any sites beyond that. The patch itself is just some folders that you simply put into your game folder as per instructions, whether or not you go to patreon for it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1641007587, "timestamp_updated": 1641007587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527382850646972656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106750003": {"recommendationid": "106750003", "author": {"steamid": "76561199102040976", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1669917418}, "language": "english", "review": "play this", "timestamp_created": 1640706121, "timestamp_updated": 1640706121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531846344470977783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "106686178": {"recommendationid": "106686178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083944770", "num_games_owned": 1727, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1640634809}, "language": "english", "review": "With Sakura Swim Club, the Sakura games are getting better: I have played a few of the older titles and slowly moved up in the years, and I have to admit that they are starting really slow.\nSakura Swim Club is also a slow starter, however the story is quite good, not badly written (few mistakes here and there).\n\nI've been going through some quite good visual novels in my time - and some quite bad ones!

The story itself is actually very sweet and at times romantic but the very forced softcore erotic scenes are completely out of place and the type of coincidental you\u2019d see in a campy perverted B-Movie which is a shame because the story itself is very well written and could\u2019ve been something very moving. Also you\u2019ll have to install a DLC to get nudity off of Steam and I\u2019ve always found those sites to be slightly sketchy. The game is a little over an hour in length so I had to idle it to get the final card drop.\n\nThe two girls your character gets involved with are Mieko and Hiromi and neither of these girls are particularly likeable. The art in this game is actually beautiful and very well done but I can\u2019t say the same for diversity. Mieko and Hiromi embody the same person in a different font. Mieko is a tsundere and will absolutely destroy your eardrums; looks like a brunette version of Hiromi. Hiromi is a cool headed and more dominant type; looks like a blonde version of Mieko. The characters do have some depth and have touching moments with the MC that did bring a single tear to my eye but this is completely destroyed by the poorly incorporated perv scenes with them. The times where it is incorporated well in the story can be very powerful and beautiful but I can\u2019t say the same for the majority of them.\n\nIt is way more of a visual novel as it is a game because the \u2018gameplay\u2019 is nonexistent. The story can not and will not change depending on your choices and the only thing you can do is press your mouse to get to the next text. It does a great job at being a visual novel but it sucks that not only can you not pick the girl you want but nothing you choose really matters. I thought it did and I just somehow ended with both but after replaying it with completely different choices I realized no matter what we all get the same ending. On the bright side it is a good ending.\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list]\n   [*] Very smooth transitions.\n   [*] Great artwork!\n   [*] Soundtrack suits the atmosphere and is good.\n   [*] Very well written.\n   [*] There is SOME depth to the girls.\n   [*] Can be both romantic and emotional.\n   [*] Can play with one hand or no hands at all!\n   [*] Girls are fully voiced!\n   [*] Actual story!\n [/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n[list]\n   [*] Your choices do not matter.\n   [*] The girls look like they could be twins.\n   [*] Coincidental perv moments are not charming at all.\n   [*] All the drama seems very superficial.\n   [*] A bit generic, you can spot what will happen a mile away.\n   [*] No replayability.\n   [*] I find the girls annoying.\n   [*] Busted eardrums.\n   [*] The extreme lack of characters make it seem like the three of you make up the whole school.\n[/list]\n\n[spoiler] Game too realistic.

I get what they were going for it's just so weird to see the characters \"pace\" their way back and fourth across the screen as they talk.\n-The music, I get this was like a low budget title but unless I'm mistaken there's literally two songs the wacky shenanigans song and the song for everything else.\n-Price, this is not ten dollars this is more like a five dollar game unless you replay it for boobas you're only really getting two or so hours of stuff. Thankfully it is on sale often.\n-Having to download the nude patch separately is always stupid (the game tags literally say nudity but I still have to download a patch why) no matter the game at the very least put the damn patch for free on steam like wolf tails.", "timestamp_created": 1626019589, "timestamp_updated": 1626019589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493087530136108398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95425905": {"recommendationid": "95425905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834108984", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1625096843}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una historia buena e inspiradora, sin contar con el h, pero que sigue una historia lineal con solo un final", "timestamp_created": 1625863413, "timestamp_updated": 1625863413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95295204": {"recommendationid": "95295204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347434387", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11997, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11997, "last_played": 1623894133}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't even ask how I got 200hrs on record", "timestamp_created": 1625707301, "timestamp_updated": 1625707301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698252260684967041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95264182": {"recommendationid": "95264182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186531618", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1033, "last_played": 1618235739}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Review using one quote from the game: [/h1]\n\n\"Real life isn't a harem anime!\" - Mieko", "timestamp_created": 1625672779, "timestamp_updated": 1625672779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94701858": {"recommendationid": "94701858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277961655", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 355, "last_played": 1627348926}, "language": "english", "review": ":parking: balls", "timestamp_created": 1625020292, "timestamp_updated": 1625020292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94571437": {"recommendationid": "94571437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157009320", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 62820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 685, "last_played": 1696807955}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok I guess.", "timestamp_created": 1624875594, "timestamp_updated": 1639114582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93928181": {"recommendationid": "93928181", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066030249", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 248, "last_played": 1623979307}, "language": "english", "review": "hot", "timestamp_created": 1623977380, "timestamp_updated": 1623977380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93645749": {"recommendationid": "93645749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143394981", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1623542380}, "language": "english", "review": "If I could give this a \"Mixed\" rating, I would.\nThis isn't a bad game. But, it's not that great either.\n\nThe writing is fine. I'd even say good. The characters, on the other hand, not so much. One of the main characters is an annoying tsundere character that I honestly didn't like, and the main character is an apathetic loner, which can work when executed well, but this character wasn't. And I'd attribute this to the main issue I have with this game: the characters' hypocrisy. The two girl characters ask the MC multiple times about something he doesn't want to talk about, but refuse beforehand to talk about their own private matters. Then, later, it's the reverse.\n\nMy second issue is that it feels like there's too little player agency. It felt like my decisions meant close to nothing, so I question there even being choices in the game.\n\nThat's about it. As I said, the writing is good. The character development is a bit cliche, but what else is there to expect from a visual novel? There's no sexual content actually in the game that I saw after laying through the story, so that tag should probably be removed. There's censored nudity, but if you came to this game looking for anime tiddies, you should look elsewhere.\n\nNot anything I'd write home about. 5/10", "timestamp_created": 1623533525, "timestamp_updated": 1623533525, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93604872": {"recommendationid": "93604872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010567332", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1623476629}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it!

Without the patch the entire visual novel is just full of cheap ecchi scenes. With the patch, everything is the same except a few additional scenes added in, near the end of the novel.\n\nSecond, the story isn't really that interesting or unique, if anything it reminds me of some low quality ecchi anime, that have no real plot, or one that isn't interesting, and are only watched because of all the ecchi shots. \n\nThe few sexual content scenes you do get (with the patch) are pretty decent quality. Its pretty vanilla but its better than nothing. \n\nOverall, the game isn't terrible so I will still recommend it. But to keep what I said above in mind, before purchasing. \n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40328198/]Follow my curator[/url] page for short version, focused on sexual-content.",

It is not a yuri title which is an exception for them nowadays.\n\nIt's a relatively short slice of life VN with a bit of romance and weak comedy. It's a kinetic novel so there is only one ending despite numerous choices. It is a mixed bag story. Some comedy, some drama, some hentai scences but nothing stands out. It's not badly written but fails to leave much impression. Characters have some development but could be better. Little to no replaybility. Choices are rather meaningless and often barely differ from each other. One of the biggest flaws is that it's very formulaic and predictable. No twists or surprises at all.\n \nWanaca's art is one of the strongest points of Winged Cloud VNs. While pretty, the number of character sprites and CGs is rather limited. Completing the CG gallery is almost too easy. I guess it's justified by the price so I won't complain much here but still... Just like above, could be better.\n\nMusic is pretty average. Tracks fit scenes for the most part and some are relaxing but there are only few of them. No songs in budget titles so don't expect one here either.\n\nNo bugs ecnountered.\n\nOverall, a quick, budget slice of life VN with a little bit of H and good art. Nothing except art stands out but worth the price asked.

or heavily misinterpret any given statement and dont expect some vague answer either. obviously including and discussing both single and multiplayer since im no deranged being in for only one experience of play;\n\nalso unsure if 13 hours racked up, by the time of writing this, can actually reflect what im about to write and not leave the impression of me being cheap on the playthrough.\nas id like to retire my hentai minesweeper tm review from my profile showcase for it being outdated in humor and educational levels, one has to come up with fulfilling certain expectations and go beyond ones horizon. the afore mentioned review shouldve never graced and hit the beam of sunlight and instead locked up or never typed out like the type of disgust it genuinely pleases me to have by simply skipping over the paragraphs designed by the irony of athestic beliefs centered around the circlejerk state of mind of the average internet consoomer. combined with the non family friendly content that is being directly promoted and shown by what i have written out is another point to seek for redemption. shouldve just told you beforehand that this is just unnecessary introduction as to why im even writing this review in the first place - solidifying myself for not depicting any sort of primitive and degenerate thinking that comes to show the person online should not try to establish himself as such and not have over exaggerated giggles and seizures over such regressing manner and language; ~heavily implied ooga boogas and oompa loomps gazing upon their screens\n\ni dont know. theres already a slue typed out and we not even progressing to get sum affordable bread. as i am an unfortunate victim of unforeseeable generation cuckholding i never got to experience the true thrill of classic childhood that wouldve come by entering early teenage during the early to mid 00s and great recession era like in my case. by classic childhood i refer to something expandable like getting your first gamecube at the age 5 and seven years later having your big brother buy you both a copy of modern warfare 2 from the gamestop on release day thanks to working two months of delivering newspapers. im basically implying that i experienced the contents long over its time and prime it was released and pushed up the mainstream timeline. i simply judge it from the perspective of an older head on the internet with only relatable nostalgia that had never been experienced or had existed in the first place.\n\nsingleplayer story campaign is sentimentally touching and thrilling as both an old head long over his heydays and the probably 7th grader on his xbox 360 back in the old days. released in 2009 and its basically the second part and sequence to the first of the modern warfare trilogy if that means shit to you meaning it plays out like similar to its peers. while plot and its progression were generic to come i believe story wise youd get unintentional sugar coating for down the line dopamine overdose believing you to join the fray as prideful kamikaze to go down in the gulf of leyte. the general placebo of overflowing courage and honour build up from the american eagle dream is a coexisting biproduct reminiscent to being deployed in open area while awaiting greenlight for rolling thunders and agent orange bombardment over creedence clearwater revival tune to fuel your lust in partaking fight against international threats in the eastern propaganda world. the characters forming the main team of interest have a strong showing to the point of being the main heroine of the game and possibly making up the best cast out of the entire franchise as you dont feel like dealing and steering your mental autopilot for some goofed up troop club ready go be gunned over by some rpg artillery performed by some hispanic named hernandez at an elementary school in brazil (not task force hernandez). wont even go into detail or sum up for spoilers as everything played out fine and ending was relatively decent, atleast with modern warfare 3 picking up where it left and you atleast have some sort of an idea if you had any type of normal childhood and grow up living outside third world country.\n\nsince i found myself playing this 10 years later than it originated you might think its dead for good or barely alive with the exception of clans as old people believing in staple america or health care system clashing off another or lobbies with trolls and cheaters. while these even apply as of todays time its fairly noticable for having matchmaking mostly filled with actual player beings for majority of the time. for your interest queue times and matchmaking usually up to 1 minute - both longer and shorter in other cases. even if you match with a cheater in lobby you can leave once or twice and youll be freed, atleast from my experience speaking.\nobviously im somewhat thankful to not experience on own hand what it was booting up into deathmatch back at its peak, but most likely more exaggerated assembling of tumors and chromsomes left to right and actual cyberbullying caused by highschoolers with uncertainty whether actually south state racism and school shooter psycho or just alt right trolls. but atleast they were breathing and crapping certified banger stuff. i got no clue whats left from back then but lobbies are mostly decided by whether which clan functions normally as premature amateur league and not handicapped and how many chemical brain defects run outside by dying to artillery from preschooler kill streak for 4 takedowns. shit actually hitting the fan would be the influx and spam of tubers, knife runners speedrunning you like being jumped in your crib by dark skin looters, snipers taking aim from underground vietnamese tunnel system, akimbo glock runners like its comethazine and youngboy and concussion forward for close up shotgun like the shades guy smoking tony montana. maps are fine layed out besides the infamous 3 lane ones and some color palettes in textures and overall distinguishmentproblems between other maps. maybe im severely retarded and being close to losing eye sight but invasion and rundown for instance feel and play out mostly the same for me. despite the mentioned critic points its still pleasuring to gun down other players when both are clearly showing a distinct lack of skill expression or fit the category of the stereotypes i called out.\noverall enjoyable, even in todays time for whatever reason i cant and dont really want to get behind but shits cash so no real complains. just dodge when its afghan, invasion, wasteland or underpass...think they are more to note. for the players with prefered loadout mentioned either ask them nicely if they voluntarily drop the class for another or just move on with your mental being. also they shouldve adjusted fall damage and not making concrete ground feel like crash bandicoot parkour.\n\nfor the love of god have i wished to be out growing toddler in the times of great recession, coping as youth with this game flaming and outright calling slurs over barely capable microphones from consoles or $20 walmart headsets. i truly believe this was legitimately the last good era of youth and childhood upbringing and growing up to, which explains my rather vivid fascination with this title. i think even judging rationally without any hard feelings or biased tendencies, modern warfare 2 stems from a simpler time in development and product as well as social standard for interaction and living connected to its players. makes it up for being a classic title or atleast carrying its characteristics making it enjoyable as in timeless matters and having a decent replayability attached to it. not sure if its worth the neetbux of 20 bucks, considering only singleplayer can be experienced to the fullest, but sale...actually dont know how much, might fix it\nyeah this issuh og modern warfare 2 review if it wasnt obvious", "timestamp_created": 1614091265, "timestamp_updated": 1614102695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

Drilled by the rich parents I was shipped from school to school but I was not interested in anything until I was recommended to look after clubs and I discovered the swimming club for me. There were only 2 sexy girls participating, which raises the big question why no one else takes advantage of it. Interestingly, I wanted to know much more about the school itself than about the swimming club because I assumed that besides me there must be a bunch of other horny students who decide with their c0ck. But I didn't worry about that and just enjoyed the time with my two girls and I have to admit as someone who has had a lot of similar situations, it's incredibly close to reality, with the difference that I would take advantage of every situation where I could get laid. And that's the only big flaw of the game, that I have to follow every asexual decision of the protagonist. When it comes to Hiromi and Mieko, even though they have very different personalities, both of them are only concerned with one thing, my c0ck, that drives them wild. Hiromi is certainly the more mature of the two and so is her body.

This one is one of their better games so far. One par with Sakura Fantasy but with a totally different genre of story.\n\n1. The writing in this one is very good. The characters are actually somewhat deep which helps endear you to them, the scenes are not ridiculous and the overall plot flows really well. Compared to Sakura Angels and Sakura beach these girls are actually likable. Sakura beach 1&2 which was a failure of a harem story around water.... this one is much better! Also the main character actually has parents. That's a first!\n\n2. This title is one of the ones which contains sex scenes (if you don't have the steam version). The art is very good and characters design is nice. Much better than some of the older games like Sakura Angels.\n\n3. Story Routes. While there isn't much extra art work to be unlocked by replaying different routes.. there is a plot point regarding the main character which is only uncovered when a particular route is taken. This is the first Sakura game that has this. (I am playing them in order of publication).\n\n4. The songs arent as jarring and loopy as Sakura Beach. They fit pretty well with the different scenes and don't sound too much like cheap MIDI files.\n\n5. Fully voiced Dialogue (in japanese). And its well done too. As someone who went through the effort to study Japanese I always appreciate this. I'm sure budget is why not every Sakura game has voiced dialogue but it definitely adds to the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1594043278, "timestamp_updated": 1594043278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72057072": {"recommendationid": "72057072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100679564", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1593909857}, "language": "english", "review": "Girl goes over to pick up the boy's retro console gamepad.\nSomehow instantly gets her itself tangled up in its cable.\nThe more she tries to squirm her way free, the more her school clothes magically slip off her.\nJapan.\n\nOnly giving this a favourable review due to the aforementioned scene making me laugh at the absurd awfulness of it all.", "timestamp_created": 1593910371, "timestamp_updated": 1593910371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72012641": {"recommendationid": "72012641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034306697", "num_games_owned": 1390, "num_reviews": 608, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1593866792}, "language": "english", "review": "In less than an hour, I started to see that the writing & plot suddenly felt like the previously released game, which should have been expected of these Sakura games and the developer company behind them.

It knows this because it knows where it isn't, by subtracting where it is, from where it isn't, or where it isn't, from where it is, whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance sub-system uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is, to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position where it was, is now the position that it isn't. In the event of the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has required a variation. The variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too, may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computance scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is, however it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subracts where it should be, from where it wasn't, or vice versa. By differentiating this from the algebraic sum og where it shouldn't be, and where it was.

Upon transferring to a new school, he meets two beautiful girls in the swim club. Things haven't gone well for the swim club lately, but with Kaede's help, that all changes.\n\n[h1] Art Style and Sound [/h1]\nThe Art here is very pretty, detailed anime style.\nMieko and Hiromi could have had more expressions. the lack of them sometimes don't portrait what emotion they are trying to convey.\nThe UI is a pretty sight. Super in the theme of Swimming.\nThe tracks are in tone with the theme of the game. Not amazing, but not blend either.\nMieko and Hiromi are fully voiced, which help the game stand out more. Preety good VA may i add.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThis is where it's hit and miss for me. The story flirts with brilhancy, tackling very relatable human situations and emotions, also has good humor mixed in, but the next second is just plain silly with situations, although not completly out of place, but barely beliavable! It fell like instead of flowing with the story normally, it forces itself to introduce moments for fan service, which is a damn shame, because the story overall is pretty chill! When a certain competition starts it gets more believable, more into the story, but still there it drifts in and out where concistency is concern.\nThere are many ways that of making an adult game/VN keeping it tastful/mature. As i pointed before in my other reviews, i do not mind sex at all, but when kept in the confines of the story, otherwise just adding it to add it only hurts the product instead of helping lift it up. I'm mature enough to not be swayed/deceived by just adding breasts/butts/boobs/sex out of sheer propose of adding them. As long as it keeps to the story, sex is a normal thing if added (kinda hot sometimes even), i just can't find it ok of a game that intends to bring a story to the player like a Visual Novel, adding senseless fan service just for the sake of \"views\".\nIf i want to look for sheer sex, there's a whole adult industry in existence for ages to look for this, or either i'll go do it myself. There are even games that are lets say \"adult content focus\", not trying to tell you a story or revolutionary game play, it's really just fan service. So VN's who are suppose to tell a STORY, should do just that, regardless if it include mature content or not, it should all be intrinsic to the story, always.\n\n[h1] Gameplay[/h1]\nNo revolution here. Developers keep what works perfectly on VN's, pretty sure it's the Renpy engine.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n+ Chill story, sometimes aproaching struggles for too common of human lives.\n+ Mieko and Hiromi are fully voiced by great Voice Actress.\n+ Very pretty and detailed game overall.\n- Very unrealistic early scenarios story wise. Most happened out of nowhere. When a certain competition starts it gets more believable, more into the story, but still there it drifts in and out where concistency is concern.\n- Mieko and Hiromi could have had more expressions. the lack of them sometimes don't portrait what emotion they are trying to convey.\n+ Has a good ending, in which is the only scenario that is 100% believable.\n+- It's enjoyable enough, as long as you overlook it's shortcomings.\n\n[h1]On a SALE, yes, RECOMMENDED[/h1] just go with low expectations, and you'll be fine.", "timestamp_created": 1591306386, "timestamp_updated": 1591306386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599447429180145264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70282563": {"recommendationid": "70282563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323670414", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1591273776}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was far too easy, I was expecting an exhilerating speed run.

If all you're looking for is a good looking porn game, then Sakura Swim Club will suit your needs. If you were looking at this game expecting it to be a real dating sim, or even well written, you're in the wrong place.\n\nEverything about this game besides the art style is awful.

He is also constantly barging into the womens changing room.  If it was just him being brazen than fine, but often he seems shy or shocked at finding a woman in a state of undress when he walks in.

It's called \"hentai\". Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college.

R18 CG's and extra scenes, all fully voiced. I consider this version to be a proper complete version of the VN, not the Steam's vanilla version.\n\nKaede who has very famous parents is expected to be a prodigy in something as well by his parents and is forced to transfer schools all the time just to trigger his \"hidden talent\" by changing his environment which so far has not worked that well for him. This time he transfers to a regular public high school and after hearing some rumours about a swimming club, he decides to join the club. There, he meets two beautiful girls who are the only members of the club, Hiromi and Mieko.\n\nIt is a pretty decent romance story with some very spicy scenes (only in R18 version), a lot of ridiculous situations and proper ending. It is the kind of story you can expect from a VN but it's done well enough to be enjoyable in itself. Of course, the fanservice is still the main reason why you would even read this VN and you won't be disappointed.\n\nBoth female characters are likeable. They have their own issues that will require Kaede's help to solve. I still feel that there was a bit more focus on Mieko and that Hiromi had less CG scenes but all of them were of high quality. While there were some choices you could make, I don't think they matter at all since I managed to unlock all 32 CG's during my first playthrough with only one R18 scene that was choice-bound.\n\nVoice acting was great, both seiyuu did wonderful job, especially in those R18 scenes. Background music was fine but nothing memorable. I wouldn't buy the soundtrack if there was an option most likely.\n\nVisuals are very pleasing and the whole gallery is pretty good wallpaper material. R18 version has 32 CG's while the vanilla version has around half of that.\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend Sakura Swim Club.

It is abysmally dry and the boobs don't even make up for it because the main character has about the sexual stamina of a housefly; the sex scenes are over in about the time it takes him to fix his overwhelmingly asanine daddy issues. \n\nThe sex scenes feel like they\u2019ve come from someone who\u2019s only sexual experiences are from doujinshi and hentais, the most glaring example of which is when you have dry anal sex with Meiko, who of course loves every second of it because the Anon you play has a wonder cock. To better put this into perspective go and whack off with a piece of sandpaper. It hurts. Which leads me to my next point, Meiko must use her own feces as anal lube or is some freakish masochist.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even crank one out to the titties because the pillow talk was about as sexually stimulating as an execution via electric chair. It felt cliche but not cliche in a good way, it brought me no nostalgia of the hentai glory days instead it felt like \u201cbargain brand hentai\u201d, which is especially ironic when most hentai is free on the internet (which this game certainly is not).\n\nThe banter between characters feels extremely forced and made me cringe as they\u2019d make terrible romantic advances towards each other, to a point where the cringe got so old I\u2019d scroll through reddit for a few minutes between each line to catch my breath. And all relatability with the characters is lost when they talk like copy paste weebs with no personality other than \u201ctsundere\u201d and \u201ckuudere\u201d. And don\u2019t even get me started on Anon who is written like a completely empty husk which the player can barely relate too, and any instances of chaddery are immediately quashed by the terrible awkwardness of every encounter. The main protagonist comes off more as an empty idiot savant rather than an actual likeable character (he also has the fastest nut in the west).\n\nThe pacing of the writing is also unsurprisingly awful. Events and conflicts are hardly focused on for more than a scene or two and it is only compounded when the writer relies heavily on \u201ctell don\u2019t show\u201d but somehow equally does not go into nearly enough detail to get me to even care a little. For example Anon\u2019s daddy issues, which is more or less the catalyst of the entire game, is resolved in a single scene which was about 2 minutes long if you read super slowly. Everything is rushed out of the way to get you into the sex scenes which are the equivalent of a war crime. \n\nThere really was nothing that could\u2019ve saved the game, the writing isn\u2019t good so it doesn\u2019t make up for the awful sex scenes and the sex scenes are terrible so they couldn\u2019t save the shit writing. I could not even begin to imagine what this game is like without the NSFW patch because the hope for some good quality boobs and ecchi were my only motivation for powering through it (Which it doesn't deliver).\n\n My rating of Sakura Swim Club? 2/10, some Reality Kings videos have better plot and character development than this game and you don\u2019t have to try particularly hard to have a sex scene better than this game.", "timestamp_created": 1564628982, "timestamp_updated": 1564629781, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523977875709533691", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54288375": {"recommendationid": "54288375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058115931", "num_games_owned": 4460, "num_reviews": 487, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 129, "last_played": 1564056677}, "language": "english", "review": "+ good art style, easy 100% achievements and trading cards.\n- cringy af\n\nLike any other Sakura Game...", "timestamp_created": 1564068934, "timestamp_updated": 1564068934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54265865": {"recommendationid": "54265865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196486662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1555170046}, "language": "english", "review": "Nyaaa~~", "timestamp_created": 1563953659, "timestamp_updated": 1563991855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54072994": {"recommendationid": "54072994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009881877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 103, "last_played": 1552573965}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck i came so much", "timestamp_created": 1563024411, "timestamp_updated": 1563024411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53973212": {"recommendationid": "53973212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189426811", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1562620068}, "language": "english", "review": "Since I was a good boy this year, I have got a very special gift.

page.\nOr check this guide out:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=550824660\n\nThe only real thing this game lacks, is the fact that there is few choices that really impacts the story.\nAll in all, its a static story line, with limited choices of 2, and with only a few encounters where you'd need to make a choice.\n\n[b] Story line completion time: [/b]\nIf you read all the lines, without taking breaks, its a little over 2 and a half hour gameplay.\n\n[b] My personal opinion: [/b]\nI really enjoyed the game, also with the 18+ patch, it made a huge impact on it.\nI felt that the story line was a bit static, and the choices should've impacted the story even more.\nAs well as added in more choices and a bit more obstacles for the main character.\n\n[b] Opinion on voice acting/Sounds: [/b]\nThe overall game sounds and music fitted the theme of the game.\nAs far as the music selection, it was 2 tracks on repeat,\nI really hoped that this game actually featured different sounds/music to each situation.\nAs far as the voice actors are, I felt that they put out the extra effort, and the 18+ patch also impacted by a big part.\n\n[b] Why did I decide to play this game?: [/b]\nI got it from a friend as a christmas gift, and I really enjoy visual novels in general.\nWhen it comes to Hentai, ecchi anime, love/romanace games/series, I can't resist not to  play/watch it.\n\n[b] Art opinion: [/b]\nThe art in this game is purely amazing and well drawn. Also the 18+ patch art, was purely eye candy.\nThe nude art was on point, however there were only so few, I really wished there were even more scenes.\nBut in overall, I can say that I enjoyed the art.\n\n[b] My rating: [/b]\nI would rate this game a 7 out of 10.\n- Since it still lacks a lot of stuff that really seperates a okay visual novel from a great one.\n\n[i] I don't feel that I wasted 3.3 hours on this visual novel, but rather enjoyed all of it.\nI would recommend this game to people who like Visual novels, \nand who don't care too much about what I said above.

I was looking for an interesting story, but the game couldn't go two seconds without one of the characters tiddies slipping out. Overall, I would say this is not a game suitable for steam, and I am very dissapointed that Gabe would allow this smut content on his platform. Are you serious gabe? When I get ready for epic gamer time, I don't want to read the equivalent of bible twice while looking at some thighs poppin up in my face? There are way too many of these outright vile pictures. I will break down my review in these ways.\n\nDialouge: If it isn't the main character talking about how his willy is excited because some girl flashed her asshole at him, its some kid talking about the same thing for 12 paragraphs but worded differently.\n\nPictures: I am usually a fan of pictures, as I write many childrens books. I am severely dissapointed, as half the time it is two girls on the screen blabbing on, or a picture of some girls bosoms zoomed in to an overly exaggerated degree. I am not happy with the lewd content as kids could easily mistake this as one of their narotoos or gokou games, or an undetale, only to have some nipples show up, disturbing their brain development. For example, I was presented with a girl fallen over, exposing her private parts, the presentation of this image had influenced me with anguish complimenting it so with this excruciating dialect.\n\nMusic: I am not a fan of midis, as they remind me of my brother, who is a keyboard artist for a jamiroquai cover band. Also its the same 15 seconds of midi looped, which gives me a headache, after two minutes, I need to sit down and have a cuppa.\n\nStory: I think it is about a strapping young lad who wanted to get on with his day as a swimming athlete, but is constantly interrupted by some very Not safe for the work environment/ school area/ public transport women. Its sad how he tries to swim, but is blocked by their thighs, as they disturbingly tempt him. I would not recommend playing this on the train, as when I did a young lad, around twenty kept laughing and pointing and saying \"good on ya\".\n\nOverall: I would not recommend this dirty game, as it is not appropriate. I am a father, a husband, an author of several smash hit childrens book, and the (not willingly) bongo player of a smashing jamiroquai cover band, I say, never ever ever spend your hard earned money on this vile piece of work.\n\n-Uncle Fudgecup", "timestamp_created": 1545064162, "timestamp_updated": 1559386574, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.28832167387008667", "comment_count": 65, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47517716": {"recommendationid": "47517716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009474997", "num_games_owned": 2202, "num_reviews": 1072, "playtime_forever": 3087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1744, "last_played": 1544553106}, "language": "english", "review": "Sakura Swim Club Review\n\nA little wet and wild adventure lies in wait here\u2026\n\nSome key points that this game offers:\n\n1.\tFantastic art work.\n2.\tNice story line, with decent character growth.\n\nGameplay & Controls: \n\nThe story plays out well enough for you to leisurely kick back in your comfy chair, hit that auto button and then enjoy the story as it unfolds before you. This time around the UI looks somewhat different than what we\u2019ve seen in previous titles.\n \nInstead of worded clickable options, this time we have icons that act as our clickable options, it\u2019s a nice change of pace, it\u2019s the little things after all that makes something unique. We have the same control options that we\u2019ve grown accustomed to, LFM being used to manually move to the next scene, RMB bringing up the menu, H/ Middle Mouse button hiding the UI for those screenshots. \n\nGraphics:\n\nStunning artwork was created for this one, this time around a modern scene is given to us, scenes of a school\u2019s interior are some locations we will be visiting along with a few other unique areas. All however have been beautifully created for us, bringing with it rich and vibrant colours to truly deliver a visual masterpiece.  The characters we meet are each created unique in their own way, the way they carry and present themselves easily describes them and paints the pictures of who they are as people and what their personalities are like. \n\nIt will really be a pleasant journey to see how Winged Cloud expands their visual novels by incorporating moving scenes and animated scenes into their novels to bring a whole new perspective into their novels. It will really raise their bar as Visual Novel developers. On the menu side of things, we get to choose whether we want to play the game in Fullscreen or Window mode.\n\nSounds:\n\nThe sound for the game isn\u2019t that great and this is not because it\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s too short in some scenes, especially scenes you revisit a lot, having that same melody repeat itself over and over really gets annoying at times. Something I hope they work on in future releases. Something that really makes up for the game here is the ambient sound, some scenes really have some amazing background sounds to them that really give their scenes a feeling of being alive which is quite pleasant to experience. \n\nAnother neat add on here is the female Japanese voice acting we have for the two female characters. It is quite a fun and enjoyable add on to experience in a visual novel, however the lack of volume control for these voice overs really brings that joy down. everything feels shouted and way to loud with no way to bring the volume down unless you turn the main volume of your PC down.  On the menu side of things, we have volume control for the Ambience volume, the Music volume and the Sound volume.\n\nReplayability:\n\nThis is an area where the game lacks again, the game has numerous choices that you can make for the main characters but besides changing a line or two of the scripts they don\u2019t really impact the game in any way whatsoever which is really a bummer. \n\nIt makes the choices seem useless in this regard. There is an adult patch for the game so if you are of age, I suppose you can play the game without it to experience, it as is and then download the patch to play it with X-rated content. but that is as far as replay goes for the game.\n\nMGR Gaming\u2019s Conclusions:\nSpoilers Ahead:\n\nSakura Swim Club begins the story of Kaede, a young man who seems to be trapped in his father\u2019s massive shadow with everyone having even higher expectations for him than what his already successful and famous father achieved including his father. Kaede does not feel the same way as everyone does and this has led to a divide, instead of caring to achieve better results, he simply stopped caring, which was the cause of several new school transfers in hopes of picking up his grades unbeknownst to his family the cause of his bad grades lies in a different area all together. \n\nThis all slowly changes and improves when Kaede transfers to the latest school and joins the swim club where he meets Mieko and Hiromi; the two ladies that are going to change his life forever. Slowly Kaede\u2019s attitude will start changing as he and the two lovely ladies grow closer and he finally realizes what it is that he wants from life.\n\nThe story reads really well, it is thoroughly enjoyable, you can see and feel how Kaede grows as a character as the story progresses, the ambient music in the scenes give the story a decent feeling of being alive which really is a nice add on. I do feel like the story should have had a few extra lines in certain scenes just to further boost and bump the story up; a good story can only be improved if one invests more detail into it. Something that I feel was a real let down is the fact that the choices didn\u2019t really matter at all this time around, making them useless to the game itself. Last but not least the game has a few spelling and grammar errors that were never fixed.\n\nAdult Patch:\n\nThis patch can be downloaded from Winged Cloud\u2019s Patreon pages for free and after installing it you can start a new game to experience scenes with sexual content and full on nudity. Do note that applying this patch makes the game pretty much a full on X-rated game where it is not implied sexual content or nudity but actual sexual content such as sex scenes and nudity in its \u2018nudist\u2019 form.\n\nSeveral scenes in the game will either move on to the next scene where the characters will have sex or new scripted texts will be available that leads to a sex scene.\n\nScore 7\nBy: MGRza\nDate: 13 September 2015\n\nAdditional info:\n\nPlatforms: PC: Mac: Linux\nGenre: Visual Novel: Anime\nCensor Rating: NSFW\nAge Rating: R18\nDeveloper: Winged Cloud\nPublisher: Winged Cloud\nRelease Date: 11 September 2015\n\nMGR Gaming Steam Curator:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32364038/\nMGR Gaming:\nhttps://www.mgrgaming.co.za", "timestamp_created": 1544770294, "timestamp_updated": 1589701223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47453530": {"recommendationid": "47453530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084855247", "num_games_owned": 1174, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 3094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1307, "last_played": 1697490463}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sakura Swim Club es mi favorita o de mis 3 favoritas dentro de la saga de novelas visual de Sakura, bastante entretenida con una buena historia que te tendr\u00e1 expectante, su dise\u00f1o es el mismo que todos los Sakura adem\u00e1s de tener parches para ponerlo en espa\u00f1ol y quitar censura para los interesados ^^\n\nSaludos y pasalo bien n,.,n", "timestamp_created": 1544502577, "timestamp_updated": 1544502577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636562228202819824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47305474": {"recommendationid": "47305474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834122680", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1545929512}, "language": "english", "review": "preety nice story and fanservice. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1544002961, "timestamp_updated": 1544002961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47279614": {"recommendationid": "47279614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039637722", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1505021411}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD", "timestamp_created": 1543862456, "timestamp_updated": 1543862456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47277659": {"recommendationid": "47277659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814365738", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1549327633}, "language": "english", "review": "Matthew 5:28\nBut I tell you that if you look at another woman and want her, you are already unfaithful in your thoughts. \n\n1 Corinthians 6:18\nFlee from sexual immorality.

For from within, out of a person\u2019s heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. All these vile things come from within; they are what defile you.\u201d \n\n1 Thessalonians 4:3-5\nFor this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God \n\nColossians 3:5\nSo put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires.

Adventure - VN - Visual Novel\nAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library\n\nTLDR: Formulaeic and cookie cutter. Mild but frequent anime art. Not much interaction. Too generic to matter. Forgettable.\n\nThis is a simple highschool VN in which you join a swim club\n\nThe girls at the swim club are adorable and immediately adopt you into their small secluded team. Then you walk on them a lot half undressed. Then they have their episode where they tell you a dramatic backstory element, become vulnerable, then after some akwardness you just all admit to each other your feelings. The three are a couple but by then you have to impress your dad by winning the swimming thing. But by then the girls helped you be better, so you win and your dad is proud. Then you have christmas with your two girls. The end.\n\nAs far as I can tell there are minor choices about your own backstory, e.g. what happened to you during your amnesia etc, but none of it really matters. The art is not really aggressive enough to really count as fan service, especially since the paperdolls feel very copy pasted by now. The main protagonist is really infantile in his mindset and behaviors, just wanting to be please everyone and not really thinking for himself much, and even sort of using the swim club as a crutch and a ritual to enter manhood by proving himself but its all very weaksauce.\n\nConclusion: Find something you resonate more with. This lacks a soul, and there is even some cross bleeding, such as the christmas arc at the end that ties in yet does not tie in with Sakura Santa. The occasional voice acting and frequent art was a step in the right direction though.

Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as an evolutionary response.[1]\nSwimming is consistently among top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.\nSwimming relies on the natural/non natural buoyancy of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies on the basis of both body composition and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy.\nSince the human body is only slightly less dense than water, water supports the weight of the body during swimming. As a result, swimming is \u201clow-impact\u201d compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.\nHydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body's motion through the water. To be more hydrodynamic, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance, though power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance.[7] Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.[7]\nJust before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. Squatting helps in enhancing a swimmer\u2019s start by warming up the thigh muscles.[8]\nHuman babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until the age of approximately 6 months.[9] Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex). The diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes).[9] Because infants are innately able to swim, classes for babies of about 6 months old are offered in many locations. This helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age.\nSwimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as 'strokes,' and these strokes are used for different purposes, or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming. It is not necessary to use a defined stroke for propulsion through the water, and untrained swimmers may use a 'doggy paddle' of arm and leg movements, similar to the way four-legged animals swim.\nThere are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly. Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions.[10] The butterfly stroke developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953.[11] Butterfly is known as the hardest stroke to many people. It burns the most calories compared to the other 3 strokes.[citation needed]\nOther strokes exist for specific purposes, such as training or rescue, and it is also possible to adapt strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to isolate certain body parts, such as swimming with arms only or legs only to train them harder, or for use by amputees or those affected by paralysis.\nSwimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BC. Some of the earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.\nThe coastal tribes living in the volatile Low Countries were known as excellent swimmers by the Romans. Men and horses of the Batavi tribe could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the Celts at the Battle of the Medway:[12]\nThe [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. . . . Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.\"\nIn 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a German professor of languages, wrote the first swimming book, The Swimmer or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming (Der Schwimmer oder ein Zweigespr\u00e4ch \u00fcber die Schwimmkunst)\nThere are many reasons why people swim, from swimming as a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity. Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries.\nMany swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to take part in. Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation or rehabilitation.[13] The support of the water, and the reduction in impact, make swimming accessible for people who are unable to undertake activities such as running.\nSwimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise[14] due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply to the muscles, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. Swimming is also effective in improving health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to positively impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers. Swimming can even improve mood.[15]\nAs of 2013, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that swimming pools in the United States be accessible to disabled swimmers.[16]\n\"Water-based exercise can benefit older adults by improving quality of life and decreasing disability. It also improves or maintains the bone health of post-menopausal women.\"[17]Swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance. Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley.\n\nThe sport is governed internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (FINA), and competition pools for FINA events are 25 or 50 meters in length. In the United States, a pool 25 yards in length is commonly use", "timestamp_created": 1530364702, "timestamp_updated": 1530364702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494809657335281372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43181652": {"recommendationid": "43181652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017103890", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 40109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 238, "last_played": 1586493360}, "language": "english", "review": "my parents think I am a disgrace. 10/10, recommended", "timestamp_created": 1530351196, "timestamp_updated": 1530351196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676504194736480713", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43180305": {"recommendationid": "43180305", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972264976", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 249, "last_played": 1565705982}, "language": "english", "review": "I am dimeraRaven and I approve this game.", "timestamp_created": 1530347049, "timestamp_updated": 1530347049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43172946": {"recommendationid": "43172946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162298559", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529987565}, "language": "english", "review": "Most realistic story for a moving to a new school type of visual novel. 10/10.

I'm not sure if it THE first eroge on steam, but its pretty close to it.   \n\nEveryone knows Winged Cloud at this point.  The Sakura visual novels are multiplying like rabbits.  With Renpy, visual novels are cheap and easy to make.  Sure you're not gonna get the next <insert critically acclaimed VN here> out of Winged Cloud, but that doesn't mean their visual novels are bad.  They set out to do one thing.\n\nThe story is pretty generic: new kid in school, joins the swim club, befriends two girls, and they eventually fight for his affections.  The \"twists\" in each character's story is pretty laughably bad.  \n\nThe voice acting is weird, but only because its in Japanese and the game was made in English, so its just a weird juxtaposition.  Otherwise the voice acting is fine.  The music is standard issue visual novel fluff.  The \"comedic\" music is kind of annoying, but fortunately doesn't show up too much.\n\nThe art is Wanaca.  Thats all I need to say.  A lot of people take issue that Wanaca has a same face problem, and its more or less true.  I like her art, so it doesn't bother me.  I swear Mieko was totally reused as Ceri in Sakura Dungeon though.  CG scenes are pretty frequent, but theres not too many.  With the uncensor patch, you'll have to replay the game once to get all the CGs,  Its pretty obvious where the choice is.  \n\nSo how is Winged Cloud's first venture into eroge?  Its not bad.

Yeah. Like, is that even relevant?\n\nWent into this with very low expectations and I was correct to do so.\nIt's a light novel and a \"Bish\u014djo game\" or, \"Pretty Girl Anime\" as quoted by Wikipedia. I do not wish to fill the void inside of me by \"interacting\"(1) with anime girls devoid of any real personality(2). Real people are much better for filling the void, presumably.\n\n1: Actual interaction is fairly limited, as per usual in the genre, or so I've heard. Interactions consist of picking one text option from two, usually not even leading to a different outcome.\n\n2: This implies I could wish to fill the void inside me with anime girls if they had real personality. Not the case, however. The void cannot be filled, no matter how hard you try or what you try to fill it with.\n\nKind of a generic story, couldn't relate all too well to the main character. It's always weird when you're playing as someone with parents. I guess he's intelligent, cynical even. Those are the only good traits I can see on him though. There are some allright themes going on, but the whole game feels building up to a climax ( ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) that just wasn't there in the end.\n\nIt's not all bad! \nMainly, there is some humor. Something about real-life not being a harem anime, even though this game *kind of* tries to be. No real direct attempts at humor, though.\nSoundtrack is good, ambient noise is unsettling, but maybe you like to hear high-pitched moaning every two sentences.\n\nWouldn't recommend anyone to \"play\" this, honestly. It's mis-labelled as horror in my opinion (though I guess triangle relationships are the stuff of horrors), which leads to you looking for a layer of depth that simply doesn't exist. Unless I didn't catch on to subliminal messaging? Doubt it. Why is this labelled as a horror game? (Leave your thoughts below).\n\nIf you want to see the lewd-ness, just go to community hub and look at guides for this game. Saves you like 5$. (Edit: 10$.

I've heard many things about the Sakura series but this is my first delving into it. And honestly, I was disappointed.\n\nThe story revolves around a high school student with over the top rich parents who send him to school after school that he doesn't care enough to put the effort into. At least until he finds one with a rather infamous swimming club. Learning how to swim with two very curvacious women in tight swimsuits motivates a high school kid, go figure. It has some very strong points but is overshadowed by one thing; the breasts.\n\nI have no issues with fan service or nudity or breasts, that should be obvious since I play so many eroge type games. The reason this VN has an issue with breasts is because every single time you think the characters are going to get flushed out or some bit of a rather dark past will be revealed, it just never happens. Instead, someone trips and somehow manages to throw all of their clothes off and just barely cover their nipples with some random object or some wind hikes up their skirt and they can't help but just bend over and show everything off to the world. And then, of course, the protagonist is shamed and called a pervert for happening to be in the general area when it happens although he never seems to give a rat's ass about any of it.\n\nSeriously, this really killed what would otherwise be a kind of interesting, albeit rushed, visual novel. You kind of have to chose which kind of VN you want to be; one based around fan service and sex or one based around story. You have have elements of both, but you can't try and be both at the same time. It just makes the whole experience awkward.\n\nThe artwork is appealing but the characters shift back and forth while talking and the CG lacks any kind of change in expressions during dialogue. In fact, it's not uncommon for characters to look really pissed off when the atmosphere suddenly changes because they haven't gotten another line of dialogue yet and the developers couldn't be bothered to animate more than one character changing expressions at a time.\n\nI give Sakura Swim Club a 3/10. This VN has bits where I find myself wanting to dive straight into the story only for tits to suddenly take the center stage and knock me straight back out. And yet I can't just enjoy the tits for what they are because none of the situations seem believable or make any sense and just come out of nowhere.\n\nMaybe the rest of the series has some quality, but I can't be bothered to try and find out after this one.", "timestamp_created": 1515316381, "timestamp_updated": 1515316381, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39139440": {"recommendationid": "39139440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258917042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1571078742}, "language": "english", "review": "Dope af, nice story, aaaaand......pretty good fanservice. \n\n\n\nHow tf do you get uncensored mode?", "timestamp_created": 1515296355, "timestamp_updated": 1515296355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39098906": {"recommendationid": "39098906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126318725", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1524957251}, "language": "english", "review": "I like swim club.", "timestamp_created": 1515191191, "timestamp_updated": 1515191191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496774196624755859", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39096249": {"recommendationid": "39096249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182721213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 190, "last_played": 1639788695}, "language": "english", "review": "There was no nudity.

The game itself serves as a sombre reminder of the event\n\nOh boy. What a way to start into my first game in the Sakura series. By this point I\u2019ve grown pretty used to playing these games that are more aimed towards men, and this series really takes it to the extreme. Sakura Swim Club is the latest release in the (monthly?) series of Sakura titles on Steam.\n\nIn Sakura Swim Club, you, as the reader, are in the role of Kaede. Kaede is your typical boring guy who comes from a family of prodigies. Of course, he doesn\u2019t care enough to do well in school. His father keeps transferring him to different schools every semester, hoping to find one that will finally \u201cclick\u201d so Kaede will follow in his footsteps. With his latest transfer, he bumps into (quite literally) a girl. Later, he goes to check out the swim club and finds out this girl is a part of this. This begins his long journey to make it to the tournament where he decides to prove to his dad that this school is working for him and he doesn\u2019t want to leave.\n\nNow, for those unaware, the Sakura series isn\u2019t exactly known for having a serious plot. If my experience with Sakura Swim Club says anything, it doesn\u2019t seem to have a very realistic plot either. The main focus is on how dirty it can become. Don\u2019t worry \u2013 the base Steam version is censored. You won\u2019t really \u201csee\u201d anything. This doesn\u2019t take out all of the near nakedness or panty shots though.\n\nGoing into Sakura Swim Club, I knew what to expect from it. I knew that things were going to get a bit risqu\u00e9. It still would\u2019ve been nice if there was, say, an actually tangible plot line. The \u201cplot\u201d makes basically no sense. Often times, things would happen just so the story could go completely off and have a lewd picture happen. Oh hey look, we\u2019re at a cultural festival! The MC has no idea what this even is, but the girls force him to go just so that they can go and show him these lewd swimsuits/outfits.\n\nSakura Swim Club is definitely aimed at a particular kind of audience. If you\u2019re wanting to read a serious visual novel then there are plenty on Steam I might suggest instead of this. If you want a pretty nonsense story that just throws in events so that one can get more lewd pictures in then sure, maybe the Sakura series is for you. I also spotted some typos within the writing which didn\u2019t help with how much the story was already making me laugh from the nonsense within. With how much nonsense I found in the story, it\u2019s hard for me to recommend this. It was already a particularly hard recommend because it\u2019s aimed at such a specific audience, but the absolutely nonsense story and events happening just to get into a lewd picture push it past the point of non-recommendation.\n\nSakura Swim Club is very similar to other Sakura games. Despite all the fanservice thrown in CG form, there\u2019s always a human emotion aspect that\u2019s relatable. This game has an ongoing theme that it\u2019s better to be yourself deciding what you want to do instead of having the path of life decided for you ahead of time against your choosing.\n\nSakura Swim Club, like Sakura Angels, got a free voice patch after release. The voices fit the characters well and amplify the reading experience quite a bit.\n\nDescribing Sakura Swim Club is difficult, not because of the game, which is fairly flat and straightforward, but because it was meant for adults and must be carefully tip-toed around for proper reviewing. A simple and short visual novel, it follows the story of 'Generic Guy' as he adjusts to a new school environment. His problem? He's unmotivated and uninterested with the world. Forced to pick a club GG opts to go for the swimming club; a club that consists of only two female members and has developed an infamous reputation. Upon arriving he meets up with 'Tsundere' and 'Sweet Girl,' and various things start to follow.\n\nThis visual novel is not good. The primary reason is because it was meant for one purpose and one purpose alone. As a result the characters are flat, and the story is little more than a token piece meant to tie everything together - often tripping over itself in order to add comedic and \"romantic\" moments at seemingly random times. At one point, for example, GG has 'Tsundere' and 'Sweet Girl' over at his house when the later one notices that GG has a game console. In her attempts to utilize it certain hijinks ensue that seem impossible for multiple reasons, and were clearly included simply to have said hijinks.\n\nAs a visual novel it ends up being quite lacking, as the choices are, few and almost never all that deep (at best). There is a bit of a plot and story involving GG and how he will adapt to the new school and handle his overbearing parents, yet it's never all that tense and the conclusions are fairly obvious. The plot is flat with no real twists or turns, the characters are archetypes through and through, but at least, if there's one redeeming feature that is that, as a piece of a certain\u2026 genre, it's decently acceptable.\n\nWhile clearly not on par with more thought out pieces and certainly underwhelming, there isn't actually something 'wrong' with Sakura Swim Club. The art is decent enough, the story, while clumsy, is not really the main focus, and the characters, while obvious recycled clich\u00e9s with little deviation, are also not really bad or all that groan-worthy.

Changing two lines of text does not count : I want either different scenes, or callbacks to my previous choices later.\n\nSakura Swim Club did NOT provide those two basic things.\n\nYes, the art is nice, and it has voice acting. \n...But I was bored to death. There was no plot point that suprised me or gave me a reason to feel any tension, and the behavior of the characters seemed illogical at times. I just couldn't get into it.\n\nI know I am being subjective here. But even if I forget my boredom with the hyper-conventional story, the two problems mentionned before are still here. This means this game is objectively subpar. A good VN wouldn't give you choices if they don't change anything.\n\nMaybe if you are REALLY REALLY into swimsuits you can overlook all this because titties.

The artwork is that of a game I have never seen before, the shading on each of the characters was done so well it seems as though these 2d girls were 3d, not to mention the wonderful scenery and great hud. \nThe gameplay was very in debt and was very immersive, it was as if I was playing this game with an oculus rift and one of those vr treadmills. When I was playing this game I instantly knew this would hit top 5 of my favorite games, along with games of the likes of Knack 2 and Yooka laylee. The gameplay is very fluid and character movement is quick, this game is not for slowpokes!\nThe story was wonderful, this game had a 48 hour story along with 72 hours worth of side quests and 60 hours worth of dlc story. The main story brought me to tears, made me life, and brough me to the verge of clinical depression so many times that I feel it is worth mentioning how GOOD this story is. Your 3 main characters are well developed throughout the story and you can connect with them very well. The Side quests make you feel as if your involved with the various communities that are in the game such as White Run and the NCR. Doing meaningless tasks for people I don't know never felt so immersive. Then the dlc content was the icing on the 3 layered chocolate frosted moose filling ice cream with whipped cream cake, the new areas added along with the dlc content give you more to do after you have done everything to do that is in the game, even after collecting all 100 golden skulltulas.\nThe community for this game is no nice and kind, I have never once been matched with salty/angry people. Whenever I play ranked games or even just casual matches I always enjoy talking to my team because they never once are rude or angry to me. The modding community adds the sprinkles on top of the cherry because now you have over 1000+ hours worth of gameplay to add to your game. I especially love the modded weapons!\n\nAll in all my review for this game is [spoiler] 2/10 BECAUSE SWIMMING PHYSICS SUCK .[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1506977123, "timestamp_updated": 1511380199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35337934": {"recommendationid": "35337934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062594030", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 263, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1506815700}, "language": "english", "review": "Best quote of this game is \"Real life isn't a harem anime\".\n\nThis is, with added chlorine.", "timestamp_created": 1506779114, "timestamp_updated": 1506779114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35313341": {"recommendationid": "35313341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325083975", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1558744167}, "language": "english", "review": "I heard many negative reviews from this game, but for me it was really enjoyable experience.

The fucking thing doesn't even last an hour, and the 'choices' you make amount to picking either peanutbutter or jelly on toast. It doesn't even attempt an illusion of meaningful choice (Like in the fantastic game Life is Strange), and none of them affect the hentai scenes. BTW, if you aren't going to patch this, don't even bother. \n\nThe Story is dog-shit, and they weren't trying to do so. You are CHAD boy who naturally attracts 2 fertile females for unexplained reasons. I wanted to pretend my character was the most Alpha Chad beast to give an explanation, but your character is a whiny bitch who can't fucking swim, hates his dad, and is generally a socially awkward autist. They actually attempted a narrative, but it's hilariously misguided. \n\nThe best way to craft a story containing smut is either treat it seriously or, if you don't have the skill to do that, you can just write it tongue-in-cheek. This game and the Sakura games I've played are absolutely inept at writing a story, but take the narrative to levels of such desperation for character development, that they can deal with real death in the middle of hentai scenes. Imagine me stroking my wangus, having a gay old time and suddenly big tit bitch #2 talks about how her mother has BREAST CANCER??? The other girl's best friend also got run over by a fucking car and became paraplegic, and that's not my fetish I must say.\n\nI'm not saying games can't deal with death, even erotic games, but the writing is so consitantly terrible here that I never saw these 2 holographic titbags as more than the sex apeal they were designed to be. When they threw these serious topics at me I litterally burst out laughing so hard I woke my mom. How could they be THIS directionless, and in the end it's revealed the moral of the story is \"be a NEET loser who relies on his parents, because hot chicks will like you regardless\". This message is so transparent, it's insulting and funny all the same. \n\nThe art is servicable, and it damn well better be since the game offers litterally nothing else, but the end gallery only has like 20 pictures and all of them can be better met with a rule 34 search. If you were expecting allot of Japanese swimsuits prepare to be dissapointed, you'll get 6, the rest are school uniforms and random garbage the girls stumbled into. Fuck, the ending scene has them wearing Santa uniforms out of fucking nowhere, you just transition into an Xmas fucking. \n\nThis game is mostly a desert of text with a couple grains of salty images scattered among the ripples, but the hour trek will never be worth much of anything. I'd say if you still want it, buy it for 2.50 AT MOST, I'd reccomend going as low as 1.00$. I got this shit on a bundle, so I'm good with what I payed, but I'd be seriously burned paying 10 dollars for 1 hour of this trash. \n\nIf you want a better game on Steam, get Huniepop, you don't have to go through a complicated zip. file to activate the boobies.

Anyways, words do this game no justice, I'd recommend it and you definitely need to try it out in order to find out if you will like the Sakura Series.\nAlso, please, play the game with the H-Patch.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/wingedcloud", "timestamp_created": 1505158736, "timestamp_updated": 1511381728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34869188": {"recommendationid": "34869188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073907178", "num_games_owned": 893, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1505070287}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta decente y hace que me entren ganas de volver a nadar. \nAdem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n esta disponible un parche de traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol+versi\u00f3n sin censura.", "timestamp_created": 1505070625, "timestamp_updated": 1505070625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444417953491211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34867969": {"recommendationid": "34867969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073523909", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1505046113}, "language": "english", "review": "At least the art is good....?", "timestamp_created": 1505066851, "timestamp_updated": 1505066851, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496037811040878296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34856132": {"recommendationid": "34856132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006413390", "num_games_owned": 3170, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1538408557}, "language": "english", "review": "This 6th title of the Sakura series from Winged Cloud feature a male protagonist Kaede who transferred to another high school after numerous transfers due to poor grades in different schools and his parents having to move constantly.

The toughest part of the campaign I have to say though is definitely End of The Line, known more notoriously as the 'Train Mission'. You have to sneak through the ruins of Pripyat as the S.A.S. and kill this Russian guy. Though it does really pick up once you fight your first dragon.

So rating this game next to that is unfair, but besides the point. \n\nI can live with the pointless fan service. I can deal with stories that lack depth. I can even deal with the repetitive blatant ignorance of the MC (which is commom among these type of games). But what I hate most is how LINEAR it is. No matter what option you pick in this game, it all leads to the same ending with slighty different dialogue hear and there. And that's disappointing. What about my choices? Why do they have no effect in how the game progress? If I wanted to experience a linear story, I'd watch anime, or read manga. What's the point of even giving you options? You might as well just smash the ENTER button for 3 hours, since what you choose makes no difference anyway. \n\nSo with that, I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down. If you like this game, recommend it to whoever, but I'm sorry, because I can't do the same.", "timestamp_created": 1495264715, "timestamp_updated": 1495264715, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647132992744445801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31847284": {"recommendationid": "31847284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120482962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 173, "last_played": 1485118642}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Visual Novel, I have played a few and can 100% recomend this visual novel.

Debo resaltar que su simpleza no disminuir\u00e1 el talento de este juego, al contrario, son estas cosas las que definen a las Novelas Visuales y son la raz\u00f3n por la que decidimos divertirnos con estos juegos.\n\nEn esta novela tendremos la disponibilidad de tomar decisiones, pero que no alteraran mucho la historia, ya que solo existe un final, pero de ellas, en algunas ocasiones podemos disfrutar de los tradicionales \"Momentos Cr\u00edticos De La Novela\" al estilo Moe. \n\n[h1] POR OTRO LADO [/h1]\n\nQuisiera ademas hablar un poco de al menos dos personajes por los cuales creo que son los que mas lograron llamarme la Atenci\u00f3n.\n\n[b]Kaede :[/b] Quien ademas por ser el protagonista, es un personaje introvertido quien concibe y reflexiona mucho acerca de las cosas mas simples como las relaciones, los padres, y el mas importante de todos : \"Que Hacer Con Nuestra Vida\", lo que me parece un trastorno que muchos de nosotros compartimos y que en el transcurso de esta historia me pude identificar en varias partes.\n\n[b]Hiromi :[/b] Una belleza sensual en todos los sentidos, en cuerpo y en personalidad, creo que al identificarme con el protagonista, y que haya una chica como ella aconsejando a alguien quien es por parte un espejo de mi personalidad, me hizo darle mucho cari\u00f1o.\n\nY Bueno, Termino Con Esto, Francamente es una buena novela gr\u00e1fica, recomiendo esta novela para quienes deseen pasar el rato, su tiempo estimado es de 2-10 horas dependiendo de la velocidad con que quieras avanzar los di\u00e1logos.\n\nEspero Que Este An\u00e1lisis Haya Sido De Tu Agrado.", "timestamp_created": 1491928411, "timestamp_updated": 1494643948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828679025173187256", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31072787": {"recommendationid": "31072787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2378, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 130, "last_played": 1491893278}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an... interesting game.

In fact, the game displays a very linear path with decisions that cause little to no effect to the final conclusion.\n\nAll in all, I would highly recommened this game to those who are looking for a visual novel on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1483248757, "timestamp_updated": 1483248757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28815926": {"recommendationid": "28815926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103429377", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491806805}, "language": "english", "review": "god this game made me so fucking hard i love it and bust atleast 18 nuts to it", "timestamp_created": 1483072445, "timestamp_updated": 1483072445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28779214": {"recommendationid": "28779214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018648943", "num_games_owned": 1390, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482990615}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would get ntr again by both of my girlfriends", "timestamp_created": 1482990666, "timestamp_updated": 1482990666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28732339": {"recommendationid": "28732339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195801565", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1509343047}, "language": "english", "review": "Just go download the nudity patch and enjoy this game's amazingness.", "timestamp_created": 1482884442, "timestamp_updated": 1482884442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "28552303": {"recommendationid": "28552303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115299319", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1482472466}, "language": "english", "review": "This visual novel is nothing short of an embarrassment.\n\nThe story pacing is all over the place, girls in this story have boobs large enough to collapse in on themselves, you could easily remove chunks of the game and have no difference in the story, and I came out of this game more confused than when I went in. \n\nThe \"Choices\" You make through the game have very little or no change on the actual story. Not to mention the fact that you only have two choices and they don't appear for every ten or so minutes. Even then you can't pick choices you even care about, the game automatically forces you to date both girls anyway.\n\nSpeaking of which, both of the girls fall in love with you but they do as such miraculously at the same time, for reasons that make absolutly no sense nonetheless, regardless of the fact that they know next to nothing about you. Supposedly they're very smart yet disprove this by both agreeing to date the main character at the same time: Again showing that they have no personality. Or at least the personality they do have is torn in half and thrown under a bus by the time they fall in love with you.\n\nMoving on: The dad, whose only purpose in the story is to talk to you on the phone and stall time so that the days don't feel so close together. Later in the story changing that purpose to becoming a temporary antagonist, telling his son he has to move. Which I, as the player, do not care about because the main character is practically brain dead anyway for chosing two girls rather than one like a normal fucking human being. For those people who DO care though, don't fret as this only last for about five minutes going a little something like this;\n-\"Girlfriend 1, girlfriend 2, I'm retarded so my dad is making me go to another school\"\n-\"What? Noooo. Call him back, tell him no.\"\n-\"Okay.\"\nCalls the dad back.\n-\"Shove off, Dad, I'm staying.\"\n-\"Pfft. Alright.\"\nWTF is happening?! Obviously, these aren't the exact lines but they're not that far off so it doesn't even matter. I can't even make up a story this bad. I can't, I really can't, beyond that I don't even WANT to make up a story this bad. It's that bad. That's all this stupid visual novel is! I had to turn my brain off in order to keep playing half way through. Do I even need to talk about all the absolutly forced fan-service? I'm all for it, as long as it doesn't get in the way of the good stuff, but in Sakura Swim Club, or whatever this crap is called. Don't even know if that's right. Here though, you have fan-service up the ass, walk into a room with a girl in order to study so you don't fail at life? NOPE! She's stripping now? Okay. \"This is stupid\" Shut up brain.\nOh! How about that one moment? You want to play videogames with a girl? NOPE! The controller, inexplicably, has a magic fucking cord. Managing to not only strip one of the girls, somehow, but wrap around her body and tighten into some weird BDSM kink fantasy. At least it was kind enough to cover her nipples though, that silly controller cable.\n\nIt saddens me, it really does. The girls of this game have some really good designs, and Himori has an awesome personality for the first half of the game. It just sucks that this game waste their potential by trying to force itself. For the most part, this isn't even a visual novel. It's a poorly written book with fan-service drawings every few pages and the ability to, slightly, change a few dialogues here and there. Though not perfectly, I feel like this visual novel wouldn't totally suck if it just gave you the option to chose which girl you want to date rather than being forced to date them both. \n\nNow for the twats out there who skip to the end of my review.

Sakura Spirit is a 2014 visual novel developed by Winged Cloud and published by Sekai Project. The game was released on July 9, 2014 on Steam and MangaGamer. It is one of the few visual novels that are developed outside Japan and aimed at the English-speaking market. It is also one of the first projects published by Sekai Project that is not a translation of a Japanese visual novel, but rather an original English work. The game is a visual novel where the player reads text on the screen combined with anime-styled artwork. However, unlike some other visual novels, Sakura Spirit does not allow the player to make selections (except for one at the end), which normally allows the visual novel's plot to progress in the direction of the player's choice.

I beat the game (aswell as my meat).\n\nAnd I found out I am no big fan of VNs, At least of the ones [i] that are considered being really good since they're on steam. [/i]\n\nThe hentai pics are really good. Definetly worth beating to it.\nBut that seemed to be the best thing. Story was what you expect from being linear and fanservice.\nNice idea of a story though, I'll give them that.\n\n6.5/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468512897, "timestamp_updated": 1468512897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499322175979614258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24316161": {"recommendationid": "24316161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064727446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1527265092}, "language": "english", "review": "install h patch for top quality memes", "timestamp_created": 1468508992, "timestamp_updated": 1468508992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584330976009368896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24310972": {"recommendationid": "24310972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258482740", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 251, "last_played": 1492324127}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game for a while now, and beat it several times, but i'm planning to finishing it some day.\n\n10/10 Would \"beat it\" with one hand.\n\nPs: download the hentai patch...", "timestamp_created": 1468486051, "timestamp_updated": 1468486051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500677824020385742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24294791": {"recommendationid": "24294791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262597788", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14477, "last_played": 1499245751}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would have 3 way relationship again", "timestamp_created": 1468413724, "timestamp_updated": 1650180109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53769981861114502", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24291947": {"recommendationid": "24291947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124068796", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1477488912}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1468401787, "timestamp_updated": 1468401787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50842893123626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24282132": {"recommendationid": "24282132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009258182", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 89, "last_played": 1521782901}, "language": "english", "review": "The audacity of choice when no matter what you click the game continues as intended.

But it wasn't until now that I caved in and bought it thanks to the summer sale.  But is it any good or should it of been drowned in the development stages?\n\nWell I went into SSC with high expectations as the only VNs I had played before hand was the Nekopara and because of this I ended up coming out a bit disapointed. In regards to plot well there isn't really any I mean it's a hentai I game I get it but at least Nekopara was able to create a story with varying character arcs that could also lead to sequel games but eh. The protagonist is called Kaede and honestly he has about as much personality as a cardboard cutout of the WWE wrestler Roman Reigns. He transfers to a new school and looks for a club to join he stumbles across the swimming clubs and after a hasty start with its members eventually becomes romantically involved with the 2 members of the club. \n\nHonestly if you have seen any school anime you have seen this kind of story before, they try to make it emotional and act as if the 2 girls actually have character but after the touching moments the character development seems to go out of the window and the matters discussed no longer effect the 2 girls at all. Honestly though the story comes across as cheesy and I found myself actually laughing at some of the predictable tropes that occured in the story to the point where I see its cheesiness as a good thing. There is also now a Japanese dub for the girls in the gae and honestly the VO is great I would sah\n\nAh yes I may as well talk about the girls whilst I am here. Allow me to introduce typical tsundere character number 761 and typical calm and collected character number 828 yeah they are basic characters that don't have much depth to them at all but again it is a hentai game so I don't really know what was expecting.\n\nLast but no means least and the reason the game has this infamous reputation is the 18+ scenes although they are not animated like Nekopara I would say they are nicely put together but I suppose the great artwork is the reason for this. They're okay. And are honestly worth both your time and use of hand cream.\n\nSo even though I see Sakura Swim Club as a some what mediocre game I can't say that I wouldn't reccomend it as it's a hentai game and those scenes aren't bad in all honesty. The only other thing to note is the music apart from 2 tracks THAT WILL DRIVE YOU INSANE AFTER BEING PLAYED OVER AND OVER the soundtrack is pretty good too. So for what this game is it ain't half bad especially consdering all of the other shit that gets put up on steam these days. \n\nNow if you excuse me I am going to get the trading cards craft the badge and have friends message me as to what the hell I have been playing for the next 3 months.", "timestamp_created": 1467134218, "timestamp_updated": 1467134218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23897070": {"recommendationid": "23897070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315216103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1468943329}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game to those who don't know the genre, and are into *cough* sexy things *cough* .

Because in every other aspect, this game doesn't feel like the 6th installment in the Sakura series, having very low potential on a series that is already pretty lukewarm.\n\n[h1][b][u]Story[/u][/b][/h1]\nLike Sakura Spirit, nothing too remarkable, in this one however, they took a more down-to-earth tone, however, not compensating with more meat to the bone, even when it gets humorous or \"attempts\" to be tragic, is still way too basic for its own good, Spirit wasn't much better, but atleast we had a more diverse and exotic type of plot.\n\n[h1][b][u]Cast[/u][/b][/h1]\nOh geez, what did they do to you?\nSpoilers aside, you only have two girls, as oppose to the (5?) in Sakura Spirit, it could have been good if each was introduced and dug deep into, but we never learn anything from them besides their latest trauma/worry, our main character isn't any better, needless to say, this results into a very empty attachment with the characters, if not for the fap or waifu material, don't get me wrong they are charming, but the lack of compensation makes it a step backwards.\n\n[h1][b][u]Writing[/u][/b][/h1]\nIs just K, can call a couple of typos and as the previous segments have told already, everything is very voidy in this game, nothing is truly developed to create a... you know... Visual Novel.\nAt times you are given plot options, but the only difference is that one of them triggers a few additional lines of dialogue and the other doesn't, I didn't have much of a problem, but for standing of VNs, this would pass as the barest kind of minimum.\n\n[h1][b][u]Graphics[/u][/b][/h1]\nWill say, just as good as its previous games, the BGs and your girls are pretty nicely detailed and with the CGs the detail goes all out, showing great... exposition, if you get me.\nNot everything here is bliss though, like Spirit, the number of Portraits is limited (Still more than Spirit anyway) and at times, they can be lacking, losing some cinematography, especially when the girls reveal their problems.\n\n[h1][b][u]Soundtrack[/u][/b][/h1]\nLike the Graphics, it remains pretty solid for the most part, the songs bring various types of beat to them and they generally work good with the situations used, they can get kinda loopy at points, and the music fades-out instead of looping, which bothers me to no end (Spirit did it too, but atleast the tracks were longer).\n\n[h1][b][u]Duration[/u][/b][/h1]\n[b]OH BOY[/b]... Just when you thought the strongest and most prominent point of VNs was missed with this one.\nLegit here, it barely took me 1 hour to finish the game, AutoSkip can do it under 7 minutes.\nMost of the game is bland, but this point takes it too far, Spirit atleast lasted 2 hours at bare minimum, in what mindset one releases a Novel as short as this?\nDon't let my playtime decieve you, i just had to run the extra hour because I was getting the Trading Cards.\n\n[h1][b][u]tl;dr[/u][/b][/h1]\nI want to like this game, but the sheer simplicity and mediocrity of this game unables me, is not terrible, is just bare and too plain to be a good VN.\nIf you wanna support Winged Cloud, Check out the other Sakura games see if anyone is better, if you are looking for a decent VN, look somewhere else, you ain't gonna find it here.\nIt has the ingredients, it just happens to go by the path of plain functionality.\n\n[b]As such, i shall grant this game...[/b]\n[h1][b][u]Plain[/u] [u]Omelette[/u]/10[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1463959789, "timestamp_updated": 1525146855, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474429190158843994", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23143916": {"recommendationid": "23143916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182053098", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1464072045}, "language": "english", "review": "I love these Sakura weeb ass games.

The presentation is cleaner, the dialog is less awkward, the story makes more sense, and there happens to be an 18+ patch for the game if you are over 18 and would like more explicit content.  \n\nA word about the patch.  It isn't available directly on Steam and the game itself is not uncensored without the patch in order to comply with Steam's rules and make the game more accessible.  So ignore the complaints from those who say there is false advertising.  It does take a bit more work to install the patch than say the one for Sunrider did, but it's not bad and you definitely don't need to enjoy the patch.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like the Sakura games and don't have this one, pick it up while it is on sale.

Her sad part of the story is that her mother has cancer and Hiromi worries that  there will be one day when her mother leaves her for good. But near the end of the story, it says that her mother is getting better\n\nMieko is the tsundere type as she yells and scolds Kaede for being stupid or a pervert, but blushes and loses her self control when he compliments her and saying that she is cute at times. Before Kaede transfered to the school, she and Hiromi had a friend who used to be part of the swim club, till one day she was hit by a drunk driver and was paralyzed from the incident. However, she tried to swim, but nearly drowned as she near the end of the pool, until Mieko and Hiromi were able to save her in the nick of time. Yet, after this incident, the crippled friend started spreading rumors that it was Mieko's fault that she was in that state and thus began the infamous reputation the swim club had in the beginning.\n\nWhile playing this game, I was fondly more emotional toward Mieko's story because she had to live with such a burden. I never thought I would emotionally feel her pain of carrying that lie around and losing a friend like that.

Coming out, well, it was about what I expected.\n\nSakura Swim Club follows the story of boring Kaede as he transfers to a new school. There, he meets a member of the swim club (by bumping into her in the hallway and getting a full view of her underwear). Things go crazy from there, with \"story\" points happening just to have the two girls suddenly become exposed. These \"story\" points mostly make no sense and just don't have an explanation. Sorry, but I've never heard of water being able to rip apart swimsuits or controller cables coming to life and stripping someone. \n\nSure, if you're looking for \"that\" kind of game then go right ahead. Otherwise, try and just stay as far away as you can. On top of the completely illogical plot, there are also numerous spelling/grammar errors throughout the story.

However there are spelling mistakes, phrases like \"weeks pass\" and then the characters talk about events prior that happend \"a few days ago\", plot disintergrates after second hour and just because sex obsessed towards the end. Not consistant, not a good story overall and ends on a sudden note with no ending to certain issues. \n\nStory: Bad\nThe whole game is basically split into two halfs in its story, the first hour and second hour. The first hour you are intoduced to these three characters (protaganist and both love intrests) and learn about them, develop a connection for each character and care about each characters issues in the game. After being told all these issues, the second hour begins and all of these things are forgotten about and replaced with mindless and poorly written sex scenes. There is NO character development in relation to the first hours issues, these issues are forgotten. The protaganists issues are solved in the second hour BUT the way he fixes them has nothing to do with the problems he is facing. Some of the issues are not resolved so you are left wondereing what will happen to these characters.\n\nArt: Great! but lazy\nThe art is fantastic, background are stunning and character design makes both love intrests look pretty in their own way. However the love intrests are the only drawn characters in the game, unless you count the protaganists 'gengleman' area. A teacher that you talk to is not drawn so you fell like your talking to a chair during these conversations. Parents are via a phone call so this is acceptable but there are no other students or characters in this game, very minimal design. \n", "timestamp_created": 1442951230, "timestamp_updated": 1442951230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48432457447052002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18142473": {"recommendationid": "18142473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080599829", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 60, "last_played": 1453885763}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and the V.N is decent, but I know you're going to by it for the plot.

I'll split it up into sections and then provide an overall.\n\nArt - 8\n\nThe art hasn't changed all that much since the earlier Sakura games, still the same big-boobed designs and similar faces. Not that that is a bad thing, because it is appealing art. What has improved is angle representation and overall anatomical presentation. The characters look more natural in their CGs, which is very important. There is room for improvement, but it's gotten a lot better.\n\nCharacters - 7\n\nFairly cliche characters, which again is not a bad thing, because it's comfortable. The girl's personalities are engaging and entertaining, with Mieko being a classic tsundere and Hiromi being the cool girl. My main qualm with the characters is actually the protagonist. Where these two girls are pouring their hearts out to him and he helps them work through their individual issues, he seems set on refusing any help for his own. It's annoying.\n\nSound - 8\n\nNothing to really write home about. It fulfills it's purpose, and matches appropriate scenes with the proper music for the mood. The sound effects sound fairly natural and nice. They could do with a slightly wider variety of music at longer lengths though. They loop too quickly and too much.\n\nStory and Writing - 7\n\nThese two go hand in hand, so I'm combining them. I won't put any spoilers, but the story is fairly cliche, like much of everything else in the game. Again, not a bad thing. It's comfortable, and has some very amusing parts. The main problem I have is with the pacing. Things move VERY quickly. I know it's hard to complain about the length of a $10 VN when longer full-length VNs are somewhere around $40-50 (although much of that comes from voice acting), but they could definitely have transitioned events better and not time-skipped as much as they did. I feel like there was a lot of wasted opportunity in the story. Not every scene needs a CG to accompany it. The writing for the most part is solid, gets the point across, and the jokes are amusing. Not really much to say here, except they should have given the game a more thorough QC pass before sending it out. I've pointed out a number of easy grammar and spelling errors that any half-decent QC and editor should have noticed and fixed.\n\nOverall - 7\n\nSakura Swim Club is a decent short-length VN with an amusing and sometimes dramatic story. While it's main purpose is certainly showcasing the famous boobs and butts of it's illustrator, it is a fairly fun ride, albeit with some quirks and definitely has room for improvement. It moves along a bit too quickly to really get attached to the characters and their various personal issues, so it has pacing problems, but it tells it's story well enough in the time it's allowed.

If you play these only to beat your meat then by all means go ahead and catch a glimpse of a few \"revealing\" pictures, don't expect too much though. There's several reasons why this fails as a good VN. The characters are shallow and provoke no feelings at all. The plot is cheesy, highly unrealistic, boring and rushed. Kaede, the protagonist, makes no connection to the player in any way. Simply throwing in some daddy issues and half assed soul searching does not immerse the player in the story. While the two other characters provided some hopes as plot devices they failed their role of both heroines and plot device. Feeling sympathy or empathy for the heroines is nigh impossible since their conflict is touched only slightly and immediately resolved once they're introduced. Apathy is the only thing I ever felt towards any character since their choices are ridiculously simple and have no impact on anything. There is only one route which is too perfect to be happy about. Plot itself is cheap and very dull, there is no real main conflict until half way through the game and even that is resolved just a few moments later. If you're not looking for conflict but rather romance even that concept is slaughtered by a stupid \"tease never show anything and no real feelings\" relationship. This is a VN without plot, depth and characters.

However, the game is also quite short, and I beat it and followed every possible path in about 2 hours, and not only that, but there are honestly fairly few H scenes to be found regardless. All in all, the game is likely worth your time if you're an average hentai VN reader, but at 10 dollars the price is rather steep for what I consider to be a short and frankly unpolished VN.

The art is great, and the soundtrack is actually surprisingly good for being a visual novel/h-game.

It sounds depressing but guess what? There's BOOBS!\n\n\nI was oddly surprised with Sakura Swim Club.  Having never read (\"played\") a visual novel before I wasn't quite sure what I was in for.  I had played some choose your own adventure style games like Appointment with F.E.A.R. in which you design your character and make choices throughout the story.  Your choices in these games have immediate consequences and often lead to dead ends.  There are no dead ends in this.  It is truly just a graphic novel on your computer.  Your choices are menial and make no real difference in the story line other than a few new lines immediately after your choice.  So let's break it down.  \n\nVisuals: 2/5\nWell, there are well drawn busty anime girls, that is the ultimate benefit to the visuals.  You get to see about 20 images of our two sexy protagonists Mieko and Hiromi.  Other than these shots the rest of the game is pretty lacking in the visuals department. There are about a half dozen backgrounds that are repeated throughout the story. They obviously could have expanded on the environments and background images. There is no animation of any kind.  When you are talking the characters kind of fade out and fade in to a new position and that is the extent of it.  Some panning across the screen or simply guiding the character across the screen would have been a bit exciting.  The other odd part of the visual backgrounds is that there are no people in them.  You end up talking to your teacher in class, but you don't see anyone in the empty classroom.  I found that a bit odd.  Were they too lazy to draw in classmates and a teacher?\n\nGameplay: 1/5\nWell you don't really play anything.  There are under 20 \"choices\" that you get to make, but they do not change the story.  They merely change a sentence or two after you make your choice.  Your character, Kaede, immediately reconnects with the original plot no matter what choice you make.  So essentially you click through the dialogue.  I took my time, writing notes, taking screen shots etc for videos and finished this graphic novel in under 4 hours.  It will probably take you a lot less.  I believe if you just wanted to cruise through and see the boobs, you could probably rapid click this game in about a half hour. \n\nAudio: 1/5\nThe music in this game is pretty sucky.  There are about a half dozen songs that loop during the chapters.  They loop often though.  Each song is about a minute long and does not loop very well. The songs feel like they were ripped from another game where they actually made sense and fit the mood of the game.  In this novel they do very little to enhance the story.  In fact they distract you from the story because they suck so much.  On a different not, the sound effects and ambient noises are great.  The water for the pool sounds great.  The muddled hall conversations give the reader a feel of being in school.  Not sure how they could do so well on one aspect and completely blew it on the other.\n\nStory Line: 3/5\nThis is the part that blew me away.  I was expecting some cheesy high school relationship banter and some silly hentai situations that result in people seeing each other naked.  Well they have that in here, but they also have some really deep shit.  We have a protagonist with a serious rift that has torn his relationship with his dad apart.  A girl whose mom is suffering from cancer and another student that has been ostracized after her best friend was paralyzed in a drunk driving accident.  Holy shit!  I didn't see anything like that coming from previews that I saw.  Thankfully the heavy story line is filled with bouncing breasts to ease the immensely depressing doses of sadness and struggle in this game.\n\nOverall: 2/5\nAt first I felt a bit shorted on the value of this game.  Three hours of game play for more than $5 seemed like a rip.  Then I remembered that this was a graphic novel and thought that I paid about the same price I would pay for a manga at a book store.  I got shafted on the music and was disappointed by the lack direction that different choices took me.  This could easily lead to great replay (reread) value and unlock more boobs.

The detail in the little things such as the glistening of water falling off a character getting out of the pool to various \"predicaments\" that the two female characters find themselves in are enjoyable to see. The music also helps accompany the relaxing tone that is set for most of the story in this VISUAL NOVEL (since many reviews seems to not be aware this game is one) while filling in fun filled tunes for the fanservice bits as well as dark undertones that are brought in. \n\nThe writing for the story was also enjoyable for an overall experience with atleast 2 playthroughs needed to get the whole story (you can complete the story with one playthrough but some details will be missing if you choose not to go through the other choices but want the \"whole picture\"). There aren't too many choices in this sakura rendition compared to others like Sakura Fantasy which was slightly disappointing to me seeing as how regardless of what you choose, the events to occur still lead up to the same style of ending. This differs from the expected since many of the other Sakura games chose to implement the \" have the same ending regardless but choose which girl you want to complete the story with\" becomes irrelevant with the differences in \"routes\" being a few extra lines of dialogue to better understand the background story that is barely implied about half way through.  I personally really enjoyed the story seeing as the struggles that the MC go through can be indirectly relatable to many people out there. \n\nFan service is enjoyable as always and the game takes full advantage of its \"swim club\" themed setting for some lovely suprises. You can expect about 3-4 pages of service shots after completing the game which is about the standard now for recent Sakura releases. You can expect to complete this story (atleast 1 standard runthrough in about more or less 1,5~2 hours based on your reading speed (assuming you are actually reading it and not on auto/skip for the fan service scenes). \n\nThe key drawbacks I would give this visual novel were how I was alittle disappointed with the length of the game seeing as they could have added just a bit more dialogue to fill in small gaps of information that the story lightly delves into. I've noticed with how quickly many of these games come out for the franchise, the stories only get shorter and shorter. The only other draw back was the variation in \"routes\" seeing as how they went to a different approach to \"choose best girl\" idea, but it works regardless.  \n\nIf this is your first visual novel or first Sakura visual novel on steam, don't go in expecting this to compare with other visual novels. The Sakura franchise is infamous for it's niche style of fanservice + with a story background slipped in. For the standard $9.99 price (promotion of $7.49 at the time of this review), one should not expect a riveting 30+ hour journey of a visual novel, but more so a quick and fun pick up story. \n\nOverall another great addition to the Sakura franchise by WingedCloud + Sekai Project.

I will avoid spoilers, but if there is any I would make a good use of this [spoiler]feature[/spoiler].\n\nSakura Swim Club is a short visual novel from Winged Cloud, those responsible to bring the Sakura series to us.\nI already finished the [i]game[/i] in about 3 hours (I'm a slow english reader, spanish is my main language), so it's a quite short story, then I patched the game to make it uncensored (the patch adds the sex scenes, h-material).\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nIt's a bit cliche if you are an into the [i]manganime[/i] world. A main male character who entered a new school and get to know two girls... they fall in love with him and we just can imagine what comes next. The only difference I saw here is the ending. [spoiler]Harem ending! The girls agreed with becoming lovers with him at the same time. Lucky b**tard.[/spoiler]\n\nThe story is kind of enjoyable, enough to make me go through all of it and keep my interest. It has good and silly moments, quite comic aswell. In the hands of [i]Navel[/i] or [i]Key[/i] (visual novel makers, known for titles as Shuffle! and Clannad) it could be a pretty deep story. Actually, I would like this visual novel to have an anime adaptation, like I said, in the right hands... Because I pretty much enjoy the drama, the romance and the deep/complicated moments.\n\n[h1]Now here they are, the pros and cons:[/h1]\n[quote]\n  [h1][u][b]Pros[/b][/u][/h1]\n  [table]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Character Design[/th]\n      [th]What can I say, I just love the character design from these guys (Winged Cloud). They are quite talented and have what an amateur artist lacks, the ability to draw a non-frontal body, better yet, a female body. They obviously make the girls more curvy, but it's quite suitable for the ecchi genre.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Art Style[/th]\n      [th]The colours, the use of well made backgrounds and of course, the art and konwlege behind the human anatomy (female curves, actually) is quite outstanding.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Story[/th]\n      [th]Quite enjoyable story, you can identify yourself with some situations and personal issues. It's good enough to keep your interest. It has drama, comedy, romance and if you patch it, h-scenes (explicit sexual content).[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Character development[/th]\n      [th]Not much to say about this, but with only 3 main characters, it's easy to tell the difference among their personalities. Leaving the [i]ecchi[/i] apart aside, it's pretty good to notice the cuteness of those two girls and the personal struggle of the main character.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th](For some of you) Nudity[/th]\n      [th]There is explicit content if you apply the patch. You just have to replace two files in the game folder. Perhaps, for some of you, this sexual content may be a con. I personally think the first sex scene for each girl is forced, out of place. They happened too early and I take them as a plain porn movie.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th](Updated) Voice Acting[/th]\n      [th]Voice acting? Yeah! Finally, Winged Cloud managed to add japanese dub to their main characters.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th](Updated) Trading Cards[/th]\n      [th]After some time since its release, this visual novel from the Sakura Franchise, finally got Steam Trading Cards.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n  [/table]\n  \n  [h1][u][b]Cons[/b][/u][/h1]\n  [table]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Short Story[/th]\n      [th]As I said before, it's a good story, but it's too short. They could made some extra effort to go deeper in the plot and make everything go slower, the events happens so fast that it's silly to think those girls fall in love with the main character that easy (not to mention the first sex scene, it was like a porn movie, \"-wanna have sex? -Yes, let's do it.\"). This story could be much more dramatic and deeper, the romance needs some time to work well along a tale.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Repetitive Music[/th]\n      [th]The soundtrack is fine, but you get tired of hearing the same music again and again. They need to put more variety.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n      [th]Interaction[/th]\n      [th]There are several decisions to make, but they do not alter the story line, just change the few next dialogs and that's it, then the story continues as default. So, there is only one ending. There is no need for Steam Achievements.[/th]\n    [/tr]\n  [/table]\n[/quote]\n\nSo, finally, I decided to recommend this visual novel only if you get it on sale, for a good price. If for any reason you get it for free, give it a chance, play it. As a manganime \"fan\", I like to try all this kind of games and give them a proper review based on my knowlegde, experience and opinion.\n\n[i][b]Thank you for reading.

They passed this off as a game?  This is my first sakura game and most certainly my last, the only reason I bought it was because of the good reviews and because it was in the same category as Huniepop (which was an incredibly fun puzzle game).\n\nThis wasn't a game.  I made maybe 4 interactive choices in the game, and the rest of the OVER AN HOUR OF \"GAMEPLAY\" was my clicking to get through the terribly written (terribly translated?) \"story\".  The character you play as is generic and boring, completely void of personality, and the girls (the only 2 sprites in the entire game) are copy paste from every anime ever.  Even as a porn it sucks.  5 or so ecchi pictures throughout thousands of dialog boxes, all of which happen \"accientally\" because you, the main character, Keade or some shit, would walk into the girls lockeroom, or into their bathroom while they're changing, then act surprised, and procede to try and skip 30 fedora-tipping dialog boxes about how pretty she is.\n\nWhat the fuck, this whole thing was trash.  Gameplay?  None.   Story?  Garbage.  Length?  Nonexistant.  Replayability?  I wish I didn't \"play\" it in the first place.  Characters?  Copypaste.  Art?  Pretty good, oddly enough.  But for $10? (~$7 on sale?)  I would expect more than two goddamn avatars, and a handful of backgrounds.\n\nNot a game, don't advertise it as one.

Upon transferring to his fourth school this year, he meets meiko and hiromi, two beautiful girls in the swim club. Things haven\u2019t gone well for the swim club lately, but with Kaede\u2019s help, that all changes.\n\nThe story is good, there is a good balance between drama and funny moments throughout. The music that plays along with the story if great to listen to and I hope to see a soundtrack realeased for  Sakura Swim Club. \nI enjoyed reading the story and highly reccomend anyone else that is thinking about buying this visual noval to give it a shot. If you enjoy this style of writing and visualisation I'd also reccomend that you check out their other visual novels, all of which can be found by searching for \"Sakura\", on the exception of \"Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc\".\n\nAlthough I wish that there was an options to set your own name instead of being defaulted to as Kaede, there was nothing wrong with the game other than what I believe to be a typo, which I have contacted them about and should be fixed soon, as with previous experiences. Other than that, I found the story to be enjoyable to read, especially before snoozing off.\n\nI'd definitively reccomend it to people that love to have a good laugh out of a sometimes cheesy story, in which the mood is mostly light and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1442094523, "timestamp_updated": 1442094955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475424885749816895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18005247": {"recommendationid": "18005247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061838524", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1442099456}, "language": "english", "review": "I consider myself a connoiseur of adult content, having a wealth of knowledge on styles such as amputee, midget, milking bondage etc. This is not to say I look down on softcore - it is my favourite style.

For the most part the MC is likeable and relatable, more so than in Angels and much more so than in Spirit. There are moments in the story that really hit home.\n\nOf course the art is as on point as ever, Wanaca is such a great artist. My main gripe with the game was the typos, there were a bit more than I would have liked to see, but they didn't ruin the story.\n\nAll in all, Swim Club is a great Visual Novel and a great installment in the Sakura series.

This is no exception. It has an good story and has left me wanting more.\n\nPros:\n- Original Artist Back.\n- Amazing Soundtrack.\n- Ecchi, But modest and doesn't take themes too far.\n- Story that if you actually read, will have you wanting more.\n\nCons:\n- Story was too short IMHO, could have extended to a FINAL choice was needed.\n \nNo Other Cons\n\nThat's about it.\nIf you like visual novels, a fan of the Sakura Series (Spirit & Angels) with the original artist making a return, You may end up liking this VN as well.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI had no idea there was a patch for this game, thanks to Videogame57 for saying.\nIt basically means that my previous review is null and void.

When I reviewed the game it was within 4 hours of its release so I had no idea of the patch. \n\nMy point still stands for the other Pros, the fact that is has a really good soundtrack is the same ect. \nI will not post a link to the patch, but it is available for download if you look for it.", "timestamp_created": 1442015518, "timestamp_updated": 1442149883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761826574802398682", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17990246": {"recommendationid": "17990246", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985001680", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1484980892}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and easy game, beat it with one hand. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1442015084, "timestamp_updated": 1442053200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1316, "votes_funny": 4709, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866356194019317627", "comment_count": 74, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17989885": {"recommendationid": "17989885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107678943", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1442013194}, "language": "english", "review": "Its pretty good, I'll give it 9/11", "timestamp_created": 1442013194, "timestamp_updated": 1442013194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 201, "votes_funny": 503, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406122088432312012", "comment_count": 25, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17988978": {"recommendationid": "17988978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209774953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 66, "last_played": 1442003901}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game, I really enjoyed the storyline and the h, it kept me reading and watching ;)\nOn another note, the creators are fantastic, and helpful with my questions and concerns thus far.\nKeep up with the good work ;D", "timestamp_created": 1442007936, "timestamp_updated": 1442007936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444428056478500366", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17988447": {"recommendationid": "17988447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120250539", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1470767041}, "language": "english", "review": "Game of the Year.
