This is practically a scam.\n\nThe game wants you to deliberately throw fights in order to trigger the H-routes, which leads directly to the typical ludonarrative dissonance inherent to pretty much all of the female-lead RPG eroge.\nThe H-scenes are all \"meh\" \u2013 pretty boring clich\u00e9d gratuitous NTR CGs with not enough writing behind them to drive them.\n\n[h1]When heavily discounted the game only costs pocket-change \u2013 however, the REAL cost is in the amount of time it expects you to waste on an entirely unoriginal bland vanilla experience.[/h1]\n\nThere's tons of RPGMaker H-games on Steam.

The game is decent so far, a little slow to start; but this is the first RPG/H-game that seems to focus more on the RPG side of things - which is refreshing. That said the localization is an absolute mess. Riddled with grammatical errors, inconsistencies, and I don't think I've seen a single sentence that wasn't broken english. That said, if you can look past the slower start and reading that gives a headache that's just as literal as it is figurative, it's still worth the cost imo.\n\nUpdate: So, I've beaten the game & unlocked everything; I will say that if you're looking for a decent RPG, (if you can ignore the already mentioned flaws) this isn't bad for the price. However, if you're looking for an HRPG, look elsewhere. The MC is pretty bog-standard for an H-game protag (big-tiddied blonde with blue or green eyes); and even if she's your type there are other - much better - HRPGs. (Princesses Never Lose, Slave's Sword 1&2, Treasure Hunter Claire, and Evenicle spring instantly to mind.) Couple the fairly boring protag with CGs that top out at below average and the \"H\" in HRPG becomes merely a distraction from the better straight RPG aspects. I can still recommend this, but only just.\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1630300677, "timestamp_updated": 1630825771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Unfortunately, nobody gives half a damn about any of that, because this game is so full of flaws that those three big positives just get tossed to the wayside. \nThe first big problem with the game is its translation. I almost quit playing ten minutes in due to how terrible the translation is. It would be bad enough for a game to mess up a few words in the characters' dialogue, but this game insists on inserting onomatopoeias everywhere. If I have to see the words \"poo poopoo pooooo\" describing anything one more fricking time for any action at all, someone is going to get hurt. \nThe second major problem is the power scaling. The bosses are just slightly stronger than the mobs in their area. Why is this a bad thing? Well, that brings me to how the game is structured. There are four story routes you can take in this game, and the determining factor between which you end up on is how many bosses you've lost to. If you want to check out one of the other routes, you need to lose to one of the bosses on purpose. This is very difficult to do when the bosses are so incredibly weak. I've spent literal hours waiting for bosses to kill me so i could check out some cutscenes. ... yes, they were worth it, but this shouldn't be a problem. If balancing is the problem, then the obvious solution is to cut down on the encounters... and theoretically, you can. monsters are all on the overworld, and you can run around them as you please. The problem with that is, the dungeons are gigantic and filled with wayyy too many mandatory fights. The game shoves levels into your hands when you really don't want them. \n\nLet's talk about the thing you're really here for- the p*rn. is it good? absolutely. It's fantastic. Sakuragames quality even. Just don't forget that you need to lose to the first real boss to unlock the lewd content. \n\nWith that out of the way, allow me to go into the story for a bit, since I really like it a lot. In this world, a war has just ended and the dark elves are pretty much history. You play as one of the last of them- freylia. This is ultimately a story about how she cleans up the remnants of that war, one way or another.\nRoute 1: the first route has three endings- one for losing to the final boss and two for beating it. It requires you to win every single boss fight you are in. This isn't very difficult and should probably be your first playthrough. This route skips pretty much all of the sidequests and lets you just concentrate on beating up random bad guys. At this point, it gets a bit confusing why you are fighting who you are, until the end, where it's told that you're fighting two of the remnants of the old war- a fallen saint and a new demon king. Basic premise, and not a lot told along the way. I kind of hate how you need to play the other routes for anything to make sense in this route.\nRoute 2: lose to one or two key bosses in the beginning of the game. In this case, you lose the faith of your guild leader, and they stop sending you on safe missions to slay evil monsters. Consider this the neutral route where everything starts to make sense. There's sidequests in town to check out, and Freylia gets very thirsty for her adopted brother. The story here is much deeper, but Freylia doesn't get a very happy ending after accidentally saving the world.\nRoute 3: Keep losing to bosses until you get thrown into prison, then win the rest. The final two routes give you the story from the villain's perspective. If you get thrown in prison for being so incredibly bad at your job, you join the villains. It's really a cool concept. The endings here are just a bit darker than those in route 2, but the prison sidequests aren't nearly as interesting... or so i hear. The prison sidequests tend to crash the game, which really sucks. This buggy mess of a game isn't getting fixed any time soon.\nRoute 4: Never stop losing and become a liability that even the villains don't want. The game gets very dark, very quickly. You learn very intimately where monsters come from and all about the villains' plans between what amount to torture sessions. It's very dark, and everyone is doomed. It really made me appreciate how much effort the writers put in to make the villains more unlikable. \nYou want my advice? only play routes 1 and 4. They give you everything you could want in an erpg, and you're not going to want to play much more than that. The translation will have your nerves ground down to a fine powder by the time you're done with the first route. \n\nSo, is this a good game? Hell no. Does it have good points? Sure, but it's not worth the aggravation, even when the lewds are better than most erpgs. The lack of a gallery hurts this game a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1623559886, "timestamp_updated": 1623559886, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744696855545043945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93654471": {"recommendationid": "93654471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156779959", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1623549766}, "language": "english", "review": "Please get this on sale.

If forced to pick a criticism, then I shall keep it brief, during my time playing through this masterpiece I noticed a certain, anti-christian aspect, sometimes it felt as if the characters were hinting towards actions forbidden to those unmarried, there is also a lot of deep penetration, gang rape and forced BDSM, this does not take away from the overall feel of the game however.

It also has several save slots, so you can experiment.\n\nThe game is not long, and the battle system is not well fleshed out, its a typical rpg, you only have your one character \nits a very easy game, only in maybe one occasion did I think I could actually lose and had to heal, and that was against the final boss.

As usual, the quality of their translation is on google translate level - unintelligible 90% of time. Don't support such shoddy release.\n\nThe game wasa made by a somewhat decent doujin circle ONEONE1. It is a short HRPG with just one playable character.\nThe main story is rather weak and barely there. Your main objective is to complete disjoint missions (storywise) assigned by a local guild. Mostly standard fetch/eliminate tasks with little background. As mentioned above, the translation is terrible so it's often hard to tell what is being said. Some text is even left untranslated. Standard shitty job from this publisher.\nThe main character lacks any serious development, but considering the length of the game it's understandable (could be better though). The rest of cast is just there. Story fillers.\n\nThe art is decent but lacks variation. Too many scenes reuse the same CGs. Locations are fairly standard, no complaint, but they're fairly small. The number of h-scenes is good, but as pointed above, lot of CG repetition.\n\nThere are 7 endings but the last one crashes the game (7th ending). Two or three other scenes also crash the game but no other issues to report so it's acceptable.\n\nThe music is very average but does not interfere with gameplay and for the most part fits the scene. A bad exception is one of the tracks played during h-scenes, it does not fit as all (weird electronic/techno).\n\nOverall, the game would be playable if not for the machine translation which strips it from enjoyment.

There\u2019s no overland map; instead you get missions that unlock new dungeon areas where you can fast travel to. Completing missions progresses the story, with the outcome of bossfights determining which route you take.\n\nOn normal difficulty, most of your time is spent fighting in dungeons. [b]Combat[/b] is basic, reasonably balanced and quite repetitive. You\u2019ll either need to grind random mobs for XP or get killed by them every so often (which teleports you back to town and gives you a level for free). Boss fights can be tricky if you\u2019re not prepared. Items and skills are somewhat useful, but mindlessly bashing the attack button and the odd heal gets the job done too.\n\nControls: Keyboard only. Use Ctrl to fast forward dialogue.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nYou pay as Fraylia, a dark elf mercenary. You live together with Ruse, an orphan boy that you rescued from monsters. While he takes care of the house and goes to school, you complete missions at the adventurer\u2019s guild to pay for his tuition fees. \n\nDuring your work, you discover that there is something amiss in the kingdom. Based on the choices you make in the game, you either help solve these or end up being part of the problem. The story has three routes, with 7 different endings in total.\n\n[b]QUALITY[/b]\nAs a game, Dark Elf barely meets the standard for the genre. It\u2019s essentially a visual novel dressed up as a RPG. But the mechanics are at least somewhat useful, and the devs did put a bit of effort into mission and level design. I guess the story isn\u2019t too bad either. Unfortunately, the translation is horrible, as usual with this publisher.\n\n\n[h1]THE GOODS[/h1]\n\n[b]SUBJECT[/b]\nThe lewd in Dark Elf is mostly about Fraylia having sex against her will with various monsters and other less-than-savory characters. Two of the three story routes are NTR themed, forcing Fraylia to do all kinds of nasty stuff out of love for her prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Her fall from grace isn\u2019t subtle though: scenes get pretty hardcore right off the bat and stay so until the end. As Fraylia is a Dark Elf, a race known for their sexual appetite, she eventually starts to enjoy it though.\n\nKeywords: [spoiler]big breasts, bondage, devices, group, fluids, forced, humiliation, lactation, monster, pregnancy, public, straight, tentacles, urination[/spoiler]\n\n[b]CONTENT[/b]\n38 full-screen scenes made out of static CG\u2019s. In addition, there are bunch of combat animations featuring Fraylia and various monsters.\n\n[b]ACCESS[/b]\nThis is one of those games where lewd means losing: if you succeed at every mission, you\u2019ll hardly see any sexual content. Access to the lewd scenes is unlocked by losing your first boss fight. After that, you\u2019ll encounter several scenes as part of the story, usually as part of the obligatory missions. Some other scenes require you to interact with NPC\u2019s that you encounter in town.\n\nYou won\u2019t see all the scenes during a single playtrough. However, after completing the game, you\u2019ll get a NG+ option that has all the scenes unlocked. You can access these scenes via the Extra menu. The game is censored by the default. In order to uncensor it, you\u2019ll either need to buy the official patch at DLsite or find it somewhere else online.\n\n[b]QUALITY[/b]\nThe quality of the lewd is pretty good. The artwork is of high quality, even though the resolution isn\u2019t up to todays standard anymore.

The translation is not good, but one can easily get the idea being pushed-- it is baffling that these poorly translated games are not looked over by anyone who speaks English as a first language. It would take less than an hour to overhaul the text into something more digestible. The character art was not as good as other games of this type, but that is subjective, same for the lewd parts which were mostly of the negative experience type and thus unappealing for myself.

chose to recommend this game for several reasons:\n\nPros:\nFemale designs: i like Fray's design hence why i bought the game lol.\nH-scenes: Very good for my taste and for a first H-game purchase, it really set the standard on what purchases i will make in the future.\nFemale voice acting: I only know the basics of Japanese but its enough to enjoy the actors voice.\nBattle animations: Very good. I like the way she shakes.\nTown/dungeon:  The design work is good. They fit the world to immerse you, regardless that this game was meant for other things lol\n\nNow the Cons:\nTHE FUCKING BUNNY, SEARCH THE DISCUSSION BOARD, FIND THE DOWNLOAD TO REMOVE THAT LITTLE WHITE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n*phew*\n\nTranslation: The translation can be horrendous at times. it started off the first 6 minutes okay, then it just made me go wtf? I literally gave up half way through the game with understanding the story line and just wanted to see the other H-scenes.  All i know is she finds and takes care of a human, she takes care of him doing quest, the monsters are becoming violent, and thats where everything broke off and i just started skipping. \n\nBattles: To get the H-cut scenes, you will need to lose, and no matter what difficulty you are in, its very....hard to lose. I thought running through some of the lava spots would make me lose health faster so as soon as i got to the boss, i would die in one hit...nope. The balance is not there,  and the AOE spells were all i cared about, along with ATK up. I found myself spamming ailment items/spells to wait for the enemy to finish me off.\n\nOverall, i feel for what i spent, it did me justice. Things got soooooo much better after removing that fucking bunny. I have bought another game from this studio (OneOne) and they have made major improvements from the translation department, one vs one battles (no longer multiple enemies) , and you have the options in the settings to allow auto loses or proceed with battle. I do plan on buying more games from this company. Give Meritocracy of the Oni and Blade a try, i have enjoyed that game more than this one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1575729705, "timestamp_updated": 1575729705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465686261653900146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "58772959": {"recommendationid": "58772959", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987795996", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 891, "last_played": 1575134225}, "language": "english", "review": "So a quick \"review\".[i](more of a gamelist entry)[/i] PROs and CONs first.

The English translation is very very bad for this game. It doesn't ruin the game but areas and people are called 2 different things at times. Your character's name is spelled differently by different NPCs. It is very awkward at moments. My review btw is entirely with the Uncensored patch added.\n THAT being said this is a fairly entertaining game. The main character is of course eye candy especially during combat. It feels as though when you go down the bad path for the first time....boy does things get bad for your character. I almost want to say it's a bit too much, but who am I kidding?\n The combat is fairly straightforward and entertaining especially when the H attack goes off. However I do wish the more powerful attacks we gain had a bit more variety to them as far as animations. It is the same slash attack but with a different effect.\nThe monster and enemy variety is not too bad,however sometimes the sprite you see on screen is not at all what appears at your battle screen. This could be due to limitations of the RPG maker they were using.\nThe story is not entirely great....it feels like it has some purpose in the beginning but our character sorta gets \"lost\" and the reason why she is doing everything more or less becomes an after thought. I feel the combat was one of the high points of this game and the H scenes were fairly decent. I found the in combat H scenes to be far more entertaining to see especially facing a new enemy. Overall i would say this is a decent game for the money. If this was 10 dollars or more i would say it's would be a waste.

This is one of the games  you most likely will look over given it is a [i] indie Title [/i]. I assure you when its on sale, It's a  worth while game to get if you can. The three main reasons you ask? Tiddies, anime booty, andan retro-esque anime RPG with bouncy tiddies and FF styled fighting. You may be peaked with curiosity why I enjoy this game despite the three reasons listed, so lets get into it.\n\n  Firstly, the tiddies. They are bouncy, they are on an elf with figure, and above all, they look soff. Who can deny some good tiddie physics enabled with Nvidia PhysX to make the bounce even more prominent and visual? Secondly, the anime booty. It's profound how much it flares out here  and it's always given screen time, just so you can see the string thong and a whole buncha meat. Lastly, the retro styled RPG with bouncy bohungas. Now you probably marked me as some weird shut in who looks for games that tickle his anime fetish, and you're precisely right actually, if you didn't pick that up on the first sentences in Para.1, something's wrong with you, but i digress. The playing style reminds me much of FFII/III and or the classic Phantasy Star I & II, but with literal porn.\n\n  See there are many reasons to love this game, yet I found love for it another way. Though it's morally  shunned by half the world, I take enjoyment knowing these indie devs are doing gods work at the end  the day. They push and seek bounds, to not only make profit, but to fill steam with wholesome hentai RPG title that are most likely made off RPG Maker. This is why i thoroughly support this, though on a sale!

The translation is the worst I've ever seen in a game, ever; I don't mind the sex scenes in games or books if the story is good and the sex scenes aren't forced into the story, but I guess it's my fault for expecting a decent story which is basically a porn game if the translation is so bad that I don't have any idea what is going on. \n\nAnd let me say one more thing about the sex scenes in this game. I bought this because I'm a sucker for beautiful elven women; hell if elven women were real, \nI'd probably be married to one right now. And I found the main character gorgeous.\n\nBut, I've never been fan of women looking absolutely miserable during sex, which is the standard in these games. Personally I'm not the fan of the scenes. And since translation is what it is, the writing will not be very erotic either. The scenes are tasteless and are basically rape scenes (if you do the \"sinful\" route).\n\nWhich leads to another problem, for an adult game; there's an awful amount of censorship.  Unless you buy the DLC to uncensor the game, you'll be staring at a creepy looking rabbit during all of the scenes. \nAs for the gameplay, it's nothing to write home about.  It has the gameplay of a barebones RPG. \n\nAl in all, if all you want is to fap to the character as she unpleasantly has sex (and if you're into that sick fetish), then this game will give you a good time.  But if you're looking for a decent story or gameplay,  look elsewhere (If you're looking for decent gameplay and a free  18+ patch, search for Unholy Disaster).", "timestamp_created": 1538538820, "timestamp_updated": 1538538820, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498642057180404663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45030175": {"recommendationid": "45030175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153950804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 311, "last_played": 1535642553}, "language": "english", "review": "I may not have gotten the role as Cable in the latest deadpool movie, but at least i get to see big'ol anime titties.", "timestamp_created": 1538343594, "timestamp_updated": 1538343594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45026676": {"recommendationid": "45026676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065802651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1644308783}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a hentai game. That already is a big pro for me. However there's a lot of cons in this game that might agitate some people. For one, the translation is very poor in some area's. I'm fairly convinced they might've just use'd Google Translate to convert most of the game's dialogue. I guess maybe contacting someone who actually know's good english wasn't in the cards? Even known I'm sure they could've found someone who would do it for free? \n\nThere's also the fact that, while you CAN get this game to play in fullscreen, this game was clearly NOT OPTIMISED to be played in fullscreen so naturally everything looks so pixelated and low-quality. While the game initially starts in a very small window, you can make it play in fullscreen next time you run the game by looking in the task bar and clicking the option. You might be thinking \"Well, most of the game is a 32-bit Final Fantasy Classic style game so does it being pixelated matter?\" Yes, actually, it does. It's not ALL 32-bit. This game is a hentai game don't forget, meaning that it features hentai art. It may not matter for the most part but it definitely will matter when it affect's a core element in the game! The core element of the game being the fap material you make of it.\n\nNow THIS can be a big problem for some people. There's the issue that while you CAN configure the controls by pressing F1 (or F2, I can't remember) you might find that the way to change the controls aren't very clear at all. There's no \"Up, Down, Left, Right\" options that might clarify that that's what controls your movement, it's just an assortment of letters. well the config window doesn't even show which key's are the arrow key's. Why is that important you may be wondering? Cause the game initially starts you with arrow key controls. WASD does nothing here. I guess maybe the whole concept of left-arm controls never caught on in Japan or something. There is the option to play with a gamepad but you likely came here to fap so... hope you know some kind of special ancient Chinese technique's for holding and using a whole controller with one hand.\n\nAll-in-all though, like I keep saying, this is a hentai game. Most of these issues likely won't even stop you which is why I of course recommend this game because naturally it didn't stop me either.", "timestamp_created": 1538329779, "timestamp_updated": 1544426053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61433565616607666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45016016": {"recommendationid": "45016016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065394397", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1538293389}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed in 3.4 hours.

o b s and a s s. xd[/i][/b]\n\nIf you're looking for some porn and don't often have a lot of access to the internet, this may be a good alternative. \n[i]No, seriously,[/i] just find the uncensor patch and you're ready to go. \n\n\nsidenote: game on itself is censored, only way to have it uncensored is to download said patch\n[spoiler]sidenote #2: what am i doing with my life[/spoiler]\n\n[strike]I may edit the review and add some spoilers/story stuff in case I actually get to finish the game >:3... and also properly review it rather than joke about it lmao[/strike]\n\n\n[edit]\nSo I've finished the game. Before I even start, be aware that English translation for the game is god-awful. If you're native British or American, you might have a hard time understanding a few... words. In the game, not in the review (or maybe both).\nIf you're planning to play it for yourself/wish not to see any spoilers, you can stop reading here.\n\nThe game begins with Fraylia, the main protagonist and the \"Dark Elf\" the game is about, fighting her way through a cave, also giving a slight backstory on what's happening in the world. Nothing much to say here. A few minutes later, we get to see Ruse for the first time.\nRuse is presented as a boy who got lost, probably he doesn't even have a family. Fraylia decides to protect him at all costs, and so she takes him with her.\nThis is pretty much where the game opens up: you can explore the main town, visit several houses, talk with NPCs, visit a shop or go straight to the \"president\" who gives you quests and missions for you to finish (in order to gain lots of gold and progress the story). \nEach time you will receive 2 or 3 quests you have to travel to before you can do a \"special quest\" (mostly a boss fight). Most of those quests, however, are basically \"go there, find it, kill it/take it, come back\", if you know what I'm saying. \nFighting enemies is relatively easy, both on \"Easy\" and \"Regular\" difficulty. You pretty much just keep punching, and when your health is low, just heal up, and repeat. Boss fights are the same enemies, except with more health (first bosses having about 1000-2000 HP, end-game ones having about 10000 or more). Same tactic as for normal enemies. Even easier when starting the game over when defeating the final boss (kinda like New Game+).\n[b]If you find this disturbing, don't even bother buying the game[/b]; the only 'original' thing about this game is that endings are impacted by... amount of sex your character had. Yes, the only difference between getting the worst and best ending is how many times Fraylia was ra*ed and what path she took. More details about endings, paths and mechanics can be found in [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkElfHistoria]an article here.[/url]\n\n[b]tl;dr[/b]: it's a rather fun experience and I guess a good way to spend your time (alone, unless you like doing \"this stuff\" in groups ecks dee). \nMeh story and translation, good replay value, great art and voice acting (Fraylia's voice only though), excellent concept.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1530810801, "timestamp_updated": 1533823437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 52, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775895595550537109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43316705": {"recommendationid": "43316705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077456482", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 604, "last_played": 1533214102}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite pleasant, the controls are very easy like every 2d rpg.

I did not buy it in the Humble Monthly, but I convinced a bunch of friends to buy it then and join me. 3 of them havent beaten the first boss, one is about midway through, and the other has beaten the final boss. It was interesting to see my friends rage, and that alone made purchasing Dark Elf worth it. However, you are getting so much more than that.\n\nThe Gameplay is fast paced and rewarding (most of the time). I never died more than 2-3 times in a place, maybe its because I R1 spammed my way through my first play through. Builds in Dark Elf can be simple or complex, some strategies will work and some wont. In my first ng+ run when I went for the Usurper Ending, I respecced into making a Miracle Class, then a Sorcerer Class, then a Pyromancer. Each playstyle is different and unique enough to where you can have hours goofing off and blowing up\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665with magic. There is a definite learning curve here, but once you get a grip on it 95% of the deaths you recieve are fair game.\n\nThe Online Aspect leaves something to be desired. Invasions can happen at the worse times, but invading always seems to end up in a world against the Host of Embers and 2 Sunbros which can be a nuisance. Another gripe with invading is that sometimes it takes forever, and joining a game after 10 minutes of waiting can easily get you booted back to your world if the host bum rushes the boss fight in the area. There are also serious latency problems with people using a bowl of potatoes as a wifi hotspot and they start warping around and hitting you from miles away. Another gripe is that Blades of the Darkmoon and Blue Sentinels can only get their covenant items by being summoned randomly into a Way of the Blue's world when he gets invaded. It never seems to happen, making two VERY nice items almost not unlockable. Summoning friends sometimes doesn't work out, even if you are the host of embers and someone from Idaho in the middle of a war camp joins you, the HOST will get hit reg problems on the AI enemies. Cheating doesn't seem to be too big a problem, but 2 or three times I have run into people who just swing you around with the power of Cheat Engine.\n\nThe Covenants are garbage. Its basically a grindfest for the little covenant items to get moderately good gear, some of which is required for the achievements. It is 10 of the covenant reward item for the basic rewards, then another 20 for the final reward making it a total of 30 invasions/defend sessions per covenant. Thats where a good 40 of my hours went, sitting around the Pontiff Sulyvahn bonfire waiting for a Way of the Blue to get invaded or to invade someone without 3 sunbros and 2 Darkmoons ganking me.\n\nThe Bosses are memorable and a fantastic challenge. They act as checkpoints to make sure you have what it takes to procceed. Some of them would randomly grab you when you were nowhere near and just slam your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665into hell, and sometimes they hit you but it doesn't register. The only boss I consider to need a nerf is Darkeater Midir from the Ringed City DLC. Even with fully maxed out weapons and soul amounts I grinded for hours for, this dude tanked hits like an asteroid. I've tried Base Run, NG+, and NG++, only finishing him off by cheesing him with sorceries in my third playthrough for a spell. I think thats the only time I truly got\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in Dark Elf, so a fair warning.\n\nThe Level Design is very atmospheric and well crafted. I know the levels like the back of my hand, and where items are located for NG+ runs. You do occasionally run into weird level loading problems where you see textures blockier than Minecraft, but maybe thats just my computer. The enemies in each level are themed nicely, and there is plenty to explore and find.\n\nThe Soundtrack and Boss Themes are Hype Inducing. Pummeling bosses to memorable soundtracks like the Dancer's and Souls's really makes beating each boss memorable. Everything about the sound design is top notch, except whenever the playable character makes a noise whether its an emote, one of those weird stones, or taking damage. These noises are slightly jarring, and really take me out of the immersion, its probably a me thing though.\n\nThe DLC purchased together is a fantastic deal and a good amount of content, however if you purchased Ashes of Ariandel alone you really arent getting much for the 15 USD. Ringed City however, is easily worth the 15 Dollars. Both DLC feature new bosses, new levels, new items, and overall just more fun to be had.\n\nThe Lore is confusing. You either need to really get into it and watch videos explaining every detail, or just briefly skim through cool looking item's descriptions. What I did understand was good, and if I ever decide to play other Souls-Borne Games, I will invest a lot more into learning the story. If this is your thing, theres a lot here to dig your talons into.\n\nPerformance Is Not The Best At Times, but if you can run the game maxed out at a stable framerate you really have an eye candy. I cannot do this however, and at medium settings I drop frames heavily in the begining of Archdragons Peak and the Dreg Heap. There is a bit of crashing whenever you whip the camera around to hard, especially during boss battles / summons / fricken Archdragons Peak.\n\nThe Community is a Mixed Bag. You get the R1 Spammes with dark gear, and then you get the helpful people on reddit comparing weapon stats and bowing. Its interesting.\n\nThe Price I would say is fair, but getting the game on sale with the season pass at 30 dollars USD is a steal. Better yet, if you didn't buy DS3 for 12 Dollars with Ashes along with a slew of other games something is wrong with you. I personally paid the 40 dollars for DS3 w/ DLC, and it is most certainly worth it. \n\nIn Conclusion, Dark Elf is a game I put too much time into just to get all the achievements so I can feel justified writing a review.

And you'd be half right. There are two different stories here, a straight fantasy RPG, and a hentai path. The hentai path is vile, full of rape, slavery, and otherwise every demeaning sort of trope and torture the trashy hentai games love. If that's your thing, whatever, but I'm strictly talking about the other path. \n\nWhat makes the narrative work is the main character. Particularly her relation to the current state of this world. It's a few years after some massive war between humans and demons. The humans took the opportunity to hire on \"freaks\" as their weapons, like orcs, dwarves, and our main character, a dark elf. She does what she does because after the war, the people tossed her aside; once the war was over and the maligned people stopped being useful, they went back to being freaks, not worth anyone's respect or inclusion in society. She's bitter about this, but comes across a human child left orphaned in the war. This makes her goal in life protecting and raising him, because in a way the war took everything from both of them.\n\nThis is WAY deeper a story and character development than I would have expected from an RPG where one of the enemies is a leather gimp with his erect junk just hanging out. The story that plays out is nothing spectacular; monsters are getting more aggressive, plots of demons covertly taking up positions of power in the kingdoms that need thwarting, etc. And because it IS a hentai game, the various NPCs and some of the enemies tend to be rather lewd, even if you go this route. But even so, she stays firmly a strong character driven to protect this young man she loves, with saving the world being sort of secondary as far as she's concerned. Makes you more willing to ignore the eye rolling other stuff.\n\nThe RPG gameplay itself is...ok. The game is a bit on the easy side, as these things go. Leveling up and grinding are real easy, and few places had me stuck outside of the nice and challenging final boss.

Only one happy sex rest mind break after mind break. So unless thats your thing this game is for you. Anyway,  thats all.\n\n\n\nDecent little H-RPG, with the two patches one from SteamUncensored that you just have to change one file and the other patch on the discussion board. Either one you get all of the original content. Due to Japan rules of what is pixilated and not pixiliated there is still some censorship. But besides that, it is the original content in regards to how you go about doing it. \n      Dark Elf Historia is a decent throw back rpg, you do feel sorry for her about how you go the direction of the sinner path. In case those that were wondering if there is a walkthrough because the game has 7 different endings. The translation was done by either someone who doesn't speak english as a first language or it was done by machine.  I think I read somewhere it was done by machine so hence the horrible horrible mess ups. Like besides humans and one dark elf, anything else considered non-human is called a orc....werewolf translate to orc. but at least its not as bad as mirror's horrible translation in calling a women getting wet by saying its semen......wtf?!? So far i have enjoyed it, the midbattle h-scenes instead of regular attack, it doesn't matter if you pick normal or easy most battles are easy, BGM is good and somewhat of a decent little story. I have not finished it yet and taking my time to go thru it and enjoy it.  And the walkthough is avaible on the discussions boards either look there or do a google search and you will find it.

However there are a few things I would like to point out to the developers to consider working on in either future games, or in any updates to this game if they ever decide on adding more content.\n\nMy first subject I would like to talk about is the translation issues in the character dialog from the native language that I am assuming is Japanese (please correct me if I'm wrong on that) to English. While I could make out what our protagonist the Dark Elf is saying or narrating in the game, there were moments that I had to read the dialog message more than twice to figure out what was going on, and even then I had a hard time understanding what was going on. I would highly recommend that you get someone that speaks and writes fluent in Japanese and English to do the translating for the dialog to help improve this issue.\n\nThe second subject I wish to talk about is the game play mechanics of the game. While I was honestly impressed by how well you did the combat mechanics to be reasonably smooth in the attacks from the main character and the enemy, I find that throughout the majority of the game I could easily defeat most of the monsters within two normal attacks, and most bosses within a coupleof minutes. Another issue I have about the combat system is that while I could see a lot of effort was put into the main character's body movements, the graphics of the status indicators of the HP, MP, AP, and TP, I couldn't help but see that the majority of the enemy's designs were well under par when compared to the main character. While most people will most likely focus on the main character and her body, it would be nice if the enemies were designed and animated to a similar degree as the Dark Elf is.\n\nThis next subject is more than likely the one most of the gamers who buy this game will be looking out for, and that is the sexual content as this is considered a Hentai game by most standards. Now as far as sexual content goes in games, I would actually rate this one a little low when compared to most other games I've played, mainly due to the fact that in most cases the only way to trigger a sexual scene was to be defeated by a boss, and even then it wasn't exactly the easiest to figure out which boss was the one to trigger it. In my case I played through the entire game as I would normally with any other RPG type game and only saw one clear choice to either trigger a sexual scene or not, and that was in the end with the Protagonist and the guy who lives with her, and after I had completed the game I had unlocked the Extras option which showed me the sexual scenes and hinted towards how to trigger them. Now while the Extras content helps a lot on figuring out how to unlock the scenes the player wishes to unlock and skip over the others that the players don't want to watch, I believe that is would be more entertaining for this game if it wasn't just the bosses that triggers the majority of the sexual content, but have the rest of the enemies included as triggers as well, I saw many enemies throughout the game as I played that could easily have activated such actions during battles and could have added more content to not just the sexual parts, but also to the combat mechanics as well, such as if a slime monster trapped the Dark Elf in the middle of the battle and caused a in battle scene to happen, which then the Protagnoist has to either endure the sexual attack or use an item or skill to force the slime off of her.\n\nWith this being the last part of my review, I'll just write a quick summary and I would like to say that as a game on it's own, I found this to be rather fun, but hard to understand due to the large translation errors and grammer issues resulting from it. I really liked how well the main character was designed and how she moved, but the rest of the characters could really use a overhaul in design and animation to match. As for a Hentai game, I would recommend at least making the scene triggers a little easier to discover for the player, and add triggers for the normal monsters around the game's map so that there's more content for it. As for if I would recommend this game, if you're looking for a reasonably cheap time waster with a sexually attractive Dark Elf protagonist that can be played from start to finish within a day or two, I would recommend this game, at least for some entertainment value, however I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a hentai game that you could play multiple times over when you could find ones more entertaining for free online.", "timestamp_created": 1510198196, "timestamp_updated": 1510198196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619586586952209473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36377763": {"recommendationid": "36377763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161202842", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1514964208}, "language": "english", "review": "Really sucks ugh", "timestamp_created": 1510155997, "timestamp_updated": 1510155997, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486592292785644531", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36305519": {"recommendationid": "36305519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407470145", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 118, "last_played": 1502219045}, "language": "english", "review": "It translated horribly.

The H content, which as always unlocks after the character loses her virginity following losing a boss fight, is involving, due to the collection of tags for diffrent experiences, as well as tags for increasing times of an experience.  As well, the character's description changes based upon these tags.  An issue with this is that unlike other similar games, there is no item available to prevent or reduce H attacks that combat opponents use, so the character's slide into depravity is inevitable if virginity is lost early.  Still, it can engage the completionist instinct to collect all these tags, which takes quite awhile.  Interestingly, playing without getting into the H content makes the game ridiculously fast.  \n\nOn a side note: you might suspect that the game could involve shota based on the characters, but the game assures us, more than once, that the boy is really the same age as the character... just stunted growth for some reason?

Imagine this game has a well-scaled character building tree or more reasonable ability acquirement, with a serious graphic quality, how impressive it could be, I gave a \"recomend\" just bcs it doesnt have obvious bugs or any other quality issues.

To be completaly honest I though you play as a male and you met the dark elf, but no. you play as her and the way of getting the \"good\" stuff is to be slutty and loose againts your oponents.\n\nGameplay: 7.5 (Combat) Nearly Acceptable\nIts simple, in fact the game is kinda made for you to loose only if you really want. Thinking it carefully, it has no tutorial. So as said the way to get the \"good\" stuff is to loose, I read that has 7 different endings, depending of your choices. Pro: the enemies arent like other games that take a lot of damage making a single battle long and boring. Cons: If you are like me a like to kill every mob around and area it becomes repetitive.\n\nGameplay 9.5 (Good stuff) Excellent\nI have pretty much played the 7 paths and well its a jewel, though for my liking *SPOILER* there are too many (like 5 of 7) endings that are bad *SPOILER END*\n\nStory: 8.5 Good\nIts quite simple, but lets be honest, If you bought it, its not for the story its for the \"good\" stuf ;). To this days everything comes to a cliche... not spoiling this one. And a good thing you can play from 2 perspectives goodies and badies.\n\nGraphics: 10 Amazing\nThe rpgmaker style graphics are nice, but some are re-used to other monsters, for example the orcs. Why 10 then? well if you use the patch for 18+, you can even have some \"good stuff\" when battling if you go throw the right path.\n\nVoice characters\nIts a shame that just the dark elf got voiced.... \nor Its great that the dark elf got voiced (matter of how you see the things)\n\nAs very personal opinion, dont like to be the heroine, by nature I believe i kinda got in the role of Ruse, and as him I wouldnt like to see (a posible partner/family member) to be rapped or to be a slutt around. Though is the first game of oneone1 that I played and there are really many things i liked around or that havent seen in other eroges, I didnt like to be the heroine.

If you buy this from steam, you will find out that h-scenes (if you don't know what h means then stay away from this game) aren't included. You need to buy the DLC from another site (dlsite) to play the full game.\n\nNow to the review!\n\nThe game itself is quite complex for your standard eroge. If you play it right, by right I mean as a righteous Dark Elf who only wants to save the kingdom, then you might not even see one single h-scene despite having downloaded the upgrade. If you play the game, even more right, which means going around looking for guys to knock you up and screw you over by failing missions purposely, then this game turns into 'that' game which demands you to play it with headphones on and with one hand free, preferably your dominant hand.\n\nStory is very basic with the lingering theme of coexistence between basically 2 races (monsters and humans where 'monsters' are elves, orcs, tentacle plants etc). There's an evil king and it's up to you to either screw with him or... get screwed by him, if you know what I mean. The plot advances through a quest system which will feel very familiar to veteran players of RPG games.\n\nGameplay is also very basic, go to quest giver, do quest, return to quest giver. Fighting interface is your standard turn based RPG system, the game of gentlemen! At the start you and your enemies get 1 turn each, but if you have enough agility, you can perform 3 turns. If you're the honorable dark elf who wants to rid the world of these evil orcs, you'd thank the devs for the agility mechanic slashing their weewees off before they can even stand up. But if you're the dank elf who wants to be covered with white sticky glue all day, you'd hate it because the gooey gooey bits usually happen after you get beat... which gets harder when your opponents take forever to attack and then miss when they do. I've played as both! If you want to experience both worlds I advice to play as the honorable dark elf first, just for the story. Then, on your second playthrough, the game gives you a suicide button anyway as it knows you'd want to spread your legs wider than a dead frog on a roadkill just to get those CGs!\n\nGraphics. Well... what can I say? After playing games that have really redefined graphics, going back to these outdated 2d graphics is a litte awkward. BUT, it at least works! The characters who matter, by matter i meant those who you'd want to see get nailed and pounded to the ground, look very beautiful. The CGs where properly drawn, cut scenes were properly animated and the overworld graphics isn't too bad either. It's not amazing, but for what it wants to give us, it's just okay. \n\nNow for the elephant in the room, no I don't mean the metaphorical use of 'elephant' for a man's sexual appendage, i mean the other one. The English translations. Fortunately I know Japanese so after seeing the abomination that is the translation of this game, I immediately switched back. There's just no denying it, the translation is shayt! Those motherfawkers out there who say 'Persona 5 translation is shayt doiiiiii' you... don't know... what shayt means. This game's translation is shayt! Names of the same person are mentioned over and over with different spelling each time that you'd think it's about a different person! I- I just don't know how to explain it. It's just... it's shayt! How do you explain shayt? It's something that comes out of an animal's sphincter ... it's brown... and it smells. It's just so... bad, it's worse than my attempt here to misspell swear words just so that steam won't heartify it! \n\nSo overall, do I still like the game? Yes. Despite the translations I still like and recommend the game. It's just worth it for how much they're asking for. Seeing how many ways the developers made it that you can get yourself fawked, literally, is just err... with a lack of a better word, fulfilling. And before one of you feminists go 'you're a sexist for liking this game doiiiiii' I'm a girl and I liked it and had a lot of laughs playing it. I also draw H-doujins, these kinds of contents aren't exclusively for men only! In conclusion, I recommend this game just for people to experience what an eroge is. If this becomes successful, who knows, the better ones from Japan might make it in steam too.\n\nEdit: I forgot to note that this game only makes use of the keyboard, so your left hand.

Where should I start?\n\nWell for one, I got this when it was on sale for about 2 dollars and something cents. Now I see that it's now back to it's original price of 4 dollars. So this review is going to be based off what I paid for.\n\nIt's an RPG maker game with RPG maker sprites, graphics. A little improvement and original graphics (I think). Whenever I try to sprint, there seems to be a little lag. I haven't experience lag while sprinting in other RPG maker games. It can be annoying. \n\nSecondly, you can easily tell that the creator or translator of this game isn't fluent in English so the dialogue kills the vibe from the H-Scenes. However, you can easily get the gist of a sentence.\n\nUnlike many RPG maker games, there seems to be effort put into combat. It's not just pictures of enemies and the basic attack scenes like a line slicing across the enemy picture. The main character actually moves her body when attacking, defending, and dodging. However, a lot of the enemies are the same sprites you see in basic RPG Maker games. \n\nBut of course, there are pros to the game. First off, despite the not-so-great English, the story is pretty good despite many other games having similar stories about wars and orphans. Also, there is a voice over that fits perfectly for this character. Despite the stupid rayman looking creatures and flowers covering her body, the H-Scenes are awesome.

Congratulations, you just played a bland JRPG with horrible translation.\nGranted, the game does one interesting thing. From the store description, you might think that at some point the story diverges, and titular Dark Elf might fall to depravity. Well, if you are playing the game without losing, you will never see this happen. But losing against specific mission-end bosses will make you get sex-scenes, and cause the story to diverge. But if you don't know who you need to lose against, it's just a crapshoot of suiciding on battles.\n\nSince the porn is pretty much the main deal of the game, might as well go over that too.\nYou get very standard stuff here. Heroine is raped or coerced into sex, and she eventually ends up \"liking\" it as scenes progress. The art isn't anything to write home about, and I've never been fan of girl looking absolutely miserable during sex, which is the standard in these games.\nPersonally I'm not the fan of the scenes, or the art. And since translation is what it is, the writing will not be very erotic either. Though it can be pretty funny at points, so I guess that is a plus.\n\nAgain, you get what you pay for. Which is sub-par release. I guess if you are poor, and absolutely need your fix of fantasy-themed rape porn, might as well go for this?

Clearly there is some censored sexiness, but that's kinda vague, so I'm aiming to clear that up. \n\nThis game is hentai (porn). Not tasteful titilation to spice up a game (a la The Witcher). Not even excessive tasteless titlation to justify an crappy game (a la Bloody Boobs). This is hardcore, close-up of a chick's crotch style hentai. If you've explored the japanese visual novels, you'll find these scenes pretty on-par with those.\n\nExcept it's got censorship. Nasty, vulgar censorship. They don't quietly skip the H-scenes, they don't tactfully adjust the field-of-view to make it less explicit. They paste a demented bunny pic over the offending parts, and continue normally. When the original has a long, fullscreen closeup of the woman's crotch, you get a long, fullscreen closeup of the freaky bunny. The steam version censors boobs as well as genitalia, so the H scenes are something you could post on Youtube without raising eyebrows. \n\nThere's a patch of course, but it's not a free and easy patch (like Hunie Pop). In fact, as of right now, the game is selling for $2.40 (on sale from $4) and the patch costs $5.85 (on sale from $12). On the forums, there are people looking for a free patch, and they're getting shamed, along the lines of \"the developers worked hard on this, if you're going to steal rather than support them, why stop at pirating just the patch and not the whole game?\" Yea, I'm sure it was twice as hard for the developers to back out the censorship as it was to make the game. Idk. Certain community members seem to think the explicit content is a DLC. \n\nWell, there is a community patch (http://steamcommunity.com/app/665180/discussions/0/1471967615843591758), and while I had some difficulty downloading it at first, it does appear to work to the point of restoring the typical japanese mosaics instead of the freaky bunny (I've only gone through the first scene, but I assume it works for all). But if the developers are treating the H-scenes as DLC, I suppose it's possible they'll push out an update that breaks the patch or try to have it removed. \n\nThe game itself is a bland jrpg, with a really bad translation, but about what you'd expect for $2.40. The H scenes seem pretty tasteless, although perhaps they're just not my style. At this cost, I couldn't justify a bad review for just those elements.

I've been quite nice in my review as I've seen this as the botched translation attempt of a nice H-RPG. But I had to reconsider my position and stop recommending this game after constating the following :\n\n1.The uncensor patch sold on DLsite English doesn't uncensor battlers (sprite of characters during battle). From what I gathered this is NOT intentional, but it is a big mistake for a paid patch.\n2.The game has bugs that'll crash the game wich aren't in the original version, most likely a result of the aforementioned bad translation. This is BAD and I can't recommend the game in this state.\n\nPlay the japanese version on DLsite if you can read japanese or if you aren't bothered by using a machine translator and a text hooker. But this Steam version is a joke. I can forgive a lot of things, but not bugs.\n------------------------------\n\nIm a big fan of ONEONE1 and haven't played much of the game yet, but I can say some things right of the bat so here's an early preview.\n\nFirst, it's a japanese H-RPG made on RPG maker. And a lot of RPGMaker's original assets are still used. So if this kills it for you then don't bother. The uncensored version will be released the 05/08 on DLSite english for 6$, while the original game (that you can also buy on DLSite) costs 9$. \nWelcome to the wonderful world of japanese amateur porn games. Now that the price, patch and RPGM issues are dealt with, let's dig in.\n \nThe biggest reason to get this game is the translation. H-RPG have a fair amount of text so a translation is fairly important in order to be able to enjoy them properly. And I have to say that the translation is ATROCIOUS. Sometimes so badly translated that it changes the meaning of some sentences. I've played many H-RPG with amateur translations, and this \"professional\" translation manages to be worse. \nIt's not as bad as a machine translation, but it's barely better. Really disapointed by the abysmal quality of the work done there.\n\nThe game itself follow the standard template of the latest ONEONE1 games :\n\n-Voiced main character. Wich is one of the best things about these games. The elf is entirely voiced, including lewd scenes.\n-Fighting system is his usual active time battle system. Nothing really new here, you have one character with a lot of skills and you have to use the right ones depending on the ennemies weaknesses. Nothing to write home about.\n-Battle r*pe. Like in his other games, the ennemies can initiate \"H-Attacks\" that make them r*pe the main character. Unfortunately they also have the same downside of being so fast that they aren't fappable.\n-Multiple Routes : You have 5 endings as well as multiple routes, including a virgin route. So you've got a fair bit of content there.\n-H-events : Like in all H-RPGs, you have pornographic events triggered by story progression, talking to NPCs, working certain jobs or losing a fight. Some are short events with generic cut-ins that may change depending on how lewd the heroine gets (not far enough to confirm it), some are longer events with full illustrations. \n\nOverall I think it's a pretty good H-RPG with an awful translation. If you're okay with that then I recommend it as ONEONE1 is one of the best amateur H-RPG devs in my opinion (along with Ankoku Marimo, Clymenia and Scale's Garden). \nIf you can't deal with such a bad translation, then don't bother. I really hope they'll step it up for the next games.", "timestamp_created": 1501850506, "timestamp_updated": 1502432691, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505928874015808105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34013247": {"recommendationid": "34013247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179973825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1503827783}, "language": "english", "review": "fapped for a good 8 hours", "timestamp_created": 1501843515, "timestamp_updated": 1501843515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385370552539825439", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34012519": {"recommendationid": "34012519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157777333", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1597207471}, "language": "english", "review": "I Thought everything was going right for once in my life..\nSo Where did i go wrong?", "timestamp_created": 1501840844, "timestamp_updated": 1504078954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477208733558654785", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34010392": {"recommendationid": "34010392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043522334", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1501832201}, "language": "english", "review": "You're better off just getting off to the CGs on SadPanda...", "timestamp_created": 1501832476, "timestamp_updated": 1501832476, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.66264653205871582", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34008448": {"recommendationid": "34008448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013313935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1506146474}, "language": "english", "review": "How do I explain this to my mom??", "timestamp_created": 1501823458, "timestamp_updated": 1501823458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4541778564453125", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34006866": {"recommendationid": "34006866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198229667096", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 318, "last_played": 1691568047}, "language": "english", "review": "best game and also got too more games thank you so much", "timestamp_created": 1501816035, "timestamp_updated": 1501816035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45917046070098877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34006738": {"recommendationid": "34006738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275697073", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1502150577}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, it's an H-RPG.

That's not something I'd expected to ever make a review about. Apologies in advance if I offend anybody else's sensibilities by speaking my mind.\n\nWhen I saw the title pop up in the list of new releases, I was happy, expectant. A game titled \"Dark Elf\" surely had to be celebrating the glory of this dark-skinned, pointy-eared race of beautiful fantasy humanoids. It had to be elegant, maybe a bit haughty, but truly stunning to behold.\n\nAt that point, I did not even care an ounce about the gameplay. Who really needs super-extravagant gameplay when there are Dark Elves to be had?\n\nEver since Record of Lodoss War showcased the marvelous Pirotess, Dark Elves had a special spot in my heart. I even collected Warhammer Fantasy Battles' Dark Elves/Druchii, even though they were pale-skinned as their Ulthuanian High Elf cousins (which was not a surprise, considering how much of their land of exile is covered in snow). Chloe and Origa Discordia were heroes of their people before the Black Dog band came and ruined their lives. Sansei Muramasa from Full Metal Daemon even made it into Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroines Infinite Duel, which recently released on Steam. She showcases yet another example of Dark-Elvish grace. Yao Haa Dushi also showed the stoic might of her people in GATE: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri, and life was good at Alnus.\n\nI hope you can understand my excitement to a degree. These dark coffee-toned beauties are a sight to behold, and one easily appreciated.\n\nBut then I saw this game, played it even, and my disappointment, nay, [b]offense[/b] knew no bounds.\n\nThis is no Dark Elf. Fraylia, or Frelia, whichever spelling in the game is actually supposed to be true, is no Dark Elf. I find the game's premise utterly deceptive. At best, she is a [b]Toast Elf[/b], who had a light tan from going to the solarium for a few hours. Maybe she even just used some tan-lotion (which might explain the light-spots on her skin?).\n\n[b]Dark Elves Matter, dear developers.[/b] \nThey are an already marginalized people who always stand in the shadows of their High Elven cousins in popular media. They are rarely considered to be included. Every piece of multimedia involving them is a rare gem, especially in western regions. This..... blatant [b]whitewashing[/b], is inexcusable. \nHow could you do this? Why did you do this?
