Which is a shame because there is a lot of upgrades/shard/abillities to experiment with, but in the end you just spam that big arrow and basic slash and facetank everything(even platforming stages!!!) because the game spams health upgrades like it's nothing (hardest difficulty btw)\n\nStory is basic, not overshadowing gameplay, villain is decent enough, ending is fine (And it reveals that Ori is actually Dark Souls: Family Edition). Never felt like it's cheesy or infantile (Maybe one moment, but still - very minor thing).\n\nLacks more complex secrets, some mistery, and more challange, but overall - if you liked the 1st one, you will like the sequel even more.\n\nAlso it's quite impressive how many times you can rearrange the main musical motive and keep it a banger.", "timestamp_created": 1699310343, "timestamp_updated": 1699310497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149675402": {"recommendationid": "149675402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180723838", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1167, "last_played": 1699241343}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyed the game a lot more than I expected.

I was bummed I'd spent more than 2 hours playing because I couldn't return it.\n\nA few months later, though, I was bored out of my mind and thought I'd give it a second try. I made myself play it and YouTubed anything I couldn't figure out, and man was it worth it. The game gets better and better as you play, unlocking new abilities and Ori becoming more agile, causing movement to become extremely fun.\n\nThis is the first metroidvania I've played. I'm not really a fan of the genre because I like a game to flow perfectly from beginning to end instead of having to backtrack with new abilities, but as far as side-scrollers go, this one has been my favorite.

I'd say the game is creatively bankrupt, and offers almost no technical improvements over the first game. This is little more than a 'cynical' cash-grab. The only thing I can say was done well is the eye candy. The game has about 15 hours' worth of gameplay in it.\n\nThey care so little about the game, they didn't even fix some of the noticeable problems with the first game: \n - the map still doesn't correctly show all areas that have been explored (and sometimes barely shows walls, so you think you didn't fully explore an area when you did). \n - The controls are incredibly loose and you're fighting against them to get the character to do what you want at times. (Your character sticks to the wall like a magnet.)\n - The gameplay is incredibly shallow.\n - The game may as well be linear. It's really not a metroidvania. You can go anywhere at any time, you just *may* miss some secrets the first time around. Realistically, I could get all secrets with the equipment I had by about 5 hours in. There's not much sense of mystery, like 'How do I access this area? Will I get some upgrade later?'. Mostly it's straightforward.\n\nAdditionally,\n - The game is incredibly easy (apart from the occasional boss battle, which are just frustrating really.)\n - So many platforms gesticulate, flop and smush around like they're made of gelatin-- even things that are supposed to be hard rocks or wood. I think the devs were very impressed with themselves for making this interesting visual effect, and so they spammed it everywhere. Another sign the devs don't care about the game, and just see it as a visual art project.\n - The gameplay is frequently interrupted by the most predictable, repetitive cutscenes-- they copied the setpieces from the first game too, so it's not even novel the first time you hide behind barriers to avoid a big owl in the background. For some reason, you can skip some of these cutscenes but not others.\n - They tried to ripoff Hollow Knight's badge system, and they failed almost completely. \n - The story is terrible and so nonsensical at times that it would be funny if it weren't embarrassing. Things happen because they thought 'this is the kind of story beat that should happen at a time like this', with no connection to the worldbuilding or narrative. Big frog gets possessed by shadow creature (without any warning or narrative setup) because that's just the kind of thing that should happen in a game like this. And of course it finishes with a boss battle, after which he overcomes the possession and then dies. It's extremely predictable and generic, and it doesn't even fit in with the narrative. The visual of the shadow creature carrying the big toad is so absurd-- there's no reason the shadow creature would try to attack you with this huge, cumbersome toad. It's an extremely ineffective way to attack the player; it's clearly done because they devs have no understanding of narrative or art, even at a layman commonsense level, and they just thought that's the kind of thing which happens in a story like this. \n\nWith the story being so nonsensical, yet predictable and generic, and no improvements made to the noticeable flaws of the first game in regards to gameplay, it's hard to see this as anything but a visual arts project for the dev team.\n\nIf you haven't played Hollow Knight yet, play that.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697971402, "timestamp_updated": 1697971402, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.41119500994682312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148657781": {"recommendationid": "148657781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126939434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 985, "last_played": 1697965168}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful graphics and soundtracks. more game play mechanics compared to the first one.

Building upon the success of its predecessor, \"Ori and the Blind Forest,\" this sequel takes players on an enchanting and emotionally charged journey through a beautifully hand-drawn world.\n\nThe game excels in several aspects. Firstly, its visuals are simply breathtaking. The game's stunning art style and attention to detail create a magical atmosphere that draws players in. The lush forests, intricate caverns, and diverse biomes are a testament to the artistry of the developers at Moon Studios.\n\nBut it's not just the aesthetics that shine; the gameplay is equally exceptional. \"Will of the Wisps\" refines the platforming mechanics of the first game, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. The addition of new abilities and upgrades keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. The combat has also been enhanced, offering more variety in how you approach and defeat enemies.\n\nOne of the most memorable aspects of this game is its storytelling. The narrative is emotionally charged, and the characters are endearing. Ori's journey is a heartwarming and often heart-wrenching one, as you navigate through themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of hope.\n\nThe soundtrack, composed by Gareth Coker, is a work of art on its own. It complements the game's emotional depth and artistic beauty, immersing players further into the world of Nibel.\n\nWhile \"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\" is a near-perfect gaming experience, it's not without its challenges. Some may find the difficulty spikes to be a bit steep, and there are occasional bugs or performance issues that can detract from the experience. However, these minor flaws are easily forgiven when weighed against the game's many strengths.\n\nIn summary, \"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\" is a must-play title for fans of platforms, storytelling, and beautiful art.

(specifically light burst throw). \n\nIt was also rather overwhelming and even immersion breaking with how many things were going on at the same time, being given sidequests etc., it felt like so much compared to the perfected, more streamlined but not restrictive progress the first game.\n\nHowever, graphically the game is a straight upgrade, Ori controls the exact same, the most important and staple movements are present and the gameplay feels smooth and very satisfying when mastered.\n\nI can't not mention the difficulty spike, the game almost expecting you to have played the first game or get \"punished\" ( - learn through trial and error), especially if you hop straight into hard difficulty. Difficulty coming from not the enemies this time, as health and resource management in this game is a lot more lenient than before, as enemies now drop health and energy shards, but when it comes to bosses, they're pretty spongy. They take a while sometimes and you've pretty much mastered the whole bossfight by the time you're done, and it feels nice? I don't tend to enjoy these kinds of victories but it really feels nice against things that don't really use BS strategies to harm you (except in the finale :))\n*Note, I only played it on Hard, I don't know if enemies drop health on normal\n\nI recommend you play with a controller, as it feels natural for a 2d platformer. If you have prior controller experience, you really should try the Ori duology, even if you aren't that big on platformers.

The game is also way bigger than the first one, they have implemented NPCs, quests and skill building.

I play for the story and relaxation.)\n\nWith all the new stuff to the game compared to the old Ori (which was a very simple platform game), this game was a little  too overwhelming. There were just too many abilities to keep track on. Some abilities were only used in certain regions and never outside of it which was unnecessary. The Burrow ability was super wonky, you could only burrow when the blue indicator showed up and because it shared the same button (i use controller) as Dash, sometimes when you wanted to burrow, you'd dash instead and lose your momentum, it was insanely frustrating. \nThere were also too many weapons and some parts in the game required a certain weapon to proceed (like hitting a wall) was very annoying because you'd have to change them back and forth very often.\n\nI still loved and enjoyed the game very much, however i dont think i will be able to finish it because it's just too much and i

The OST, gameplay, and storyline were all top notch and if not better than the sequel. What stands out between Ori and the Will of the Wisps and Ori and the Blind Forest would have to be the combat system, as in this sequel, it follows through with a rather dynamic boss battle system to progress which I think brings a lot of life to the gameplay. Sure, the order of progression might be confusing to most people, but I think the essence of having free will to make the choices yourself bring out a lot of adventuring as you are exploring the map. But besides that, one area of concern in Ori and the Will of the Wisps would be that it isn't low-end friendly as compared to Ori and the Blind Forest, the graphics can sometimes be rather demanding, the gameplay and cinematics may become choppy, but that rarely disrupts the smooth flowing of the gameplay.

Either way it's phenomenal and definitely worth buying.\n\nPlaying \"Ori and the Blind Forest\" first is not technically required, but I do recommend playing it first. The worst part about this game is that it does rehash some parts of the original, but also has so many mechanical and design improvements (many of which are not-so-subtly borrowed from Hollow Knight) that it sorta nullifies the gameplay of the original. It also feels a little shorter, but that might be because for me the muscle memory of Blind Forest carried me through about 2/3 of the games challenges.\n\nOther than that there's nothing bad to say. The graphics are incredible. The platforming is satisfyingly technical yet feels buttery smooth. The new world has a lovable cast of characters in diverse biomes. The plot takes a bit to get going but brings it home with some very emotional resolutions. The soundtrack is beautiful (although I'm pretty sure the villain theme is just Seven Nation Army) Across the board the level of polish and care is immaculate.", "timestamp_created": 1696661662, "timestamp_updated": 1696661662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147776294": {"recommendationid": "147776294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982276353", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2224, "last_played": 1620902708}, "language": "english", "review": "Muito bom", "timestamp_created": 1696646319, "timestamp_updated": 1696646319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147774247": {"recommendationid": "147774247", "author": {"steamid": "76561199510194540", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1697382625}, "language": "english", "review": "Fluid gameplay and great colors and graphixs.I find the game to be quite relaxing with the beautiful soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1696642984, "timestamp_updated": 1696642984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147768259": {"recommendationid": "147768259", "author": {"steamid": "76561199211488935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1812, "last_played": 1698528018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego es GOD esta con mas mejoras que su predecesor \nojala mas gente lo jugara y ve lo sensacional que es", "timestamp_created": 1696633019, "timestamp_updated": 1696633019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501231491565704346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147767512": {"recommendationid": "147767512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121107671", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2517, "last_played": 1696381451}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly moving and beautiful game.

Despite having a larger map to explore, this time around, with the additional abilities and tricks you can pull off, it seems a lot faster to get from an area to another.\n\nThe game introduces new abilities while requiring players to reactivate and relearn old ones. Ori is more capable this time around when it comes to its arsenal, but still fragile in combat. The game features excellent traversal and progression mechanics, with periodic main narrative follow-throughs necessary for full completion. \n\nBoss fights are challenging, and chase sequences are less frustrating than the first game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD_mAKechc&t=2s\n \n[h3] \ud83d\ude04 Fun: [/h3]\n\nLike the previous game, I've enjoyed this game a lot and it was nice to return to this world.\n \n[h3] \ud83c\udfde Visuals & Presentation: [/h3]  \n  \nThe game boasts gorgeous visuals with notable improvements, featuring intricate details in the world. Although the impact may not be as strong due to the fact that it's not too far from the original and that sense of newness is kinda of gone. Still,  it remains one of the most stylistically impressive games.\n\nLike before, yet even more improved, there are different map sections exhibit diverse biomes, ranging from lush forests to candy-like landscapes, deserts, frozen areas, and dark caves. \n\nLike before, there is a map like an ant colony. It looks weird but fits well within the game's context and adds to its overall appeal.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3046285181\n \n[h3] \ud83d\udd0a Sound & Voice-Acting: [/h3]  \n \nThe music this time around is a lot softer, and despite featuring an incredible soundtrack, I honestly enjoyed the end song of the first game more. Nevertheless, there's quality in all aspects, from the voice acting performed by characters that can't be understood, to the beautifully crafted sound effects.\n  \n[h3] \ud83d\udcd6 Story & Writing: [/h3]  \n\nOri and the Will of the Wisps takes Ori to a different location: a mysterious island, after Ori and Ku, his little owl friend, get pulled in by a strong storm while flying together and are separated as they both fall on this new world. You continue to play as Ori, the mysterious and cute spirit creature capable of using its energy to solve puzzles, fight enemies, and overcome obstacles.\n\nYour journey starts as you explore this vast new world. Although the map is three times bigger than the prequel, the sequel does a great job of making you feel as if the map isn't so vast, thanks to the fact that you now have many more abilities to enhance traversal, exploration, and movement, making the experience more intense, rapid, and interesting.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3046282624\n \n[h3] \ud83e\uddf5 Length & Difficulty: [/h3]  \n  \nThe game can take some time to beat and complete, especially if you plan to have multiple runs. It's fairly difficult when it comes to some areas or boss fights, but if you play the game right from the get-go in highest difficulty you'll realize that the most challenging part is the boss fights.\n\n[h3] \u2b55\ufe0fVerdict: [/h3]  \nAlthough there have been great improvements made in combat, graphics, and the story, there was something about the original that I enjoyed more. Maybe it's the element of newness, or the fact that the music resonated with me differently, but overall, I think that if you've played and enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy the sequel just as much. It's a worthy package that should be played one after the other as it holds a dear spot in my heart.", "timestamp_created": 1696530645, "timestamp_updated": 1699719628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748560011386871338", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147696785": {"recommendationid": "147696785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035367664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 961, "last_played": 1696529246}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and lovely story, makes me wish that there was and additional ending to play again", "timestamp_created": 1696529600, "timestamp_updated": 1696529600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147689222": {"recommendationid": "147689222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358232553", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1696521018}, "language": "spanish", "review": "guapisimo", "timestamp_created": 1696521288, "timestamp_updated": 1696521288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147679422": {"recommendationid": "147679422", "author": {"steamid": "76561199552365352", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1239, "last_played": 1696510375}, "language": "english", "review": "Game devs does not have idea of difficulty levels.

It takes everything its predecessor fell short in and improved upon immensely. Some of the major pros below:\n\nThe combat system has been flushed out and is actually really comprehensive and dynamic. Due to the refined combat system, fighting enemies and bosses is much more enjoyable rather than just mashing the same button. The bosses and enemies are much more diverse and include a challenging but fair skill level to beat. \n\nThe movement mechanics have drastically improved despite Blind Forest already being so fluid. The main difference is that you get more useful and comprehensive movement techs earlier in the game rather than going through half the game and finally getting a double jump like in its predecessor. A good metroidvania excels in movement and getting the best movement tech early in the game will keep the player motivated and enjoying rather than struggling and bored. \n\nThe story surprised me on how elaborate it was and I think it was a perfect continuation from the previous title. The characters were so charming and unique. Many side quests along side the main missions and the map flushed out everything in a readable manner. \n\nThe score is exceptional and I did not think it was possible to create better tracks than Blind Forest. I truly felt immersed in many of the sequences and the music was perfectly pitched in the background. Alongside the music was the amazing art direction. Blind Forest already excelled in this department but it was taken to the next level in this game. \n\nAmong the many compelling attributes that Ori and the Will of the Wisps inherits, it's the little things that count. And I won't mention exactly what these are but as you play the game, the small touches really showcase the passion and drive the team had when developing this game. A level of quality and attention to detail that you don't see in modern titles. \n\nI think Moon Studios absolutely knocked it out of the park and I am looking forward to what they can bring in the future.

The weapons are cool but the set up feels like a thrown together with many imperfections. I do like the game with beautiful art style, fluidity for platforming that really left me astonished. The soundtrack was really good (take that with a grain of salt as I listen to auduiobooks as well while I play game).

Graphically and artistically. There's VERY little to take you out of your immersion, other than Shriek's model clipping through itself in one (1) cutscene. The whole world is beautiful (Luma Pools is actually heaven I think) and the music... GOD the music.\n\nI turned that sh*t up to 11 and blasted my eardrums out and y'know what? Worth it, every time. The frosty music for Baur's Reach actually had me crying when I was running through it trying to get 100% completion.\n\nSome of the chase sequences had a few moments where I was like \"Man, I don't know where I'm GOING\" and it got me killed more times than lack of skill did - so that's annoying. However, it's a minor gripe.\n\nSomething Ori and the Will of the Wisps has over its predecessor (Ori and the Blind Forest) is the combat. I have nothing against the combat in the original game, but it's simply better in the sequel. You have more options to fit your fighting style (melee, ranged, mage, whatever), it feels smoother, and when combined with the new movement abilities, it gives you nice, clean gameplay.\n\nEvery boss was FANTASTIC with only one giving me trouble and a headache so bad I was forced to take a break. [spoiler]Mora was mostly fine, my biggest gripe being with her tells. \nWhen she summons spiderlings, she screeches. When she tries to melee you, she screeches. When she spits acid at you, she screeches. See the problem? It plays the same sound for every attack. That doesn't help me figure out what she's doing ahead of time, so I took a lot of cheap hits.\nI died a lot during her last phase where she makes the arena dark, but that's due to my own idiocy in not realizing I could just... turn on my light spell and simply not take damage.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the HELL out of Ori and the Will of the Wisps - more than it's predecessor? I don't know! It's been so long since I've played it, I can't compare them that well. (if i replay it in the future i'll let y'all know) Even if I do replay and find WotW worse, it will still have been a good, worthwhile experience.\n\nLastly, the only reason I'm not talking about the story is because... it's Ori. Y'all know the story baller as f*ck, I don't gotta tell you. (I cried by the way, if that gives you an idea.)", "timestamp_created": 1695794406, "timestamp_updated": 1695794406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147105372": {"recommendationid": "147105372", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229671623", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1695786147}, "language": "english", "review": "peak game (i haven't started)", "timestamp_created": 1695785147, "timestamp_updated": 1695785147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147101962": {"recommendationid": "147101962", "author": {"steamid": "76561199123244624", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1696145070}, "language": "english", "review": "quite fun", "timestamp_created": 1695779202, "timestamp_updated": 1695779202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147101874": {"recommendationid": "147101874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198929866959", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1552, "last_played": 1695778945}, "language": "english", "review": "spoiler alert kinda but the final boss does something funny called removing the ground\n10/10, beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1695779017, "timestamp_updated": 1695779017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147068934": {"recommendationid": "147068934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280000152", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 858, "last_played": 1696075730}, "language": "english", "review": "in spirit race DONT do it because get mad and the rest is good", "timestamp_created": 1695745937, "timestamp_updated": 1695745937, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147064994": {"recommendationid": "147064994", "author": {"steamid": "76561199482684589", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1407, "last_played": 1695741276}, "language": "english", "review": "might be a hollow knight copy but its a good one", "timestamp_created": 1695741301, "timestamp_updated": 1695741301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147058034": {"recommendationid": "147058034", "author": {"steamid": "76561199118272281", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1145, "last_played": 1697530371}, "language": "english", "review": "epic parkour moment\n", "timestamp_created": 1695732751, "timestamp_updated": 1695732751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147057044": {"recommendationid": "147057044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057129766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 829, "last_played": 1696000648}, "language": "english", "review": "Exquisite platforming, very fluid.

Very touching and well told. \nOne of my favorite part of the game is simply how amazing it is to move in this game. It is so quick, reactive and satisfying. Especially as you unlock the last abilities, you really feel like a god moving around the platforms. It's really outstanding. \nIt makes it even hard to play other games as they all seem too slow and sluggish compared to Ori. \nI would like to add that the game really improved from the first one. The combat is better, there is much more life and I like the quests. It feels like an amazing expansion to the universe of Ori and the Blind Forest and I am dreaming of a third one.. \nJust... awesome :)", "timestamp_created": 1695673289, "timestamp_updated": 1695673289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147022308": {"recommendationid": "147022308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043332387", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1696110665}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "timestamp_created": 1695672873, "timestamp_updated": 1695672873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147011657": {"recommendationid": "147011657", "author": {"steamid": "76561199133968888", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1697613542}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a good game, The Environment and the music is too good.

Even better OST than in the original. Gareth Coker is a genius, I saw him at the Games Music Festival in London. He is so dedicated to composing game music and so dedicated on making it fit every moment of the game, that he played it for over 1000 hours during his 4 years of working on the score. The 4K HDR looks insanely good and the world is beautiful. I can't stop staring at the main menu. Ori's responsiveness is even better than in an original game and is incredibly smooth. This game hits emotionally hard again. We finally have more flexibility when it comes to saving. The ending is good, bittersweet and I like that the cycle is completed and it is a perfect closure to both games. I could praise this game for hours. This and Hollow Knight are the best that the metroidvania genre has ever had to offer.\n\nEveryone is praising this game and for a good reason, so I will focus on what could have been better about this 9.5/10 game:\n-I was a little disappointed with how little time we were able to play as Ku. Watching the trailers, I assumed that more focus would be given to her in both story and gameplay. I was hoping for some mystery about the owls and that the plot would go a bit in that direction.\n-The main \"antagonist\" is not as good as in the first game. In terms of how we fear her and in terms of her origin story, which is just sad and that's it.\n-Platform challenges and escape sequences seem less challenging, and that is what I enjoyed in the first game. I loved the satisfaction of beating the Ginso Tree sequence in the original. Dying 30 times to that epic music was amazing. On the other hand, we get Spirit Trials as a challenge.\n-I liked the addition of the NPCs, and the Mokis are really cute, but these RPG elements decreased my immersion. Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the way they were executed, but you should be in a dying land, desperately looking for a way to save it, not being distracted by a friendly chat, doing quests and building. I don't want to spoil, but compared to the original game, the land's situation should be even more dire.\n- I liked the boss fights, but Hollow Knight does it better, and I think the game should focus on what it does best, which is chase/escape sequences and platform challenges that have been shortened and made easier in this game. However, HK doesn't have such responsive movement, so it's still enjoyable and refreshing to have those fights from time to time, especially fight with Mora the Spider (and that music change in the middle was crazy!).", "timestamp_created": 1695477556, "timestamp_updated": 1695477556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1,

Some mechanics feel weird, which is probably where most of the difficulty comes from. However, at the same time, they are super creative and unconventional. In terms of how this relates to other metroidvanias, it seemingly takes inspiration from a lot of the ones I played up until this point, but does it so well that it is hard to be upset about it. The visuals are perfect and the OST is a really awesome twist on the first game's sound track, as well as new tunes that make the journey feel much darker but still emotional. Gotta address the elephant in the room for differences between this and the first game [spoiler] Combat is refined and now there's bosses and boss chases and they are awesome, they did not slack here whatsoever [/spoiler]. I kind of felt weird about all the different movement options towards the end of the game, because I often misinputted due to the time pressure, and forgetting that certain movements are mapped rather than LB or RB on the controller. Exploring in this game is great, and there's virtually no punishment for going the wrong way [spoiler] especially if you have the instant teleport item [/spoiler]. \n\nThis is very close to a perfect game in my mind, though some may find it surprisingly challenging.

These aren't bad additions, it does add more flexibility in a build you could make with the Charms and where as the Nail in Hollow Knight allows you to bounce off of enemies by attacking down, in Ori, a hit resets your jump count so if you're hitting and jumping right, you can keep being airborn, which feels -so -good.\n\nYou'll find most of the shards exploring or from some NPCs and this is where you'll get to select your double jump, your wall grab as well as other buffs and other helpful benefits. You unlock more shard slots the more you go.  \n\nThe main abilities are now in a wheel that you can access with LT, stopping time, allowing you to select your skills and put them in your shortcuts (X,Y,B). This is where your main attack, Spirit Edge, is as well as Recover for life recovery, fire orbs, a spear and such.\n\nIt feels a little too much compared to the simple and effective way the first game was built around, unlocking your abilities felt more natural without having to select them, but it's well done still, I got used to it without much issues, everything flowed well because the game got great design in overall. \n\nDifferently from the first game where you had a skill tree where you would spend the Spirit Light you're collecting, all the shards and abilities can be upgraded with Spirit Light at certain NPCs now.\n\nTalking about NPCs, they now also give some side quests and we got a Trade Quest like in A Link's Awakening. The throwback.\n\nSo, one more time, one of the best Metroidvania.\nA third game would be more than appreciated because there's nothing like it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1695252209, "timestamp_updated": 1695284746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146635335": {"recommendationid": "146635335", "author": {"steamid": "76561199145776879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1776, "last_played": 1699965101}, "language": "english", "review": "Fire game do recomend", "timestamp_created": 1695199683, "timestamp_updated": 1695199683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146613027": {"recommendationid": "146613027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259328602", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1678, "last_played": 1695157830}, "language": "english", "review": "The pros:\nEverything about the game\n\nThe cons:\nThe optional Spirit Trials", "timestamp_created": 1695158261, "timestamp_updated": 1695158261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146602311": {"recommendationid": "146602311", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029624426", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1254, "last_played": 1695344228}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game", "timestamp_created": 1695145808, "timestamp_updated": 1695145808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146576566": {"recommendationid": "146576566", "author": {"steamid": "76561199082410345", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1906, "last_played": 1645168371}, "language": "english", "review": "Im not a furry but i love Ori- the game i mean", "timestamp_created": 1695108717, "timestamp_updated": 1695108717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507982611656188965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146576368": {"recommendationid": "146576368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296760943", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1501, "last_played": 1695886391}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es el juego m\u00e1s bonito que vi, con una dificultad desafiante y una ost preciosa :3\n", "timestamp_created": 1695108210, "timestamp_updated": 1695108210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146572161": {"recommendationid": "146572161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198812879162", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 559, "last_played": 1695098495}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10\nBuena Historia\nBuena M\u00fasica\nBuen Gameplay\nBuenos Jefes\nEsta Perfecto", "timestamp_created": 1695098708, "timestamp_updated": 1695098708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146566821": {"recommendationid": "146566821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256904643", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1695088625}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best movement systems I have seen.

Just like Ori and the Blind Forest (which you should play, if you didn't already do it), get ready to be amazed by the beautiful soundtracks and places and be prepared for another emotional story.\n\nThe gameplay is just as amazing as in the first game, except you have more abilities (which you can upgrade AND you can use more than one), the open world concept feels more open as you can explore every place multiple times, the saving system changed into an autosave method (which can work in your favor a lot of times) and you get to meet lots of NPC's with all sorts of cute tasks. ([spoiler] except one task that will give you a big punch in the heart. You'll see what I'm talking about [/spoiler]). The visuals are just breathtaking and the music fits beautifully. You'll get through all sorts of emotions, from anger to sadness, from depressed to being incredibly joyful. \n\nThe combat system is really changed. Now we have interesting bosses ([spoiler] the last one shouldn't be a boss. Remember that punch in the heart? Double it. Actually, triple it [/spoiler]) with amazing moves and abilities. Each weapon is required in certain places and the amazing thing is that you can change your weapon any time you want. Even when you're mid battle! There are lots of upgrades for your weapons and you can even get new ones. Speaking of upgrades, you can equip lots of them with the help of shards that you won't miss. \n\nThe controls are as amazing as ever. Everything feels so smooth, especially when you progress through the game and you get some more abilities. Basically, you take everything good from Ori and the Blind Forest and you bring new and better elements to it. \n\nThe visuals are just out of this world. I know that it's been said numerous times, but I just can't help it. Every place (even the not so friendly ones) seems like it's from some amazing fairytale or picture. The lighting system combined with amazing details gives life to the world of Niwen. Of course, we can't forget about the soundtrack that really brings every place to life. Gareth Coker is this amazing God that can create soul piercing soundtracks for the Ori franchise. Every piece is so intense that it makes everything so real. The original theme from the first game is wonderfully \"sneaked\" into the new soundtracks that it kinda gives a feeling of nostalgia. \n\nNow, the ending (more like a rant) [h2] MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! Everything will be covered and I'll post a spoiler free conclusion [/h2]\nThe ending finished me. I've never been this devastated after a game since the first Ori game (even then, it wasn't THIS bad). [spoiler] In my opinion, this game has two endings. The soul wrenching, heart stomping, stomach punching one and the other that doesn't really feel like an end (more like a sequel posibility). Over the course of the game you'll find an even sadder owl story. The first ending involves her and I'm really not happy with it. Call me a brat, but I enjoy happy endings, especially for characters like this poor owl. This game talks about forgiveness and redemption, but this is the part where it fails. After you have to FIGHT with this character, you have to see the saddest cinematic in the whole world and then you have to accept the fact that nothing can be done. And don't get me started with the fact that nobody remembers her, nobody goes to visit her, she doesn't even appear in the credits (in the little arts between credits). It feels like nobody cared about her, EVER, and that's just so heartbreaking. At the end of the game I didn't even know how to feel. Sad or angry for this seemingly rushed ending. You can't get us invested in this sad story and expect us to have the will to fight her. I hope that there'll be a definitive edition that will give her a happy ending. Or at least a sequel with something related to this story. [/spoiler]. It's an Ori game, so you should expect to be emotionally drained, but I feel that everything was much more emotional and sadder.\n\nSo yes, I really REALLY recommend Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I recommend the whole Ori franchise. This game isn't called a masterpiece for nothing. You'll be welcomed into amazing worlds that are brought to life with the help of stunning visuals, cute and amazing characters, emotional stories and out of this world music. You'll find yourself taking screenshots from minute to minute (I think I have 500 of them) and you'll love every nook and cranny of the world that beautifully appears before your eyes.", "timestamp_created": 1694997350, "timestamp_updated": 1694997350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146501966": {"recommendationid": "146501966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346456859", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1695094499}, "language": "spanish", "review": "hollow knight pero de furros 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1694988510, "timestamp_updated": 1694988510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146499286": {"recommendationid": "146499286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106562034", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3147, "last_played": 1695143661}, "language": "english", "review": "Very pretty game with beautiful music.

I got to this one pretty late, but I enjoyed it as well. The biggest strength is the movement; it feels amazing flying around the map with multiple jumps, boosts off enemies and their projectiles. You need to unlock a few abilities, takes maybe 90-120 minutes before the game really opens up and becomes a lot more enjoyable IMO. Once it did I was all in, up until that point I was a bit bored. \n\nThe combat is easily one of the weakest parts of the game. If you've played games like [i]Hollow Knight[/i] and [i]Blasphemous 2[/i] to name a few examples, you're gonna be pretty let down by this aspect of the game. I honestly enjoy the escape sequences from the original Ori more than any of the boss fights here which are all super easy. The combat is so strange because everything is easy, but at the same time, making the enemies more challenging wouldn't necessary make it better because the attacks you have kinda just suck and feel underwhelming. I also found it really annoying that you can only have 3 abilities equipped at once; most games like this would typically allow you to use all your abilities via different button inputs, or a better control scheme so that felt pretty bad.\n\nSimilar to the original, the game is beautiful, and the music is amazing. It's certainly a game that is more accessible to newer Metroidvania players, and will be more enjoyable if you haven't played some of these other titles that have incredible combat. Regardless, it's still a fun experience and offers music and visuals that are thoroughly enjoyable. Not my favorite, but a good game that I'd recommend.\n\n[b]Recommended[/b]\n\n[i]If you found my review helpful, please consider following my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44234346/]Steam Curator page[/url] where you can see more thoughts and recommendations[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1693789688, "timestamp_updated": 1695963955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.708505392074584961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145627446": {"recommendationid": "145627446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844362874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1689264289}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically the first game plus a bunch of mechanics and design decisions from Hollow Knight, which isn't bad and the game itself is good, but I feel like it lost a lot of its identity because of it.", "timestamp_created": 1693788756, "timestamp_updated": 1693788756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145618858": {"recommendationid": "145618858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118456234", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 927, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "playtime_at_review": 846, "last_played": 1699668849}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No esperaba nada y termine llorando con el final :'v.

Right now, there are some technical and performance issues that may disturb the experience but are fixable over time, which I really don't bother with and deny my not giving it 5 stars.

La m\u00fasica hecha por orquesta es una maravilla, hecha a la medida para resaltar cada zona, como en el bosque silencioso, la m\u00fasica hace una perfecta labor cont\u00e1ndonos los triste y desolada que es la zona, acompa\u00f1ada por una paleta de colores que hacer precisamente eso. Dando como resultado zonas interesantes a la vista y la escucha. La m\u00fasica sabe ser tensa y \u00e9pica cuando se necesita, los bossfights y las persecuciones son entretenidos por esto, y por el siguiente aspecto a recalcar, el gameplay: muchos dicen que es muy parecido al de hollow knight, y es cierto, si. Pero presenta una gran mejora frente al gameplay del primer juego. Siendo mucho m\u00e1s amplio y adaptable al jugador y situaci\u00f3n en la que te encuentres.

I especially enjoyed pairing that ability which lets you shoot arrows faster with that one ability which lets you shoot multiple short range burst arrows. \nGraphics wise, this game takes the cake, and should honestly be a standard for 2D platformers. The game is just beautiful to look at. I will leave it at that. \nStory wise, I think it was solid, like an 8.5 out of 10. Some parts I would most certainly change, but overall it wasn't drawn out a whole lot, and the run time felt good for the price of the game. Some of the puzzles were quite tricky (most of which I had to find guides on how to do them on YouTube) but they were genuinely well designed and fun to go through, though challenging at times. \nOverall, a very fun platformer that I think can appeal to anyone.

But Will of the wisps is just something else. As soon as i started i was hooked and finished the game in about 15 hours of gameplay, 15 hours of pure joy. The soundtrack is incredible (good job Gareth Coker), the graphics are incredibly beautiful, story is just amazing and the gameplay is super fun and honestly should be the basis of every metroidvania. I would give so much to wipe my memory and play the game again from the beginning, it is an incredible experience that everyone should have a chance to enjoy. Moon Studios did a smashing job with the whole Ori series, and i really hope that some day in the future there will be an Ori 3, because this was a hell of an experience.

Not all games were perfect but this is something worth trying if you want something new.\n\n[WHAT I DON'T LIKE]\n\n- [ENDING]\n like anyone else did,i got abit annoyed and complaint from the ending itself. is it just me or its too early to jump straight to the point at the end? . Like no warning or anything for the final scene and just like \"Ok the ill do it\" no hesitant or solution to the problem. Im just like... why????? is there no other vessel or anything??????\n\n- [LACK OF CONTENT]\nMaybe some of you who have played and finishing this game feels satisfied but i dont, similar to the previous sequel it lacks of in game content when you compare to other games like hollow knight. The problem is i want more :(, I NEED MORE\n\n[THE GOODS]\n\n- [MUSIC]\nthe taste is subjective but this is one of the best ost ive heard in any modern games, fits perfectly with the surroundings, intense moments, and boss fights. every area has a character itself thanks to its very good level design and the theme.\n\n- [STORY]\nits simple, reconnecting Ori with Ku and his family. But the progress what i feel is making this game special, from the memories in the Beginning with naru, ku and gumo until meeting new strangers like kwolok,opher, the mokis and everyone else. its a one long 20 hours journey and i like it...... until the ending.....\n\n- [MECHANICS AND ABILITIES]\nJust as i said from the start, it took some hollow knights mechanic's as a inspiration and it wasn't a bad thing since it was an improvement compare to the first sequel, i think this is just me but some abilities was a bit overpowered making it a bit unbalance. Besides that, i had fun with it, easy to learn and hard to master i would say.\n\n- [VISUALS]\nJust like the first game, its a gorgeous world to explore. \"Very good graphics\" my friend played the first game and this is the first thing she said to me. This second game was an improvement. with the music theme fits perfectly with each different area and cutscene and outstanding visuals making this game more than word \"alive\".\n\noverall its a refreshing game if you want something new, better than most modern games today. This game is a hidden gem. Worth the buying on sale for just 2-3$. \n\nif you said \"compare this to hollow knight\"........ i dont know what to say about that since the game itself was very differrent from one and another. Even thought its 2d platformer and a metroidvania.

Unfortunately.\n\nThe graphics, music, and sound are amazing.  The platforming is quite good as well.  The combat is better than the last game, but still very weak.  As I said in the last game, they should have made a platformer rather than try and be a metroid-esq game.  \n\nThe last boss is the best example of that.  First, there is no enemy anywhere near as hard as this at any point in the game.  You go from decent combat with abilities you can work with to the mess the last boss is.\n\nThe game shows you where an attack is coming from, but never shows you what the actual hitbox is.  I kept getting his by the ground stomps because I would move just outside of the where the head would be to get some hits in.  Neither the head nor the marker on the ground are anywhere near the size of the hit.  That head is another example.  I could stand a full Ori width away from the head, but still get hurt when I tried to attack it.  The last phase shows the really bad design.  The projectiles come at you with pure RNG.  This means you can use them to keep up, but suddenly, the direction you were moving in from them becomes empty and the nearest one is literally on the other side of the screen.  This will kill you through no fault of your own.\n\nReally, if they left out the combat and only did platforming, it would be a truly amazing game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1691903017, "timestamp_updated": 1691903017, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427738159894943237", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144056869": {"recommendationid": "144056869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952452357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1692384625}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't have as much to say about this game as I had for the first game, but that's simply because this game has much less to criticize. While the emotional impact this game's story had on me was not as substantial as Blind Forest's story, I still loved every second of it. The pacing of the ending was also a lot more well done, as well, with a very long and exciting buildup to the final boss fight. While this wasn't a complaint of mine, I've heard a lot of people say that Blind Forest's ending was very abrupt.\n\nAt first, I was a bit annoyed at how much this game was taking directly from Hollow Knight. I felt like those mechanics were Hollow Knight's own, and that no other game deserved to take them and use them for themselves. By the end, though, I really started to appreciate how much the gameplay benefited from the intense swordplay, charm system, and NPC-oriented quests, all mechanics that also appeared in Hollow Knight. Game studios taking inspiration from other games in their genre to better the overall experience is a very good thing, and while I didn't realize that at the start of my playthrough, I'm glad that Ori took this route.\n\nThe combat, abilities, charms, movement, and visuals are all a huge step up from the first game, with everything feeling just about perfect.

It makes the ending that much more poignant if you know what's going on\n- In all, if you played the first game and made an effort to remember the bigger plot points, the story here is pretty good and provides great closure to the series\n- The vibes oscillate between cute, mysterious, and scary\n\n[b]Playability & Replayability[/b]\n- Like the first game, this is a masterclass in metroidvania puzzle platforming. It's hard and you'll die a lot, but it never feels cheap or impossible. If we're going to continue comparing it to the first game, I'd say Will of the Wisps is a bit less challenging than Blind Forest\n- This is a subjective opinion (aren't they all?), but I found myself enjoying the level design a bit more in this game. Areas like the little grove with all your friends and the watermill were really interesting. It's not that they were bad in Blind Forest. On the contrary, the level design and map were excellent there too. I just found myself having an easier time making a connection between my unlocked abilities and the places they allow me to access this time around\n- There's way fewer chase and stealth sequences this time around. I was happy for the reduction while I was going through the story, but I wound up actually wishing there had been a few more of each as I was watching the credits roll\n- The bosses were also pretty good, but won't pose much trouble if you've gotten the hang of beating bosses in more combat-intensive metroidvanias like Blasphemous, Grime, or Salt & Sanctuary\n- I'll probably play both games in the series again one day. They're too good to not revisit sometime again\n\n[b]Overall Impressions & Performance[/b]\n- No performance issues or bugs to report\n- I found myself liking Will of the Wisps just a little more than Blind Forest. If it comes down to any specific thing, I'd say it's the design involved in the watermill area. It's the best environment in either game in my opinion, and I had a blast exploring it\n\n[b]Final Verdict[/b]\n- [b]9/10[/b]. The Ori series gets a fitting and beautiful ending. Seriously, if you like Metroidvanias with challenging platforming, this series is can't-miss. Sure, it's not as complete a package as something like Hollow Knight, but I wouldn't rank Will of the Wisps far behind it", "timestamp_created": 1691445220, "timestamp_updated": 1691465025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143608398": {"recommendationid": "143608398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198894813208", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2020, "last_played": 1691438723}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0627\u062c\u0645\u0644 \u0644\u0639\u0628\u0647", "timestamp_created": 1691436574, "timestamp_updated": 1691436574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143605948": {"recommendationid": "143605948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038733459", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 690, "last_played": 1691433661}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not crying!

In the first game , upgrades were in a menu which you can access through your latest save point. This made it easy to access from everywhere which was good but the upgrades were this tree-like structure which branches out to three distinct branches and if you wanted to get a spesific upgrade on a branch , you had to obtain the previous upgrades in order to do so -chain like- . So an upgrade like triple jump was only available late-game (you could receive it mid game but then you probably had to not upgrade the other branches to receive it).\nIn this game ,they removed the saving points completely. Game auto-saves now and I think this was a needed change because let's face it , manual saving sucks (or I suck at it lol). And since they removed manual saving ,instead of this  upgrade menu ,they turned it into a merchant where you can buy the upgrades from. And they also made it limited to a certain amount of slot (3 at start but could be extended to 8) so that it cant be used all at once but you can remove the upgrades from slot and replace it with another one easily.Since the slots are extendable , once you are late game , you could have sufficient amount of slots to beat the game etc. Overall this felt like a great change .\n\n-Quick Travel : This was also a vital addition which was given to player's desire.In the first game, you could only quick travel when you reach into one of those pools where you can warp from one pool to another. But sometimes you would be far off from one and getting there could be time-consuming for some players. With this addition, you could warp to the any pools around the map so that you don't need to walk all the way to get to nearest pool and then warp.That was a nice touch.\n\n-Open World : First game was also an open world-game but lacked the open world features and felt empty walking around the map -objective wise- . Second game however, turned this vast area into a better open world style and added some RPG features. In this game , you could get side quests apart from the main ones , and this helps with exploring the map, finding areas that are not mandatory to find, extending gameplay length etc. I finished the first game without exploring a huge area that had 2 upgrades which would have helped me better with exploring the rest of the map and was essential in obtaining some of the upgrades which I couldn't obtain because i lacked those upgrades.\nAs I mentioned before, merchants instead of upgrade trees or buying the map from a vendor instead of activating the map yourself breaks the feeling of being alone in a huge area where it doesn't make sense to not have any living beings around. This was a great change that put the game on a even higher level than it normally is.\n\nThe only thing i would reproach about is the main gameplay - playing the main quests- , had it not been the boss fights, It pretty much felt like doing the same thing in the first game. Go to that area, grab that thing, go to the other are and grab the other thing; once you have it all collected, go to boss area , fight the boss etc.Only difference was the boss fights and not gonna lie , boss fights were much better than the  tree sections of the first game.But this was something that is mildy annoying and didn't effect my opinion about this game .\nThat being said, I think my overall ranking of this game would be 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1691333682, "timestamp_updated": 1691334231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143515739": {"recommendationid": "143515739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985214009", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1358, "last_played": 1690888674}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1691321610, "timestamp_updated": 1691321610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143503881": {"recommendationid": "143503881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198901136662", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1526, "last_played": 1691306398}, "language": "english", "review": "better and more fun game design than the first, although i do think it lacks some of the soul the original had. a great sequel", "timestamp_created": 1691304706, "timestamp_updated": 1691304706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143499129": {"recommendationid": "143499129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361506143", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 763, "last_played": 1691319722}, "language": "english", "review": "Salah satu game paling bagus secara story, visual, dan soundtrack terbaik dari game yang pernah gw mainin", "timestamp_created": 1691297197, "timestamp_updated": 1691297197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143498973": {"recommendationid": "143498973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044895465", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1521, "last_played": 1699095066}, "language": "english", "review": "successful sequel", "timestamp_created": 1691296945, "timestamp_updated": 1691296945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143495188": {"recommendationid": "143495188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148359359", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1233, "last_played": 1611314946}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing atmosphere and visuals and the best thing is the platforming and abilities you use throught your journey", "timestamp_created": 1691291141, "timestamp_updated": 1691291141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143489054": {"recommendationid": "143489054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202860579", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6986, "last_played": 1691271541}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, this is the best game I have ever played.  And that says a lot as I've played quite a few.\n\nMy first real video game experience was playing Rayman 1 on the PS1, then later Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc on my old Gateway computer.  This was accompanied by the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy and and the first couple Spyro games on the PS1.  Rayman was my favorite though: the mysterious and magical primordial forrest and whimsical characters and (slightly) dark plot elements and wonderful music had me in love.\n\nI grew up, and played other games (mostly FPS and RPGs), and I longed for a game to fill the hole the Rayman franchise left in me, as most other platforming games just weren't the same.\n\nThen I discovered Ori.  I played through Ori and The Blind Forrest, and what a wonderful surreal experience!  It felt like fresh air, and gave me feelings I hadn't felt since I was a kid.  So naturally, I played Ori and the Will of the Wisps.\n\nIt was every bit as good as the first Ori game, and actually improved some aspects that were lacking in the first game. It's improved graphics will be harder on older systems, but the game is even more vivid than the first game (which is impressive!).  Punchy controls, fun and engaging mechanics, and beautiful story and soundtrack make this game one of the best experiences I've ever had playing a game.\n\nFantastic game.  I am sad that there are no more Ori adventures for me to experience, but perhaps in the future there will be more!  If you're still on the fence, just get the game.  You WILL NOT regret it.

you haven't played that yet i strongly recommend it before playing this. experiencing the story of blind forest enhances the experience of the story for will of the wisps substantially.\n\nand if you have played blind forest and enjoyed it, this game is a quality sequel that follows the spirit of blind forest enough that i would bet you will enjoy it too\n\nof course, will of the wisps still has some phenomenal art and music, and the story is just as beautiful as blind forest and i recommend both games on principle for that story.\n\none of the main differences between blind forest and will of the wisps is the inclusion of an actual, far more in depth combat system and i love it. combat feels just as fluid and satisfying as the platforming and is very moment centric. the game still isnt as combat focused as something like hollow knight or anything but its very enjoyable regardless and just like blind forest enemies still play into the platforming itself still which i also like.\n\nspeaking of the platforming, the gameplay's main focus id say is probably still platforming and it feels polished up a bit from blind forest, who's moment already felt very fluid and satisfying.\n\nwill of the wisps still has what i call \"chase sequences\" for lack of a better term that i talked about in my review for blind forest, in short it is a hazard or similar obstacle that progresses through an area and you have to stay ahead of it. they are challenging platforming sequences that are extremely gratifying to complete and satisfying to move through, and are some of my favorite moments in both games\n\nbeyond combat and platforming, will of the wisps also introduces NPCs and side quests along with its normal life/energy collectibles which i greatly enjoyed. the quests arent really tedious and usually just gives you an opportunity to learn more about the world and the people in it, if only just a little. it serves to make the world feel more alive.\n\nwill of the wisps is also a much longer game than blind forest despite my playtime for both being roughly similar (i have a lot of afk time lol). i completed blind forest in roughly 10-12 hours and i completed will of the wisps 100% in roughly 20-22. the areas are larger and more detailed and nuanced and there are more things to collect and find and do than blind forest.", "timestamp_created":

Sometimes it\u00b4s difficult to get all the moves right, what with the myriad of leaps and dashes. But the added challenge is a really nice touch, since it forces you to focus and adapt to new situations quickly.\nOver all, awesome game from top to bottom.

The biggest distinction I can make between the two games is that in WotW, Ori feels more powerful and accompanied by friendly faces in an otherwise harsh world, whereas in BF, Ori felt much more frail, isolated and alone.  Nonetheless, the world of WotW is just as threatening and vast as BF.  Will of the Wisps is a worthy successor to Blind Forest, and well worth a playthrough!\n\nThe Full Summary:\nWotW retains the charm and beauty that made me fall in love with BF, but this time around, Ori feels like they've grown since the last adventure.  While still very much a Metroidvania-style platform adventure, combat is much more heavily emphasized here than in BF.  Throughout WotW, Ori gains a plethora of upgradable powers that make exploration and combat a breeze. \n\nAlso unlike BF, this world is inhabited by friendly faces.  This takes away from the sense of isolation, hopelessness and dread that gave BF such a distinct feel, but nevertheless Ori still feels like this world's last hope, seeing as how many of the inhabitants of this place mention that they haven't seen a Light Spirit like Ori in their area for a very long time.  This is also emphasized whenever you stray too far from the central hub area, as much of the terrain is dark, desolate, and dangerous. \n\nWhile the above does change the flavor of the game when compared to its predecessor, this is still very much an Ori game at it's core and plays just as smoothly as BF.  And personally I appreciated having a friendly, more alive world to explore.  The ally creatures, and even some enemies, reveal backstory and lore, making the world feel much more fleshed out.  It makes it feel like you're fighting to protect something in WotW, whereas in BF you were fighting to restore what was lost.  \n\nThe story was a delight to play through, and finding every collectible and side-quest was a nice challenge on top of the story.  There are also Combat Shrines and Spirit Trials that test your combat and platforming prowess, respectively.  So there's plenty to do if you need a break from questing. \n\nWill of the Wisps is a fantastic follow-up to Blind Forest, and absolutely worth a play through, especially if Metroidvania-style games are your thing.", "timestamp_created": 1690137266, "timestamp_updated": 1690858525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142633674": {"recommendationid": "142633674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074364187", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1690743432}, "language": "english", "review": "Great looking game with a very poetic story", "timestamp_created": 1690105434, "timestamp_updated": 1690105434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142630790": {"recommendationid": "142630790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053562085", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1348, "last_played": 1690108404}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story.

I can definitely tell this game copied Hollow Knight in regard to the \u201cspirit shards\u201d which are essentially \u201ccharms.\u201d The combat is far more enjoyable and not repetitive like the first game and the different environments is a lot more fun this go around. This game definitely had more challenge to it as well. I also enjoy the fact that I could 100% the game without needed a strategy guide. Only once or twice I had to look up for some help in regard to getting to a new area.\n\nOverall, it addressed my gripes about the first game in a lot of creative ways. It also made escape scenes a bit more forgiving and less time consuming. Really the only knock I have on the game is that it certainly copied aspects from Hollow Knight. I wish it wasn\u2019t so overt in doing so but I will say the game stands on its own just fine. The general story and new characters are enjoyable as well.\n\nI can\u2019t sit here and say it\u2019s better than Hollow Knight but the gap between the two is not much. This is arguably easier to pick up and adapt to as it still is not as hard and allows for traveling and ease of getting around much easier. The strength of the game is platforming and that is something that I can\u2019t say any other game can compare to because of how downright fun and complicated the platforming can get. It\u2019s hard to find anything to not like about this game truthfully. It\u2019s quite enjoyable and did something that few sequels do and managed to improve the obvious flaws from the first while not changing the formula too much. \n", "timestamp_created": 1689814289, "timestamp_updated": 1689814289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142436129": {"recommendationid": "142436129", "author": {"steamid": "76561199522680357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 340, "last_played": 1691170691}, "language": "english", "review": "a little laggy but perfect", "timestamp_created": 1689810223, "timestamp_updated": 1689810223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142433700": {"recommendationid": "142433700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132231288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2681, "last_played": 1687016975}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite 2D platformer.

In Hollow Knight, you can collect a Mask Shard, Vessel Fragment, or other important item, and there's little to no descriptive text, because none is needed\u2014everything in that game is intuitive. By contrast, every time I got an item in Ori, they gave me a lengthy explanation about what it does and how I should get ready to collect a bunch more of them. I'm sure not everyone will feel this way, and I'm probably making a huge deal out of something that's not very important, but for me it felt like I was being patronized.\n\nI can respect the opinion of anyone who enjoys this game (and/or its predecessor), but it wasn't for me.", "timestamp_created": 1689718464, "timestamp_updated": 1689718464, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142357445": {"recommendationid": "142357445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066116918", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1690025524}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Definitely, this game deserves me writing a review.

Si ya Ori and the Blind Forest era un juego sobresaliente, esta secuela dice \"quien sos\" y mejora en todo lo mejorable a su precuela. Si bien al principio, puede sentirse un poco secuela continuista, a lo largo de la aventura te das cuenta de que es algo distinto, pero en el mismo universo. Vamos a desgranar todo.\n\nEl mapa de su precuela no termin\u00f3 de encantarme. Pues este juego soluciona todos los problemas que mencion\u00e9 (como la mucha linealidad para un metroidvania) y a\u00f1ade un mont\u00f3n de cosas por hacer. Y s\u00ed, son UN MONT\u00d3N. En el mapa, habr\u00e1 NPCs que tendr\u00e1n distintas funciones: algunos mandar\u00e1n \"rumores\" (que son unas mini misiones secundarias de ver un lugar), otros te dar\u00e1n mejoras u objetos a cambio de dinero y otros tendr\u00e1n funciones muy marcadas, como venderte mapas, darte misiones secundarias o darte cosas a cambio de otra moneda. Solo con esto, ya mejoran much\u00edsimo el mapa, porque te dan a conocer que hay m\u00e1s gente. Adem\u00e1s, hay una especie de santuarios en los que por pruebas te dan dinero, que expande m\u00e1s la exploraci\u00f3n.\n\nJugablemente, es incre\u00edble. Los controles son igual de fluidos que los de su precuela, pero a\u00f1ade una cantidad de mec\u00e1nicas a las del juego base, que acostumbrarse al anterior despu\u00e9s de haberlo jugado ser\u00e1 muy dif\u00edcil. Son muy variadas y consiguen que tanto el movimiento como el combate de este juego sean una maravilla. Esto sumado a una especie de sistema de amuletos como el de Hollow Knight, expande las posiblidades hasta el infinito.\n\nLas boss-fights son muy buenas, pero hay muy pocas. Todas siguen un sistema parecido (que no destripar\u00e9 aqu\u00ed) pero se sienten muy diferentes entre s\u00ed y son muy dif\u00edciles, por lo que el hecho de hacerlas bien, es un logro incre\u00edble. Las mazmorras se echan de menos, habiendo solo 2 en todo el juego pero las que hay est\u00e1n dise\u00f1adas de manera excelente.\n\nAudiovisualmente es lo \u00fanico en lo que no se pod\u00eda mejorar a la precuela. Es igual de bonito, tiene entornos muy variados de aspecto y de colores (diferenciando los elementos con colores caracter\u00edsticos) y el dise\u00f1o de personajes, enemigos y jefes es incre\u00edble. La OST es para ir a la casa de cada uno de los compositores y felicitarles individualmente. Algunas canciones son obras de arte que llegan al coraz\u00f3n.\n\nSi bien la historia no es lo que m\u00e1s destaca del juego, est\u00e1 bastante bien. Tiene alg\u00fan giro que nadie se esperar\u00eda y que a algunos podr\u00eda llegar a sacarles lagrimillas. Toca temas muy parecidos a los de la precuela, y hace una narrativa bastante buena.\n\nResumiendo, Ori and the Will of the Wisps es un juegazo (casi obra maestra) que perfecciona a su precuela en todo lo perfeccionable que ten\u00eda.

I felt the combat fell a little flat for me, and the world did feel a little empty towards the end of the game, but I ended up enjoying it nevertheless. There are a couple games that get a better value for the $30 pricetag, but I ended up snagging it on sale and enjoyed my time with it. Worth your time if you can get it for cheaper.\n\nThis is my first time playing a game in this series, and I ended up 100% it on Normal. I might revisit it for the Speedrun achievements or to play it again on Hard, but I don't really feel a strong urge to do so.\n\nPROS:\n- The game is visually stunning. Backgrounds look phenomenal, and the various details like the flora in each region help sell the game's world. The character animation is also incredibly good, both in gameplay and in cutscenes, doing a good job of selling emotion without dialogue. I wish more games looked like this.\n- The Sound and the Music of the game is also fantastic. A lot of work was evidently put into both the sound design for gameplay and the score for the game, and it really shines through. It reminded me a lot of the Armello SFX, which are also amazing.\n- The platforming feels REALLY good. The game gives you access to a lot of things that just chain together really well, and I think the complexity really works in its favor. Plus, I'm a sucker for anything bullet time, and bash tickles my monkey brain in a lot of different ways.\n- This game feels OK to 100%? There's not that much content, sure, but I'm grateful there's no 40+ minute endurance challenges or esoteric puzzles that I have to bash my head into for hours to solve. I do wish there was some more variety, but fully completing the game doesn't feel actively bad, which I enjoy.\n\nCONS:\n- Combat feels like an afterthought. Enemy variety is pretty low (I can think of maybe like 4 distinct non-boss enemies? There's a couple of variants but you get my point) and normal enemies never really feel like a barrier after a certain point. This game also gives you a ton of flat combat buffs (do more damage, etc.) that make the game easier without making it more fun/interesting.\n- Bosses were also super disappointing. None of them really feel engaging, and the game does a poor job of communicating both when you get hit and when you hit the boss back. \n-  Some late-game abilities kind of trivialize a lot of the platforming challenges, which is both a blessing and a curse. It makes traversing the map a lot faster and more fun, but also takes a lot of the puzzle solving out of the equation. Wish there were a few limits on it (use energy or something idk).\n- I didn't really mesh with the story at all. Part of this may be the fact that I didn't play the first game, but I never really got super compelled by the main story. You don't really get to interact with a lot of the main forces opposing you outside of hearing other people talk about how bad they are, which feels a little flat from a storytelling perspective.\n- The game is noticeably buggy. Several memory leaks just happen throughout my playthrough, and lag leading to input delay was also a thing that happens sometimes. For a game that is so polished otherwise, that was kind of shocking to me.\n- For a Metroidvania, it feels like backtracking is very underutilized. Never felt the need to go back to older areas until I was already trying to 100% the game. I think the game would have benefited if they had cut a few areas and put that effort into bulking up the remaining areas with more secrets, quests, and puzzles.\n\nThis game felt very casual on my playthrough. Dying is never really a setback and you almost always have the resources needed to accomplish something nearby. This could be a positive or a negative depending on who you talk to, but it was definitely very prominent in my mind when I was playing through the game. The game is at its best as a platformer, the movement is well thought out and engaging and the map design helps accentuate the game's strengths. The combat feels very straightforward and would be where I would want to see the most improvement in a potential sequel. This game's presentation is a standout quality - the animation and visuals are heads and shoulders above other similar games. It was a good experience and I would recommend it to anyone interested in trying a new 2D platforming/exploration game.", "timestamp_created": 1689447342, "timestamp_updated": 1689447342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142144077": {"recommendationid": "142144077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961284812", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 1499, "last_played": 1699568666}, "language": "english", "review": "ONE OF THE BEST PLATFORMERS IN LIVING MEMORY", "timestamp_created": 1689441698, "timestamp_updated": 1689441698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142140612": {"recommendationid": "142140612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262368788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2561, "last_played": 1687124784}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome graphics, excellent platforming and fun with dashing and bashing, and a mature story/ending.", "timestamp_created": 1689438221, "timestamp_updated": 1689438221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142134525": {"recommendationid": "142134525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364325802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1692040085}, "language": "english", "review": "Ori and the Will of the Wisps is an absolute masterpiece that enchants players with its breathtaking visuals, mesmerizing music, and an emotional journey that will leave an everlasting impression.

The combat I'm personally not a huge fan of cos I dont like platformer combat but even that was fun. The little animations for ori when shes hanging off something or rolling on the ground. It was all done increadibly well and this last point is my personal favourite, having just finished I paused the game and noticed if look on the left of the pause screen YOU CAN SEE YOUR PROGRESS IN THE GAME there will be little images of each major creature that only appear after you have interacted with them in their respective areas. THEY MADE A PAUSE SCREEN INTERESTING for me it's the little things like that which really make a game good or not, like the notes in the last of us or the endless secrets of the open world in red dead 2. Just the fact that they loved the game so much that they even made a pause screen interesting is just beautiful and it's the kind of game design that really makes you remember and appreciate a game.

The game maintains the beautiful art style only getting more pretty by focusing more on bioluminescence and adding a more vivid depth to the world's environments that wobble and bounce in response to your movement. The music is also just as strong maintaining the emotive orchestral world-music score that compliments the game's primal tones.\n\nHaving already mastered movement the team decided to add more combat in this title. WotW does away with the ranged wisp attack and now introduces a small variety of weapons and a new cast of monsters to use them against. It lacks the mechanical precision of it's contemporaries and while the combat is there it isn't innovated on at all. The enemies are nothing special in terms of gameplay and you'll encounter the same few types throughout the entire game. There are a few different weapons but they feel like toys to play with, not tools to be applied to enemies. If anything they see more creative uses as solutions to puzzles and platforming sections than they do as ways to dispatch foes.\n\nMovement meanwhile is still very strong and WotW introduces a handful of new movement abilities which compliment everything that came before. The cinematic boss platforming sections make a return but are accompanied by lacklustre boss fights that provide more excuses to use the attack button and don't add much else. You also get to play as Ku for a section of the game which makes for a nice change of pace, and offers a bit of unique movement and platforming.\n\nAs for story, if the first Ori game was about the cycles of life and death WotW is about growing up and playing your part in those cycles. The new characters and critters you befriend all seemed unnecessary seeing how the first game conjured so much emotion with zero dialogue, and the new quests they bring with them feel like blatant padding. I imagine the studio wanted to capitalise on making you run around and fight things, but it's a shame they resorted to some of the more phoned in game design to accomplish that.\n\nIn conclusion WotW does less with more but given the first game's strength was its minimalism there's no wonder they had trouble making all the new features fit. If the combat focus was treated with the same creativity as the first game's movement it could have really been something special rather than a middling sequel with lots of padding.", "timestamp_created": 1688903839, "timestamp_updated": 1688903839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141674787": {"recommendationid": "141674787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198844178711", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 586, "last_played": 1690312038}, "language": "english", "review": "Most calming game with the best ending\n", "timestamp_created": 1688903749, "timestamp_updated": 1688903749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141668814": {"recommendationid": "141668814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101235320", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1688897216}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game and definitely recommended.

I'd agree with most people that it is almost as good as Hollow Knight.  The graphics are extremely impressive.  The different environments are all colorful and easy on the eyes.  The game feels like it's breathing with life, the background and characters and enemies all have a fluidity in the animation.  The game is fun to play and gets you pretty addicted once you start.  I like how you can choose what weapons you'd like to play the game with.  You get a sword to use at the beginning, but you can choose to unequip it for any of the others (which you have to purchase from this monkey character).  I used the sword and hammer at the beginning without knowing much about which weapons would be good to purchase.  I found that fighting the bosses with melee was sorta difficult though.  A fully upgraded bow turned out to be my favorite in the end.  You can shoot up to five arrows and use a shard to increase fire speed and decimate pretty much anyone without much of an energy cost.  You'll spend most of the game jumping, double jumping dashing grappling in different ways over spiky pits or spiky walls.  None of the regular enemies proved too challenging, but they can be sorta an annoying distraction.  If you die in this game you have endless lives and they restart you close to where you died which is nice because if they took the dark souls approach this game would be brutal.  I think the main thing that sorta bothered me about this game is I found certain bosses to be extremely annoying.  It felt less predictable to fight them than other games.  The bosses give little clues to what attack is coming, but sometimes even when you know what they'll do you still can't avoid getting hit.  The last boss has an ending phase that's absolutely nuts and I couldn't imagine how anyone could make it through without dying at least once.  The first two phases aren't bad at all, but then it just goes crazy and you're grappling desperately while getting hit rapidly from different directions where if you're in one large area of the screen you can't possibly dodge.  Then you have to continue grappling and somehow get hits in and then go back to grappling and getting hit some more.  I found the best weapon for this last phase is the exploding spike because you can shoot from far away and deal great damage.  But you have to conserve your energy up to that point if you want to use it, otherwise you'll end up having to use melee in this phase.", "timestamp_created": 1687709729, "timestamp_updated": 1687709729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140681772": {"recommendationid": "140681772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982081248", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1053, "last_played": 1691249283}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the game today and I highly recommend it.

And it blew my mind! The graphics are 20 times better than the previous game's (Already awesome) graphics, and the combat is much better too! As while the first game's combat (Though great in its own right) usually amounted to mash the attack button while dodging the enemy's attacks, and maybe occasionally use the bash or ground pound attack when you unlock them, Will of the Wisps' combat is much more in-depth. There are multiple weapons to pick from, more ways to attack, and the combat feels a lot better overall! As for the world map, it's absolutely humongous! And yet it still manages to be easy to navigate! The game also features actual boss fights, unlike the first game, which only really had 1 miniboss, and a bunch of chase-sequences. The boss fights in this game are great too,  and since this game has multiple different weapons to pick from, the boss fights have a lot of strategy to them too! But even though this game has actual boss fights, it also has chase sequences like the first game. And they are just as great if not better than the first game's! This game also has actual NPCs, and sidequests, unlike the first game. Notably, the characters, and sidequests are really in-depth, like for example, if a character at one point mentions having moved from a different area of the map, leaving their old house behind, the old house will actually be located at that part on the map! This results in the world feeling a lot more alive than the previous game's. Honestly, my only complaint with this game is that it has a few audio issues in a few places (though that's probably due to my bad graphics card), but that didn't really impact the experience as a whole, so while the first game was awesome, this game is epic!

Awesome story, Awesome gameplay.\n\nThe story is perfectly written with the right amount of drive to keep you playing the game trying to discover how it will end. The ending is beautiful and the journey along the game is very interesting with a lot of npc characters that are unique and entertaining. \nThe game play is highly entertaining with your power scaling pretty significantly along the game. You will unlock a shit load of new skills and they are all useful and fun to use. Some skills are part of the main story and some skills are upgradable skills that are not necessary to complete the game but they are fun still. *the last skill you upgrade as a part of the main story is incredible fun*\nThe platforming is one of the best out there, you can't get a lot better than that. I love how the platforming feels as it keeps you entertained and engaged. The gameplay and the movements are very smooth and satisfying.\nThe combat is not necessarily the most important part of the game, yet the boss fights are really fun with different bosses.\nThe art style is very artistic, this stylized art is visually appealing and the music will give you eargasm and induce all kinds of emotions within you as you play the different parts of the game.\nThe map is great with a metroidvania that includes a lot of hidden places for completionists who like to collect every possible nugget in the game. you can always comeback to access hidden places that will be inaccessible for you on your first encounter.\nIt took me more than it should to complete the game because I've gotten stuck and went running around looking for solution more than I would like to admit.

The incredibly detailed yet clean presentation allows for visuals that pop beautifully while sitting in the overall scene well. The OST also hits the mark, as does the story, which ties in beautifully to the Blind Forest.\n\nThe gameplay is brilliant, though there's definitely some inconsistency when it comes to difficulty. There's nothing here that'll cause much of a headache if you're a regular player of such games, but the increase in gameplay complexity compared to BF paired with a few oddly tuned boss fights make for an experience which can be a bit inconsistent at times.\n\nOverall though, it's a spectacular sequel to a stunning game.

This one is a masterclass of production, though it's not without occasional flaws.\n\nCombat is a HUGE upgrade from the original, and is satisfying on so many levels. From silvery slashes to thundering hammer blows that knock enemies flying, every aspect of combat is delightful. There is an abundance of ways to attack that suit a variety of playstyles, but I'll be blunt when I say that not all available forms of attack are particularly useful to me. To each his/her own, there's lots of stuff for people to enjoy here. \n\nGraphics and environments are hugely updated and well developed. Gorgeous coloring and lighting are abundant. Periodically, there will be something that looks a little lazy, such as the splash animation that happens when pink blobs shoot out of a slimy pit, but those moments are few and far between. \n\nThe level design is GORGEOUS. There are many places that are easy to \"ooo\" and \"ahhh\" at. Nothing I've ever played looks like this game. Truly unique. \n\nStory is much more developed than the first. Though stereotypical and not perfect in its writing or execution (e.g. \"you're the hero that will save us\"), it contains some beautiful cinematics and heartfelt scenes filled with deep emotion. The cinematics, like the graphics, are very unique in execution. \n\nThe music, like the first, is SOOOOO GOOOD. Blind Forest moved me deeply with the music at the opening screen, and this game continues that motif. I bought the OST of the first one, and I'm planning on buying this one, too. There is a fair amount of \"recycled\" themes, as is pretty normal for sequels, but the composer came back with some new ideas on how to freshen up the themes while adding entirely new songs that fit the field and atmosphere perfectly. Ori wouldn't be Ori without the music. \n\nLike the first, much of the fun comes from traversal of the environment. You'll unlock lots of abilities that will allow you to move around your environment with ease. What starts out as highly cumbersome to get through becomes a breeze. Though you'll backtrack a lot to get the items you missed the first time, it is genuinely a delight to get around the environment, especially once you unlock the final ability that makes all the hard to get places so much more fun to get to. Ori's got some hardcore parkour skills. \n\nThis game is a massive improvement over Blind Forest, with the devs taking a hard look at many of the things that made the first a bit of a chore on occasion and fleshing them out to the point of approaching perfection. The game is short, though a fair bit longer than the first - getting all items and unlockables takes around 15 hours. Despite this, the game ends right on time where the various mechanics would otherwise start to get really boring without some really intense changes. \n\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this game enough. It's very close to being a masterpiece. Flaws and all, there is nothing in this game that is not worth the time and enjoyment.", "timestamp_created": 1685851846, "timestamp_updated": 1687235147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139506709": {"recommendationid": "139506709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278149506", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1686080167}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is visually a masterpiece and so is the story. The combat though, not so much in my opinion. It makes no sense that the enemies can break you attack combos or abilities, yet you can't break their attacks, makes no sense and is quite unfair, especially when it comes to newer players of this kind of genre.

Even when made hard, it's significantly easier than other games. Because of this, the combat is not as moment to moment intense and sharp. If you're expecting fluid and amazing combat from Hollow Knight, you will most definitely not get it here. It is however smooth. The movement is great and makes up for the lacking combat.

Spent a lot longer before I arrived at the Wellspring Glades.\n\nI really love how mechanics gradually adds up and makes controlling gradually more tricky. I felt fiddling with controls and abilities mid-fight was quite healthily challenging and well-designed.\n\nAlthough, I'd say the most outstanding aspect of the game is definitely the music and graphics.

You play as Ori, a spirit of the forest and start out trying to rescue one of your friends. You meet a variety of denizens of the forest while learning new combat and travel abilities. This is the sequel to Ori and the Blind Forest.\n\nGameplay - 4/5. The platforming is good, but I'm docking a point for some of the sand burrowing as tight turns I found incredibly difficult to pull off with the controls. If you like fast paced platforming, this game is for you. Normal adventure have you hopping from place to place, unlocking secrets and removing obstacles to get further and further, all while gathering new abilities and resources. Boss battles are a combination of avoidance where you have a 'run the gauntlet' type of chase either from the boss or from a natural disaster (or both) and then another part where you are battling the bosses with your combat abilities. \nGraphics - I've found Ori's art style to be enchanting and the designers are able to tell a story and make you feel emotions with just the graphics and the creatures that inhabit the world. While this isn't a graphically intense game for your rig, I enjoyed all the spectacle. 5/5.\nMusic - haunting light melodies run throughout the game offset by oppressive chase music when called for. they're appropriate for the situations and pleasant on the ears but I didn't find any of them sticking out to me and eventually listened to iTunes instead. 3/5.\nStory - This is a very light 'story' to the game but what they do deliver did have me get emotional and root for the characters. My only issue with the story was the very ending, [spoiler] with one character, the main boss, really having a disservice in its ending. They gave the boss' backstory and then just left them in their poor existence. I would have liked some redemption and acceptance after the life they lived, but I just like happy endings. [/spoiler] A 4/5 from me.\nFun factor - I did find a few frustrations in the game, there were a few points that the solution to opening the next area eluded me and I had to look up the solutions but I'm not the best at puzzles. The actual gameplay is fun and I enjoyed the game but won't be replaying it any time soon. 4/5.\noverall - a delightful and charming experience.

The platforming level design is an obvious step down from the first game, but they also obviously didn't care about that anymore, because \"hey Hollow Knight got more attention than Ori 1 so let's just completely copy that.\" These people are obvious hacks and it's pathetic.

HK is a one difficulty game that is filled to the brim with varying bosses you learn to overcome with some complicated platforming while Ori is really giving you a great and beautiful looking story with some bosses. The platforming is more extreme in Ori, but the way the game is set up is not anywhere near as punishing as HK is. Granted you can play Ori at a higher difficulty to get a true souls-like experience, but just playing through on Normal is nothing excessively difficult.\n\nBoth are great games in their own right; if you want a very difficult and unforgiving game that forces you to adapt or die play HK; if you want a game that is pretty with a straightforward story and a stellar soundtrack play Ori, and kick up the difficulty if you are into that.", "timestamp_created": 1684544118, "timestamp_updated": 1684544118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138579672": {"recommendationid": "138579672", "author": {"steamid": "76561199454698670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1698958358}, "language": "english", "review": "buh", "timestamp_created": 1684543364, "timestamp_updated": 1684543364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138579035": {"recommendationid": "138579035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063055306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 296, "last_played": 1684541701}, "language": "english", "review": "Just stick with the original.\n\nThis one felt it needed to be more/better so it complicated things with lame fetch quests which distracted from the story.\n\nI especially loved the part where you're given four objectives, but one of them turns out to be a locked door until you do the other three.

Didn't think much of it at the time, but I thought it would be a nice gift for her. I remember seeing her playing it from time to time, the message indicating that she'd started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen. There was always a certain small pride in seeing that, because to me it meant that she was enjoying my gift.\nLast September she committed suicide.\n\nAfter everything had more or less settled down from that, I sat down and booted up her computer. All that was on there was Chrome, Steam, Word, and a few games. One of them, of course, was Core keeper.\nShe had played this game to pieces, clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer. She had used every square inch to its maximum potential, and was making ridiculous amounts of loot. It was only then did I see just how much she loved my present. No other game she played quite captured her affection as much as this one. None of her friends really knew about it, however; it seems like she preferred to keep it to herself. Like it was her own little bit of heaven she could turn to whenever she wanted.\n\nAnd because of that, I can't help but smile whenever I play this game.\n\nI cannot recommend it enough; every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect. The music is catchy and memorable (I'll often find myself humming certain tunes from it), the world feels lived-in and natural, and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable. It's hard to stop once I get invested in the game; minutes can easily turn into several hours.

It is a drastic improvement from the first game (Ori and the Blind Forrest) and improves on literally every single aspect, except for the music, which is just as good in the first game. The music in this game is astounding and you owe it to yourself and to Gareth Coker to purchase the soundtrack! The gameplay is wildly improved. I was not a big fan of the combat in the first game, and thankfully it has been completely overhauled, with a greater variety of abilities that all feel truly transformative and impactful, along with shards you can equip to boost your abilities even further. They have also made it so you can heal by holding down \"B\" if you're on controller, much like Hollow Knight which is a great feature that I am happy is in this game! Boss fights are exhilarating and intense, with once again, an incredible musical accompaniment by Gareth Coker. \n\nVisually the game is sharper, more colorful, more fluent in animation and just a resplendent treat for the eyes all the way through. With a big map to explore, there is plenty of beauty to be found. Speaking of beauty, the story is surprisingly powerful and sweet, with a great ending and tradeoff, and with a beautiful and heartwrenching musical score by Gareth Coker! (Yes, I am mentioning his name ad libitum in this review, because the man's name deserves to be spoken for his incredbible work!). \n\n[h1][b]Final Verdict 10/10[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]The game borrows ideas from other great games of the same genre, and despite this, Ori holds its own identity and heart just as those that came before it. It is the pinacle of 2D metroidvania platformers right now, with every aspect being done meticulously and passionately!

Even though other aspects of the game are good I will not play it again.\n\n[spoiler] So basically, Moon had no plans for a sequel. This is obvious because Blind Forest was a complete story. Microsoft wanted another game and Hollow Knight was popular so they copied it. As for the story, they copied it from the first game and added some things here and there. This story is the product of crunch and different writers working on it. \n\nThe ending is the scrapped ending which was intended for BF (where it would have worked better). Here it feels unnecessary, forced and rushed. We are told that Ori should stay and become a guardian of this forest, but we assume that she will be mobile like the other guardians, and also she has already accomplished a lot in that state. But no, Ori has no choice but to die by fusing with the light that we met five minutes ago even though there was no immediate danger like fire and even though Niwen was doing fine for the most part. (again these factors were different in Blind Forest and that's why the ending would have worked better there).

The sequel, \"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\", has even more similarities to the \"Hollow Knight\" - the way one unlocks abilities, the way one can buy maps for different locations, etc. And yet, it's less challenging while still being not too easy - which, in my case, is a huge plus.\n\nThe story is nice and touching, the graphics are beautiful, and the whole feeling of exploring the vast world and fighting off enemies keeps one engaged till the end. Different zones require different mechanics to pass, some parts are quite frustrating the first time around, but in the end everything is manageable. Even the few boss fights hardly require more than a few tries - again, a huge plus for someone who isn't a masochistic Dark Souls fan.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience, arguably even better than the first part - in my very humble opinion, that is.", "timestamp_created": 1683820107, "timestamp_updated": 1683820107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138140172": {"recommendationid": "138140172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198879995114", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 789, "last_played": 1683817179}, "language": "english", "review": "epic", "timestamp_created": 1683817210, "timestamp_updated": 1683817210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138139603": {"recommendationid": "138139603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442445852", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1770, "last_played": 1684665822}, "language": "english", "review": "\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b0\u25b1 - 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1683816383, "timestamp_updated": 1683816383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514062106609344482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138128037": {"recommendationid": "138128037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009306267", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 598, "last_played": 1686212248}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like platforms games, this is one of the best ever made.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a sequel that changes the game completely. Real quickly, with out getting to much into spoilers, here is a quick change/add list. \n\n[spoiler]\n- A lot more weapons, which feel unique and varied\n-Side Quest\n-Talk able NPCs\n-Combat Gauntlets\n-Builds that you can customize your play style\n-Bosses and Minibosses\n[/spoiler]\n\nHere are the Pros and Cons of the game \n\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n\nMusic - Just as the first game, the music is fantastic, always masterfully made to fit the current environment. \n\nCombat - Combat was one of the biggest negatives from the first game, but now it is one of the biggest positives. There is no way to express it in words, it feels so fluid, and feels amazing\n\nEnemy Types- There are now a lot more enemies to fight, which is a good thing when the combat feels good. If the previous game had around 7 types of enemies. This game has around 15, which is a big improvement. \n\nThe World - Just as the first game, the new world is great. Each place feel even more varied, and has its unique twist to it. \n\nBosses - The Bosses in the game are all very good. Some times, when you are fighting, its feels like an anime, the way you are dashing around. \n\nStory - A simple yet effective story that can make a grown man cry\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n\nCertain Side Quests - There are some side quests, that are pretty boring. Whether its just a fetch quest to an NPC, or  grabbing an item for an NPC\n\nHealth/Energy System - To be clear, the health and mana [b] BARS [/b] themselves have not changed, just the way that you use them. \n        -To gain back your health, you are given a ability very early in the game, that gives you 3 health per 1 cell of energy use, which is very overpowered. In my opinion that caused me to not be careful because I can always just heal myself so quickly.  \n\n        -To Get More maxed Health/Energy, its the same, however, instead of in the first game, if you only need one collectible to increase the respective bar, you need to find two items, because they are in halves this time.

From the moment I started playing, I was completely swept away by the beauty and wonder of the game's art and music.\nThe story of Ori and his quest to save his loved ones is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. The game takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, from joy and wonder to heartache and sadness.\nBut despite the emotional weight of the story, the game is also incredibly fun to play. While many platformer games rely solely on combat, making the game hard by throwing overpowered bosses, Ori games has always focused on the movement mechanics being challenging as well while also not being completely unfair. And the game's many side-quests, hidden areas, spirit trials, etc. kept me exploring every nook and cranny of the world well past the actual story. \nBut what really sets \"Ori and the Will of the Wisps\" apart is the way it makes you feel. The game's themes of love, loss, and perseverance are woven into every aspect of the game, its \"painting coming to life\" like visuals and gorgeous music, to the characters and their struggles.\nOverall, a truly remarkable game that touched me in ways that few games ever have. It is a testament to the power of video games to tell deeply emotional and impactful stories, and it is an experience that I will never forget. If you're a fan of platformers, or just looking for a game that will move you to tears, I cannot recommend it highly enough. \n", "timestamp_created": 1683638211, "timestamp_updated": 1683638211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562351465225219727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138029691": {"recommendationid": "138029691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163598621", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1683602177}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't speak any higher of this game....

This game was alright but I think I have had my fill in the 14 or so hours I actually played this for and I have no desire to play the first one right now. The story is not good and will not make you cry despite what you might have heard. It is very shallow and takes itself way too seriously. Unlike Hollow Knight, the world lacks depth and cohesion and feels designed solely for the player to mess around in. The game is beautiful but the visuals are so overwhelming and Ori is so tiny sometimes you cannot see your character and they die. I died during an escape sequence and a boss fight because the particle effects and cinematic camera turned my character into a literal dot - a white dot on a snowy incline. \n\nThe core gameplay is pretty fun. The combat with the sword is satisfying but the combat abilities are all pretty useless. Why set an enemy on fire when just spamming attack with the sword does the trick? Even the combat shrines where you do combat trials for ability slots never has more than 4 enemies on screen. Ori's sword can easily stagger every enemy except the ones with shields who make you switch to your hammer for 3 seconds. The bow does no damage and fire, shuriken etc are just not as satisfying as the basic sword. All these abilities feel like they were added in because a committee forced the developers to.\n\n Ori is not a challenging or frustrating game. The game autosaves every minute and so there is no tension at all. You literally cannot lose progress but you might die a lot during some of the platforming sections because the controls and Ori are both very floaty. \n\nThe Moki are adorable though. Easily the most likeable characters in the game. A lot of the side quests are engaging and well thought out and I actually wanted to complete them, which is rare. Overall, this is a solid 7/10.\n\nI bought this for less than 2 dollars, If you buy this for 2 dollars, it is definitely worth it but for anything higher than a fiver, no.", "timestamp_created": 1683008261, "timestamp_updated": 1683010786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496894419193267822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137661397": {"recommendationid": "137661397", "author": {"steamid": "76561199044859471", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1146, "last_played": 1682808540}, "language": "spanish", "review": "11 de marzo de 2020 paso muy rapido todo\n", "timestamp_created": 1683007336, "timestamp_updated": 1683007336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137658048": {"recommendationid": "137658048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025551690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 990, "last_played": 1684287730}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun.

I won't have as many hours in it as some of my others because it isn't very long but I'll 100% it which I don't do for most games and it has good replayability. I really don't think I'll play a game better than it for a long while. I got it on sale for $6 but it's worth the $30. I try to only buy games that will have long play times but this game is so good that you don't need that. I played the blind forest and it was good but wow, this is perfect.\n\nHere's some more info:\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2611 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610

Also, I especially love the fact that, rather than just restoring the land in the previous game, you also restore the life it once held. This is one of the few games I have played that calmed me down this much. The combat has also been majorly improved, with significantly more diversity in how you can defeat your enemies.
