In the roughly 5,000 years of recorded writings, we trace our lineage to any number of accomplishments -- from the invention of the wheel to landing on the moon; from the advent of agriculture to the polio vaccine. But the path has not always been easy: the same progress we celebrate in these marvels of ingenuity has too often worked to the detriment of human beings. The same atomic energy that powers our electrical grid, for example, threatens our very existence; the extraordinary interconnectedness provided by the world wide web is used just as readily to spread messages of hate and division.\n\nIt is this paradox -- the tragic medley of brilliance and violence, of hope and chaos -- that lies at the heart of Turbo Pug 3D. For in the long catalogue of three-dimensional infinite run games, no other work comes closer to accomplishing the feeling of what it must be like to live as a pug in a sombrero, aimlessly running through deserts and fields. And yet, at the same time, the core goal of the game, to reach 1,000 points, is a feat unattainable by mortal beings.\n\nIt is for this reason that I must give this game a score less than the 10/10 some would argue it truly deserves. Yes, it is true that this game allows you to play not only as a pug, but also as a cat and a penguin -- and, yes, as some of you are surely thinking, it is just as true that this game allows players to collect coins in order to unlock a royal crown which can be worn by the game's protagonist. But it is also true -- and this is important -- that no player has every achieved more than 1,000 points in this game. That doing so simply cannot be done, and likely will never be done by human beings.\n\nIt is this sad fact, that 1,000+ points are unattainable in this game, that speaks to the aforementioned tragedy of human existence. This unattainable goal is representative of the broader tragedy of the human condition -- that we are born into a paradise, yes, but that is is fallen, as we are but mortal beings. That we live our lives like Sisyphus, forever carrying boulders up our respective hills, only for our burden to eventually fall back down. That our lives, however meaningful and however beautiful, must someday end. And, sadly, that no matter how many miles we attempt to run, our pug will forever slam into the wall of a low-poly voxel just short of 1,000 points.\n\nIn the words of Albert Camus, we must imagine Sisyphus to be happy. For to believe otherwise is to make life unliveable -- or worse, unworthy of us.\n\nIt is for this reason that I give Turbo Pug 3D an 8 out of 10.\n\nEDIT: I got 1,000+ points and the corresponding achievement. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1593120189, "timestamp_updated": 1593241611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69648590": {"recommendationid": "69648590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262436638", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 246, "last_played": 1657162405}, "language": "english", "review": "i fucking hate this game but it felt nice to look down and spit on it when i completed it. stupid ass game.", "timestamp_created": 1590216234, "timestamp_updated": 1590216234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69520910": {"recommendationid": "69520910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054640275", "num_games_owned": 524, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1590032765}, "language": "english", "review": "Turbo Pug 3D runs well and is a good time killer.

Every race is randomly generated with prefabricated tiles. Most of which need to be cleared by jumping over them. A jump however uses more than a tile, you are not landing in the same frame where you jumped. This causes you to undershoot multi-jumps in the beginning - expecting to barely make it with the final jump as the delay shifts your position with every jump a little more forward causing you to crash into the last obstacle very often. This could be keyboard and human input lag. Obviously you can't hit jump at the exact time the character is again able to perform a jump.\n\nA single mistake ends the run.

I'll wait for you.\n\nDone?\n\nYeah, this game is worse. I played it for literally two minutes and was repulsed by the gameplay. To write this review, I had to get the playtime up to 5 minutes. But it only took two to see this abysmal game for what it is.\n\nFirst of all, the wait time between attempts is even longer now. It's like 5-6 seconds. That is a LOT of time when you're dealing rapid many-deaths twitch reaction gameplay. Imagine how infuriating it would be if I Wanna Be the Guy made you wait 5 seconds every time you hit R.\n\nSecond of all, you can't start a run with space any more. So not only do I have to wait 5+ seconds, but I have to move my hand over to the mouse and click a small area of the screen. Why?\n\nThird of all, the control latency and hit detection are even worse, and not in the flappy bird way. It's just bad.\n\nFourth of all, this feels like an unfinished unity3d demo/prototype that somebody made in a couple hours (if not minutes).\n\nFifth of all, this game is \"3D\", yet there is no way to control the camera angle or really do ANYTHING with the third dimension. So actually, this game is 2D. You know what makes Yoshi's Story and Little Big Planet 2.5D? You can interact with the third dimension, but it's limited. E.g. in LBP you can jump between a few different \"layers\".\n\nAnd they have the nerve to sell this game for money.\n\nI'm starting to question if these games are just asset flips.\n\nunless your name is O_SEBIN, go waste your money on something more productive like a fidget spinner or something.", "timestamp_created": 1536313646, "timestamp_updated": 1536313841, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43569997": {"recommendationid": "43569997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058995029", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1577378663}, "language": "english", "review": "Utter trash.\nSometimes jumping over an obstacle kills you anyway, sometimes it doesn't jump at all.

I assume i got this in some sort of bundle of games, because in what state of mind would you have to be in to purposely buy such a game. I guess the only positive is that i got it for much less than the actual price. Even though it is unbelievably cheap.\n\nThis game is another 'not for steam game'. Things like this don't belong on steam. It's something you would find in the app store for free, yet they are charging you for a pile of garbage that isn't even well optimised. I can not believe how such a game can get on to steam, along with the many other games they have in this 'franchise'. For someone to enjoy sitting playing this really baffles me.\n\nI think my main hate towards this game is the difficulty, i love going for achievements in games and that was the main reason i decided to finally download it on the day of this review. However, i hate achievements that require you to be in the top band of players, now to people who enjoy this game and are thoroughly good at it, they may critcise this and just call me bad, and i can agree, i cant even get far with my score. But for something to kill you so easily and make it so obsticles are sometimes virtually impossible to jump over multple in quick succession, make it so that the 'Unstoppable' achievement of geting 1000 points is not accessable to a lot of players.\n\nOn top of this, the spacing between such obsticles is horrendous, when spamming my mouse, i can't even click quick enough to jump over the next obsticle. Whenever such come up, i have already lost. It isn't my reaction time either as there is one obsticle with three consecutive jumps, with spikes, and you have to be perfect to get over it.\n\nTo make things worse is the lack of optimisation for this game, the fact that such a shitty small game lags more than an online shooter ceases to amaze me, this makes it impossible to even attempt to get a high score as it just kills you whenever it wants, and for a game that relies solely on timing, it really hurts the gameplay.\n\nIn addition, just like the games prior to it, the music is awful, there are basically five songs, two of them calm and the rest fast. Only one of them fitting the tempo and tone of the game. To just place random songs is lazy once again, but i am glad that there are multiple songs so that it doesn't get repetetive like other games that last a while.\n\nI noticed a lot of reviews saying this was a step up in the 'franchise' yet in my opinion, i think it is lazy. The graphics are terrible, simple and plain. Moreover, the game is much more difficult in 3D and works much better as a 2D game.\n\nThe sad thing is that at some point in the future i am going to have to return to this mess to attempt the achievement and i don't know if i can take that pain again. Overall the game is an excuse of a steam game, and is totally lazy in many ways, and i would really not recommend getting it.", "timestamp_created": 1528590539, "timestamp_updated": 1528591965, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543739378452301025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42486427": {"recommendationid": "42486427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315369325", "num_games_owned": 699, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1540373700}, "language": "english", "review": "The forth instalment of the series is in 3D!!!\nPros:\nNice soundtrack as always but I hope you guys can make more...

To improve i think it would be better for the player to choose what they unlock and not that the game just unlocks it automatically as i think the player should have be able to choose what the coins are spent on.\n\noverall i think this game is worth getting as its a good way to pass the time. The biggest problem for me was that the game did not have a lot of items to unlock and it made the game seem a bit pointless but if they add more things to unlock i would 100% recommend this game to anyone as it will give the player a goal.\n\n[quote] This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellCowON]HellCow.[/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1511994658, "timestamp_updated": 1513533208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674759745597839355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37368971": {"recommendationid": "37368971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131325276", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1510155841}, "language": "english", "review": "ALL THE OTHER PUGS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS THEY BETTER RUN BETTER RUN", "timestamp_created": 1511540844, "timestamp_updated": 1511540844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53886038064956665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37109479": {"recommendationid": "37109479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122450215", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1638065864}, "language": "english", "review": "Gets game for free.\nStarts game.\nGets top 10 score this week in the world first try.\nUninstalls", "timestamp_created": 1511451826, "timestamp_updated": 1565479004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531826972961425781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36975153": {"recommendationid": "36975153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198757849945", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1513316366}, "language": "english", "review": "A really nice and simple game! :D", "timestamp_created": 1511424067, "timestamp_updated": 1511424067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523293614387512207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36554692": {"recommendationid": "36554692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149878138", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 166, "last_played": 1511189207}, "language": "english", "review": "Description:\nThe conveyor jumping dogs continued to trade and this time the action takes place in 3D. We have the same one-button runner where we need to jump over obstacles one of the proposed cute animals. Our goal will be to get as far as possible and collect as many coins as possible. For coins you can open new animals and headpieces for them. The four biomes, each with their traps and obstacles. Biomes open if to run a certain number of meters without stolknovenii, and a BIOM is available immediately at the next race. Will you be able to get all the achievements and beat the highscore of other players?\n\nPros:\n\u00a5 The ranking of the best players (no cheaters). There is a rate in both daily and for all time.\n\u00a5 Interesting to get achievements. If h e had achievements for 1000 points, I would gave up the game much earlier, and so direct his hands were shaking to get the desired achivku.\n\u00a5 There were decorations for small animals (hats).\n\u00a5 Two mini-games triggered when collecting all the Golden letters scattered locations.\n\nCons:\n\u00a5 Brand for all small animals are missing unique jumps present in previous parts. Differences only in visual terms.\n\u00a5 Very often jumps do not work right. And, it seems, had to be jump, but it is not. Had to click a mouse and keyboard.\n\u00a5 Rare friezes which for the runner deadly disadvantage.\n\nThe result:\nI am glad that in the conveyor game, the developers brought something new, and not released a copy of its product with a minimum of changes.

Turbo Pug 3D is a hybrid of both elements stated before, accompanied with a feasible unlock system for new characters and hats through grinding for coins. That alone is surely enough to give a player a \u201crun for their money\"!\n\nWhile there is no plot present in this game, the player\u2019s goal is to achieve the highest score (points). This is if you plan on playing competitively. If not, there are the steam achievements there. This is what I ended up going for.\n\nThe graphics and effects are like that you would see in Minecraft. I would add that the effects were too overdone, because they could be distracting and there is no option to minimize or turn them off completely. I found myself dying on parts where it is the most hardest to see the obstacles: Such as the bones in the desert, when it is snowing. That is one aspect that I was displeased at, though I can also see it as another unique factor to challenge players.\n\nThe audio and music is suitable for the theme of Turbo Pug 3D. There\u2019s nothing too odd about an 8-bit BGM on a game that solely consists of a block-like environment and textures. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience for me, and can be played both casually or competitively for the high score. The tips I would give to players who want to aim for that 1000 points are:\n-Focus on your character\u2019s movements and timing of jumps\n-Make sure you look ahead a few times, so you can expect certain obstacles\n-Try and try again\n\nGood luck.

When you want to jump, there will be an occassion where your character does not jump and either lands or collides with obstacles or falls to its death like a lemming.  It doesn't help that the jumping sucks (makes you feel like your character's a rock).\n\nI can appreciate the work that went into this product, but when you're not having any fun, then you can't call this a good game.  If you're an achievement hunter, then you should know that there's an awful distance grind.  Though 1000 does not seem like much in [i]Turbo Pug 3D[/i], you'll find that to be a problem with poor controls.  Though the price is set to $2.00, you'll benefit if the price is approximately $0.50.\n\n1/10  Turrible Pug...", "timestamp_created": 1489442395, "timestamp_updated": 1489442395, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464759558439254761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30493272": {"recommendationid": "30493272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094321628", "num_games_owned": 1225, "num_reviews": 1003, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 218, "last_played": 1489423180}, "language": "english", "review": "cool cool", "timestamp_created": 1489423194, "timestamp_updated": 1489423194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436213165521621704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30479258": {"recommendationid": "30479258", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014479396", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1489350837}, "language": "english", "review": "100% achievements in 4 hours.\n\nI loved this one so much!

I also liked the day/night cycle and the various biomes\n+ Very challenging, the game actual requires some pretty precise timed jumpes, and gets progressively harder as you run into harder obstacles.\n+ Daily / Global leaderboards help provide replayability\n+ Great soundtrack!\n\n- There's an odd filter that makes the game look overly bright at times which I found to be very annoying and a bit bothersome to the eye...especially in a game like this that requires a lot of focus.\n- Some obstacles (after about 400points) mainly in the Snow Biome are overly difficult, and feel impossible at times. I wish the game was a tad bit easier to lengthen the expeirence a bit. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed Turbo Pug 3D a lot more than the original Turbo Pug and find it to be a great improvement.", "timestamp_created": 1474525141, "timestamp_updated": 1474525141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65072321891784668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25624835": {"recommendationid": "25624835", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998726931", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1475422104}, "language": "english", "review": "A pug, a penguin, and a cat\nWent a jumping, fancy that\nIn desert, fields, and the snow\nThat's really all you need to know\n\nIt's sold at a decent price\nAnd the game is rather nice\nYou'll always want to top your score\nWhich will keep you playing more", "timestamp_created": 1474487509, "timestamp_updated": 1474487509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531300187110900879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25614300": {"recommendationid": "25614300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080125348", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1474435971}, "language": "english", "review": "I personally had troubles with the game, but the developers got back to me ASAP ad made it all good.
