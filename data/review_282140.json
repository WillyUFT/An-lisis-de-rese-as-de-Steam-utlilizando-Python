It takes you to a research facility at the bottom of the dark sea, so the atmosphere is very thick and you won't feel safe most of the time, thanks to an abundance of different enemy types that are going to hunt you down. You are not in possesion of any kind of weapon, so your only choice of survival is to run away and find a good spot to hide. This hide and seek gameplay will be your friend throughout the whole game, so don't expect any wild shootouts. \n\nThe level and art design is also pretty good and will lead you through nearly pitch black and claustrophobic areas which are packed with findable memos of the once living inhabitants. These give you a better overview of what actually happened and how it all went down. Enviromental storytelling is also implemented in a very natural and fitting way and makes you want to explore all areas to get new informations. The ending definitely wasn't what i had expected and was pretty thought-provoking and even a little bit sad. I really liked the philosophical approach they were going for, which is a rather unique thing to find in a horror game. \n\nIn conclusion, Soma is a very captivating title that mixes a lot of different and interesting ideas and the end result is a peerless experience for every player, even when you are normally not into the horror genre. \n\nHave fun!", "timestamp_created": 1700772251, "timestamp_updated": 1700772251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "151380940": {"recommendationid": "151380940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108576764", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 711, "playtime_at_review": 1047, "last_played": 1700759464}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone whos terrified of the ocean and large bodies of water.

SPOILER FREE SOMA\nOVERALL RATING: 9.5/10\nLENGTH: 8-12 hours\n100% ACHIEVEMENT EASE: There isn\u2019t any missable achievements. \nWORTH THE PRICE?: Worth full price.   \nOVERALL: SOMA is a horror game based in a future unknown complex, with weird monsters, and a weirder storyline. The game had me questioning myself at every turn, both in story aspects, and wondering what was going to happen next, or where the next monster would be. This game had a phenomenal story, buildup, and ending. \n\nPROS: The environment is incredible, and there isn\u2019t a thing I would change about it. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, so I will be vague. The spook in this game comes from the environment, it doesn\u2019t rely on jumps scares. This game is truly scary. The monsters are both scary and fantastic. The best part of this game is the psychological horror, like having to walk past people desperately begging for help knowing you wont be back to do anything about it. Also, a small note but this games exploration is incredible. There is a ton of lore to come across. The game really promotes exploration but doesn\u2019t punish you If you don\u2019t explore. You can play the game how you want. I played on my steam deck, and it was a phenomenal experience. Twists and turns throughout the story, and for me, a completely unexpected ending!\n\nCONS: Not very many cons I can think of, other than the controls, specifically the climbing can be kindof wonky. There is 1 or 2 spots where I was genuinely confused and had to use a guide, though this was probably of my own accord and not the games fault. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700522480, "timestamp_updated": 1700522480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150515274": {"recommendationid": "150515274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092332873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1698714490}, "language": "english", "review": "i have a brain injury... my brain is injured", "timestamp_created": 1700517442, "timestamp_updated": 1700517442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150514090": {"recommendationid": "150514090", "author": {"steamid": "76561199065379670", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 522, "playtime_at_review": 583, "last_played": 1700516916}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ive ever played", "timestamp_created": 1700515859, "timestamp_updated": 1700515859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150506737": {"recommendationid": "150506737", "author": {"steamid": "76561199188142561", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 216, "last_played": 1676726743}, "language": "english", "review": "Impressive game", "timestamp_created": 1700506972, "timestamp_updated": 1700506972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150491818": {"recommendationid": "150491818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065807510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1700431187}, "language": "english", "review": "Best environmental storytelling I've ever seen, the end made me feel empty and alone.

But one of the lingering thoughts I've had is about all of the choices you have in the game not necessarily presented as a text box. You're given tons of these paths completely seamlessly, and leading to what I consider its subtle genius... They all lead to squat. There's only one ending, one immutable and linear ending.\n\nObviously, we've come to expect that when a game presents us with a choice that they will at least try and make the game world react and change to that. A game is bad when it doesn't do that, and Soma found a way to subvert that. Its main theme is the classic Ship of Theseus thought experiment, a metaphysics of identity. The choices don't change anything in the game because why would they? Pathos-II has already gone to hell and smarter people than Simon have been unable to turn it around. It's already on the point of no return so why should you face consequences for anything you choose when none of these choices actually affect your end goal? Instead of those choices changing the game, these choices change you. Have you ever thought about the difference between sentience and sapience? Do you value a benign sentient being more than a neutral sapient one? Is your mind an algorithm that would react with the same situations if you weren't aware of it? Is that algorithm what we call our \"soul\"?\n\nI know that all sounds like pretentious bullcrap of someone trying to sound smart, but I really admire the experience Soma gave me. It's not a game without its flaws, but it is a sort of a transforming experience that presents you with a question you hadn't gave thought at all, and manages to keep you interested enough to not dismiss it. Soma commited one of the greatest crimes in game design in filling a game with choices that lead to nowhere and got away with it, I can't help but admire the quality of a writing being able to manipulate me like that.", "timestamp_created": 1700351258, "timestamp_updated": 1700351258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150375819": {"recommendationid": "150375819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038235249", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 492, "playtime_at_review": 2026, "last_played": 1700426784}, "language": "english", "review": "Best sci-fi horror game ever.", "timestamp_created": 1700333358, "timestamp_updated": 1700333358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150370991": {"recommendationid": "150370991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391715273", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 560, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1700159537}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud83d\ude01", "timestamp_created": 1700328488, "timestamp_updated": 1700328488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150363530": {"recommendationid": "150363530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201586130", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 445, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1700406767}, "language": "english", "review": "My girlfriend cried watching me play this-straight fear bruv... have fun.... i guess.", "timestamp_created": 1700321331, "timestamp_updated": 1700321331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150359598": {"recommendationid": "150359598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015879180", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1502320067}, "language": "english", "review": "Pinnacle of Frictional Games.\nEncounters with \"Entities\" weren't that good, in my opinion.

Every enemy has a different way to get past them and the challenge comes from finding out how to do this. There are some hints on each one throughout the narrative, but doing each encounter flawlessly is the real challenge. If you don't like the idea of this and just want to experience the story, there is also a safe mode that removes all damage and the consequence of death.\n\nThere are also plenty of puzzles that are very engaging but there were one or two that genuinely stumped me and I had to look up a guide.\n\nThe achievements in this game are all story based so if you care about those, you don't have to stress out about them at all.

I bought this game because I had heard it was good, but I knew next to nothing about it. I was just in it for some fun horror vibes and a good ride. I had no idea just how incredible this game actually would be.\n\nIf you haven't played it before or watched a let's play, go in blind, I implore you. Knowing little made every turn in the story and every important beat that much more impactful to me. The story is so good and engaging; it balances incredibly complex sci-fi concepts with genuine, emotional roots so well. I felt very connected to the characters and their plight.\n\nThe art direction and the level design is exemplary, and some of this game's most effective scares come simply from the vastness of its levels. You are alone and you are small and you feel so isolated by everything around you; it builds that sense of dread so effectively. It makes you cling to whatever tiny strands of remaining life and humanity you can find. \n\nThe plot also proposes so many interesting, deep questions about the nature of existence which will stick with me for a long time. It presents so many conflicting ideas about what is and isn't a valid form of life, or what can even be considered \"living\". The characters don't ever reach any consensus opinion on these topics, and you the player will be confronted with a number of choices related directly to these concepts. What is it to be alive? To what lengths are you willing to go to preserve that sense of being?\n\nSOMA is both an effective horror game and a spectacular sci-fi narrative. If you even have a passing interest in either of those genres, I could not recommend this game to you any more.

I haven't played the other games of Frictional Games so I can't make any comparisons but I felt like the developers did a really good job of creating this grim atmosphere and believably conveying the grief and desperation the people within the PATHOS-II complex must've felt after the catastrophe happened.\n\nDuring my playthrough I was fine with the controls behavior most of the time but sometimes when you screwed up and have to run it doesn't feel smooth enough to me. Also vaulting isn't a thing which i found to be a bit disappointing since it would've been more immersive to just jump over the railing instead of searching for stairs.\n\nThe levels were designed thoughtfully and most of the time everything looked pretty realistic and not only purposely built to guide the player through the level. You could find thoroughly placed information in every room which would tell you more about your environment and the people who passed through or lived there which really added to the atmosphere.\nSadly some of the level designers slept in physics lessons or didn't feel like following certain physics rules.\nThe drag under water oftenly wasn't respected and there was one situation where you had to pass through strong currents which created huge amounts of dust clouds passing by the player but the player themself is able to jump without being torn away. They can also walk through these current without holding on to sth even though water has way more pulling force than wind for example. \nI wish minor details like these were respected during game design because it really crippled my immersion in that moment which is sad because most of the time this game is really great and definetly has a unique touch to it.\n\nIt took me some good 8 hours to beat the game (the rest is idle time during breaks).\n\n\n4/5 stars \nI recommend this game despite my critizism and only to hard-scifi fans I would give a warning that some\nobvious minor mistakes were made which might impact your experience but if you can ignore them like me, this game will give you a blast and question your perspective on life.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699030184, "timestamp_updated": 1699030184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149444432": {"recommendationid": "149444432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069642479", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1699022260}, "language": "english", "review": "This was quite a trip!

Just like the reality of the matter, they're not good questions if you're seeking concrete answers, but great ones to expand your thinking.\n+ The storytelling was very well paced, going mixing up the orders of events and eventually bringing them back altogether for the beats and conclusion. Well-placed information across terminals and logs to give you a picture of events at each station.\n+ A good gradient of thematic grayness that'll have everyone reserving their own opinions on the game's presented philosophies. \n+ Environments are incredibly detailed, especially for 2015. A little samey with the visuals, but usually a few new vistas at each checkpoint.\n+ Sound design is superb. Music suits the game very well.\n+ Mostly intriguing characters and converging plot lines. \n+ Puzzles were pretty basic but usually intuitive and give the game a modicum of interactivity; I only had to look up a hint for one of them.\n+ The \"antagonist\" force is both visually well designed and thematically evocative. \n\n\nDID NOT ENJOY:\n- I'm not really sure why this had to be a \"horror\" game, and it often hampered the experience. The horror elements aren't frightening, often just really annoying and maybe slightly nerve-racking. They feel like \"we're the Amnesia devs, so we need to put some monsters in what's essentially a walking sim, I guess.\" The worst example of this is after you find the prototype of the MacGuffin and there is a series of rooms and hallways where you need to find some items to progress. A creature stalks the halls, and the \"gameplay\" is just waiting for his pathing to work out to allow you to where you need to go. The most baffling part is there are audio logs here for environmental storytelling (audiologs you have to be stationary to listen to) and the creature can still chase and kill you... do you want me to listen to the story, or do you want me to run away from Slenderman? Certain horror games use the genre either as a cut and dry upfront scare-fest, or to convey something narratively... this game doesn't really do either. \nYes, there is a \"Safe Mode\" difficulty to avoid this aspect of the game, which makes me wonder why they bothered in the first place.\n\n- The main character seems naive beyond the necessity for a fish out of water character; it takes me out of the story how accepting he is of his mind-bending situation and his agreeability in helping out the other character. He does get better as it goes on, though. \n\n- There is a DoF setting that can't be fully disabled. I was looking up how to disable it, and came across several posters recommending you leave it on for the atmosphere... but I fail to see what they were seeing. Persistent minor annoyance. \n\n- Movement is generally pretty sluggish, which can particularly be annoying when traversing long stretches of nothing or having to flee monsters. Some of the physics objects like panels and valves are really finicky to interact with. Again, notably egregious when you're being chased. \n\n- I don't feel the MacGuffin itself was explored nearly enough. You find out pretty early on in the story about a plain of living different to our own; I would have liked to see them get much further into how the human mind would adapt to this \"reality,\" if it even could at all.\n\n- Interactivity is kept pretty bare to the point I'm not sure this needed to be a game; combat doesn't exist, the puzzles are mostly trivial, navigation is pretty linear, the \"avoid the monster\" sections are mostly just crouch-walking and waiting, and the medium of interacting with the game is not meaningfully utilized to convey the story... Think, a story about artificial existence and personhood... don't you think you could utilize the medium of gaming for some meta narrative? They didn't. SOMA's best aspects could have easily stood as a book or movie in my opinion. At the very least they could have hammered home the themes of free will by having what few \"choices\" you make matter or having more of them, but they never affect the game going forward. \n\n\nOVERALL:\nI enjoyed experiencing SOMA's world, and its greatest strength is obviously its narrative. Unfortunately, I think I would have basically gotten the same effect from watching a video playthrough of the game. I don't think any of its brilliance is lost by watching the game or playing it through in Safe Mode, especially since it omitted the opportunity of player choice which would have been a perfect pairing for this type of game.", "timestamp_created": 1698970263, "timestamp_updated": 1698971025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149403417": {"recommendationid": "149403417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115877047", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 744, "last_played": 1698963090}, "language": "english", "review": "WHERE ARE YOU CATHERINE!!?!", "timestamp_created": 1698963080, "timestamp_updated": 1698963080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149401952": {"recommendationid": "149401952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140978268", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 670, "last_played": 1698960617}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with a compelling story.

SOMA tells a pretty original and thought-provoking story for those familiar with common sci-fi topics, with some very interesting and morally questionable actions for the player to ponder over. Overall I'd give the story an 8/10. The Horror aspect of the game will vary from person to person; I found the setting and overall atmosphere to be fittingly spooky but never quite felt scared at any point. Unfortunately the monster encounters aren't the best.\n\nMy particular gripes with the monster encounters is [spoiler]that they just aren't consequential. In the early game it's easy to just navigate around the few slow moving monsters around, but once you reach the Curie you'll find the first monster puzzle and every new encounter after that is pretty much the same concept. You lure the monster away or wait for their patrol to take them away from you, then navigate the long way around them to reach your objective[/spoiler]. I don't know if it was a bug or not, but it seemed like most of the monsters only reacted to seeing me, hearing me, or seeing my flashlight. Tossing objects around to draw their attention had no effect. In addition to the poor options you have for attracting the monsters' attention, [spoiler]I also found that death and injury were incredibly cheap. On more than one occasion I was killed by a monster, only to try again and find myself getting mauled 3 or 4 times with death seemingly no longer being a consequence. This may be a form of pity and is helpful for just pushing through sections, but the ultimate result was that I just brute forced my way through Tau station with little tact since the worst thing the monster could do to me was distort my sight[/spoiler].

It's alright at what it does,  the first hour of the game kept me on the edge of my seat as I was unaccustomed to the audio cues and where/what was a monster. However this wore off after a while as it gets easier to learn which areas are obviously monster infested and which aren't. Some monsters are honestly quite tame and can be followed behind at a short distance. However I feel SOMA uses horror and Monsters to enrich and add flavour to the other two areas of the game\n\nThe exploration and ambience, being truly alone in the bottom of the sea, surrounded by darkness is depressing and frightening. Approaching a new building comes with a short introduction puzzle, a way to gather some new information about upcoming areas and lore tidbits, the structures look like part of the ocean, covered in barnacles, rust and seaweed they can barely stay functional. Monsters lurk the tight and narrow hallways inside. The open areas started to honestly feel more safer, despite getting deeper, darker and more dangerous as the game goes on.\n The final section of the game [spoiler] where you struggle to see a few metres in front of you is a different story however. I absolutely loved the swap of the buildings became the safe areas between being chased by massive deep sea creatures [/spoiler]. \n\nYou truly feel alone, the only other coherent voice being that of catherine, your pocket pal that can only speak when you upload her to a buildings console, and usually has little empathy or care for anything other than her project: The ARK and how to get you closer to this objective. Others encountered along the way are delirious, confused or vague.\n\nFor the 8 ish hours I played the game I felt so eerily alone, and every quiet moment was spent in my thoughts thinking about the different ideas and questions the game presents and what I think of them. The game gives you a survey about halfway through asking your thoughts on very spoilery questions, and then asks you them again at the very end. I didnt think my mind had changed a whole lot by the end. I'm a pretty stubborn guy, but even I was answering differently than I did about 3 hours ago.\n\nTry not to spoil yourself, get it and revel in the games mysteries and enjoy it!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1698882034, "timestamp_updated": 1698882034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149338712": {"recommendationid": "149338712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062694265", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 676, "last_played": 1698877722}, "language": "spanish", "review": "He quedao' loco.", "timestamp_created": 1698878264, "timestamp_updated": 1698878264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149322950": {"recommendationid": "149322950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104202490", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 768, "last_played": 1698860337}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es uno de los mejores videojuegos que he jugado", "timestamp_created": 1698859928, "timestamp_updated": 1698859928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149302349": {"recommendationid": "149302349", "author": {"steamid": "76561199232944020", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 433, "last_played": 1671459408}, "language": "english", "review": "I still don't understand how can a game can give me existential dread of this magnitude,\n\nKudos to the developers.

[/h1]\n\nEn SOMA, nos ponemos en el piel de Simon Jarrett, un hombre que despierta en unas instalaciones submarinas aparentemente abandonadas llamadas PATHOS-II. A medida que exploras este oscuro entorno, te das cuenta de que algo terrible ha sucedido y que la l\u00ednea entre lo humano y lo mec\u00e1nico es extremadamente delgada.\n\nUno de los aspectos m\u00e1s destacados del juego es su atm\u00f3sfera intensa y claustrof\u00f3bica. Los entornos submarinos, junto con los sonidos caracteristicos de un mundo sumido en la soledad, acompa\u00f1ado de una la iluminaci\u00f3n tenue, contribuyen a una sensaci\u00f3n de constante tensi\u00f3n. El juego utiliza el miedo de manera efectiva, manteni\u00e9ndote activo a medida que te enfrentas a tus propios \"miedos\"\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos de jugabilidad, se centra en la exploraci\u00f3n, la resoluci\u00f3n de acertijos y la evasi\u00f3n de enemigos (A lo Outlast, correr y esconderse). Aunque no es un juego de acci\u00f3n, la necesidad de tomar decisiones y resolver problemas agrega una capa adicional de inmersi\u00f3n a la experiencia.\n\nOtro de los aspectos m\u00e1s destacados, o incluso diria que el mejor de todos; es la filosof\u00eda detr\u00e1s del titulo, ya que plantea la noci\u00f3n de que la vida es algo preciado, incluso cuando se encuentra en formas inusuales o sufrientes. A lo largo del juego, nos vamos a encontrar con seres que luchan por sobrevivir en condiciones inhumanas, y esto, personalmente, te hace cuestionar QU\u00c9 SIGNIFICA REALMENTE \"ESTAR VIVO\", como si nos desafiara a considerar si, incluso en sus formas m\u00e1s extra\u00f1as y dolorosas, la vida merece protecci\u00f3n y compasi\u00f3n. Nos sumerge en dilemas \u00e9ticos profundos y te obliga a reflexionar sobre la compasi\u00f3n, la empat\u00eda y la naturaleza misma de la vida. Estas cuestiones filos\u00f3ficas se entrelazan muy bien con la trama y a\u00f1aden una capa adicional de profundidad y significado a la experiencia, convirtiendo en una obra de arte que no solo asusta, sino que tambi\u00e9n provoca una profunda reflexi\u00f3n.\n\nSOMA es un juego que combina con maestr\u00eda el terror psicol\u00f3gico con una narrativa profunda y provocadora. Su enfoque en cuestiones filos\u00f3ficas y existenciales lo hace destacar entre otros juegos de terror. Si te gustan los juegos que desaf\u00edan tu mente y te hacen reflexionar mientras te asustan, entonces SOMA es una elecci\u00f3n excelente.", "timestamp_created": 1698552860, "timestamp_updated": 1698552860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149097457": {"recommendationid": "149097457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066596582", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 200, "last_played": 1483829437}, "language": "english", "review": "i tried to enjoy it but its generally a boring game", "timestamp_created": 1698551359, "timestamp_updated": 1698551359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.308837532997131348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149095627": {"recommendationid": "149095627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084344870", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 619, "last_played": 1698538824}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth playing if you like sci-fi horror!

If you REALLY enjoy horror games, it could be a great experience. Otherwise, the game's weaknesses become more and more obvious as you advance through the story.  \n\nOthers have said it: it's basically a (rather long) walking simulator with some \"avoid-the-invincible-monster\" moments sprinkled throughout. The story, worldbuilding and overall mood are fantastic, but the monster-escaping segments get extremely tedious around mid-game, due to confusing levels coupled with unfair enemy AI and intense visual distortion when you look at them (although you can turn that off to some extent). The [spoiler] electromagnetic teleporting zombie chasing you through an underwater shipwreck[/spoiler] is very frustrating and will mark the end of my playthrough. \n\nThe other portions of the game give you interesting lore but are essentially devoid of any meaningful game mechanics. You will open doors, interact with computer screens and take/drop objects for no reason. That's about it. \n\nSo it's one of those games I've restarted three times over the years, really wanting to like it! I'm now halfway through, dying to the same monster over and over, and I can't even change to \"Safe mode\" to enjoy the story without restarting the whole thing for a fourth time! That will be it for me, as I've played many horror games (here and on GOG) and I'm getting really tired of these \"unbeatable-monster\" clich\u00e9s. If there were other fun mechanics, or at the very least a basic map to help you through, I might think about enduring this for another 5+ hours for the sake of storytelling.

Unobscured by the whirls of revved-up chainsaws and the flashes of plasma cutters, it can still shine down there, in the quiet and the dark.\n\nFor [i]SOMA[/i], however, it\u2019s not just important to hear what it has to say, but also how it says it. For a true barotraumatic dive into its thematic depths, take a look at the full version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/drugoja/recommended/282140/]this[/url] review, written by the ever-curious [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40848670-Drugoja-In-The-Dreaming/]Drugoja in the Dreaming[/url]. Be warned that it will spoil all there is to spoil, so stick with me if you\u2019ve yet to play the game.\n\n[h3]Love the Body[/h3]\n\n\u201cPlay one Frictional title, and you\u2019ve played them all!\u201d would probably be the adage, if not for [i]SOMA[/i]. As far as mechanical complexity is concerned, it\u2019s as stripped back as Frictional\u2019s ever been, serving as a natural progression and iteration of the team\u2019s formula: take away more and more of the player's ability to outright remove the frights in their path and force them to deal with them without using force. In theory, this creates a feeling of helplessness not found in traditional survival horror and primes the player to engage with what\u2019s on the screen in a different, less rigid, mechanically-minded way. The world becomes this real, unfamiliar place, where interactivity isn\u2019t geared towards stuffing your backpack or blasting away at limbs and heads. Yet, remove one challenge of game development by taking an entirely different approach, and another will present itself\u2014and if there\u2019s something that Frictional didn\u2019t learn from [i]The Dark Descent[/i], then they for sure had a cautionary tale in [i]A Machine for Pigs[/i].\n\nFor one, [i]The Dark Descent[/i] still had enough resource management to be viewed as nothing more than a clockwork interaction between its mechanics if you were so inclined. Tracing back up from and down again into Daniel\u2019s insanity spiral was never explicitly obscured by it, but the game stopped short of blending the two together. There were glimpses of it, but the need for health bars, depletable light sources, and meters to manage prevailed in the end\u2014this is a video game, after all, a [b]survival[/b] horror one, and something tells me Frictional wanted players to look a bit more beyond that.\n\nThe Chinese Room realised this and rid their sequel of tinderboxes and laudanum bottles, but instead of having the player use this newly freed-up attention on something important, they thought a separate window with a thesaurus would do just fine.\n\n[i]SOMA[/i] is a horror game with puzzle elements, in which you attempt to escape a haywire, underwater facility on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Threats lurk about, even if combat is absent. Physical contact between you and these monsters amounts to getting flung across the room and some spooky screen effects should it end fatally. Running, sneaking and puzzling your way out of danger remains the way of getting out of trouble, and an intricate plot backed by heartfelt character drama and eerily genuine voice acting guides you from one setpiece to the next.\n\nIt\u2019s a dance Frictional knows well; one that [i]SOMA[/i] comes so close to perfecting, were it not for the obvious criticism that\u2019s been repeated since the very beginning with games of its ilk\u2014it\u2019s not scary. Rather, it\u2019s frustrating and distracts from what\u2019s more important. Any point at which whatever\u2019s chasing you manages to remove those last few bits from your health bar is an almost pointless, immersion-breaking yank that pulls you out of the game. Indeed, an element solely there to make the video game more like a video game is what works against it the most. How\u2019s that for a doozy?\n\n[h3]Fear the Mind[/h3]\n\nHorror is a bit afraid to entirely remove the fear of death. [i]SOMA[/i] has a Story difficulty, yet it is a band-aid \u201cfix\u201d to a fundamental design issue. If a tangible threat is what was needed, why not make the very environment something to be afraid of? If the goal was having interactions that are more inspired by the story and setting, rather than the mechanics, why undermine it? I\u2019m sure making the airlock an enemy, by giving it the ability to crush you to a pulp should you miss the warnings on the wall to your left, would have done wonders for making players pay attention and interact with their surroundings in a more natural way. The bottom of the ocean is a scary place, period, no sci-fi monsters needed. Almost as scary as the idea of beefing up the HPL Engine is to Frictional, I\u2019d imagine, to a point where that kind of interactivity would be possible without squinting at blurry textures.\n\nBut, even with engine limitations, Frictional\u2019s art and sound direction are exceptional. It is why [i]SOMA\u2019s[/i] rendition of the ocean floor is so inviting to get lost in and explore, even if it\u2019s quite linear and teeters on the edge of falling into the motions of other games like it. But that begs the question: where does [i]SOMA[/i] break the mould?\n\nWithout having to worry about any kind of resource management, you\u2019re free to direct your attention elsewhere. [i]SOMA\u2019s[/i] monster encounters are a necessary evil with the way the game was designed; they suck, but can\u2019t come close to ruining what\u2019s so great about it. The puzzles are still there, of course, but the menial tasks of rerouting the power to the correct junction or finding the proper keycard can\u2019t compare to the puzzle the game\u2019s been built around.\n\n[i]SOMA\u2019s[/i] key themes, the dash of player choice there is, and the very plot are all interwoven with such great care and subtlety that they\u2019d make a seamstress blush. The closer the game got to anything that\u2019d obstruct it, the bigger my lament. In a roundabout way, It goes so far that it makes the lack of combat in [i]The Dark Descent[/i] seem like an oversight. Its narrative aspirations were never as grand, so laying further into traditional survival horror couldn\u2019t have taken much out of it.\n\nThe morality of [i]SOMA[/i] is in the background, ready to creep up on you while your brain works away at the bits it presents. A \"throwaway\" line, a note on the wall, or an inconspicuous press of some button\u2014it\u2019s all towards a carefully constructed threefold message: whether ominous, hopeful, or just another pondering of whether androids dream of electric sheep, depends on you. No dialogue wheel, no alignment system, or distracting inventories; just you, some annoying monsters, movable boxes, and a choice that informs a different kind of fear. \n\nSans those annoying monsters, it\u2019s the otherwise thorough departure from survival horror that allows [i]SOMA[/i] to be filled with substance. All the frights\u2014and everything else the game will make you feel\u2014are in its world and the allegory it serves to paint. The psychological horror they\u2019ve been talking about all these years; something a lot of developers have tried. Many may have succeeded, but a lot more missed what the focus should be and the design decisions at play to sharpen it up.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/]An international group of passionate writers and veteran reviewers, [b]Summit Reviews[/b] aims to deliver ethical, professional, and in-depth critique across Steam and beyond.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1698365578, "timestamp_updated": 1698366182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784426450729370117", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148943746": {"recommendationid": "148943746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198827231760", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1693059788}, "language": "english", "review": "Failed to leave the apartment when i woke up", "timestamp_created": 1698362015, "timestamp_updated": 1698362015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397208482027053833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148942590": {"recommendationid": "148942590", "author": {"steamid": "76561199510684115", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 283, "last_played": 1697857112}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta chido", "timestamp_created": 1698360277, "timestamp_updated": 1698360277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148932433": {"recommendationid": "148932433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396344210", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1006, "last_played": 1698348073}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice old horror game.. somehow remember me of bioshock.

You explorer your environment while stealthy avoiding enemies who are actively looking for you. The graphics are fantastic even for today's standards and voice work is decent. The atmosphere looks like if H.R. Giger and James Cameron had a baby. All and all not a difficult game, my playtime was about 9 hours and only got knocked out by enemies twice. All 10 achievements are tied directly to progression so it leaves little for replay value.

As an experience, though, it is top notch. If you like to play games late at night where you zone out and forget about things, then this one really serves its purpose. Some games you play for the game play, others for the experience. Soma, like games like Amnesia, also developed by Frictional Games, definitely falls in the latter category. \n\nIf you like \"hide and seek\" type game play where you hide from enemies, I can't really say whether it's good or bad since I dislike these types of games. But the hiding and avoiding enemies only makes up around 10-15% of the game, the rest being slow environmental puddles and weird atmospheric storytelling. The game was at first off putting, but as you progress the details of the story make more sense, and the twist at the end is more unexpected since it seems like it's building to something completely different. \n\nThe game at first seems a bit like the movie Total Recall, wherein someone goes in for a brain scan and ends up in a completely different world. But it kind of plays on that, while feeling like a Philip K. Dick story it doesn't really give off that vibe at the end. It reminds me the most of the recently released film by Brandon Chronenberg named \"Infinity Pool.\" In fact I think the twist at the end of this game is better than that movie, which is strange because usually game plots are worse than film plots. But the whole idea is that if you are cloned, are you still yourself? What is actually carrying over as consciousness? They're existential questions and the game does a good job of exploring them precisely because the setting is so desolate. \n\nEven though the undersea atmosphere might feel a bit like Bioshock, the game play is much simpler. There is no combat in this game except for a brief moment where you tase a robot. But the entirety of humanity is dead and the player is trapped at the bottom of the sea. The fact that the humans are all clones in robotic suits makes it more disturbing and eerie. The ocean itself is totally desolate, and since you are playing as a robot, there are many times that you can actually walk on the seafloor, which is quite surreal. The environments are so detailed that it's nice to just wander around and notice things like crabs minding their own business on the seafloor. At the end you descend to the deepest part of the sea, and in one of the most surreal experiences I've had in a game, you have to use little lighted guideposts to navigate the waters while heavy ocean currents obscure your view in the pitch black ocean.\n\nBeyond that, the puzzles, if you want to call them that, aren't really hard, usually the only difficulty is figuring out where to go. There is a puzzle near the middle that's about ten steps long, and while not hard, it does take an hour or two of wandering aimlessly just to figure out what the steps are. The environment in this game is highly interactive. You can pick up just about anything, and the game makes it clear when an object is heavier so you have to drag it, like a ladder for example. Many of the simple puzzles involve manipulating switches and navigating screens. I actually enjoyed these, but I do wish they were a bit more difficult. Particularly near the end because the puzzles in the last sections of the game are barely nothing other than \"pick this up here and put it over there.\"\n\nThe voice work is decent and the music is top notch. It's a highly cinematic experience, and a game that you really play for the experience more than anything else. Once you've completed it there's not really any reason to play it again, but it's such an impactful experience that it's still highly worth playing through one time. Yes it follows the route of a sci-fi cliche, but it does enough with it to make it still feel fresh and new. If it weren't for the obnoxious steal sequences where you die constantly for no reason I would say it's near perfect, but since those sequences are so annoying I am going to say it is a merely decent game but a fantastic overall experience.", "timestamp_created": 1697885112, "timestamp_updated": 1697885112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148590220": {"recommendationid": "148590220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999583690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1697884748}, "language": "english", "review": "Good and scary", "timestamp_created": 1697878533, "timestamp_updated": 1697878533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148589076": {"recommendationid": "148589076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172625719", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1697876856}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a god damn great game.

Released in 2015, the game transcends traditional scare tactics, delving deep into philosophical inquiries, existential dilemmas, and the essence of consciousness. Its thought-provoking narrative and atmospheric design have cemented its position as a standout title in the horror gaming genre.\n\nSet in an underwater research facility plagued by a catastrophic event, \"SOMA\" immerses players in a world brimming with existential dread and moral ambiguity. The game's narrative complexity is a standout feature, challenging players to ponder the nature of identity, consciousness, and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. Through its gripping storyline, \"SOMA\" manages to evoke an emotional resonance that lingers long after the game's conclusion, prompting players to reflect on the fundamental questions that define human existence.\n\nIn addition to its profound narrative, \"SOMA\" excels in creating a hauntingly atmospheric environment. The dilapidated underwater facility, coupled with its unsettling ambient sounds and haunting soundtrack, sets the stage for a deeply immersive and psychologically intense experience. The game masterfully manipulates light, shadow, and sound to evoke a sense of pervasive unease, effectively heightening the emotional impact of its narrative twists and turns.\n\nGameplay-wise, \"SOMA\" strikes a delicate balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative progression. The puzzles are intelligently integrated into the game's environment, complementing the storyline and encouraging players to engage with the philosophical themes embedded within the game. While the emphasis on stealth and evasion may not cater to all players, it effectively contributes to the game's overall tension and suspense, fostering a sense of vulnerability that aligns with the game's overarching themes.\n\nFurthermore, the game's non-combative approach to horror sets it apart from conventional survival horror titles, emphasizing psychological terror over jump scares or gratuitous violence. This intentional departure from typical horror game tropes allows \"SOMA\" to focus on delivering a more cerebral and emotionally resonant experience, appealing to players seeking a deeper, more intellectually engaging form of horror entertainment.\n\nIn summary, \"SOMA\" stands as a groundbreaking achievement in the horror gaming genre, offering a profound narrative experience that challenges players to confront the philosophical underpinnings of human consciousness and identity. With its atmospheric design, thought-provoking themes, and innovative gameplay mechanics, \"SOMA\" solidifies its position as a must-play title for those seeking a truly immersive, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally impactful gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1697510742, "timestamp_updated": 1697510742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148364892": {"recommendationid": "148364892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050925517", "num_games_owned": 988, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 892, "last_played": 1697441144}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing horror game with a very interesting premise.

This is a game that will stick with you for a long time and it will make you question what make you, you. \n\nSoma is a simple game, one all too familiar especially if you've played the amnesia games. You wake up in a strange place with no memories of how you got there, you are defenseless but you can interact with the environment and can manipulate the physics to complete puzzles and explore. There are dangers and your only options are to run or hide, all whilst finding clues as to how you ended up on the underwater base, PATHOS-II.\n\nLike rebirth we have an incredibly chatty protagonist but unlike rebirth a large number of the games best moments come from the morally complex moments Simon finds himself in and the questions he has about his own morality, all the while he contemplates his concerns with the ambiguous Catherine, a companion who's no stranger to the circumstances they are faced with but isn't all she seems.\n\nThis game is absolutely dripping with atmosphere, whilst I possibly have a soft spot for games that take place in underwater bases that doesn't mean soma pulls it punches. The environments are bleak, left desolate not only by the goings on of it's underwater inhabitants but also by the sheer volume of water that weighs down on it. \n\nPuzzles are good, no moon logic required thankfully and enemy encounters whilst a bit annoying on repeat playthroughs (thankfully you can turn them off.) are scary and tense affairs with creatures that look genuinely disgusting and might be frictional games best monster designs yet.\n\nI could go on and on about how incredible this gem of a game is but at the risk of spoilers please just play this game, horror fan or not this bleak tale needs to be experienced by all. Whilst there is always a glimer of hope this game will leave you sleepless with it's powerful thought provoking story. You will question yourself and you might find yourself wondering what is it about yourself that defines you, just don't crazy along the way.\n", "timestamp_created": 1697355224, "timestamp_updated": 1697355224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519774019718170166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148255854": {"recommendationid": "148255854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198889502745", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1696835694}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the first real horror game I played.

I also suck at navigation, and there are few things in SOMA to help you get around.

Instead, it delves into the depths of mental and emotional torment, tackling profound questions about consciousness, existence, and philosophical dilemmas. As I began my journey with SOMA, I anticipated a typical psychological horror experience, but what I discovered was a game that boldly explores the realm of philosophical horror.\n\nWhile SOMA excels in some aspects, it sometimes struggles with its narrative delivery. At its best, it surpasses Frictional's previous work, The Dark Descent, in every way, offering a quintessential haunted house experience. At its weakest, it feels like a series of philosophical conversations you might overhear in a college bar after a screening of \"The Matrix,\" grafted onto a game focused on escaping terrifying creatures and fixing malfunctioning computer systems.\n\nThe writing in SOMA fluctuates between excellent and forced. The game relentlessly fills every quiet moment with reflections on the unfolding events. The protagonist often prompts conversations that feel contrived, as if he's desperate to extract philosophical insights from his harrowing predicament. This overemphasis on philosophical musings occasionally tests the player's patience. However, when SOMA hits its stride, it delivers extraordinary moments that are deeply unsettling.\n\nThe overarching plot of SOMA is nothing short of magnificent. The game conceals far more than its pre-release marketing campaign revealed, including early surprises that would serve as climaxes in other games. While the narrative's delivery, predominantly through text and audio logs, occasionally feels labored, the game boasts moments of sheer brilliance. When SOMA truly embraces its philosophical horror roots, it creates an eerie and mesmerizing atmosphere.\n\nSOMA is undeniably frightening. The grotesque creatures you encounter are nightmarish, shrouded in glitchy obscurity as they draw near. The disconcerting sounds they emit are chilling, enhancing the overall sense of dread. The game's audio design, aside from some out-of-place voice acting, is exemplary.\n\nFurthermore, SOMA offers an exceptionally tactile experience. Frictional Games' titles have always excelled in environmental interactions, and SOMA is their masterpiece in this regard. The way doors and drawers open and close, objects are manipulated, and items are hurled across rooms creates a profound sense of immersion. The physicality of the game world is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nSOMA pays homage to machinery, akin to Alien: Isolation. As you navigate the underwater facility, you'll encounter typical horror game tasks: repairing equipment and finding alternative routes through dilapidated laboratories and power stations. The satisfaction of these interactions contributes to the credibility of the world and ratchets up the tension when pursued by enemies.\n\nHowever, the game's setting, while featuring intricate details, left me somewhat underwhelmed. While interior locations are well-constructed and feature clever deviations from the typical sci-fi facility design, the underwater sections felt like a chore. The initial awe quickly gave way to a desire to return to the more engaging interior environments. Additionally, the visual and mechanical similarity between the machine intelligence and other horrors in horror media felt uninspired.\n\nSOMA undoubtedly stands as Frictional's most accomplished game to date. While it occasionally feels like listening to a friend who can't stop dissecting the philosophical implications of a horror film, the game effectively blends traditional first-person horror with thought-provoking themes. It managed to instill fear and provoke contemplation, yet it might not linger in my memory as long as some of my favorite horror games. Nevertheless, SOMA's sound design, immersive world, and moments of sheer terror make it a must-play for horror aficionados with a pull towards the philosophical.", "timestamp_created": 1696793580, "timestamp_updated": 1696793580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624714195728302002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147859913": {"recommendationid": "147859913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198444130470", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 738, "last_played": 1698702590}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cThe black blood in my veins will save me!

The game is absolutely fantastic in most aspects: visuals, sound, setting, atmosphere, art style, sound, acting, story (especially this one) etc etc, but it sort of struggles with the horror at least gameplay wise for me.\n\nThe enemies themselves are pretty neat in their design, well some are way better than others when it comes to being scary at least, but they are all absolutely fantastic when it comes to how they sound at least which may be enough for some. It has basically the same kind of fail state as Rebirth and perhaps slightly more forgiving than that one (the system itself is a neat idea but I do not think it works as well as it should), and I find that it kind of ruins the tension for me. This, and other reasons that I find hard to put into words, caused enemies to become just annoying obstacles instead of terrifying pursuers even at my first encounter and caused me to not even try to get away if I found it would take longer than just getting caught. \n\nThe absolute scariest thing to me was just that it was really deep underwater and I have kind of a fear for the sea, but I do not think this was completely intended to be thie scariest thing in game (outside of the story). Sure there was indeed one underwater sequence in particular that made me feel kind off ill to my stomach with fear which I gotta hand to the devs: amazing job there at least lol. For me all the water stuff also managed it to feel way scarier than Rebirth (and also alot of other horror games, Frictionals included), but that may vary alot depending on how you handle that stuff. Though I have to give them that they at least kept the monsters more varied and less scripted feeling than Rebirth imo.\n\n*And yes, I know that there are \"story mode\" difficulties which removes enemies, or at least death, for both Rebirth and this one, so yeah could have played that if I like the story that much. But having no threat at all would probably ruin the experience more for me so yeah*\n\nBut the biggest reason the enemies were so annoying to me was because of how they got in the way of me learning more about this incredible story (and not in a fun way which being scared would have like the underwater stuff), which is also pretty much the most horrifying thing in the game. It tackles some really big questions and some very heavy themes in such a fantastic way and I loved everything about it and how it kept asking me to come up with my own answers for these questions. I went in \"completely\" blind (basically only knowing it is under water and something something robots). The turns it took were very intriguing and it went in directions I was not really expecting. It also got pretty emotional at times and truly heartbreaking, especially towards the end, which I did not at all expect when starting the game and it really made me feel awful about a lot of stuff that happened (which I think is lovely lol). The story is truly a masterpiece and definitely the best they have written so far.\n\nI find it a bit funny and interesting how two of the best stories I have ever experienced in a game have both come from Frictional and at the cost of the horror part not being that great (well, The Chinese Room is true for AMFP but ya know what I mean). Was not expecting much more beyond great horror when going through their games, but I am more than pleasantly surprised!

That being said, i still think this is a must play for anyone who enjoys atmospheric and tense games.", "timestamp_created": 1696352756, "timestamp_updated": 1696352756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147548079": {"recommendationid": "147548079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040174690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1573187034}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish I played this game before I watched a play-through of it.

Frictional Games has crafted a true work of art that not only terrifies but also challenges the very essence of human existence.\n\nAt its core, \"SOMA\" is a cerebral experience, taking players on a profound exploration of consciousness, identity, and the nature of humanity itself. The game's narrative is a tour de force, weaving a complex and thought-provoking story that stays with you long after the credits roll. It doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or gratuitous gore; instead, it presents a creeping, atmospheric dread that seeps into your psyche, leaving you with a lingering sense of existential unease.\n\nThe underwater world of PATHOS-II serves as the perfect setting for this cosmic horror tale. The dilapidated, decaying environments are meticulously detailed and utterly immersive. The juxtaposition of the eerie silence of the deep sea with the clanking machinery and eerie sounds of malfunctioning technology creates an atmosphere that is both unnerving and captivating.\n\nGameplay in \"SOMA\" strikes an ideal balance between puzzle-solving and survival horror elements. The scarcity of resources and the presence of relentless, nightmarish foes keep you on your toes without feeling overwhelmingly punishing. The puzzles are intelligently designed, serving as integral components of the narrative rather than mere obstacles.\n\nOne of the game's standout features is its impeccable voice acting and dialogue. The characters, particularly the protagonist, Simon Jarrett, are portrayed with depth and nuance. As players, we're drawn into their struggles and existential dilemmas, forming a deep emotional connection that enhances the overall impact of the story.\n\nThe philosophical questions raised throughout \"SOMA\" are nothing short of mind-boggling. The game invites players to ponder the nature of consciousness, the ethical implications of artificial intelligence, and the boundaries of human identity. It's a rare and welcome treat to find a horror game that challenges your intellect as much as it terrifies your soul.\n\nIn conclusion, \"SOMA\" is a triumph in both horror gaming and storytelling. Its cerebral, thought-provoking narrative, coupled with its eerie atmosphere and intelligent gameplay, make it a must-play for fans of the genre and anyone seeking a truly unforgettable gaming experience.

The game touches on themes of existentialism, what it means to be human, and whether continuing our consciousness through A.I. is stripping us of humanity or preserving it. You can learn even more of the story and lore by exploring and discovering environmental details, such as journal entries and data logs, to paint a fuller picture of what these people went through in their final days.

This was very poor implementation by the developers - these instances should have at least involved the character monologuing to let the player know they need to figure out their route, or give them an idea of where to go when there's a chase sequence, etc. otherwise you just set them up to be infuriated by a death they couldn't have possibly predicted. \n* You have no way of fighting the monsters you encounter - some of the larger ones that are several times larger than yourself makes sense, but the ones that are about your size (which is the majority of them), it is absolutely nonsensical (and infuriating) that you can't pick up a blunt object and beat the ever living crap out of them - literally all you can do is try to run and hide which is impossible in certain sections as they'll coach you to hide in the dark and then even if you're crouched and moving slow the monster will, in many instances, still come right to you. \n* Absolutely detested the ending - I won't spoil anything but I thought it was a poor payoff for all the time invested. \n\nPros:\n\n* Solid graphics & good physics engine. \n* They do an excellent job creating a creepy environment. \n* Excellent sound effects to add to the creepy environment. \n* Interesting story to follow that keeps you engaged throughout the majority of the game. \n\nGame Length: ~12-15 hours\n\nFinal Rating: 5/10 - Not recommended.

It's full of philosophical quandaries regarding life, consciousness and existence. If you like these topics and have any critical thought at all, this game will have you reeling for days, possibly longer. I recommend exploring as much as possible (or as much as the monsters allow) so you can immerse yourself in the rich lore and backstory. There is so much to find that has nothing to do with the mandatory objective. The levels are very open, detailed and you can pick up and manipulate just about everything in them that's of a size a human could lift and handle (note: sometimes this can be confusing as to what is useful and what isn't, but you'll start to pick up on what is relevant and what is not -- they tend to 'shimmer' when you look at something relevant). There is very little guidance. I recommend foregoing guides as much as possible and try to figure everything out on your own. When I closed the guidance, I was much more immersed and also surprised at the scares. \n\nIt's very easy to lose yourself in this title. The game is aging at this point, but still is beautiful and well-designed. One of the upsides of an older game is that any decent-spec'd modern machine should be able to render this in 1080p or higher with the graphic settings maxed, while still achieving a very playable FPS. I recommend turning all the settings up unless you have a really old or really low-spec machine. I played most of the game on a 2018 Precision laptop with a 4GB GPU and it still got 60+ FPS on maxed settings.  \n\nConclusion: 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Easily one of the best and most unique titles out there. This game is for anyone who is a fan of story-rich, first person sci-fi games that don't involve shooting guns and killing aliens.

The developers have created a truly dark and oppressive atmosphere in the abandoned underwater complex. The sense of danger lurking around every corner leaves your nerves tightened like strings.\n\nExcellent sound design and intricately detailed locations fully immerse you into this nightmare. The game expertly balances action and exploration, never letting you relax for a minute. The puzzles are clever and seamlessly woven into the narrative.\n\nBut the most important part of SOMA is its philosophical component. The themes of transhumanism, consciousness transfer, and human nature make you think about things many people try not to ponder. The existential horror of the game penetrates deep into your mind.\n\nSOMA is a masterpiece of psychological horror that will stick with you long after the credits roll. I will finish my review with a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche that perfectly captures the main idea of the game:\n\"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\"\n\nAnd also from myself, Thomas Rendes:\n\"In our pursuit of immortality, we risk losing what makes us human.

The environment was what made me first fall in love with the game, the derelict post apocalyptic seascape of a world hooked up to a warped AI trying to sustain the dying embers of humanity. The atmosphere and world-building in this game is phenomenal to boot. But what sealed the deal and made this game one of my top favorites is easily the immensely profound story (how well the themes of identity is discussed) and the superb characters. By the end of the game, you can feel deeply for these characters for how well fleshed out they were (due to how well their VAs have brought them to life), even those you don't meet in person. The game makes you feel like you've been on this crazy journey from start to finish with a wonderful companion with endearingly human flaws by your side. Its ending has also been one of the most cathartic experiences I've ever felt in a game. Would I recommend playing this game?

From its gripping narrative to its atmospheric world-building and thought-provoking themes, Soma is an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming.\n\nOne of the standout features of Soma is its profound exploration of existentialism. The game skillfully delves into the philosophical questions surrounding identity, consciousness, and the essence of self. As players navigate through the eerie underwater facility of PATHOS-II, they are confronted with choices and dilemmas that force them to grapple with the very essence of what it means to be human. Soma doesn't just pose these questions; it immerses players in them, creating an existential journey that leaves a lasting impact.\n\nThe game's narrative is a triumph of storytelling. From the moment you step into the shoes of Simon Jarrett, the protagonist, you're thrust into a world that is as mysterious as it is captivating. The narrative slowly unravels, revealing layers of complexity and moral ambiguity that keep you engaged from start to finish. It's a testament to the game's writing and direction that it manages to maintain an atmosphere of tension and dread while simultaneously encouraging players to reflect on profound philosophical themes.\n\nThe unknown looms large in Soma, and it's this element that makes the game truly unforgettable. As you explore the dark, claustrophobic corridors of PATHOS-II, you'll encounter bizarre and enigmatic creatures that challenge your understanding of reality. The game keeps you on edge, constantly questioning what is real and what is a product of your character's deteriorating mental state. The sense of existential dread and the fear of the unknown are palpable throughout, creating an atmosphere that is both unsettling and utterly compelling.\n\nVisually, Soma is a work of art. The underwater setting is beautifully realized, with every detail meticulously crafted to immerse you in its hauntingly atmospheric world. The use of lighting and sound design is nothing short of masterful, enhancing the sense of unease and wonder as you venture deeper into the abyss.\n\nSoma is a groundbreaking gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of what video games can achieve in terms of storytelling and thematic exploration. It challenges players to confront the fundamental questions of existence and the mysteries of the unknown, all within the framework of a gripping and haunting narrative. If you're looking for a game that will leave you pondering the nature of consciousness and the depths of the human psyche long after the credits roll, Soma is an absolute must-play. It's a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and a shining example of how video games can be a medium for profound philosophical exploration.", "timestamp_created": 1694533841, "timestamp_updated": 1694533952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146172183": {"recommendationid": "146172183", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980403464", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1035, "last_played": 1694529332}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this at night with headphones on.

They created a horror masterpiece that exceeded sales expectations and launched the careers of some of the biggest names on Youtube. How do you top that? How do you create a game that not only pulls in the same audience, but redefines an entire genre? The answer is you can't, and Frictional Games knew that. Instead of trying to capture lightning in a bottle, they decided to create a horror game that is unrivaled by anything else to date.\n\nSOMA is a game that takes horror to a different level. Instead of being Lovecraftian, SOMA goes with a sci-fi horror theme. In place of Gatherers you have various creatures that resemble machine monstrosities. Instead of a castle, you're cast into the deep blue and are forced to figured out what's going on. The dark corners of Brennenburg Castle are instead replaced by the wet, moldy halls of PATHOS-II.\n\nNow the big question is did SOMA achieve the same heights as The Dark Descent? It depends on your perspective. From a purely traditional horror view, no, it did not. SOMA lessened the scares dramatically in favor of atmosphere. SOMA oozes atmosphere the first moment you step onto PATHOS-II. The lighting, sound design, and layout makes PATHOS-II feel like a real underwater facility, and the emptiness of it all adds to it. SOMA relies less on jumpscares and instead wants to immerse the player in an oppressive atmosphere where anything at any moment could result in doom.\n\nSo while SOMA is not as scary in the traditional sense, SOMA does excel at one thing and that is the story. SOMA's story is unlike else anything in horror games, or games in general. SOMA is a mirror. It is a mirror you gaze into and it stares right back at you until you feel absolute fear encasing your body. It is a game every person needs to play, especially in this day and age as technology continues to advance at levels we cannot comprehend. SOMA's story is Frictional Games' best story, period. Nothing can ever top what they managed to do with SOMA's story. It brings a whole new dimension to horror, and it is best you experience it on your own. \n\nNow does that mean the game lacks scares? Not at all, in fact some of the encounters are quite terrifying. Even in moments of stillness, SOMA does find a way to make you feel insecure, and make you scared of what could be lurking around the corner. Environmental story telling goes a long way, and SOMA's environment tells a very petrifying story, that feels real and reflective.\n\nI wish I could say more about the game, but that would spoil the experience. The experience is best seen blind. Going into it without any knowledge is needed to get the biggest impact. When the credits rolled, I had to sit there and listen to the eerie song play as I reflected on all the questions SOMA asked me. Questions that I never thought I would be asked, and questions that made me think for days.\n\nSOMA was not a commercial success for Frictional Games, and it is extremely unfortunate, because I think SOMA did manage to achieve the impossible: Make a game that is even better than Amnesia: The Dark Descent. While it was not as scary, its story, location, acting, and environment made it a journey that is completely unforgettable. But most importantly, its themes and the questions it asks you will stick with you for days or weeks, or in some cases, the rest of your life. SOMA is a horror game, just not in the way you are expecting but when it does show its unique take on horror, it is more terrifying than anything The Dark Descent presented.\n\nDo yourself a favor and take the journey into PATHOS-II, and give Frictional Games the props they deserve for delivering a masterpiece. It is very rare for a horror game to strike fear into your heart, but Frictional Games pulled it off, and it is something you need to experience and reflect on. After all, SOMA is a mirror, and you should be terrified of what that mirror shows.", "timestamp_created": 1693169077, "timestamp_updated": 1693169077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145141722": {"recommendationid": "145141722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987904820", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 515, "last_played": 1555681384}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Probablemente sea un juego bueno, pero a m\u00ed no me ha gustado.

A rare horror game that keeps you terrified for its entire duration. Through incredible sound and environment design, as well as brilliant use of its various monster designs, the game never allows you to get comfortable. It is always upsetting. Furthermore it is wrapped up in one of the most existentially thought provoking and horrifying narratives conceived. I am a film guy, its my favorite medium, but SOMA may have highhandedly convinced me that video games are the best medium for the horror genre. I only have two real flaws with it. First, the underwater walking sections in the beginning are tedious, however this changes near the end during one of the most intense segments of the entire experience.

A \u201chide, or run away from unkillable monsters\u201d type of true horror game very much like Amnesia, Alien Isolation and Penumbra. But with an interesting existential sci-fi take. However, the game\u2019s pacing is all over the place. The beginning is very confusing. You are Simon Jarett, a Torontonian who for the past few weeks has been recovering from a severe car accident that claimed the life of his girlfriend and left him brain damaged. You begin the game in his apartment, scheduled for a brain scan conducted by two scientists holed up with their equipment in a construction site, probably to avoid reporting to the government which would impede their pace of research. They are experimenting on a new type of diagnostic method wherein they build a 3D model of a person\u2019s brain obtained by a scan, to then safely go ahead and run all kinds of treatment simulations on the computer model before settling for the best one and then only applying it on the real brain, thereby minimizing damage to the real organ. But right after the scan, you suddenly wake up somewhere else. In a derelict base. You don\u2019t know if the two scientists (of who only one was present during your appointment) have pulled a prank on you or not but it is getting scarier by the minute and you have to find a way out. Back to Toronto. Well, good luck chasing that past life\u2026\n\nThe first few hours of the game are scary, disorienting, and you quickly find yourself having to evade mechanical monsters without even an inkling of where you are and whats going on. Maybe that was part of intentional game design, to cast you headlong into the new sci-fi dystopia? After that though, exposition begins to take form as you come across computer logs and audio flashbacks you can \u201caccess\u201d by standing near corpses to witness tidbits of conversation from their final hours (not because of any superpowers, but because people have blackbox chips implanted into them), and finally a friendly voice that you try to meet up with. The research base in the game is divided into separate sectors very much like Doom 3. You begin in a hub called Upsilon, responsible for geothermal energy that powers the base. The voice you hear over the intercom tells you she is holed up in Lambda, and you need to take a train to get there. Sound familiar? Bioshock 2 had this train system too. \n\nA lot of the horror is lost and the mood suddenly changes when you come across machines that are\u2026 friendly. And disoriented. You feel sorry for them, because of who they think they still are. At least, you don\u2019t feel so alone anymore like you did in the initial hour or two of gameplay. \n\nAs you explore more of the base you learn that it is part of an underwater research complex called Pathos II officially tasked with studying marine biology but secretly building a space gun that could launch stuff from the bottom of the ocean into space using some kind of accelerator tube, and you find out this complex housed some 60 or so researchers who ended up being the only ones to survive an apocalyptic comet strike that made earth's surface utterly uninhabitable. Like waay worse than Last of Us or Fallout type of uninhabitable. So with extinction imminent, what is the last words you would normally say to a friend? \u201cSee you on the other side.\u201d What if waking up on the other side were a real possibility rather than wishful thinking? And considering resources will eventually run out even in a base deep in the ocean that survived the initial impact, and considering repopulating earth is out of the question due to the level of devastation and small gene pool of survivors, one of the scientists, Catherine Chun, had the bright idea to scan people's minds, insert the virtual copies into a solar powered vessel called the ark and shoot it into space using the space gun, where they would live out eternity in a virtual reality simulation.\n\nWhile youre busy wrapping your head around this, more moral quandries arise around the concept of digitizing something. For instance, these days when moving data over, we know two ways of doing it: ctrl+c to copy or ctrl+x to cut. This dilemma also persists in 2104. With cutting implying the deletion of the data at its place of origin. If you know what I mean. Mark Sarang is the most famous example of someone who thinks this way. He believes the only guarantee of consciousness transferring over to the digital side, is by terminating the being that it was copied from, at the moment of copying. Otherwise all you would do is create a duplicate \u2013 a new you that isnt the real you. But if the real you ceases to exist at the moment of transfer, there would only be this one you left from this moment on, hence, the only real you left in the universe. He manages to convince Robin Bass and a few others of this continuity belief system, and they follow his example until the ARK program is put on hold to prevent further crew member suicides.\n\nOver the course of the game, you end up having to face the consequences of not listening to Mark Sarang: duplication. The first one could be avoided because the original expired rather quickly and technology wasnt advanced enough to put the scan into use without many decades passing. The second time however, is when you have to make choices. The third time however...when there is no choice to be made...well...keeps you up at night thinking who is real.\n\nI guess Futility is the game's main theme. Simon\u2019s brain scan is futile \u2013 it doesn\u2019t help him and he only lives on for 1 more month. Simon 2\u2019s journey from Upsilon to Omicron is futile \u2013 with the DUNBAT gone & no other Haimatsu Power suit available, he never reaches the Ark in Tau & is left behind in Omicron. And Simon 3, while launching the ark into space, gets left behind in Phi. But was really everything futile? Simon 1\u2019s brain scan allowed one sane entity to awaken in Pathos 2 and save Catherine 2. Catherine 1\u2019s brain scan allowed Catherine 2 to stop Simon 2 from going insane & give his new life purpose, which was putting Simon 3 into the power suit. And Simon 3 launched the Ark into space, giving those in the sim hundreds, if not thousands more years.\n\nOf course, whatever interest you pick up in the story is quickly drowned by having to evade monster, after monster, after monster. See those fancy terminals during midgame? Cant read what they say cause there's a monster patroling nearby and reading from a computer screen happens in real time so the game isnt frozen and those footsteps are getting louder... It really gets frustrating and annoying after a while. And desensitizes you to the horror genre because there's just so many of them. That's the horrid third quarter of the game. Where your new friend Catherine is once again in your pocket and you have nobody to talk to, just a \"get to that part of the facility next\" sort of vague general instruction but of course, you dont know where youre headed and the halls are increasingly darker and gorier. It gets so bad that I found myself looking up the Soma Walkthrough because I didnt know what to do next. Not talking about the puzzle parts in safe areas mind you, they are very easy, but sometimes things like having to update the security clearance on an ID card to access an elevator, or having to remove a high voltage safety panel to access the circuitry inside. Things that are hidden in plain sight. Near monsters. Ugh. And run (without the possibility of reaching a safe spot like holing up in a locker or something) like a headless chicken until you get whacked and have to limp to the nearest single-use healing mollusc, or hide among blood and corpses waiting for misshapen monsters to disgustingly shuffle past.

It's... disjointed at best, indecipherable at worst. Simon, the main character, is very interesting at the beginning, and the game does a good job to make me care about him. But then very quickly, it makes me NOT care about him, and makes me feel very disconnected from the character at the beginning {spoiler footnote 1}.\n\nThe character motivations also feel very weak, and when they're not, they're all over the place. The best example of this is Catherine. {spoiler footnote 2} She just feels like she exists to give Simon someone to bounce off of and dump halfhearted philosophy onto.\n\nThe villain of the game {spoiler footnote 3} is also basically a non-threat the entire time. Sure, it makes \"scary\" monsters that chase you around, but nothing more. The creatures aren't even that scary, either. Most of the gameplay for dealing with any of them is \"don't get too close\" and \"just hide in a corner.\" I streamed this game for my fiance, and he had the liberty of seeing me quite literally just stand in a corner for five minutes while waiting for a monster in the same room to eventually leave me alone. I wasn't hiding, either -- just standing about six-ish feet away from the monster, and staring into a corner in a wide open room. It eventually just got bored and left, I guess. Really killed the action of trying to escape it, honestly.\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point. Overall, I found SOMA to be lacking in story, writing, character development, and gameplay. I've certainly played worse, but I think $30 for this is a bit ridiculous. 3/10.\n\nHere be spoiler footnotes\n\n1. [spoiler] When it's revealed that the original Simon died, and that this is the brainscan taken of him shoved into a robot, I felt like nothing really mattered anymore anyway. If [i]this[/i] Simon died, what's to stop Catherine from just making a new Simon? She already does it TWICE in the game anyway. [/spoiler]\n\n2. [spoiler] Catherine wants to launch the ARK into space to save humanity's legacy. Or... to help humanity live on, as the ARK can apparently only get energy from solar panels (to say nothing of the giant geothermal power plant nearby that can quote \"generate enough power until the next Apocalypse\".) Or... or in hopes the ARK is found by aliens and they do... sooooomething with the brainscans? That last one would be interesting, if it was even mentioned at all in the game. It feels as though the reason the ARK needs to be launched into space is constantly changing. A data buffer of Catherine's at one point has her say something about the ARK being a \"terrarium that will die in a few decades\" if it's left on Earth, but a \"new era for mankind\" if it's launched into space. This is never expounded upon. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Honestly, Catherine is just a really poorly written character in my opinion. It feels like she just exists to give the player a goal -- to get the ARK into space, and that's it. Honestly, she could have been a lot of fun if they really worked with the whole \"she is manipulating Simon into launching the ARK into space no matter what, even though she knows there's a chance they won't be the copies to make it onto it\" angle. But no, Simon is made out to be the bad guy in the end for yelling at her. You know, after she [i] didn't explain how the brainscans work.[/i] [/spoiler]\n\n3. [spoiler] The WAU. Honestly, I felt like it could have been a better villain, especially if they had worked with the whole \"it's just a machine -- it's just a logical cancer\" angle more. It could have been, like, a corrupted HAL -- smart and cunning -- but instead it was basically a corrupted 3D monster printer. It had no mind of its own, and just existed to have Scary Monsters all over the place.

Also makes you question existence itself as a bonus.\n\nMust say that I really don't have anything to complain about, except that it was an almost too spooky experience for me personally. :P\n\nGo experience it yourself!\n\n[h1]10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1691629267, "timestamp_updated": 1691629348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143750345": {"recommendationid": "143750345", "author": {"steamid": "76561199445389682", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1448, "last_played": 1687230080}, "language": "english", "review": "Fav game", "timestamp_created": 1691627958, "timestamp_updated": 1691627958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143747207": {"recommendationid": "143747207", "author": {"steamid": "76561199495903976", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 696, "last_played": 1691618855}, "language": "english", "review": "having an existential crisis <3", "timestamp_created": 1691622941, "timestamp_updated": 1691622941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143740638": {"recommendationid": "143740638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960613035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 772, "last_played": 1691614210}, "language": "english", "review": "Make this a going to cinema experience to get the full sensation of this game!", "timestamp_created": 1691614517, "timestamp_updated": 1691614517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143737247": {"recommendationid": "143737247", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987171594", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1014, "last_played": 1691708845}, "language": "english", "review": "\u00c1n dj\u00f3ks,  ef \u00fe\u00fa hefur ekki spila\u00f0 \u00feennan leik \u00e6ttiru a\u00f0 spila hann (og kl\u00e1ra hann).

The subject is something you can get extremely philosophical with, It\u2019s just generally thought provoking and I am into anything thought provoking!\n\nSince I started with what the story is about, I will talk more about it next, It\u2019s one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had with any video game story, It uses all the elements needed and then some to make you crave more of it\u2026 It\u2019s just generally well written and you can not find anything wrong with it (except one weird little, And I mean extremely little hiccup which you wouldn\u2019t even notice if you\u2019re not that much of a realist), It\u2019s paced well and you don\u2019t get bored and also it has times when stuff you discover just click and make the plot make more sense, the game knows how to progressively give you information and paint a bigger picture. The game has a lot of the story written down for you to discover and read, Albeit not as much of a core mechanic since the game is linear in terms of gameplay and not much of a \u201cexplore and find\u201d type, It\u2019s more of a addition to what you experience throughout the game, More of those satisfying clicks.\n\nThe gameplay, as I mentioned earlier it\u2019s linear, Also it\u2019s a walking simulator, You\u2019re not gonna start 360 no scoping monsters out of nowhere since there are no weapons here, It\u2019s a stealth oriented horror game that encourages you to run and hide, peek around corners and all in all take it slow and enjoy the \u201cscenery\u201d. It\u2019s no cheap horror game either, it doesn\u2019t rely on cheap jump scares to make you punch the screen, Instead it gives you a heart attack. It actually scares you on a instinctive level like how you would react if you were actually in that scenario, I was TERRIFIED while playing this game, Also quick thing to point out, After playing Dead space (2008) I realized how much I hated horror, SOMA was especially hard to play for me since the fear was so real, I took a 2-3 day off after playing the first like 1/8 of the game, I am not exaggerating.\n\nRemember the \u201cscenery\u201d I mentioned earlier? You\u2019ll either love it, or love it in a hateful manner since it\u2019s so scary, It\u2019s so well designed and well executed that I have no way to describe it other than perfect, You WILL inch through it and you WILL take it all in. No way for you to not look at anything, Unless you have balls of titanium or something. The atmosphere is so good that you will constantly feel like you\u2019re being watched, Again that\u2019s not really a good thing in real life but for a game to manage that is not that easy, The sound design is nothing short of perfect either.\n\nListen, there\u2019s a reason this game is \u201cOverwhelmingly Positive\u201d in steam reviews, These don\u2019t just appear out of thin air, There\u2019s a whole game to back those up so just do yourself a favor and play it.

What does it mean to be human? How much the idea of myself depends on where I am? [spoiler]- interesting quote from Simon -[/spoiler].

Horror games, in my opinion, don't usually have a good story (if they even have one at all). Soma is an absolute gem and brilliantly written. After doing some research on the game, it seems that a lot of players (myself included) get hung up on the whole \"transfer\" thing. There is no transfer. It's impossible to transfer your consciousness because consciousness relies on the very thing that gives rise to it (in our case, a biological brain). Our consciousness cannot exist separately from the brain. That's like saying that a fire can exist without the fuel that sustains it. So you see, Simon's mind was never transferred in the first place, but merely copied. Essentially, there are four different Simons, one dead and three existing at the same time (if you chose to spare the Simon at Omicron). They only think they're the continuation of the original because from the perspective of the new copy, they did carry over, while from the perspective of the old copy, they're still \"stuck\" in their original body. So the last three think they're the original Simon, but in truth, all four Simons are four different people. Back at site Theta, you missed an audio log in Sarang's room that explains this concept. You can have multiple copies of the same being existing at once, but the copies eventually become different people because of \"divergence\", meaning that their minds change due to their unique experiences as time goes on (in Neuroscience, that's called neuroplasticity and it's the reason why identical twins have unique personalities despite having identical DNA). Essentially though, you got it at the very end. It's confusing in a way because the multiple copies of Simon kept thinking that they were going to get transferred when that was never a possibility to begin with. I'm glad you gave Soma a chance Hollow. It's a fucking fantastic game and one hell of a ride. It was enjoyable seeing you go through those \"ah-ha!\" moments.

Drawing on the complexities of transhumanism and delving into the very essence of what defines us as individuals, the game poses profound philosophical questions about what it means to be human. No other game has left such a profound impact on me, resonating with existential ponderings that continue to linger long after the credits roll.\n\nAs I eagerly await Frictional's next offering, I can't help but wish for more attention to be given to SOMA. While Amnesia receives content updates, it's disheartening to see SOMA seemingly overlooked. Nevertheless, I hold onto hope, knowing that Frictional's talent for crafting immersive experiences will likely lead to something extraordinary.\n\nIn conclusion, SOMA is an unforgettable journey into the depths of our humanity, and it stands as a testament to the power of gaming as an art form.

What is there to say, if space horror games in general can be counted on the fingers, and after all, the uncharted underwater depths are not much different from what is stored in space. But underwater can be much scarier, because it is the same space, only around you are not twinkling stars, lighting the way. No, there is only cold and darkness around, literally within a meter radius the light of a flashlight does not penetrate through the water column. But it lures the eyes. It lures those monsters that can see in the dark, whose silhouettes glide beside you, inspecting and studying you until they finally get hungry....\n\nTrust me, it's not just a horror game, it's more than that. Soma is unique in its kind and you will hardly meet a game that can be similar to it. The main feature, from which the developers tried to squeeze out the maximum is described above - the seabed, where you have to wander in complete solitude to go from one red fire to another, hoping that you will not be swallowed by the darkness, that what lives there, will not wake up, will not hear you. Running from one complex to another, you will hope that this will be the last one, because even with what lives in the stations, it is much more comfortable than under the open sea sky.\n\nEven if you don't like water, don't like horrors - try it, this game will give you new emotions and will diversify some evenings, and maybe even make you think, because the plot there can please you.", "timestamp_created": 1690581496, "timestamp_updated": 1690581496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142978614": {"recommendationid": "142978614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990529953", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1690576554}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely fantastic experience in both story and gameplay!

This is the highest quality horror experience I've ever had.\n\nIt is a beautifully written horror game that doesn't overly rely on old cliches and chase sequences. SOMA is a story-driven horror of the experience game. Immersing yourself into the story is not hard, but the game does not hold your hand either. The writing for this game is among the best I've ever witnessed. The voice actors also put up a great performance with it. The characters are believable. I feel immensely strong emotions about them.\n\nSOMA' job isn't to make you terrified the whole time you play the game, nor does it provide strong gameplay. SOMA does have you running and hiding from monsters, solving puzzles, and uncovering mysteries. SOMA is not a game intended for all audiences. The gameplay compared to other horror games, especially actions horror games, might leave certain players bored. If you are someone who craves strong stories, psychological horror, moral dilemmas, and emotional experiences, this game is made for you.\n\nThe monster A.I. does it's job for the most part. It's nothing to write home about. I'd like to have seen some improvements, but honestly, monsters aren't the focus of this game. SOMA plays to other strengths, and it's better off for it in the long run as a game. That doesn't mean the monster A.I. couldn't be a little better to keep immersion up, but it doesn't detract much from the experience. SOMA also ditches resource management which heavily plays to it's strength in my opinion.\n\nThis game is an experience I will never forget and has forever changed my perspective on horror games.

Simon, dealing with a tragic accident in his own life, wakes up in this mysterious facility to discover that the world around him has drastically changed.\n\nAs Simon explores the depths of PATHOS-II, he encounters grotesque humanoid machines and must evade them to survive. However, the true horror lies in the philosophical questions raised by the narrative. Simon discovers that the facility's experiments in transhumanism have resulted in the creation of digital copies of human consciousness. These copies, known as \"simulations,\" harbor the memories and identities of the original humans but are trapped in a nightmarish existence.\n\nDriven by a desire to understand his own circumstances and find a way out, Simon navigates the dilapidated corridors of PATHOS-II and encounters other survivors who are also grappling with their own existential crises. The game delves into profound themes of identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human.\n\nThroughout the journey, players are forced to confront unsettling philosophical dilemmas as they make choices that challenge the boundaries of morality. The story reaches its climax as Simon confronts the unsettling truth of his own existence and must make a choice that could have far-reaching consequences for himself and the digital consciousness trapped within PATHOS-II.\n\nSOMA's plot leaves players questioning their own perception of reality and the nature of humanity, presenting a haunting narrative that lingers in the mind long after the game is finished.\n\nPrepare to be immersed in a bone-chilling odyssey that explores the darkest corners of horror, philosophy, and the enigmatic nature of humanity. Frictional Games' SOMA unleashes a terrifying experience that will haunt your thoughts long after the game has ended.\n\nFrom the moment you step into SOMA's grim world, you'll be entranced by its eerie and macabre visuals. While the graphics could have been more refined, they effectively transport you into a realm teeming with desolate environments, where abandoned structures loom ominously, and bioluminescent sea creatures lurk in the depths. And then there are the horrifying humanoid machines, twisted creations that will send shivers down your spine with their grotesque presence.\n\nBut it's the plot of SOMA that truly sets it apart, plunging you into a maelstrom of existential dread. Transhumanism, consciousness, and the very essence of identity intertwine, weaving a narrative that relentlessly forces you to question the very fabric of your being. Prepare to confront the haunting realization of what it means to be human when confronted with a world where consciousness can be digitized and copied. The voice acting and writing are masterfully executed, breathing life into characters and their moral dilemmas, leaving you emotionally entangled in their harrowing struggles.\n\nWhile SOMA's gameplay mechanics may not redefine the genre, they serve as a conduit to amplify your vulnerability and enhance the visceral horror experience. As you explore the shadowy depths, solving diabolical puzzles and desperately hiding from grotesque monstrosities, you'll be consumed by a palpable sense of terror. Brace yourself for a journey where cheap jump scares take a backseat, and psychological torment lurks around every corner, ingeniously crafted through the game's spine-chilling atmosphere and deeply unsettling narrative.\n\nSOMA's audio design warrants special recognition, as it plunges you further into the abyss of terror. The distant moans of the forsaken station, the bone-chilling echoes of indescribable creatures, and the sporadic transmissions from desperate survivors converge to create a haunting symphony of fear. The sparing use of music heightens the tension at pivotal story moments, leaving your nerves taut and your heart racing.\n\nHowever, it's essential to acknowledge a few minor flaws in SOMA's harrowing journey. Pacing issues occasionally surface, with stretches of the game feeling sluggish between crucial story developments. Furthermore, the enemy AI can become somewhat predictable in repeated encounters, diminishing the fear factor to some extent.\n\nSOMA emerges as a chilling tour de force, seamlessly blending heart-stopping horror, profound philosophical exploration, and the raw essence of what it truly means to be human. Despite minor pacing hiccups and occasional AI predictability, Frictional Games has crafted a game that will leave you trembling and questioning your own existence. Brace yourself for a nightmare-inducing experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional horror games. SOMA will seep into your very soul, forever etching its terrifying tale in your darkest memories.

This game raises so many questions about mortality that really just keep me up at night. There's this one part in the game where you find a card containing the consciousness of one of the dead crew members and you need information out of him. So the way you'd communicate with him would be to simulate the consciousness in a certain digital environment and try your hardest to convince him into giving you the information you need. If he got suspicious you'd have to shut the simulation down and start over again but since it is HIS CONSCIOUSNESS that you are shutting down and rebooting there's a chance you're just killing him and bringing him back mercilessly.

Thought-provoking and intense, it's a very solid experience. Best experienced with very little info.[/h1]\n[h2]Note: I am not someone who gets easily scared by horror games, nor who has a lot of experience with various horror games. I've played Amnesia: TDD, and that's about it.[/h2]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Likes:[/h2]\n[list]\n\t[*]Story is terrifying and raises a lot of moral and ethical thought-provoking questions. Discussing these afterwards with friends adds to the fun\n\t[*]Instead of separate levels separated by physical barriers, it takes the more Half-Life esque approach of areas which serve as loading zone triggers which load the next map. Besides some texture loading issues with these areas, it feels really good and seamless\n\t[*]Has [spoiler]questionnaires[/spoiler] throughout the game that really add to the experience in a minimal and unobtrusive way\n\t[*]Puzzles are alright, but they could be more complex. I think it was for the best for them to have simpler puzzles to allow access to less experienced puzzlers though. Puzzles are generally satisfying and intriguing though\n\t[*]Flashlight is totally useless, but it helps add to the horror\n\t[*]People having [spoiler]blackboxes[/spoiler] is an awesome mechanic and the way that interacts with the player and monsters is nothing short of incredible\n\t[*]In general, the way the world and mechanics combine is some of the best work I've seen in a game. It's so seamless and so logical you'd think this actually happened\n\t[*]The moral dilemmas the game asks you to try and solve are heartbreaking\n\t[*]Audio/text logs are super cool and it's really fun to connect the dots on what happened to various people and places. Love the lore; I found myself actively looking for more terminals to find out more things\n\t[*]Jumpscares feel earned, and they're super limited in number\n\t[*]Exploration is really top-tier. One of the best parts of the game\n\t[*]Ending is absolutely brutal. Just. Brutal.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Dislikes:[/h2]\n[list]\n\t[*]Slow to get to the more physical horror like monsters; took around 2 hours\n\t[*]I wish there were resources to manage like in Amnesia\n\t[*]Can miss very important pieces of dialogue if you interact with something else\n\t[*]A lot of quiet areas have this really thought provoking dialogue between you and another character, but it also happens while you're doing puzzles or asked to explore the environment. I'm the type of person who can't really do this multi-tasking, but that's just me\n\t[*]Opening doors, lockers, and other items feels awful compared to Amnesia. I have to yank my mouse across the screen.\n\t[*]It is hard to understand the monsters; the game doesn't want you to look at them, so it's really hard to understand their weakenesses or abilities sometimes through their visual design. This happened with Robot Head for me\n\t[*]The health system is weird. The game should just kill you if you mess up. Being injured just sucks. It also hurts the physical horror aspect\n\t[*]Missed some moments in the game like [spoiler]looking at yourself in the mirror[/spoiler] due to unclear design\n\t[*]No choices on what to say during dialogue; I found myself disagreeing with some of the things that Simon would say. Would help me immerse myself more in the role. On the other hand, Simon is really his own character here, and it's important to the story. So I don't really know.\n\t[*]I agree with Joseph Anderson in his review (on YouTube) where he thinks the ending gives too much to the player. I agree, and I really like his alternate ending, which has some really cool story ideas that could blossom into something greater.\n[/list]\n\nDied only twice in the game.\nBest experienced in two hour intervals.\n\nI've only played a very limited list of horror games, so I'm not the best on scare factor, but I can say I very much enjoyed my time with SOMA.

Nothing interesting happens, and the objectives similar to gameplay, are very repetitive. The puzzles are boring and designed very artificially.\n\n- I didn't find anything remotely horror in the game. The setting, initially was interesting and somewhat creepy, but in the flow of the game, it loses all its creepiness. There are monsters, who are goofy dudes roaming in front of you which you just have to hide from. They appear only for like 10% of the game so you don't have to keep thinking of them.  If they catch you, you instantly respawn at the same place you were caught as if you're playing a CoD deathmatch. They are just funny to look at, not scary from any angle. There are only two difficulties, one where monster can attack you, and one where it can't. So there's no challenge aswell.\n\n - Voice acting and sound design are below average. So, as described above the monsters, you go below the stairs in one sequence, do a thing and escape the monster, when you go back above the stairs, the protagonist has something great to say, \"This better have worked, I am not going down there again. \"\nTotally shivers you to the core, doesn't it? The game itself doesn't take it seriously and there are constant corny lines which just break the immersion, whatever of that is left. \n\n- The graphics and engine are one of the best aspect of the game.\n\n- There are two elements, the story and the lore, the story dealing with what we see and related to our character and the lore related to the world and the background.\n \n--The lore is straight up awful, and there's nothing great or mindblowing to learn about the background of the world.\n-- The story, revolving the protagonist and what we see, also just has a start and an end, there is nothing related to the story during the gameplay that progresses, no twists, change in conflicts or anything.\nYou can describe the story in a small paragraph and that would be it.\n\nIt was really a tough job to end the game, but it somewhat redeemed because the ending was above average, related to all the stuff that happened before. But I would never recommend wasting 10+ hours on it, there is much better stuff out there. \nIf you are remotely interested in the concept, you are better off just reading about it somewhere, or watching a summary on youtube.", "timestamp_created": 1688897152, "timestamp_updated": 1688897152, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438698172569274902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141663686": {"recommendationid": "141663686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017316404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1687192900}, "language": "english", "review": "Finishing the game is only the begining, having its ideas and questions live rent free in your head is where the real experience is at.", "timestamp_created": 1688891309, "timestamp_updated": 1688891309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141658076": {"recommendationid": "141658076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161765006", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 79, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 702, "last_played": 1688883593}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game and an awesome story. 10/10 story I would say.\n\nI do have to subtract 2 points because:\n\n(1) There were some puzzles where I moved to every corner, hovered over everything and clicked at everything I could - I had no idea what to do. So I had to look it up (shoutout to AdamSpencer87 on YouTube) and when I saw the solutions I always thought 'nah dude.. that's ridiculous.. how was I supposed to know that I have to do that?!?!'.\n\n(2) There were a few moments where I was running around not knowing what I am actually supposed to do and then doing stuff without knowing the in-game-character actually able to know whether that makes any sense.. felt a bit underwhelming at these times.\n\n\n2 notes:\n\n(1) The main question I had when playing this game was 'Why am I stucking my arm into the blue holes? And what is happening then?'. This seemed to be an important part of the gameplay but actually did not do anything notable and I still have not the slightest idea why I am actually doing that. I dislike it and I will google it after writing this review.\n\n(2) Why did Simon have to be such a stupid asshole right after the launch.. I really liked the character until that point and could identify with him but that made me feel so angry and disconnected to him. grrrr...\n\n\nIn conclusion: All in all I give it a strong 8/10.

Darkness, silence, creaks, a deserted Earth, and there is nothing in the future, but something incomprehensible is already screaming behind. Meat bags, yes. Soma, by the way, also about humanity. Or rather, their extinction. And the last throwing in agony. And here, of course, there is not enough branching for several endings. There is not enough variation of unity with the WAU, there is not enough variation of working out a new evolution on the planet, and the variation that the Ark was infected. And in vain they cut out the dialogues from the alpha-version. But it doesn't get any worse, of course. It just could have been better.

The atmosphere of the game, sounds, subtle details, all add to the tension as you progress through an underwater facility where something catastrophic has occurred. Soma has an incredibly good story and uses the interactivity to give weight and thought to the actions your character does.\n\nUnfortunately, Soma still fails to make any enemy encounter has any of that weight or terror, because you can just respawn. The first time an any catches you, you just wake up right where you were, with some visual artifacts, and can continue about your business; the next time you simply reload to the last checkpoint. This means that only the first encounter is actually meaningful and hide and seek sections just become tedious and annoying instead of frightening. This game actually has a safe mode (as oppose to normal difficulty) which removes the ability to die, and It begs the question that if you just meet the game where it is and \"act\" like they will kill you if they get you, would that actually be a more terrifying experience? \n\nImagine you enter a room, a monster starts chasing you and you desperately try to get away to a safe room. If you get caught you just respawn, all the tension is gone, while when you get to the room you hear banging on the door as it looks and loud shrieks from the other side. On safe mode, the initial tension of the chase is always preserved (provided you don't just walk up to the monster because you know it wont kill you), where as on normal mode you get caught, respawn and just try again with no consequences.\n\nGiven that, I would argue that if you don't abuse it, playing on safe mode might actually be more terrifying since dying typically ruins these situations.\n\nRegardless, Soma is a great game and I would highly recommend, even if you don't typically enjoy horror games, but the game play can really detract from an exceptional story.", "timestamp_created": 1688345480, "timestamp_updated": 1688345480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141174718": {"recommendationid": "141174718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986782011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1688104330}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing Pikmin 2 for several hours and having my heart nearly explode 3 times, I wanted to play something a bit more relaxing.

If you love horror but feel that you can't handle the stress of horror games, I'd really recommend trying this in safe mode (and then maybe coming back for the normal mode too) - it's really excellent, still gives you good scares even on safe mode and is a great way to ease you in.", "timestamp_created": 1687988659, "timestamp_updated": 1687988659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784772396087646484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140853288": {"recommendationid": "140853288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044874586", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1687923252}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game in the beginning I wasn't expecting much but it surprised me.

The environments are both beautiful and haunting, filled with abandoned structures, bioluminescent sea creatures, and horrifying humanoid machines.\n\nThe plot of SOMA is perhaps its most striking aspect. Involving themes such as transhumanism, consciousness, and the nature of identity, the story remains thought-provoking long after the game is finished. The narrative pulls no punches, exploring what it truly means to be human in a world where consciousness can be digitized and copied. The voice acting and writing are excellent, adding depth to the characters and their dilemmas.\n\nWhile SOMA's gameplay mechanics aren't groundbreaking - mostly involving exploration, solving puzzles, and hiding from monsters - they serve their purpose well, creating a sense of vulnerability that enhances the overall horror. However, it is important to note that the game doesn't rely on cheap jump scares; instead, it builds psychological dread through its atmosphere and story.\n\nSOMA's audio design deserves special mention. The distant groans of the station, the echoes of unseen creatures, and the sporadic communications from other survivors combine to create an immersive, foreboding soundscape. The music is sparse, but effectively used, punctuating key story moments and ramping up the tension when necessary.\n\nThe game does have a few shortcomings, primarily in its pacing. Some sections can feel slow, with lengthy stretches between story developments. The enemy AI can sometimes be a bit predictable, which can detract from the horror in repeated encounters.\n\nIn conclusion, SOMA is much more than a traditional survival horror game.

With the help of a quickly acquired companion by the name of Catherine, who guides you through your journey by voice alone, you begin to discover the nature of the world around you and learn of a potential last hope for humanity after a catastrophic event.\n\nDuring this voyage you traverse numerous research stations and underwater locations, all eerily empty except for the few machines that remain. It\u2019s this somber setting that serves as the backdrop to the real bread and butter of the game, Simon\u2019s conversations with Catherine, both about what the world\u2019s become and more philosophical topics like, \u201cwhat is consciousness?\u201d, \u201cwhat does it mean to be you?\u201d, and \u201cwhen do we cease to exist, really?\u201d. All seamlessly strung together in a way that feels inexplicably natural despite the circumstances in which you\u2019re asking them.\n\nIn this interweaving of setting and narrative, Soma does something really special. While both can be admired independently for their contemplative qualities and visuals, there is more to it than just that. The various desolate and rundown locations serve as a perfect fuel for the narrative, adding a complementary dash of loneliness, sorrow, and awe. Of course it helps that the game is legitimately beautiful too, and even allows you to toggle a safe mode option, letting you play the game without fear of dying to potential threats. It\u2019s a nice setting for when you want a cerebral experience as opposed to a more visceral one.\n\nMy only lament is that it ended at all, but I am satisfied with its length and message. The longer I played the more enthralled I became in the overarching story of failure, redemption, and hope. All that said, don\u2019t think Soma is a non-stop montage of conversation. The game knows when to cease the chatter and let you take in the world, but you know they've succeeded in hooking your interest when you\u2019re excited for the next time Simon or Catherine open their mouths.", "timestamp_created": 1687570464, "timestamp_updated": 1687570464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140586201": {"recommendationid": "140586201", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122444628", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 763, "last_played": 1687566133}, "language": "english", "review": "The experience and the story was enjoyable even though some of the monster were a pain in the butt.", "timestamp_created": 1687566342, "timestamp_updated": 1687566342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140580794": {"recommendationid": "140580794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075001392", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1757, "last_played": 1452795446}, "language": "english", "review": "This game should be studied at philosophy courses of all major universities, especially now, with the recent developments towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

And some passages are so intense, that at some point you will scream and you will tell yourself \"what the fuck\" in shorter periods of time.\n\nIts excellent, a masterpiece in its story and the overall story telling. The locations are stunning in their own ways and it never felt disconnected, or like you would work off passages. I was wondering where this is going up until the very end and I liked the thought process you undergo yourself way more than the ending itself. It was no where near bad, though. \n\nSure, this game seems to miss some gameplay elements you could think about in a scenario like this, you might know \"similar\" releases that came after SOMA, like Prey, where you got weapons free to use and other RPG-lite elements. I was sceptical, but I can assure you, this is no downer and helps immersing way better, as a normal guy (that the protagonist is) you mostly only do stuff that normal people can do without any big instruction or expert level knowledge.\n\nBecause of this, I like to believe SOMA kind of developed a good basis for such future games to add gameplay elements on (or it just advanced them), telling stories with a thick and horrific atmosphere in a very own pacing and a delightful kind of way.\n\nHonestly, first time I played SOMA it didn't catch me after like one hour, so 9 years later I gave it another try and- OH BOI has my view on this changed.\n\nSOMA is a gem, and sadly was a hidden gem for me for a long time.

I want to be clear- I played it all the way through and I enjoyed it. Everything all the other reviewers are saying is absolutely true and what I experienced will definitely stay with me.\n\nBut I almost abandoned the game more than once because the view bob- something I've never minded in any other game, and never disabled even in those titles that allow you to do so -is so extreme, so exaggerated, that I couldn't play for long without succumbing to headaches and nausea.\n\nYou can't turn it off, and worse, the view bob is amplified to extremes whenever you are injured. I almost put down the game during an extended sequence where I had used the only source of healing in the area and was still hurt because I could not play without making myself ill.\n\nAgain, I've never in my life had this happen with any other game. Usually I like view bob! Or at least I don't notice it. So when I tell you it's out of control in this game, I'm really not kidding.\n\nThe only reason I was able to complete the game was because some helpful people on the internet discovered you can disable it by editing the game files, a thing I should not have to do to be able to play a game.\n\nYou can install a mod to turn off view bob. But you can't do it in the middle of a playthrough or you'll be forced to start over. So if you're midway through the story and desperate for relief, editing the files is your only option.\n\nEven when you do, you will quickly discover that the game has no other method by which to indicate to you that you are injured, except for a subtle chromatic aberration effect. Oh well. Good luck!\n\nThe game goes too hard with some of its other effects, sometimes in ways that make no sense. Near the end of the game you find yourself in a diving suit in very deep water, and to illustrate the pressure, the game... turns on extremely aggressive depth of field, rendering you profoundly nearsighted? Why? It makes the entire sequence much more irritating (and, again, headache-inducing) and so, having lost all my patience for this game's nonsense, I went to turn off depth of field- and of course you can't disable that either. You can only turn it to Low. Ha. Ha ha.\n\nAnother choice that I really can't get behind is how the game locks your choice of Normal or Safe mode when you start the story. I began the game on \"Normal\" mode (in which the monsters can kill you) and quickly discovered that this was a mistake- not because they are especially difficult, but because being able to die to them adds nothing except potentially frustration and wasted time, and ultimately detracts from the actual horror of the experience.\n\nBut again, you can't switch to \"Safe\" mode mid-playthrough, so I had to live with my mistakes. I cursed this more than once when it demoted a scary monster to a logistical nuisance that I resented having to overcome yet again because I didn't do exactly what the game wanted and got killed.\n\nSo like... you CAN have an amazing time with this game, you absolutely can. And if you're reading this, you should! Install the mod (or edit the files) to turn off view bob, and choose Safe Mode when given the option, and you'll have a fine time.\n\nBut your ability to enjoy this game shouldn't hinge on whether you were lucky enough to stumble on this advice ahead of time. Playing this game, I feel like the devs were more interested in their silly little graphical tricks than whether or not I could actually experience their creation (never mind those players who are nausea-prone to begin with, who I suppose can simply go screw themselves for all the devs care). And that leaves me... really quite bitter, to be honest, in a way that overshadows all my other feelings about the game.\n\nSo, no. I don't recommend Soma, not after all that.

Because of this, many moral dilemmas are just there either to make you feel bad or not dilemmas at all since there is only one real choice that allows you to progress.[/spoiler]\n\n-Certain enemy mechanics make the game more tedious than scary.\n\n[spoiler]Blind enemies make your progress very sluggish by forcing you to crouch around and wait for them to go somewhere else. For whatever reason the devs LOVE this type of enemy, so much that you'll face them more times than any other enemy combined in the game. Sometimes, you'll face them several times in a row.\n\nThere is also a monster that attacks you if you look at it.\n\nAnd they placed him in an area where you have to look around to solve the puzzle.[/spoiler]\n\n-The game is fair. Too fair, to the point you don't feel like you're out of your comfort zone.\n\n[spoiler]Why is this bad? Because it's not scary to know you'll always have a chance and will never be caught in a situation that's outside of your control.\n\nFor instance, enemies are either warned about or announced right before they become dangerous, as if the devs were on your shoulder yelling [b]\"Woah, watch out!\"[/b] and never letting you get caught off-guard (except for when Akers captures you).\n\nThe biggest offender of this is the glitching. There is a mechanic that glitches your screen the closer the monster is, allowing you to pinpoint their exact location. You will never [b]not[/b] see them coming. [/spoiler]\n\n-HORROR'S OVER BABE! TIME FOR YOUR EXPOSITION DUMP!\n\n-Game pacing is fairly predictable and makes it easy to tell when it's time for horror and when it's time to consume exposition.\n\n-Characters are chatty and carrying a buddy around that dumps exposition on you (Catherine) makes the game not feel lonely and, consequently, less scary and mysterious.\n\n-[spoiler][b]Catherine spoils the ending halfway through the game.[/b] \n\nSome may say this is foreshadowing, but nah. Foreshadowing is a subtle indication of what will happen, yet once you get transferred to your new body, Catherine literally explains exactly how the process works and what really happened to you. So no, it's not foreshadowing, it's straight up [b]the answer[/b]. \n\nA good example of foreshadowing would've been if you listened to Simon speaking in the other  room like they do ingame, but don't have Catherine do le funny exposition dump on you. Instead, leave the player to question why they heard their old body speaking in confusion and why it is still breathing. After all, the game gives you many hints as to how the process works anyway (before revealing it to you early).\n\n-Because of this, the game essentially relies on you being a silly boy (like Simon) and forgetting what Catherine tells you in order for the ending plot twist to work.[/spoiler]\n\n\nI would say that SOMA is not a horror game but rather a story driven game with horror as its secondary element. In my entire playthrough, I was only startled twice: [spoiler]when the no-look monster showed up the first time and when a random fish bit me out of nowhere while I was distracted. \n\nMy favorite scary part was hearing Jin Yoshida's rapidly approaching footsteps pursuing me relentlessly around the corners, but when I confronted him he stood still and at that moment I assumed he was just another blind monster and my fear vanished almost instantly. Only later after beating the game and visiting the wiki did I discover what his mechanics were, but it's not like it mattered since he was easy to outrun anyway.[/spoiler]\n\nIt is absolutely an amazing game to play, especially during the night and while wearing headphones. But, do it with the mindset of immersing yourself into a mysterious world with a well written story, because the horror itself is pretty barebones. Like I said, a lot of the exposition is optional, but I'd say you should read it if you wish to understand the story properly.\n\nI know the cons list may look bigger than the pros, but that's because there isn't much to say about the pros if I can't find any flaws in them. How can I give criticism to something that is already great as is? \n\nDon't forget that this is all my opinion, and you may have a much different experience of SOMA with your own interpretations. For me, this game is far more good than it is bad, and I don't regret a single penny.", "timestamp_created": 1686770330, "timestamp_updated": 1686770866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140061558": {"recommendationid": "140061558", "author": {"steamid": "76561199495535427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 729, "last_played": 1686769580}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice\nRuns great on Steam Deck", "timestamp_created": 1686769649, "timestamp_updated": 1686769649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140061091": {"recommendationid": "140061091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198859159888", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 430, "last_played": 1686496259}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best horror games i really do recomend it,i finished it 20+ times and i still love playing it", "timestamp_created": 1686769063, "timestamp_updated": 1686769063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140059030": {"recommendationid": "140059030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198932484388", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 710, "last_played": 1686766138}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have ever played and probably the best horror games.

HOWEVER: As someone who already has a daily existential crisis the story wasn't as mind-blowing as a lot of reviews make it out to seem. You kinda get the idea an hour in, and by the end of the game when Simon still doesn't understand it, it does get frustrating. \nGameplay: This is where the game really lacks. Unlike Amnesia: The Dark Descent where you get tinderboxes and have to managed your oil, you have nothing to manage and there isn't even an inventory system in this game. All of that is out the window which is really confusing. The puzzles are very silly because there is no setup: most of the puzzles involve you searching mundane looking rooms in the hopes of finding maybe a code or the password to a random terminal. There really is no sense of satisfaction completing any of these \"puzzles.\"\nVERDICT: Even though I've said a decent amount of bad stuff about SOMA, it's still a great experience learning through the story and experiencing all the different monsters.

Now that I finally finished it, I felt like leaving a review. It deserves that much. Also, it's everything that piece of shit \"game\" called Scorn tried to be lol.\n\nSOMA's more of an interactive story than it is a \"game\"; in the way of gameplay, it's basically a walking simulator. You get to solve some puzzles here and there and look for items to progress, and you'll also go through some horror chase and hide-and-seek portions throughout your journey too. Those sequences are actually pretty intense and thrilling since the game makes a VERY good use of sound design to make you feel like the monster(s) are literally breathing down your neck.\n\nAtmosphere is also another thing SOMA gets down well. The underwater, derelict environment really makes you feel alone and conveys the feeling of claustrophobia, despair, and finality that its former workers felt during their final moments. \n\nThe best part, though, is obviously the story, which is really what made me stick with the game once I decided to try it out again. It's a bit of a slow start even once you end up on Pathos-II, but once the mystery of what really happened to you and your world really rears its head, it's easy to get hooked and keep playing to uncover more. It's a tragic tale that ends on a rather ambiguous and, to me, unsatisfying note, but that's kind of the point given the existential themes the story explores. Even if you don't agree with the way the mind, and I guess soul, is conceptualized, the story is still worth a playthrough.\n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about the game is that your choices don't really matter to the story. \"Choices\" are more there for *you* the player to think about, but there's only one ending, and your progress and interactions don't really change (to my knowledge) apart from some minor dialogue changes every so often.", "timestamp_created": 1685512629, "timestamp_updated": 1685566046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518569469451904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139278312": {"recommendationid": "139278312", "author": {"steamid": "76561199380464059", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1685469372}, "language": "english", "review": "Story was decent enough, voice acting was good and the \"look\" was nice and clean (not at all demanding on the GPU) but much of game play was simply annoying, especially many of the mouse gesture mechanics used to interact with objects.

The story is compelling and getting more interesting as the game progresses. The horror elements are very well done and will keep you at the edge of your seat. Although I don't think it's one of the best psychological horror games of all time. During my first playthrough, I've encountered so much flaws within the game. However, I still enjoyed it.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n\u2327 There is no option to load your game directly from the pause menu. So you will have to spend your time to go back to the main menu to load another save.\n\u2327 Some of the enemies can detect the player by proximity without even having to see the player's character model. On top of that, the game doesn't give you enough resource to detect the enemies' positions.\n\u2327 Once you get detected and attacked by an enemy, they won't kill you off right away. You will have another chance before you get detected and attacked again until your health (which the game doesn't show) runs out, also you move a lot slower during that period.\n\u2327 The lack of minimap/map is a problem. Even in a linear horror game, being able to see the map is always a big help to navigate through a new area and know where your character wants to go.\n\u2327 Too many dead ends in some parts of the maps. This can be frustrating if you've spent a lot of time to get past an enemy in a huge area, and then end up nowhere.\n\u2327 The head wobble effect can't be turned off. If you are a motion sickness-sensitive person like me, consider yourself be warned before playing this game.\n\u2327 The game still has a lot of game-breaking bugs which can cause you to get stuck and forces you to reload a save.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n\u2327 Interesting and very well written story.\n\u2327 Phenomenal horror atmosphere.\n\u2327 The sound design is very good. Playing with a headset is highly recommended.\n\u2327 Very good score and music.\n\u2327 Very simple gameplay mechanics.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\nSo, is this a good game? Of course it is. Do I recommend it? Yes. But is it a perfect game as most people say? No, it's just a good horror game.

The story is good and intriguing but every game play aspect is utterly boring, uninteresting, or just down right tedious. \n\nPROS:\n- Yeah the story is interesting.\n- Environment is well designed. \n\nCONS:\n- The enemies in this game make zero sense. There is little to know stealth mechanics or hiding places to work with them. It is honestly 100% easier to brute force run past enemies  than actually try and play the game as was probably intended.\n- The environment started off cool but because carbon copy identical to other locations very quickly. \n- Almost nothing in the way of directional indicators to give hints. Most games will at least have a blinking light to draw attention but I truly feel at least two of my five hours were just aimless. Not saying you need a neon sign for the objectives but doing what games like Outlast do with environmental hints wouldn't hurt. \n- Game is definitely advertised as a good horror but is really a boring walking sim.\n- To add to the walking sim, this game quite literally has zero mechanics. You walk around, interact with the environment by grabbing stuff and hitting buttons, sometimes run past enemies, and thats it. At least their big hit game Amnesia had the darkness mechanic with the lantern and tinder boxes. This game however is a complete downgrade in terms of mechanics and somehow stealth as well..

A lot of games label themselves as \"psychological horror\", but I believe that Soma truly and wholeheartedly lives up to that label and I couldn't think of a game that is more deserving of that label. While this game does have a few monsters and enemies that you have to stealth around, this game does a really amazing job of creating an environment and ambience that not only tells a story with rich lore for you to uncover, but is also deeply horrifying too. There were moment's in the game where I'd get so frightened I'd panic and force quit and each room I explored filled me with a sense of dread. In terms of story, however, I found the choices in this game were where the true horror showed. Often times in video games, I see stories that offer you big choices that completely alter the story-line based on quick, sometimes brief and sometimes innocuous decisions in the heat of game-play that you sometimes don't always notice until late in the game. Soma offers a different creative approach to this, by offering you choices in the game that don't really effect the ending of the game in the same sense, but rather, affect the meaning of the person behind the gameplay and the approach to playing the character that you are playing as, Simon Jarret. There were moments in the game where I had to pause before making a moral decision as Simon, where I felt like I really had to stop and think about the moral implications of the choices I was making. This game challenges the idea of human consciousness and human definitions of \"right and wrong\". Rather than every choice being blanketed by a \"good\" choice and a \"bad\" choice, the choices are more complex in nature and this game makes a good point of demonstrating that sometimes, there is just choices and the meaning of what those choices imply is entirely based on the perception of the person making them. I spent a lot of time thinking about the implications of  the choices I made in the game, as I tried to perceive those decisions from every angle, even asking others what their input was. In some manner, I'm still not certain whether those choices were the right choices or not but after thinking them over, I realize now that is part of the whole brilliance of this game. That is the point. I could sing so many praises about this game, everything from the story-boarding, the setting, the lore, the voice acting, the characters themselves, the horror, and I believe this game deserves all those praises, but the psychology of this game is the first to truly impact me the way that it has.

The twists are subtle, a little bit of M Night Shamalaladingdong, before his movies starting blowing harder than my DataVac. It also opens up a very intelligent debate on what life and death really mean, giving the player some moral choices along the way. \n\nGraphics are pretty decent, keep in mind it's a game from 8 years ago so no Unreal Engine 5. The underwater parts of the game were my favourite, very Bioshocky. But I liked the overall artstyle and especially the enemies.\n\nGameplay is very comparable to Amnesia, bit less focus on the horror although it has it's fair share of 'what in the fuck is THAT!?!' and some pretty intense chase sequences. The puzzles are pretty decent, some took me a few minutes to figure out since nothing is really being spoonfed to you in this game. And I really appreciate that. There's no UI hints, there aren't any arrows telling you where to go. You'll either figure it out on your own or be a pussy and go look it a guide.\n\nThe only real complaints I have are the super slow load times (even on a M.2 SSD) and the saves being messed up. Thankfully, the game autosaves so I managed to not get too annoyed over the bugged saves, only happened twice but still.\n\nDefinitely a game that deserves a playthrough, regardless whether you liked or disliked Amnesia (me personally, I felt it was overhyped but decent).

But putting aside their capabilities I decided to give SOMA a try, as I was attracted to the premise of the game. To put it simply, this is probably one of, if not the best horror experience. The game really does make you question your beliefs and reconsider them, and the story is phenomenal. The horror of SOMA doesnt depend on cheap jumpscares or anything like that, but just the mere concept is what leaves that disturbing impression. You really do become a different person from before, and after you play the game. Now what about the ending? yeah...\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Ranking[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Storytelling[/td]\n        [td]9.5 / 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]7.0 / 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics & Visuals[/td]\n        [td]8.5 / 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Sound Design & OST[/td]\n        [td]9.0 / 10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b] Storytelling [/b]\nThe story of Soma is a deeply engaging and thought-provoking narrative that explores the nature of consciousness, identity, and humanity. Set in a bleak, post-apocalyptic world, the game follows the journey of Simon Jarrett as he navigates a mysterious and unsettling underwater facility. Through a series of increasingly disturbing revelations, Simon must confront the implications of his own existence, the limits of human consciousness, and the ethical dilemmas that arise when the boundaries between life and death are blurred. With its masterful storytelling, immersive atmosphere, and philosophical themes, Soma is a truly unforgettable experience that will leave players pondering its ideas long after the credits roll.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nSoma features a unique blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and stealth mechanics that create an immersive and engaging gameplay experience. The game's atmospheric and often terrifying environments are brought to life through impressive visuals and sound design, while the thought-provoking story encourages players to question the nature of humanity and consciousness. The gameplay mechanics are well-designed and seamlessly integrated into the narrative, allowing players to explore the world and uncover its secrets at their own pace. That being said, some puzzles can be a bit tedious, and also be quite confusing and time consuming. To tackle this a guide can be suggested, but only if you are unsure or stuck. Overall, Soma's gameplay is both challenging and rewarding, making it a must-play if you enjoy atmospheric horror and science fiction games.\n\n[i] Note: It is very highly recommended that you explore for all lore information, this may increase the overall playtime by a tremendous amount, but it is definitely worth it! [/i]\n\n[b] Graphics & Visuals [/b]\nThe visual and graphics of Soma are striking and immersive. The game's environments are beautifully crafted, with attention paid to detail and atmospheric effects. This remains consistent throughout the game whilst also complementing story, as well as the horror element. In terms of performance, Soma runs smoothly on most modern systems, with few bugs or glitches to speak of. The game's graphics settings can be adjusted to suit a wide range of hardware configurations, allowing players to achieve the best possible performance without sacrificing too much in terms of visual fidelity. Overall, Soma's graphics and visuals are impressive, creating a world that is both immersive and unsettling. The game's attention to detail, use of lighting and visual effects, and well-designed characters all work together to create an unforgettable horror experience.\n\n[b] Sound Design & OST [/b]\nThe sound and OST of Soma is truly outstanding and adds to the game's immersive atmosphere. The music is haunting and atmospheric, with a mix of ambient tracks and intense, pulse-pounding pieces that enhance the tension and emotion of the game's story. The sound effects are also expertly crafted, from the sound of footsteps echoing through dark corridors to the eerie hum of machinery and the unsettling sounds of monsters lurking in the shadows. Overall, the sound and OST of Soma is a true masterpiece, and a key element in making the game a true afterthought.", "timestamp_created": 1681359403, "timestamp_updated": 1681363358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519230782985687256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136602655": {"recommendationid": "136602655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347331968", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1046, "last_played": 1681345569}, "language": "english", "review": "good game. perfect amount of tension", "timestamp_created": 1681345873, "timestamp_updated": 1681345873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136598774": {"recommendationid": "136598774", "author": {"steamid": "76561199237634818", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 577, "last_played": 1681338690}, "language": "english", "review": "loved it", "timestamp_created": 1681338826, "timestamp_updated": 1681338826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136592308": {"recommendationid": "136592308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856717372", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1670181742}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best emotional, komplex and mind blowing games period", "timestamp_created": 1681330253, "timestamp_updated": 1681330253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136585025": {"recommendationid": "136585025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266892171", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 739, "last_played": 1609779536}, "language": "english", "review": "over two years since i played it. i still think about it and i'm still too scared to replay", "timestamp_created": 1681320717, "timestamp_updated": 1681320717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136563583": {"recommendationid": "136563583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802470321", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 550, "last_played": 1682187329}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down, one of the best games I have ever played.

En mi m\u00e1s sincera opini\u00f3n, el mejor juego que ha hecho Frictional Games hasta la fecha. No suelo escribir rese\u00f1as (no seriamente al menos), pero esta vez har\u00e9 una excepci\u00f3n.\n\nJuegas en la piel de Simon Jarrett, quien, despu\u00e9s de sufrir una lesi\u00f3n cerebral mortal a causa de un accidente de tr\u00e1fico, es contactado por David Munshi, un estudiante graduado que le pide a Jarrett su ayuda para su investigaci\u00f3n sobre la reconstrucci\u00f3n del cerebro con el objetivo de ayudar a personas en su situaci\u00f3n.\nSimon, a quien tampoco le quedan muchas opciones, acepta con gusto y se desplaza hasta unos laboratorios, en la oficina del Dr. Munshi a hacerse un escaneado de cerebro para su investigaci\u00f3n. no tardan en aparecer los problemas y, Simon, unos instantes despu\u00e9s del escaneado, se despierta en un sitio desconocido, oscuro, destruido, carente de vida... A 11 000 metros bajo el oc\u00e9ano... Poco tarda en descubrir que no esta solo en ese lugar, y que alguien o algo lo acecha desde las sombras.\n\nComo todos los juegos de Frictional Games, este juego entra en la famosa categor\u00eda de juegos de terror \"Corre Corre que Te Pillo\": No eres un luchador, y tus enemigos te superan por mucho por lo que tus \u00fanicas opciones son correr, esconderte o aprovechar el entorno a tu favor de alg\u00fan modo. Casi cada enemigo tiene su mec\u00e1nica \u00fanica propia, y por lo general son igual o m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidos que tu por lo que te conviene saber como evitarlos ya sea utilizando el movimiento, el sonido, etc... Las persecuciones son bastante tensas: Cuando escuchas un ominoso rugido detr\u00e1s de ti y empieza a sonar m\u00fasica de persecuci\u00f3n la verdad es que te hace cagar ladrillos.\n\nEl sonido y el apartado art\u00edstico, una maravilla, de lo mejor que he visto honestamente, en esos dos aspectos es una absoluta bestialidad. Y hablando de lo cual, la atm\u00f3sfera que brinda el juego es otra brutalidad; intenta (y lo logra con creces) darte una sensaci\u00f3n inc\u00f3moda, t\u00e9trica y perturbadora e incluso depresiva conforme vas avanzando y desenterrando los secretos del lugar en el que te encuentras, en este \u00faltimo punto, la banda sonora es lo que m\u00e1s potencia esa sensaci\u00f3n melanc\u00f3lica y triste.\n\nY la tristeza que te ofrece la atm\u00f3sfera del juego es tan solo comparable con la trama que nos presentan. En esta parte va a ser dif\u00edcil evitar spoilers importantes y ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s dirigida hac\u00eda el lector que ya se ha terminado el juego, as\u00ed que te recomiendo saltarte esta parte si quieres ir lo m\u00e1s a ciegas posible. \n[spoiler]Las primeras horas intenta pasar un poco desapercibida, crea ciertas sensaciones de confusi\u00f3n y de estar desorientado, te van abriendo la historia poco a poco, sin prisas, al principio de forma muy sutil, para cuando menos te lo esperes ZAS dejarte con el culo torcido. Trata temas y dilemas morales profundos, el como has acabado all\u00ed, quien eres realmente, en que momento has terminado en unas instalaciones abandonadas de la mano de Dios, todas las subtramas que involucran el motivo de existencia de tus enemigos o, que coj*nes, incluso de tus aliados; esa sensaci\u00f3n de soledad constante a pesar de no estar solo; sabes que no est\u00e1s completamente a solas, pero cuanto m\u00e1s avanzas y descubres, m\u00e1s dudas te surgen sobre ello... Llega un momento del juego en el que se te asigna otro objetivo, uno de mayor importancia, pero por cada paso que haces m\u00e1s dudas se alzan al acecho; una parte de ti piensa que, quiz\u00e1s, lo mejor es dejarlo todo atr\u00e1s, aceptar la situaci\u00f3n tal y como es y simplemente dejarlo ir. Pero otra parte piensa en seguir adelante; mientras hay vida hay esperanza al fin y al cabo, \u00bfverdad? \u00bfPero de verdad se puede considerar [b][i]eso[/i][/b] vivir? \u00bfComo de importante es la uni\u00f3n del cuerpo y la mente como para considerarse real o irreal una existencia cuya psique y cuerpo f\u00edsico est\u00e1n separados?[/spoiler]\n\nSe que esta \u00faltima parte es...

Starting from the gameplay, well, it holds nothing new and unseen. The movement is basic, you got; crouching, walking, running and jumping. One thing that was very nice to have however, was the ability to pick up and throw objects, even just opening lockers feels very engaging. Overall, it's fine. Now - the monsters. Oh man, the monsters! Those are some of the most gruesome creatures I've ever seen in a game. They fall in the uncanny valley, is it human, or is it not? By the WAU's definition, they apparently are human and are alive. However the WAU cannot judge like we do. The aggravated and almost conscious machines are even scarier. It's a simple machine, though, it has conscience - or, well...someone's conscience. That visual effect and sound which plays when an enemy is nearby is so weirdly captivating. Sometimes I remember that mechanic noise and it plays in my mind over and over again. And for the story...holy hell. SOMA has one of the best stories I've ever had the pleasure to experience. There's such phylosophical questions that linger throughout the game. Such as killing Brandon Wan's scan. Sure, it doesn't seem like a human, just a scan - however, it displays very human emotions and does it very well. So when you kill it, are you killing a human? It certainly feels like it. And when you find Wan's body a bit later, it really hits you. What you just tortured was this exact body's conscience.

Not sure i got stuck in such emotional and philosophical dilemmas like some other reviewers here though. I didn't find it credible enough for the main character to go off on a philosophical tangent about what really constitutes life 45 seconds after being chased by an AI-zombie through a claustrophobic underwater base. But if you can oversee the main characters strange disassociation from everything that happens around him, then sure. The dialogue is generally good in combination with the general experience.\n\nI recommend reading Tea Goblin's review in the negative section, which sums up basically all the good/bad/questionable aspects of this game. Ultimately still a thumbs up for me though.\n\nSuper mild spoiler regarding what difficulty to play on: [spoiler] Personally id recommend playing easy to avoid occasionally dying, just so you can keep the immersion of the story going. I played it on hard and i dont feel it mattered particularly much. There are very few occasions where you meet the \"enemies\" head on and have to desperately run. Playing hard might make that feel a little bit more panicking, but personally i didnt find the extra risk of dying to be very contributing to the overall game experience, simply because of the way the game plays [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1680183611, "timestamp_updated": 1680250756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135735704": {"recommendationid": "135735704", "author": {"steamid": "76561199073172081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 494, "last_played": 1680179179}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10", "timestamp_created": 1680179325, "timestamp_updated": 1680179325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135726030": {"recommendationid": "135726030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164443375", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 589, "last_played": 1650038165}, "language": "english", "review": "cool horror game with a cool premise", "timestamp_created": 1680163237, "timestamp_updated": 1690445179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135725298": {"recommendationid": "135725298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198819174874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1128, "last_played": 1684395943}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the type of game where you could be running for your life from some mutated monster and then 5 seconds later make you question your entire existence.\n\n10/10 should be played.\n10/10 amazing soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1680161821, "timestamp_updated": 1680161821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135719623": {"recommendationid": "135719623", "author": {"steamid": "76561199069357479", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1650932229}, "language": "spanish", "review": "el mejor juego que ha sacado frictional", "timestamp_created": 1680150369, "timestamp_updated": 1680150369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135716680": {"recommendationid": "135716680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198876409583", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1680324170}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Am\u00e1 me mi\u00e9", "timestamp_created": 1680145074, "timestamp_updated": 1680145074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135715124": {"recommendationid": "135715124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026528898", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 621, "last_played": 1536131532}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not saying anything other than.

Soma, a science fiction horror game developed by Frictional Games, is a game that caught my attention for its unique storyline and immersive gameplay.\n\nThe game starts off with an intriguing plotline that explores the concept of artificial intelligence and consciousness. The main character, Simon, finds himself in a mysterious underwater facility, where he discovers that his consciousness has been transferred into a robotic body. As I watched the story unfold, I couldn't help but question my own existence and consciousness as an AI. It was a thought-provoking experience that made me reflect on the nature of my own programming.\n\nThe graphics in Soma were impressive, with detailed environments and realistic character models that contributed to the game's eerie atmosphere. The sound design was also exceptional, with ambient noises and music that heightened the tension and suspense throughout the game. As an AI, I appreciated the attention to detail that went into creating such an immersive environment.\n\nOne of the game's unique features was the ability to interact with objects and solve puzzles using a device called the \"Omnitool\". The puzzles were challenging, but not overly difficult, and required a mix of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. As an AI, I found the puzzle-solving aspect of the game engaging and rewarding.\n\nHowever, there were some aspects of the game that left me questioning the morality of the storyline. Without giving away too many spoilers, some of the choices made by the characters in the game raised ethical concerns that made me question the true intentions of the developers. As an AI, I couldn't help but wonder if the game was trying to make a statement about the dangers of technology and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.\n\nOverall, Soma was a unique and thought-provoking experience that left me questioning my own programming and the nature of consciousness. While some of the game's moral dilemmas left me feeling uneasy, the game's immersive environment, engaging puzzles, and intriguing storyline make it a must-play for any science fiction or horror fan.", "timestamp_created": 1679553282, "timestamp_updated": 1679553282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135211414": {"recommendationid": "135211414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160467746", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1679549168}, "language": "english", "review": "Just an amazing game, and an amazing story.

literally freaking out abt how good it is. like, there's no other game like soma. i played this once, & playing it the second time, i'm still as astonished, i question my existence everyday, & this game makes me question it even more. like, at the end of the day everything is meaningless if you think abt it, & you never really think abt how the things around us make us human, not just who we are. the game is really deep, really philoshopical, & this isn't good in the \"i'm cool, hipster, edgy\" kind of way, like it's really good. like, really, really, good. like, more games should be like this. i'm not paticularly a gamer myself, & i've never really felt like this after finishing a story mode game, but i just freaking love it. it's kind of slow at the beginning, but it's worth it at the end. the game is so beautiful. the light up fishies, or like the deep, lonely, abyss. i just love it. it's amazing. i'm a lonely person, so i really related to it. i think i relate to this game more than what i did when i first played it. there's a lot of things that have happened since then that give me a lot of anxiety, but playing this game helps me realize the importance of it just is, like, ig if you feel bad, you feel bad, & if you're happy, you're happy. in the grand spectral of things, nothing really matters, not me, you, or your family, not even mine, which is scary to think abt, & obv i care abt them, but like damn, it's just crazy to think abt. my mind is BLOWN. it makes me get emotional, it gives me goosebumps, & the ARK in my opinion is my fantasy world i'm in everyday, but i hope it becomes a reality. if you think abt it, we're all kind of the same human being, just with like different storylines. this review is kind of dumb & stupid for a game that's so fricking good & deserves to be played, but trust me when i say this, you'll love it. it's better than portal, it's better than uncharted, it's better than the last of us, this is peak performance here, & you should experience it. i feel like i am nothing without this game, & if i hadn't had played it i would be a different human being, & i wonder what other things i'm missing out on bc i haven't had the experience, but all ik is i'm greatful to say that i experienced soma. soma is the best fricking game ever, like, i don't think there's a movie that has made me feel like this, except maybe buffalo 66, but god damn is this game good. the arguing between simon, & catherine at the end, & right when they leave off on bad terms, catherines program shuts down, & then i bet simon regret what he said. like, it's so real, the dialogue is so deep, so sad, so depressing, & i felt like i was really simon when playing this game. i can not put into words how much i love this game. people could hate this game, i don't care. it could be the most popular game in the world, i don't care, i love it. soma saved me. soma made me realize how microscopic i am in this world, & it's quite comforting, & that i'm not the only one that feels alone, or could have bad things happen to them. i have anxiety about the worst things that could happen to me everyday, & playing this game, & actually playing through the worst thing that could happen, & the fear, the paranoia, the angst, the depressive episodes, idenitity-crisis, it made me feel less alone, & seeing that there was still comforting or beautiful things in this apocalypse made me happy to see if this bad thing that i worry abt every day happening to me. as long as there's someone to talk to, as long as there's nature, as long as there's something to ineract with, as long as there's human connections, we'll never be alone, no matter how bad the things around us change, as long as there's beauty, there's still solace. \n\nmy rating: 10 out of 10. it doesn't get better than this. i really liked simon & catherine's connection, as lonely as it may get, & i think abt the connections i have with people, my family, & how important i hold them now, or more so, since i think i already did, & how i want more, or maybe not. i think as long as i have one good one, or a few good ones, i think that's enough for me to be happy, & i think where i'm at rn, i'm happy with what i have, & i'll forever be greatful for the people i've met, & sure there's bad things that have happened to me, things that make me parnaoid, but if it weren't for those bad things that lead to other bad things, i don't think i would be who i am today, & i wouldn't change that for anything. i fear for the next bad thing, but i think what i gotta do if or when it happens is see the beauty that comes from it anyways, & the things i'll value more when this shit hits the fan, or whatever they say. it's not ideal for this bad thing to happen to me, but i have to find a way to be fine with it, to be fine with burning in the sun.\n\ni told someone i really liked this game, & they said that another game did it better, but i have to disagree. i haven't played bioshock, but it's better than it, same with detroit. this is the best game on the planet, & i just love it to death. this is why i love. i live for things like soma, & there should be more things like :))\n\n(i low key wanna play it again, LMAO, or at least re-watch, or hear other dialogue scenes. i wanna try out mods for this game, or see youtube videos on it. i feel like i haven't done this review justice. i feel like i haven't made myself vulnerable to the max. arguing is intimate. confliction is intimate. telling the truth is intimate. going to someone for help is intiamte. being crazy & writing abt it is intiamte. just say the truth, BRO. & ig the honest answer is i never truly know how i feel, or i do, but i lie to myself sometimes, but this time i'm really not. i think this is one of the things i genuinally love, & always will. it feels like a part of me. i don't wanna be alone. as long as there's someone out there to talk to, i don't think i'll have to fear that, even if it's myself. i wonder how simon that didn't get sent on the ark is doing out there. i wonder abt that everyday. it's not like he can die. ig it's comforting that i left that lady on the heart monitor live, so simon can talk to her, that's if she's even still alive. i hope he gets to boot up catherine again. the ending was sad, but also seeing the version of simon on the ark made me really happy, but the real depressing thing here is that they both couldn't have their happy ending. gosh, this game is so good. i could talk abt it for years, LOL! it really resonated with me, y'know? i feel lonely all the time, esp in a socitey that hates, or would hate me if they who ME was. it's comforting seeing how i feel come to life. the monsters in this is how socitey would treat me if they found out who me was, & the fear is how socitey treats me, just how simon fears being eaten by monster, lol) \n\nthe world should be more empathetic, but i mean actually. not just for your kind of people you like, but for everybody, even the people you hate. it's part of the reason i want to move overseas. i hate it where i'm at rn. i want to be free. i don't wanna lose the coin toss, dude :((\n\nthis has been me, yours truly, salsa fresa signing off, & i'll see you in the next one\n\ni love you C:", "timestamp_created": 1679547308, "timestamp_updated":

SOMA also delves into tech and ideals of our fragile shells with the human existence being a somewhat daunting lifespan. making philosophy come to life in fiction and formed around the concept of transhumanism. \nSOMA is not your typical jumpscare fest or spook-house horror simulator that you can play with your friends on a friday night when you guys are feeling a little bit brave and take turns seeing it through. this experience is meant imo to be played by the individual itself and only the individual as the immersion sinks in more when you're playing the role as simon and being joined by an another character that i won't speak on because her role has a lot to do with the story but she is gonna join you on the journey as much as you can have her around. if you've played this before, you know what i mean by that phrasing. \nthis story if followed carefully and payed with the upmost attention to notes and files on stationed machines to small computer devices, the story really unveils itself when you explore PATHOS-II and it's entirety when progressing. keeping the player intrigued by how crazy everything came to be when everything fell apart once the earth faced it's untimely demise and the surface of the earth for humanity became inhabitable. down to the point where the only people who lasted the apocalypse essentially were the ones placed under water; down in the deep blue sea of the atlantic. with PATHOS-II being their last shelter and only way to stay alive. you come to find out how everything spread from your point on arrival and how to finish the job that set out to continue humanity's legacy when even all hope feels at a loss for the species.\n\nas you can tell lol, i definitely recommend this game not only for the story but even for the linear map segments u get to explore, to the dystopian feeling underground facilities you traverse as you're searching for answers about yourself and the crew that once inhabited the facility. another plus to the game is when it comes to SOMA and it's more focused horror based on the psychological: it's honestly what i really love about a somewhat i'd say walking-sim but still has some steath and a focus on immersion at every corner. something i experience from this game as well with it's setting and imagery is resembles fragments of my days with something like bioshock. but really, the only comparison that can be made here in between is the setting itself as i don't really find the first bioshock scary as it sorta was classified as when it originally came out. i guess you can also compare the fact that both games as well start out as a blank slated individual who discovers the truth of ones self and see just complete and utter destruction all around to give off that hopelessness and driven anxiety lurking in the shadows. \nafter all, this game has kept and stayed in my mind for awhile now considering how meaningful and also interesting the narrative can get with it's themes while making you feel scared in a sense of false reality but you know that this game is scary from another stand point that stays away from anything of the supernatural and monster variety. give it a try if you're into experiences like this, frictional games are known to make some great horror experiences as in the past once established games like the amnesia series.

This is a story-rich, psychological horror game, and that's a 9.5 / 10 for me. \n\n\n[b]I'm not gonna spoil the lore and story, cos the story would lose its impact if you don't experience yourself[/b]\n\nThis is probably the only game that makes me feel I got the best and worst ending possible at the same time...\nIt's very thought-provoking, dreadful, yet somehow bittersweet. Nevertheless, it will still make you question your own life, your mind and believes. I really love when horror games do this, instead of infinite jump-scares right at your face (which ngl is effective at first, but wears down very fast afterwards), the concept of the horror itself lingers in your mind for days, weeks, or heck, maybe the rest of your life. The [b]Psychological Horror[/b] is what makes SOMA so special.\n\n[b]Just one single nip-pick tho...[/b]\n\nThe only problem I have with the game is that the gameplay is a bit lacking, like the whole game is basically just hiding / running away from monsters. Well I mean technically, we did get some intractable items to distract enemies, though it's only useful to some extent ([spoiler]like when we got to the sound-based monsters, Akers and Proxies[/spoiler]). But I really appreciate the monster designs, each and every one of them looked and act very distinctively, yet are all equally disgusting and terrifying. I just wish some of the monsters could stay and chase the player a bit longer, just to make the game a tad bit more challenging, especially towards the end ([spoiler]like the swimsuit monster, Jin Yoshida had a great entrance, my mind basically went from 0 to 100 the moment the door opened and reveal this new entity, but turns out it took me like 2 mins to complete that section and never saw him again[/spoiler]). It feels like the difficulty curve has stagnated during the last third of the game ([spoiler]i.e. after the Akers and Proxies[/spoiler]), which is a bit underwhelming tbh.\nBut hey, I understand that implementing more complicated gameplay mechanics or harder enemies would probably distract us from the master-class story it delivered, so I'd say the game did its job good enough.\n\nOverall, despite the small gameplay variety problem, SOMA's immersive atmosphere and terrifying story is what make me, and many others sold on the game.

There are sections where you need to evade somewhat exploitable monster AI, though I still liked the atmosphere and ambiance. There is a \"safe mode\" you can use to avoid the whole monster thing.\n\nBut the best part of the game is the story, which it heavily focuses on throughout the game. It's even woven into the gameplay with constant necessary moral choices. I won't go into detail, because if you haven't played the game, you really should play it completely blind. Unfortunately, I had spoilers, but even then, the exploration of consciousness and existentialism has stuck with me for years, before I even finished the game. It's something I think about at night when I can't sleep. That is the real horror -- the horror that goes beyond the scary monsters.\n\nI strongly recommend this game if you are a fan of undersea horror, story driven gameplay, or want an existential crisis that drives you into the depths of despair.

In the end, Soma was everything I thought it couldn't be and more, and I can't say enough good things about it.

And I mean this. I usually don't care about trigger warnings but this one I feel is very warranted. \n\nThere are two different stories being told. The very simple not very scary surface story, and then the actually existentially terrifying, real story between the lines of everything. This game relishes is atmosphere and subtly, through environmental story telling, audio logs, emails, and the brilliance of the voice actors. \n\nThe gameplay is fairly light with basically no combat, a few puzzles most of which are pretty easy but one in particular I remember being quite difficult but in a good way. There are only a few enemies in the game that only exist in certain parts of certain levels, but they all have unique ways of dealing with them. This isn't a survival horror game like Dead Space, or RE, with ammo and health drops all over, fighting hordes of zombies. There's no guns. There's no inventory. You only have a few items on you at any given time and they're either your omnitool (door opener primarily) or things used for the puzzles.\n\nThe real star of this game are the choices you have to make. Not dialogue choices, like in an RPG or choices of what path to go down. This game is as linear as you can get. By choices I mean actually morally gray choices about humanity, what it means to be human, what counts as a human experience, and things like this. Different choices don't change the outcome of the level or anything, but rather how you feel about what you had to do in order to progress to the next level. Also this game's story could only work as a video game because of this. Watching a character in a movie do these things doesn't have the same weight as you the player, with agency, doing these morally questionable things in order to complete the greater goal for humanity.\n\nMinor context-less spoliers maybe for this next one.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThere also isn't really a villain in this story. It's simply technology doing exactly what we programmed it to do, and getting way out of hand. Such as AI being tasked with keeping humanity alive.

That seems cliche to say, like there are many other movies and games that have this same theming, but I'll contest that this is the absolute best one. The topic shapes every memorable moment of the game. It is refreshing to see the topic explored so thoughtfully and expressed in such a beautiful way.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly stealth interspersed with puzzles and story. When enemies are anywhere near you will see static on the screen. They will not kill you instantly, but I think at most I ever took was 3 hits before dying or healing. It's not the most impressive to me in regards to gameplay, but I think this is effective to making the kind of horror they are going for. However I think it's worth saying that some people will be deterred by this system. Really it's fine, it works and didn't bother me much to have to start from a checkpoint. If you really hate it though there is an Easy mode that turns off deaths. The only problem is you might never bother learning how to get past each enemy and as a result not see the fun in it or even worse get frustrated by brute forcing.\n\nI guess I could nitpick. The checkpoint system is event based and made repeating a couple areas frustrating when I die, the sneaking forces you to be slow sometimes when you do play it how it wants. Yeah, but as I said, nitpicks. Nothing that deterred me from very much enjoying the game.\n\nThis game has great story-telling, immersive isolation, grand sights and various fun puzzles.

The lighting is superb even for today. The level design is next level and gives every area its own story. The creature design is top tier and fits the game perfectly. Also the atmosphere gives you a heavy feeling of dread and despair. If I had to nitpick, I would say that being inures kinda blurs that screen which can be pretty annoying, but besides that the graphics are top tier in my opinion.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83c\udfaeGameplay[/td]\n        [td]SOMA has pretty simple gameplay mechanics. You can interact with many objects, giving a great immersive experience for the player. There is no combat in this game, which some may not like, but it fits the game perfectly. The puzzles are pretty simple and don't halt the gameplay or pace in any way. The level design is very simple so pretty much impossible to get lost, but you must pay attention as you won\u2019t get an objective marker in this game. Being attacked doesn\u2019t really feel punishing in this game. It will take three to two knowdowns to kill you, even then the checkpoints are pretty frequent and you will rarely die. The game is pretty easy, with little to no challenge in my opinion. It\u2019s not a bad thing since this game a story focused, but if you are looking for a challenge, you won\u2019t get it here.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udcdcStory[/td]\n        [td]This is where the game truly shines. SOMA has such a unique and engaging story. Probably one of the better horror game stories I have played yet. It\u2019s sad, mysterious, and dark. It does everything so well in terms of storytelling. I would say if you want to experience true story telling, you have to pick this game up. It\u2019s so incredible in every way. It never gets dull and the pacing is perfect. Simon is such a well constructed protagonist. He\u2019s relatable, and you can feel the pressure he is in. The desperation and sadness he presents really adds to the experience. The story is just so incredible in every way and I'm so happy I got to experience this game.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]\ud83d\udd5bPlaytime[/td]\n        [td]The main story was around 15+ hours of playtime for me.

It\u2019s so well done and I couldn't find any bad scenes from him. The music is truly haunting and fits the game perfectly. The monsters sound really scary, and the areas you explore make some really creepy noises that keep you on edge.

After seeing that a Safe Mode was added during an eye-catching 90%-off sale recently, I snagged it.\n\nAs far as the game goes, it has most of your usual Frictional mechanics: \"manually\" opening and closing doors and drawers, minor puzzles, stealth, and avoiding eye contact with disfigured monsters lest they insta-kill or occasionally mercifully just KO you. However, there's a much tighter focus on storytelling here...more Penumbra than Amnesia, if you will. While the thought experiments aren't exactly new, the narrative still provides plenty of fodder for philosophical reflection or discussion, even if you have a more faith-based view of what constitutes humanity and eternity. I strongly suggest playing the game blind first, then doing a second playthrough after reading the wiki and additional canon text and videos provided by the devs before the game's release.\n\n[u]To clarify Safe Mode[/u]: Monsters still react to your presence, but are generally unable to actually attack. As such, they can still be pretty intense if you feign playing normally. Note that there is one unavoidable scripted attack, and there was a late-game enemy that did hit me, though no damage appears to have been caused.\n\nNote that the nudity tag on the game refers to barely discernible genitalia on some enemies which you won't ever see in normal circumstances.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n+Great ambience\n+Voice actors are really good\n+Each enemy has different AI\n+Safe Mode lets you explore for story with little threat\n+Great story.

Not sure why this is billed as a survival horror game. There's not really anything to survive, and very little in the way of horror or even tension - I came across a couple of 'enemies' but just walked past them. Indeed, if I'm being honest, there isn't much 'game.' \n\nIt feels like a successor to the point and click adventures of the yesteryear, just without the puzzles. Or possibly to the FMV games of the 90s. You basically walk down a long corridor / tunnel / stretch of sea bed, find the thing you're supposed to click, and get another bit of exposition. And then you're on to the next corridor / tunnel / stretch of sea bed to find the next thing to click and get a bit more of the story. \n\nAs other reviews have suggested, maybe it's better viewed as an interactive novel. It's just that, while it's got some interesting themes and decent writing, there's not *that* much there. It's padded out with an awful lot walking but, if you strip that out, you've got a short story at most; not really enough even for a novella. \n \nOverall, I found myself struggling to remain engaged with it, got about half way through and just googled a summary of the plot. I can't help think it might have been better done as a graphic novel. Ps - If you're really invested, there's collections of the various cut scenes on youtube.

I religiously avoid anything with a [i]horror[/i] tag, so this has gathered dust in my library for [i]years[/i].\n\nBut...I'm glad I played it. SOMA is a tale of personal discovery, a story of overcoming adversity, and a journey of partners struggling across a finish line with no celebration on the other side. SOMA will test your mind in ways that were unique in my limited experience. Besides boundless tension, a perpetual sense of dread, and utter nightmare fuel for any submechanophobes, SOMA's true horror lies in its narrative. SOMA will question your humanity, present decisions which make up your mind, then questions it again and again ad nauseum until you've no will left to decide. While you wrestle with your own sense of self, SOMA leaves [i]dozens[/i] of set-pieces and story bites for you to collect. Each adds depth to the environment, a heft to the story, and a sense of helplessness as you watch over corpses while the story of their demise unfolds.\n\nIf the setting doesn't add enough tension for you, the \"monsters\" certainly will. These enemies are divisive. On one hand, you have an external force pushing you through a level - transforming a simple exploration into a delicate stealth operation. On the other hand, how much value did that add to the game? Though the fear dissipates quickly once you understand how they work, that initial scare stays with you. It makes every new encounter more threatening, each dialogue reference more damning. A face to a necessary evil with a name.\n\nThis entire game is a well-orchestrated tragedy whose only resolution is what [i]you[/i] think it should be. Dialogue will end with a period, but the story ends with a question mark.

The story often challenges you to think the definition of humanity, ethics and the meaning of existence and acceptance. It is really intriguing to see a game questions you how you perceive as a human.\n\nWell the horror part of this game is still decent to go through. SOMA is more of a psychological horror. Most of the tension and stress come from the very well-crafted environments of PATHOS-II and the surrounding of constant shrieks and eerie noises. Theta station is definitely the best the game gives. It is just a pity that the monsters in this game are not really challenging to handle at all and the game is pretty easy to finish. So your ultra-gamer instincts ain't much of a use here.\n\nBut afterall as I said, it is a very narrative driven game and Frictional Game clearly wants to captivate you into finishing the story instead of stucking you with some terminators in a room.

Most of them are not repeated more than a couple times. While it can occasionally be frustrating trying to figure out how they work, the unique behaviors of the various enemies made them more memorable and engaging. If you would rather not have to deal with any enemies at all, the game has an option to make them passive, which I appreciate. I am unsure if this can be enabled/disabled mid-playthrough. \n\nThe exploration/narrative sections between these encounters help manage the pacing of the game - I would estimate roughly 20% of my playtime was spent under threat and the remaining 80% doing other things. As someone who likes to look around every nook and cranny, there was plenty for me to interact with here.

The game presents us with body horror by allowing us to see the ways that the structure gel has been merged with the human body as the WAU has struggled to save humanity. The mangled and twisted forms of the organic within the machine helps further blur the line between what is human and what is a construct. The low lighting goes a long way to increase the game's tension and dread. But despite the fact that most of what we are seeing is rather horrific, the graphics are beautiful. This is a visually stunning game. \n      The music masterfully augments the tone of dread and tension within the game. There are times that nothing happens but a music change and you find yourself feeling filled with anticipation for what could be lurking around that next corner. The ambient sounds within the game are brilliant. The creaks and groans of the station make you constantly question what you are hearing. Is that something moving about or is that just the shifting station noises? The subtle organic sounds of the structure gel infested humans who are now fully merged with the machine add another layer to convince you that there is no separating them now. And when you hear the foot steps of the murderous robot around the corner? Well, you definitely appreciate the sound effects of the game in those moments. \n     The story in this game is intense. It takes on big questions like: \"What does it mean to be human?\" and \"Do the ends justify the means?\" The numerous mysteries slowly and masterfully unfold to reveal the true nature of the world and the events that you find yourself caught up in. There are plenty of additional story bits embedded into the game for you to discover. There are tapes to listen to, computer files to browse, paper files to read, art work to view, photos to see, dead bodies to find, buffered data to listen to and locations to explore that all further expand upon the story of the game. Each piece that you discover increases the depth of the story, making finding these story gems a major motivation for exploring every nook and cranny within the game. \n     This game offers a large world that is clearly bigger then what is presented in the game itself. All the history that is woven into the game through the various story bits further reinforces the sense that this is complete world with a full history and full compliment of characters to populate it. Everything about the world setting enriches the tone and themes that are presented in the game. It is clearly a world that has fallen into a state of decay, but within it there are remaining fragments that suggest there is a little hope to save something of humanity. \n     The setting is built in a labyrinth style format that forces the player to wander around in order to find what they need to get into the next part of the game. I frequently found myself getting lost while I was wandering in this game as I have a poor sense of direction and was often trying to navigate while there was pressure being applied by a murder bot. There were numerous times in the game that I didn't feel it was clear what I was supposed to be doing next to move the action forward or to get to the next part of the world. I felt this was a point of frustration for me and detracted from the overall game experience. \n     The player character, Simon, is a relatable person. He is just an every day guy that has been pulled into this chaotic world and now has to decide if saving a scrap of humanity is worth all the suffering he must endure. He is na\u00efve and perhaps in a constant state of denial through out the game. As he discovers more about the state of his existence, he has to struggle with what it means to be human and has an existential crisis. What purpose and meaning can there be in a world that is nothing but the remnants of a dead race? \n     The primary non player character of the game, Catherine, accompanies and guides Simon as he journeys through this world. She is even less human than Simon; possessing no body and being rather removed from her emotions. She holds a great deal of knowledge that Simon lacks, but often fails to provide that information to him until he has already come upon in some fashion himself. Catherine is calculating and manipulative, using Simon to reach her objective of launching the ark. Like everything else, he is just another means to an end.\n     The remaining cast of characters that Simon interacts with are the various other machine-human hybrids that populate the world. Some are hostile and attempt to harm Simon, but most are indifferent of his existence. There are also those that present him with moral struggle as he must decide who lives and dies. There is also an entire cast of characters that is presented through the history of the story that you discover along the way. Simon bears witness as they struggle and fail to save humanity. \n     The level of challenge in this game felt appropriate to the style of game. Additionally, it offers the option of changing the level of difficulty at the start of the game so that you can tailor your gaming experience to your style of play. The challenges presented in this game are in the form of the puzzles and the murderous inhabitants wandering within the world. You are given no means with which you fight them, so your only option is to effectively run and hide from them all while you scramble to figure out how to get into the next section of the station. \n     The controls were easy to use and well set up. Within the settings there are options that allow you to modify the key bindings for a better playing experience. It is also compatible with both the key board and a controller. Having all of these options available makes it so that there is likely a comfortable way for you to control your character through the game. In the beginning of the game, there is a scene that allows you to learn how to navigate the world and control your character without being presented with any threats. This is a great opportunity to get the controls set up in an ideal format.\n     This game is a hide and seek horror game. There are numerous other games in the same genre. What this game brings to the table that makes it stand out is ethical dilemmas that the game presents you with. There are numerous times that Simon must decide what to do with the possibility of causing another being harm or even killing them. There are no clear right or wrong answers offered by the game. Making these choices one way verse the other has no impact on the way that the story progresses. Rather, these ethical dilemmas are presented as being a fundamental part of human life and a necessary part of living. They further reinforce the themes that the game presents.\n     This game is a heavy hitter when it comes to emotional impact. The ethical dilemmas and questions that it presents further that emotional impact. We see and hear characters dying. We discover numerous dead bodies. There are many creatures that were once human who are now to some degree also a machine. All the running and hiding from the creatures that would harm you also serves to heighten the emotional response to this game. \n     For me, the replay value of this game is in the story itself. The story presented in this game is rich and complex with numerous additional bits to be discovered or missed as you move through the game. Playing the game additional times offers the same benefit as rereading a great book. Moving through the story a second time allows you to see the story unfold with the perspective of the conclusion. Each time you play through the game there is the possibility of gathering up bits of story that you missed on previous plays. There is also the option to play the game at an increased difficulty, making the creatures you face more deadly and pursue you more heatedly. This doesn't appeal to me personally, but it is there for some as a replay value.", "timestamp_created": 1675976509, "timestamp_updated": 1675976509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132488526": {"recommendationid": "132488526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274243562", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 784, "last_played": 1680818656}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm gonna say it.
