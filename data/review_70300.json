Terry Cavanagh clearly knows how to introduce players to concepts, gradually building up from the very simple to the more advanced, keeping the player engaged as things get tough. VVVVVV does a really good job of hinting at solutions to various puzzles using room names (e.g. Prize for the Reckless) for those paying attention. The game is also good at hammering home the point that the trinkets are completely optional, so no-one wanting to just rescue the crewmates and reach the credits wastes time and effort.\n\nVeridian controls really well, but not being so tight that the game becomes easy. His hitbox, and those of the various hazards, are pretty fair as well, so players shouldn't end up hating the game because of difficult passages, but rather their own motor skills.\n\nThe in-game map does a good job of helping you uncover everything you need and hints at how to get from A to B, since the wrap-around nature of the world doesn't always make this explicit.\n\nOn the whole, VVVVVV isn't difficult if you just want to reach the credits.

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. (in lower pitch) Fuuck! (in slow-mo, with the word coming out of his mouth) FUUUCK! (sticks the middle finger at the TV, drops controller, stutters) FUCK! (grabs TV and yells) DIIIIIIIIIIIIE! (in super-slow motion): FUUUUUUUUCKEEEEEEEEEEERS! (Cuts to him in his kitchen) You tried to help me now, man?! (shoves his head into a cabinet)\n\n(shows the game cart to the viewers) Well, let me be honest with you about this one. Ooh boy, I HATE this game. I mean, it makes me wanna kill myself. Now, the only comforting thing to know is that everybody seems to share my frustration. Karate Kid is a game, that has haunted many of our childhoods. I mean, everybody has the same story: \"I loved the movie, so I got the Nintendo game, and I couldn't stand it, yet I had to keep on playing it, because I had to beat it.\" So, what is it about this game, that's drawn so many unfortunate kids to turn into bitter adults, reminiscing on their angry childhood; screamin' at the TV, throwin' the controllers? I mean, anybody who has beaten this incredibly hard piece of shit will not have any sense of satisfaction but, rather regrets, because it is a complete waste of fuckin' time. I mean, it's like coming out of a brutal fight, being the winner, but achieving nothing for all your troubles but some bloody bruises and broken bones. It's just not worth it.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the control is so awkward. You have to press Up to jump, which doesn't really help because you can only go straight up in the air. He has... you ha-you gotta be like absolutely still, and if you touch an enemy, ya fly in the opposite direction. You can't get close enough to really attack anybody. You die in every pit and it's so easy to fall into them. So every time you get hit near a pit you're basically dead.\n\nLevel one is ridiculously easy. You just fight one-on-one and then you kick the shit outta everybody, and there you go, you win. Do it again, and again.\n\nNow level two is where we get to the side-scrolling gameplay. It's almost a ripoff of Kung Fu, but much worse.\n\nEvery once in a while there's these stupid bonus stages which are next to impossible. Man, I think it's pretty safe to say that it would be easier to do this in real life.\n\nNow when you get to level three, there's a typhoon, so the wind keeps pushin' ya back, and if that's not enough, there's these twigs and birds flyin' through the air. Every possible projectile hurts you and makes ya fly back, and there's pits everywhere.\n\nI hate this game, but why am I playing it? Well, that's the question everyone has asked theirselves. And they all have the same reason: because you're angry and you wanna win. You wanna beat the Nintendo, but the cold fact is that nobody cares but you.\n\nThen you get to level four and holy shit, is it hard. You can't get near anybody to attack them, and they all have these long spears that make ya fly back. You can sometimes hit people when you're walking uphill, but when you're goin' down, you can't really attack low enough to hit them. They're all basically just bullying up on ya, and they just knock ya all around and there's nothing you can do.\n\nAnd guess what? That's the last level, and if you were expecting some big ending to be worth all your trouble, well you're wrong. The only thing that happens at the end is that Mr. Miyagi winks. What a piece of shit.\n\nMan, I guess they decided because the game's only four levels long, it better be the hardest four levels ever. Well, how 'bout this, how about if I made a game where there's just this one cliff you have to jump over and it's like nearly impossible, but if you do it, you win the game and that's it. I mean, what the hell were they thinkin' with this piece of shit? What the hell? Now, if you're a serious Nintendo collector, do yourself a favor, don't get this game, because it's not worth it. I mean, it's made many lives miserable and, y'know, if you see it on sale for a dollar, just stay away. Don't even touch it.\n\n(spits on cartridge and flushes it down the toilet.)", "timestamp_created": 1692141315, "timestamp_updated": 1697747775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143747241": {"recommendationid": "143747241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322175268", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 602, "last_played": 1692306699}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1691622987, "timestamp_updated": 1691622987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143666212": {"recommendationid": "143666212", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967815270", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 167, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1450307101}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming and devilishly simple but challenging puzzle platformer by Terry Cavanagh (Dicey Dungeons, Super Hexagon). \n\nYou can move left and right but instead of jumping you flip gravity, a simple mechanic but explored in a variety of interesting ways to its fullest extent across the different areas of the game.

Every screen builds on and twists the mechanics with such genius and unpredictability that it's impossible to get bored. The difficulty is high, but made manageable by abundant checkpoints and the platforming being centered around creativity instead of precision. My only nitpick is that there were a few times I was lured into activating a checkpoint that was placed after a trinket, with no easy way to backtrack. This meant I would have to return later and redo some of the platforming to collect it. I don't agree that the game is too short. There's no filler and plenty of replay value with the trinket collecting, time trials, secret achievements, flip and no death modes, and level editor.\n\nWhen indie platformers are brought up, Shovel Knight and Celeste receive the most attention. VVVVVV should be part of that discussion. It's a perfect example of how focusing on one mechanic can still surprise players in unexpected ways. I'm shocked indie devs don't do this more often since designing several dozen unique mechanics is not only very demanding, but it also invites comparisons to platformers that often do it better, like Mario 3 and Yoshi's Island.", "timestamp_created": 1689821831, "timestamp_updated": 1689821831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142425775": {"recommendationid": "142425775", "author": {"steamid": "76561199103795962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 284, "last_played": 1689849052}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego es dios", "timestamp_created": 1689796814, "timestamp_updated": 1689796814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142407253": {"recommendationid": "142407253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267790326", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1688117362}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo curioso es como conoci este juego primero el personaje lo conoci por super meat boy luego por un tiempo me lo tope y es buen juego.", "timestamp_created": 1689775645, "timestamp_updated": 1690030832, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578178465366363525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142389465": {"recommendationid": "142389465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360162863", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1691532263}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm flipping out over here!

Even though the game is only a few hours long, everything besides the gameplay is only ok, so I don't think going for multiple playthroughs is worth it.\n\nAfter doing a second playthrough of the game with a bunch of randomized elements the game was more fun than I thought it was.

The chiptune soundtrack is perfect; I could listen to it for days and not get tired of it. The controls are great; being able to control Viridian with very little sliding and also freely midair is a wonderful feel. The difficulty is very well handled--nothing too hard nor too easy, and it gives you the option to play in a no death mode as well as challenges.

You've got to be joking.\n\nI believe that this game excels in almost every aspect.\nThe music in this is well constructed, and worth listening to outside of the game if it's your type. They generally will match the overall aesthetic and vibe of the area you are playing in.\nThe graphics are nice, and for 8 pixel by 8 pixel textures, they are pulled off quite well.\nThere is a free to use, powerful level editor built right into the game, with scripting capabilities along with full size game potential within it. There are external editors too, which if you're interested you can research yourself.\nAs far as I know, this was the first flip-gravity-instead-of-jumping platformer game, which is a unique mechanic for a platformer.\nIndividual mechanics are introduced and the difficulty gradually goes up, and provide a decent challenge without overwhelming you.\nCollectibles are mostly placed in good locations, however some are exponentially harder or easier to obtain than others.\n\nThere are a few levels that are not as good as others, but the final level is a huge issue. It is considerably harder than all the levels previously and doesn't put a good ending impression on any player. It also doesn't build too much on the story because it reuses elements that were already used in story building.\n\nOverall, it's very fun to play through the first time, and is also very replayable with flip mode, or just going for a lower death count or a speedrun. It's also pretty easy to get into level building, and playing other people's levels (though I would not recommend the in-game editor for this.)\n\nMy final verdict is an 8.5/10 [Very good]", "timestamp_created": 1668990766, "timestamp_updated": 1674758604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125847052": {"recommendationid": "125847052", "author": {"steamid": "76561199048661372", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1700789181}, "language": "english", "review": "For what it sets out to do, I can say that this game has it's priorities straight and it nails them straight in the kisser, making a pretty fun platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1668983674, "timestamp_updated": 1668983674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125802607": {"recommendationid": "125802607", "author": {"steamid": "76561199163881626", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4005, "last_played": 1692085868}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1668929557, "timestamp_updated": 1668929557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125595355": {"recommendationid": "125595355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268693083", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 922, "last_played": 1691630031}, "language": "english", "review": "i really like thi game guyz", "timestamp_created": 1668638117, "timestamp_updated": 1668638117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125561060": {"recommendationid": "125561060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257546218", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1676786461}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun challenge that gives you a sense of accomplishment when you clear a difficult part.", "timestamp_created": 1668585023, "timestamp_updated": 1668585023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125356937": {"recommendationid": "125356937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314679778", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1668945198}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable experience, coin collections was fun :)", "timestamp_created": 1668267342, "timestamp_updated": 1668267342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125349131": {"recommendationid": "125349131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198869052899", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1684504186}, "language": "english", "review": "Please take breaks while playing this game.

Fortunately, controls are responsive, there is no input lag, and as far as the challenge goes, at no point did I feel it was overly challenging (I did not get all tokens; apparently there's a super challenging token to grab, not my cup of tea).

I coin the most prominent offender \"The Epilepsy Elephant\", to which a giant flashing elephant is in a room without warning. While I don't suffer from Epilepsy, even my eyes were burning at this. Similarly, many rooms could give you a headache if you have trouble handling continuously spinning objects or rooms moving independently to the background.  \n\n[h1] Should you buy?

VVVVVV is the best RPG I have played. The characters are so compelling and so life like that it puts Ubisoft to shame. \n\nYou play as Captain and he travels through dimensions to save his lost crew and other dimensions. The captain and his crew must have been motion captured into the game since the movements are so lifelike. At first the story seems slow, but it is all just to set up this amazing discovery of who the Captain really is, who is crew is and why this dimension is really collapsing. Even the title, VVVVVV really gets you going that even before you purchased this game the game devs were already dropping hints for you as the player to suspect what this game is really about.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Spoiler Alert////////\n\nNow, for those of you who played the game and actually paid attention to the subtleties of the story line, I want to give you elite a philosophical nugget to chew on. I would like to propose that each dimensional area that The Captain visits, no each screen pan, is a reflection of the Captain's heart while he is on the hunt for each of his crew members. So not only do the dimensions reflect the inevitable doom of our universe, but it also reflects the sometimes more subtle brokenness of our hearts. For this reason, when the crew are all back together again on the Captain's ship, where the rooms make sense, it reflects a wholeness in community which is what I think the secret ending meant.

It's extremely fulfilling and fast paced, with no fluff at all, fast restarts, and frequent checkpoints. Even the hardest parts of the game probably won't take too much of your time, compared to other games with common flaws such as slow death animations and respawns, infrequent checkpoints, and just generally taking way too much time to do things that this game does well. There is also a breadth of postgame content and challenges, including a level editor with the option to import even MORE levels.\n\nFinally, after years of being a complete experience, the game was recently updated with bugfixes and improvements, including an increase from 30fps to whatever-the-heck-you-want fps, and a whole frame of input lag sheered away. This is due to the game's code being made open souce and multiple community members contributing to it, refining the original spaghetti code into the best version of the game, outshining the excellent 60fps console ports. It also includes the options to play the game with the original bugs unfixed, at 30fps, or with the extra frame of input lag, if you really want to play with any or all of those things.\n\nAnd of course, the base game has always, and will always be, outstanding. An amazing achievement in game design, with charming graphics and one of the best soundtracks of any video game I've ever heard. There is no reason to deprive yourself of this experience for any longer than you need to. Play this game.

Instead of attacking/jumping like in a traditional platformer, you get around by utilizing a unique gravity shifting mechanic. With this feature, the experience constantly feels challenging yet fresh and exciting - there will be moments where you have to shift over disappearing platforms, avoid spikes or dodge obstacles. At times, there will be bouts of trial and error that will frustrate you, but that quickly disappears once you learn what you're supposed to do (it also has a bit of a puzzle element in a way).\n\nOverall though, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys challenging games.", "timestamp_created": 1656887367, "timestamp_updated": 1656887367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929101943969727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118118804": {"recommendationid": "118118804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010737305", "num_games_owned": 1979, "num_reviews": 333, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1657670854}, "language": "english", "review": "i die more than dark souls", "timestamp_created": 1656841380, "timestamp_updated": 1657671283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118102239": {"recommendationid": "118102239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330202472", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1207, "last_played": 1656562668}, "language": "english", "review": "Game mechanics are easy to understand, yet the levels provide a fun challenge for beginner and advanced players alike.", "timestamp_created": 1656816674, "timestamp_updated": 1656816674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118100223": {"recommendationid": "118100223", "author": {"steamid": "76561199319958135", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 92, "last_played": 1665717283}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

Lets start off when you open the game. It greats you with new game or continue from night 1. you most likely click night 1 and play the first night. It teaches you awesome mechanics like the mask and the fact that there's no doors. Only three animatronics that attack you and the puppet. Wind up the music box and the puppet wont kill you. The first night is easy and the second night makes you face mangle and foxy. Its still easy but night 3 is where it gets more difficult. Now the withered animatronics are out. They all are the same thing which is put on the mask at the right time. The only one that doesn't apply to is foxy. You need to flash your light at him but you did that in the second night. The third night shouldn't be to hard after a while but the fourth and fifth pick up difficulty. Once you beat the fifth night your mechanics should be pretty on point and a new option appears which is the sixth night. This one is way harder. For me it took a little bit but not that long but for other people it might be way harder. Then once you do that you unlock the custom night. This is where you can set any difficulty for the animatronics. but if you set them all to 20 you do 10/20 mode and if you beat it you get the third star and a bragging right. I haven't done this yet because its so difficult but its possible. There's also secret death mini games and some show the man behind the slaughter. So thats my review for VVVVVV. Such a fun game with iconic characters like Freddy. I hope you beat 10/20 mode and check this game out.", "timestamp_created": 1656608175, "timestamp_updated": 1656608175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534312725067138672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117894691": {"recommendationid": "117894691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175570841", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 653, "last_played": 1690115415}, "language": "english", "review": "very dank, quite  easy to mod and the fact source code is publicly available is a very fun detail from a computer nerd's POV. solid few hours of gameplay and lots of stuff to master for extra achievements, it's also possible to create your own levels and play levels of others. one could say it's a small game, but it does have a lot of potential", "timestamp_created": 1656548522, "timestamp_updated": 1656548522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642002642154693604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117891793": {"recommendationid": "117891793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046439791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 207, "last_played": 1496023348}, "language": "english", "review": "An indie classic for a reason, short and simple but very well designed.", "timestamp_created": 1656544371, "timestamp_updated": 1656544371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117833337": {"recommendationid": "117833337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122027334", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1656446226}, "language": "english", "review": "VVVVVV?

The flip mechanic is very fun to play with. The OST is amazing. Every track has great quality, they are catchy and hit home. The graphics are simple but lively and colorful. VVVVVV is not that long of a game as it can be cleared in less than 4 hours and that means it will not get tedious overtime, and adding to that, the difficulty is always increasing. Take my word, this game HAS challenge. A few rooms WILL cost you to clear, but overall the game has a fair balance of difficulty. It's not easy, nor unreasonably difficult. The final sections are a true challenge, be prepared to die a lot. The plot is not complex, but it's pretty nice. And also, lore about the dimension where the game happens can be found by reading terminals around. This game has replay value, the scenario is open and well sized for the folks who enjoy exploring, and 20 trinkets scattered around for the folks who enjoy collecting itens and collectibles, and the game is challenging for the folks who enjoy challenge. There are even different gamemodes (which I haven't tried myself so I can't really tell what they are) and an option to toggle a timer (great for speedrunners).\n\nWorth every cent.\n10/10\n\nA bit out but kind of a personal take: why did I get attached to the characters?

The soundtrack is a banger and every level can be consistently done with enough practice. The game is very replayable too, with there being some freedom of choice in the order you choose to do the stages. Nothing in this game feels completely unfair or out of your control. VVVVVV playthoughs can last between 13 minutes to many hours based on your skill level or if you are going for all 20 collectibles.\n\nHowever, unlike other platformers, VVVVVV is more trial and error focused as it is nearly impossible to sightread a stage you've been in for the first time. The difficulty is comparable to similar hardcore-platformers as well, as touching any obstacle results in instant death. As a result, this will require you to remember many areas of the game and learn various strategies in order to do them consistently. Memorization is very crucial if you are going for the time trial achievements or the games hardest difficulty, No-Death mode. \n\nIn my and many other's experiences, 1 particular minigame known as \"The Gravitron\" sticks out among everything. It is required to play an easier version of this minigame for 60 seconds in the main game and No-Death mode. The problem with it is that the obstacles are partially randomized, which could lead to many cheap deaths, especially in No-Death mode or if you are going for the 1 minute challenge on the much harder version of The Gravitron. On the bright side, this game includes speedrun friendly features, such as an old glitches toggle or an in-game timer. Additionally, there is a built in level-editor and some community made levels come preinstalled.

For about a sandwich in monetary terms, this game is a complete steal.\n\nTerry Cavanagh has once again outdone himself with this title, and after both playing, collecting, and speedrunning this game, it's become clear to me that this is not just a classic, but an all-time great.\n\nHere's a couple of things to note before you go and click the little green \"Add to Cart\" button: [list]\n[*]This game is tough. It isn't exactly \"slam my desk in rage\" tough (except for ONE BIT which I will GET TO LATER), but it has an above-average level of difficulty. \n[*]Yes, I know everyone already knows, but I still need to say it; The soundtrack is a 10/10, and even if you don't buy the game, at least treat your ears to the music. \n[*]Unless you're really going to sink your teeth into this game, expect a few hours of playtime at most. There's a ton of post-game content, and collectibles scattered across the map to boot, but I understand some people just want to see the credits roll.\n[/list]\nSpeaking of collectibles...\nThe trinket hidden in the room, \"Doing Things the Hard Way\" (thanks for the room names Bennett) is one of the most devilish sections in videogame history. I'll let you figure out why. However, that's not why I'm annoyed.\nThe problem is when the game asks you to collect that trinket as fast as you can without dying. There's a reason the \"Space Station 2 Mastered\" achievement has a 0.9% next to it. Same goes for The Lab, but I'd call the \"Pure Unobtanium\" trinket slightly easier.\n\nNow, after you've done all you want to in this game, what's next?\nConsider speedrunning. Here's my elevator pitch:\nWe've got plenty of categories, tight competition in IL runs, a couple of really neat glitches, and finally getting the better of this game is super duper fun.

There were plenty of other things I forgot about this little platforming gem in the decade since I last played it, but the name is definitely the hardest part to stick. I can\u2019t overstate how glad I am I revisited it, though, because VVVVVV is one of the best balances of challenge and chill you can get from indie platformers. It can confound and mystify without frustrating, and always offers you something new to do if you\u2019ve come across a particularly tricky section. And even if you do find yourself starting to fume, the thick layer of charm laid on by the adorable characters and retro stylings is sure to put you back in your comfort zone.\n\nIt\u2019s a disaster\u2026IN SPAAAAAACE! Captain Viridian\u2019s ship has crashed in an unknown sector of the universe, and his crew has been scattered by a mysterious disruption. It\u2019s up to him to reunite the team and figure out what the heck happened to the ship, and fortunately, he\u2019s the perfect person to do it. Not only does he have a winning smile and a can-do attitude, he can also flip his personal gravity at will. That\u2019ll prove invaluable when facing the twisting corridors and yawning voids of this enigmatic place. Each new challenge will push him in different and unexpected ways, and ultimately lead to some big revelations about where his ship ended up, and where it\u2019s going.\n\nVVVVVV has a perfectly serviceable story for the kind of game it is, a framework to hang fantastical platforming and exploration upon. There are terminals dotted about that give a little more context to the story beats that happen from time to time, but again, plumbing the depths of this strange space is the real attraction here. The map is wide open, with a vast Super Metroid-esque landscape sprawling in all directions just outside your ship. From here, tunnels and passageways lead to more discrete sections that present thematic challenges like moving platforms, edge-wrapping mazes, and a particularly harrowing tower ascent. Your crew tends to be tucked away at the ass-ends of each of these areas, and each adds their own little colorful observations about the predicament you find yourself in.\n\nThe platforming is the real star of the show here, because it takes a wonderfully Bionic Commando approach to powerful yet limited mobility. All you can do is run left, run right, or reverse your own gravity while on solid ground. With no discrete ability to jump, a single-tile obstruction can be a greater obstacle than a yawning laser-filled chasm if there\u2019s no clear way to gravity-flip over it. And trust me, the game makes incredible use of this dynamic in all of its areas. Platforming takes on a whole new dimension here, with ceilings becoming just as important as floors and nominally simple jumps turning into an entire process when you can only flip around the extremes of the problem. Some of the challenges are infamous, such as a multi-screen ascent and descent through a spiked gauntlet just to clear a tiny ankle-high wall.\n\nMost importantly, though, is that nothing here is particularly stressful. Aided by the simple, charming art style, VVVVVV is ultimately a very inviting game, even when facing you with a twisting passage of death. Checkpoints are dotted practically every other screen, and retries are instantaneous, meaning you can fling yourself to your doom as much as you want and waste very little time doing it. The hardest challenges are also reserved for the optional collectibles scattered across the world, and even then don\u2019t reach the same heights as some modern metroidvanias in difficulty. A wealth of fast-travel teleporters on top of all this makes it clear that this game can be taken at your pace, as far as you want, as long as you\u2019re having fun with it.\n\nThat was the biggest feeling that flooded back to me when I replayed VVVVVV recently, just how outright fun the whole thing is. I never got stuck anywhere, never raged at any of the challenges, and always had a huge smile on my face when I rescued one of my wayward crewmates. I don\u2019t want to hear any complaints about the pixel art, because the clean lines and stark colors really help emphasize the platforming. The sound design is a perfect match to the retro feel, with big boops and beeps that I love (and I cannot lie). VVVVVV is regarded as a classic for good reason, offering timeless challenge and exploration without ever really pushing you out of that cozy, comfortable space.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

That said, even the tool had some difficulties executing it precisely enough, it was not consistent enough, but I got it after several attempts.\n\nI would still rate the game mostly positively.

But with reviews so overwhelmingly positive, I think negative reviews are lacking.\n\nIf you had a good day, you feel great, and all you want is something challenging to get you focused, stressed, and perhaps even frustrated, before you finish it and become happy again, feel free to try.

"language": "english", "review": "I reviewed this game before with an also negative review, but now that I've actually uh...beaten it, I feel like I should rewrite my review. This game is still pretty bad. \n\nIf I had to describe VVVVVV in one statement, I'd say \"precision platformer on an ice level\". The controls really are the main challenge of the game, and it feels very artificial. Captain Viridian controls like he's made of wet soap, usually taking what feels like (and might even be) half a second to come to a complete stop. You'd think the level designs would account for this, but no; the levels all feel like they were designed with a character with tight controls in mind. That's not even mentioning the fact that things like spikes have hitboxes that seem to actually be bigger than the sprite itself; I've had many instances of death where Viridian is obviously not contacting the spike, but dies anyway. Combine this with the terrible controls, and you get deaths that realistically aren't your fault. YOU didn't input that extra movement, YOU didn't hit the obstacle, and as such, YOU should not have died. But, of course, you do anyway. \n\nWhat sucks more is if the controls were tighter, this would definitely be a positive review, since that's realistically the only problem with the game. Sure some trinkets have really bad placement (Veni, Vidi, Vici is unreasonably hard given the controls, and there are multiple sections that kill you almost immediately upon respawn, which is not good), but by and large the level design is excellent, and would provide a fun (if really big) challenge. That's not even mentioning the fact that the music and graphics are both unmistakably great, especially given it was one of the earlier pixel-indie-game types. The music I especially want to draw attention to (Positive Force goes so hard). The story is simple, but does what you'd expect well.\n\nFinally, and this is especially important to me personally, the game has no cloud saves. There never has been and never will be an excuse to cheap out and not include cloud saves, especially when your game is STILL UPDATED. If you pay money for a game on Steam, it should have cloud saves, regardless of what the game is or how much it costs. They're not a hard feature to implement, and they save SO much hassle for transferring saves between machines. Cloud saves can be added to games post-release too, so that's not an excuse either. \n\nTL;DR, game has slippery controls and no cloud saves, and sadly, despite its great artwork and music, I think those flaws are enough to justify a negative review.

The main objectives of the game are to rescue the 6 crew members all who have gotten lost behind a series of platforming challenges and let me say this game has some pretty hard ones in it. I spent upwards of 40 minutes trying to get a certain trinket in this game (this game's collectibles) and it was driving me crazy. I honestly don't recommend going for all the trinkets if you're playing this game for the first time, just go for the shipmates and you'll have more fun with it, just chill out to the awesome soundtrack and the normal campaign is a breeze.\n\nIt's a quintissential indie game, it's definitely a modern classic in my eyes and I recommend it if you're looking for a challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1639609302, "timestamp_updated": 1639609316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105819236": {"recommendationid": "105819236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199590659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 512, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1518132459}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game and the soundtrack absolutely SLAPS", "timestamp_created": 1639492024, "timestamp_updated": 1639492024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105797028": {"recommendationid": "105797028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375356307", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 138, "last_played": 1639457327}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Malisimo y si un juego es dificil tambien deberia ser divertido, como Cuphead, Geometry Dash", "timestamp_created": 1639450694, "timestamp_updated": 1639450694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105720332": {"recommendationid": "105720332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107772444", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 160, "last_played": 1672680619}, "language": "english", "review": "Terry Cavanagh really popped off with this one.\nGreat every time I return to it, an absolute classic.\n\n10/10 Will one day beat with 0 deaths.", "timestamp_created": 1639330439, "timestamp_updated": 1639330439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539235353469848633", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105644677": {"recommendationid": "105644677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065666577", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 161, "last_played": 1639198335}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you love semi-difficult platformers.

Others say \"V times six\" or \"V six times\".\n\nOk, with that out of the way: In my opinion, this game is:\n\n- An instant platformer indie classic of the same high caliber as Shovel Knight\n\n- And a must buy for every platformer fan\n\nI can't believe I had this game sitting in my library, collecting digital dust, for so long! However, in a way that was a good thing because I got to play it with the August 2021 update. Yup, the game got a (most likely final) update a decade after it was originally released!\n\nVVVVVV was a charming and pretty fun, although somewhat short, platforming experience for me. The main gimmick of this game is that instead of jumping you reverse gravity, and you use that mechanic to traverse and maneuver through the different levels and sections in the game's world / dimension while trying to avoid different kinds of obstacles.\n\nYou will face some easy challenges, some moderate challenges, and a few really hard challenges which will require you to arm yourself with patience! The \"Doing Things the Hard Way\" gauntlet to get one of the collectible trinkets is pretty difficult, but with a lot of practice [b]and mountains of patience[/b], I'm pretty sure you'll be able to eventually complete it.\n\nI enjoyed the game's simple but colorful pixel graphics, I liked the few character interactions here and there, and the music is great! I have no complaints about the controls, except for the fact that Captain Viridian (your playable character) has a bit of momentum when moving, which led to many unintentional deaths... but I guess a bit of momentum is part of the challenge.\n\nVVVVVV also has a number of modes to play and mess around with once you complete the main game, such as Time Trials, Flip Mode, and one fun but pretty hard mini-game you can get if you obtain all the trinkets.\n\nOh, and I also liked how you have to explore the world / dimension in order to find each new level. That was enjoyable, and added a small \"metroidvaniay\" touch to the game, so to speak.\n\nIn conclusion: If you like platformers, I definitely recommend VVVVVV, even at full price (although it tends to go for 75% off during most sales). And if you aren't into platformers yet, I would still encourage you to at least give this game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1635909428, "timestamp_updated": 1635918669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "102109984": {"recommendationid": "102109984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068646901", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1554930671}, "language": "english", "review": "Heard Potential for Everything and decided I needed this game in my life.

Er, V.\n\nA \"hard\" type precision platformer. With Commodore 64 style graphics, or other old computers. Which is cute, it has a bit of that feel, with absolute banger of a soundtrack, and a bit of abstract nonsense of some famed computer platformers with random symbols as enemies that just follow path pattern and random names for each room which can be very cute. Quirky stuff, a mainstay of indies, albeit that elephant was mighty weird in a cool way.\n\n...oh, it's a game where your your main physics action of platformer, that is usually a jump, is replaced with flipping gravity. You can do it only when on the ground, so no, you can't just flip endlessly in air and be like a ghost cheatah. This power is not explained through in-game narrative, no, don't think so.\nMan, I can't believe I almost forgot to mention the main feature of the game, how can I even function and write reviews when I don't force myself to take notes. Answer: barely.\n\nIt's a cute game but compared to other first wave indie games of 2010, all the classics, this one just doesn't really hit the string in any special way or memoriable way. It's short and feels simple and well just just just.\n\nFurthermore, it's kinda not very good at the genre is challenges. Precision hard platformer? Cool, but why in the world is main hero so slippery on the stop then? That has given me too many deaths and haven't led satisfaction on beating hard platformer challenge, not as much. And on top... Escort missions.\nEscort missions.\nEscort missions.\nIn imprecise platformer like that. Now you have to escord a twat who is few steps behind and follows same imprecise physics rules.\nThank gosh for infinite tries.\n\nAt least you don't need to 100% game, just beat main content which isn't as hard as some trinkets. You need to get all trinkets to unlock secret area but it's not a plot-twisting awesome new ending. Sorta has some narrative but primarly bonus stuff area.\n\nSo yes, 6/10. 7/10.

It's hard, even after beating it four times, but checkpoints are all over the place. Thus, while it is hard, it's not terribly punishing (unless you go for the optional collectibles). It's just very satisfying to weave your way through the spikes and other hazards successfully. It's not a very long game (my first playthrough was roughly two hours long) but I personally prefer shorter games like this. With a bit of practice, you can easily beat the game in one sitting. I just played through it again today and got all the optional collectibles in less than an hour.\n\nThe music is also amazing. Honestly some of the best chiptune I've ever heard, and I've listened to a lot of chiptune music.\n\nThe graphics aren't that great, but to be fair, the game is trying to look like its from the Commodore 64. They serve their purpose, and precision platformers don't really offer time to take in the scenery anyways. The recent update to support framerates above 30 FPS helped make the game look a lot nicer.\n\nMy one issue with this game is that the player doesn't move slowly, but this is only an issue if you try to inch your way forward bit by bit. You try for inches but end up getting feet. However, the level design doesn't usually ask you to make small adjustments like this, and if you do get killed by this, you don't get set back very far because the checkpoints are everywhere. This one issue doesn't do much to impact the rest of the game's incredible offerings.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Easily a favorite.

It's elegantly simple, with lots of exploration to be done, and really interesting difficulty spikes. The soundtrack is an absolute joy to listen to, and a massive part of the appeal. \n\nVVVVVV's extremely barebones. All you have are the abilities to move left and right, as well as swapping gravity. The game takes that mechanic to the absolute limit, with so many different types of obstacles and ideas. It's an incredibly simple game with a very simple and short story. I'd say it'll take you 3-4 hours to complete the story. The collectibles may take longer. Haven't tried the level editor, but I'm sure there are some just lovely levels.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it for everyone though, some people may be annoyed with the metroidvania style exploration. It's a good game, but if you aren't invested early into it, you won't be invested later into it. \n\nVeni-Vidi-Vici's impossible too.

A short but sweet story, a lot of difficulty, and fun.\nWarning: If you have epilepsy or bright flashes bother you a lot, don't play this. Bright flashes and changing colours are par for the course.\nIn more detail: VVVVVV is a really neat puzzle platformer. If you don't go out of your way to get all the little things, then the story can be completed in maybe an hour or two. However, completing the difficult challenges is a big part of the fun. The puzzles are smart but not impossible to figure out, and require you to use your skill with the game. A lot like Portal in how it makes you learn a new set of rules, this time for gravity instead of portals. \nYou play as Captain Viridian, the Captain of a starship which has been tossed into chaos, and are charged with rescuing the rest of the crew. Viridian, and indeed the rest of the crew, are represented by little chubby stick figures, and if you're hoping for graphics beyond what you can see in the banner, you'll be sorely disappointed. The art style is very simple. Where VVVVVV shines is in the gameplay; it has several different modes, lots of little challenges, and a decently big map to explore. The story is more of an accessory to the gameplay, but it's enjoyable for what it is.\nI'd say that VVVVVV is kind of like a cross between LaserCat and Portal; metroidvania-style map with tons of rooms, 2D, but with an interesting mechanic which makes it engaging and lends itself to new puzzles, and each level introducing a new element to diversify the puzzles.\nI don't know if I'll be coming back to VVVVVV since I'm not much of one for time trials or no-death runs, but for those who are, VVVVVV has a good few more hours of gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1626454485, "timestamp_updated": 1626454485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95738267": {"recommendationid": "95738267", "author": {"steamid": "76561199072487279", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 969, "last_played": 1659411611}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny pixel person go flip flip\n\nedit: captain viridian 6 hours on the super gravitron :arrow_up_down: :arrow_up_down: :arrow_up_down: :arrow_up_down: :arrow_up_down:", "timestamp_created": 1626285969, "timestamp_updated": 1627962664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55218505859375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95647924": {"recommendationid": "95647924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244869784", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 258, "last_played": 1653619484}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1626160037, "timestamp_updated": 1626160037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95641516": {"recommendationid": "95641516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198184135265", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 629, "last_played": 1694830199}, "language": "english", "review": ":D VVVVVVV!!!! :DD", "timestamp_created": 1626148917, "timestamp_updated": 1626148917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95639119": {"recommendationid": "95639119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174785865", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1583461140}, "language": "english", "review": "I came here from Super Meat Boy.

I actually played through it again a couple months ago, and it still holds up to this review score and to my original perception of the game.  \n\nVVVVVV does not use conventional platformer jumping, instead allowing the player to essentially \"flip\" gravity - when you jump, you'll keep going up until you land on the ceiling - potentially many screens above you, in some areas.  VVVVVV's mechanics and puzzles are quickly intuitive and understandable and each of the 6 main areas uses a new mechanic to add to the basic mechanics of the game.  VVVVVV is difficult but also generally forgiving, allowing newer or less skilled players to approach the game fairly easily and simply work their way through puzzles through by quickly trying over and over again.  At the same time, it allows for more advanced players to challenge themselves through both the basic \"campaign\" as well as through the time trials associated with it.  The overall style of the game is excellent, with fantastic music and excellent pixel art, as well as a sense of humor about itself.  If you haven't played a platformer in a long time, VVVVVV is a great way to jump back into the genre without an overly long commitment (the game can be easily completed by a first-timer in 3-4 hours) or without subjecting yourself to overly punishing and difficult mechanics like some competitors.  If you've enjoyed other PC platformers but you haven't played VVVVVV, its mechanics are fun and unique enough to justify a purchase and will give a skilled platformer a worthwhile playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1620546198, "timestamp_updated": 1620546198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91660247": {"recommendationid": "91660247", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999033616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 86, "last_played": 1618981365}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute little game that has a good balance of fun and frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1620496635, "timestamp_updated": 1620496635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91631818": {"recommendationid": "91631818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091785239", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1744, "last_played": 1654163666}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and simple game with varying degree of challenges.

Two buttons for horizontal movement and one button to [b]flip gravity[/b] (and another for using machines). The game's pretty [b]twitchy[/b] though, but there's an [b]option to slow down the game's speed[/b] if that's a problem for you. You can save at big teleporters or at any time in the pause menue. It's a [b]puzzle platformer[/b], you dodge enemies, avoid spikes and solve the challenges presented to you, sometimes requiring you to actively think about how you approach a situation.\nThe obstacles you face require [b]fast reflexes, dexterity and, above all else, perserverance[/b]. But the game throws [b]checkpoints[/b] at you in almost every room so it is never too hard and [b]always fair[/b]. Should a challenge pose too difficult, you can always go into the options where you can enable an \"invincibility cheat\".\nYou can also use a [b]Controller[/b] if you want to. Personally, I [b]prefer the keyboad[/b], as the twitchy nature of the game demands [b]precise and immediate inputs[/b], like having to press left and right in quick succession, which is easier with keyboards.\n\n[u]GAME WORLD:[/u]\nThe [b]overworld[/b] is a partially non-euclidian [b]maze[/b], that begs you to explore and fill in every tile on the map.\nHidden across the [b]open maze[/b] are mostly [b]linear Zones[/b] that serve as the levels. Each level has a unique theming and expands on a different concept like conveyer belts or lines that switch gravity when touched.\nYou can tackle them in any order you want.\nThe [b]pacing[/b] within the linear levels is great. You never grow bored or exhausted. Outside in the open maze it can naturally vary, as an open structure largly depends on the player for its pacing. The [b]overworld is quite easy[/b], expect for some sudden spike pits, and can be a little boring sometimes. It circumvents this with plenty of teleporters used for [b]fast-travel[/b], even though the [b]world is quite small and dense[/b]. Certain patches of tiles/rooms of the map are just empty as well, which gets disorienting and forces you to look at the map. If they were filled with a handful of random debris it would be easier to tell where you are and you wouldn't have to wait for a dozen seconds of free falling until you can flip again.\n\n[u]MUSIC:[/u]\nThe music is [b]catchy, timeless and nothing short of outstanding[/b]. Souleye managed to create tracks that bring you into a dream like state, soothing most anger, and the pieces range from beautifully melancholic, to just cool and epic, to cheerful, some fast and some slow paced. It feels almost like each track is from a different genre and yet they all fit together seemlessly. If you don't like [b]oldschool pixel game bit sounds[/b], there are power metal versions of the soundtrack made by Souleye  himself online (VVVVVV - MMMMMM) that sometimes put an interesting spin on the original, like Predestined Fate starting with a romantic spanish-ish guitar as the quiet melancholy of low electronic blips doesn't translate well into e-guitar music.\n\n[u]STORY:[/u]\nThe main story in of itself is [b]really simple[/b]: Rescue your lost crewmates. Though there are some [b]minor twists and turns[/b] that keep things interesting in terms of unexpected occurances, no drama between the characters or character arcs. But to those that want more: there are terminals scattered across the desolate dimension serving as [b]worldbuilding[/b], telling you the [b]backstory[/b] of the strange place you found yourself in, giving you bits and pieces and leaving some room for theories and interpretations.\nA shortcomming may be the [b]lack of proper set dressing[/b]. Many areas are said to represent space stations, labs etc. but they all just feel pretty much alike in the sense that everything feels like a videogame level instead of believable places even with a lot of fantasy. But [b]prioritizing level design over visual worldbuilding[/b] is always the right choice for a platformer.\n\n[u]BONUS CONTENT:[/u]\n[b]Challenge modes:[/b] Time trials, no death runs, a vertically mirrored playthrough and a survival challenge. [b]20 optional collectibles[/b] with a [b]worthy completion reward[/b]. And after all that you can make your own game with the [b]level editor[/b]! I haven't really played around with it, but from what I've seen from the creations of other players, [b]you could almost rebuild the main game from scratch[/b] if you wanted to, the only things that SEEM to be missing are the option for the escort missions (don't worry they're actually good) and making autoscrollers (also good), you can even make cutscenes!\nThere are plenty of [b]player created levels[/b] for you to go through. I recommend \"333333 easy mode\" especially, which serves as a spiritual sequel to the main campaign. Be weary of \"Golden Spiral\" though, unless you got a punching bag around.\n\n[u]CONCLUSION:[/u]\n[b]I VERY STRONGLY recommend this game.[/b] The only potential turn off may be the [b]difficulty[/b] that will proof too much for those new to platformers or videogames in general, but that's what the [b]invincibility option[/b] is for. You also have [b]infinite attempts[/b], no Game Overs.\nThe main campaign ( = disregarding bonus content) is [b]short and sweet[/b]. You could get to the end within a single day; the longevity comes from the challenge modes and player levels.\nIt is a [b]puzzle platformer[/b], so you also have to think sometimes to progress, instinctive play won't get you through ALL situations. The only negative I can think of is that the game only shows you one room at a time, which means that when you exit a room the [b]view suddenly snaps to the next room[/b], there's no gradual shift and the game doesn't freeze movement while it shifts, which can potentially be disorienting (the only exception is are a few autoscroller sections, which is way better than it sounds), but I think that may have been intentional and it avoids significant leaps of faith by showing you rooms beforehand that require \"correct falling\".\nThere are [b]accessiblity options[/b]: disable animated backgrounds, disable effects like screen flashes, invinciblity (which causes only minor glitches like a random moving platform being stuck, it won't crash or corrupt your game) and adjusting the game's speed.\nThe vibes from this game have caught me up in a dream time and time again. I am not a mental health professional, but I seriously consider giving this game to someone going through a rough time as the game effortlessly tells a simple tale about positivity and perserverance in a desolate, hostile world without getting obnoxious about it, beating the odds and coming out the other end with a big smile on your face!\nYou definitly get your money's worth here tenfold! The game is also quite small with 70MB and can be downloaded in one or two breaths using my average Wifi at the end of space and time. Even with a singificantly worse connection I reckon it would hardly even take 10 minutes.\n\nA solid V out of 10 :D !", "timestamp_created": 1619434481, "timestamp_updated": 1620133183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668260157108306885", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90865949": {"recommendationid": "90865949", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271147443", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 882, "last_played": 1619321539}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the most difficult games i've ever played, but that's what makes it so much fun. its been years and it still holds up as one of my all time favorite games", "timestamp_created": 1619305829, "timestamp_updated": 1619305829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "90856513": {"recommendationid": "90856513", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007124268", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1586275953}, "language": "english", "review": "Best interestellar interdimensional spacial musical platform game ever.

VVVVVV is at its core a game for gamers. If you like overcoming challenges and achieving a goal with a proneness for difficult progression, I highly recommend VVVVVV, but as it stands this is not the kind of game that I will remember as a holistic experience but simply a simulator for frustration.\n\nYou're supposed to die a lot in this game, but I can't see how falling through a screen with no information only to get spiked and redo this again and again makes for fun gameplay. The mechanic of reversing gravity instead of jumping is brilliant for sure (however narratively nonsensical), but the movement controls are unresponsive and slippery while some rooms are so fast paced you more often than not look at yourself in disbelief that you made it through, like Samuel L. Jackson in \"the miracle\" of Pulp Fiction.\n\nYou're told that some environments represent something, like your spaceship hub world, but the retro visuals are at most a neon bright unintelligible mess of passages (and spikes baaad). The music though is excellently composed with the obvious retro chiptune sound, but keeps a fine balance of high intensity hooks and bittersweet nostalgia.\n\nI did try it out almost 10 years ago but never got very far, and with this review I decided I should return to it as I knew it had obtained quite a cult following. This said, it is not my intent to in any way disrespect those that hold the game in a high regard, but more so give a different take on an already established title and a greater understanding for games in general. Claiming video games are art is a very derogatory approach that revolves around putting the art label on anything that evokes emotion or is close to heart. As in my take, however beautiful a team synergy can be in football it should not be classified as an art because the intent of the practice is at it's core competitive and not reflective, which is inherently the same case with a lot of video games and most notable the earlier we go. As the medium of games has evolved from tabletop interactions to arcade blasters, it entered the digital age. But it always revolved around overcoming obstacles and achieving a goal, hence the competitive side. I would never say that Pac-Man is art, nor would I say that League of Legends is art. But in the wake of creation, much in the same vein of the evolution of moving pictures, the interactivity of games has truly reached the capabilities of an art form such as cinema, music or painting.\n\nImmersion in visuals and audio is a powerful force that conspire with you as a person, which prompts an active process where the object resonates with the subject instead of being a one-sided interaction. The gameplay on the other hand are mostly set up by rules which you abide to, where the mechanics communicate with you what you should or need to know. The multimodality of visuals and audio can instead be told by you (the player) what it should mean, because it is all up to the perception of the medium.\n\nGameplay in itself is not art, but the visuals and audio is, and more so the fusion that is exemplified in a coherent product. VVVVVV is a take on the 80s arcade games, and is by design \"gameplay only\" while the visuals acts as the carriage for said gameplay. What do I want to say with this? It is not my objective to label VVVVVV through a certain criteria, but I rather explain how the intent of the game can be understood as nothing short of a redundant rearview mirror. Leaving the gameplay to the side, VVVVVV functions best as a nostalgia trip but is through it a sorry impression of a gone by time. A time when games operated by the means of limitations in technology and not intellectual property. VVVVVV doesn't try to be anything else than a retro fling when so many games in the same age took giant leaps for the indie scene. This doesn't invalidate the developer's work and the strive of the indie company, but only exemplifies the hollowness of VVVVVV when standing next to titles that were released the same year (2010), such as Super Meat Boy (which is another difficult retro platformer) or more cerebral and slow-paced games like LIMBO. This said, VVVVVV still works as an arcade game that is appreciated for the satisfaction of \"winning\", but that is not why I play games.\n\n\n[b]4/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1615305943, "timestamp_updated": 1615311987, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586000442504882813", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88123754": {"recommendationid": "88123754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123982133", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 233, "last_played": 1694958410}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1615284130, "timestamp_updated": 1616240540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88120370": {"recommendationid": "88120370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820363075", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1649950062}, "language": "english", "review": "A highly replayable, fun and simple platformer where instead of jumping you flip the gravity.\n\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1615278007, "timestamp_updated": 1615278007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88119404": {"recommendationid": "88119404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197605493", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 487, "last_played": 1637066105}, "language": "english", "review": "This certainly is an interesting game. I like the mechanics, being able to flip instead of jump is a really interesting idea. The fact that I paid $5 and got 8 hours out of this game, during which I fully %100'd it twice (once normally, once in Flip mode), and I don't have nearly all the achievements really goes to show the insane replay value they managed to cram into this little indie game from 10 years ago now.\n\nThe graphical style is great, I've always been a sucker for \"retro\" graphics. What amazes me is that they went the whole 9 yards in that styling. Most games with a \"retro\" style seem to just use pixel art and not really bother with what made the old games so impressive: limitation. But VVVVVV goes the extra mile with the Commodore 64 style. Text boxes adhere to the color cells, all the music could be achieved using a S.I.D. chip (although maybe not during gameplay), and even the sprites for the characters are spot-on period-correct, their eyes and mouth hollow because for a majority of the game, you're on a black \"space\" background. Little nods to tricks like that used to save memory on the old systems really bring the nerd in me out. Also, nice touch with the cassette turbo-loader when the game boots ;)\n\nAll those little details are what really drive the retro style home for me. Games like Shovel Knight and Cave Story, while great in terms of their gameplay, don't really adhere to the limitations that bred creativity back in the day. They just use pixel art and call it a day, maybe with a few low-frame animations thrown in too. Truth is, even VVVVVV breaks those limitations sometimes, namely with the background in outer space, because the background normally can't move on a C64 (at least, not without some serious programming wizardry)\n\nAlright, enough gushing about the style. What about the gameplay? Well, it's a mixture of puzzle-platformer and just raw platformer, with maybe a teensy pinch of Metroid thrown in. And I love it. All those little trinkets to collect, clearing out the entire map, the time trials mode, flipped mode, all sorts of extra things to do on top of the main game, which is admittedly short. Just saving all your fellow crewmates, a skilled player could expect to beat the game in an hour or two. While most trinkets are just a quick little side-path away and won't take up too much time, some (namely the ones on Space Station 2) can be extraordinarily difficult, the most infamous of which being in a room called \"Doing things the hard way\" with a Terminal that taunts you.\n\nI already touched on the Music in the Graphics segment, but bottom line, if you like Shovel Knight's music (or  S.I.D. demo-scene music, or just chiptunes in general) you'll like the stuff here too. It's great.\n\nFor $5 you could certainly get worse, VVVVVV is not a bad choice by any means. It's heaps of fun, albeit short.

The graphics are standard minimalistic retro style, and the story is a little generic, but decent, but what really stands out to me in this game is the gameplay. It is SO much fun. I have played this game for extensive amounts of time without getting bored, and that's a rarity for me, because I have quite a short attention span. This game is pretty hard, but the difficulty is a bit overrated if you ask me. I beat it in a mere 4 days, which was not something I expected to happen so quickly. That's not to say that this game isn't difficult, though. I died at least once on almost every single room, and at least 50 times on every level. This game is challenging, but fair. Not a single room felt like it was unfairly difficult, and only one of the twenty trinkets felt that way for me. (*ahem* Edge Games *ahem*) Even the infamous Doing Things The Hard Way, which is probably one of the hardest levels in gaming history, never got old or stale for me, even though I died at least 500 times there and spent almost 2 hours on it. (It was more enjoyable than Edge Games, that's for sure.)\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the OST. It is absolutely phenomenal. Every song is memorable in its own way, and none of them sound too similar to each other. Each one fits the level it plays in extremely well, and I'll definitely be downloading every song. Out of all of them, Positive Force is probably my favorite, but it's pretty hard to choose.\n\nNot sure if I'll ever be able to 100% this, but I'll certainly try, because this game is addicting. I've found myself playing the time trials over and over again to S-rank them, and I've been doing it for hours and hours on end without them getting boring once.

The minimalistic visuals belie a game with very engaging puzzles and complex level designs.  The difficulty level of the puzzles can increase drastically as you progress through areas, which often have their own technical quirks that deftly utilize the game's mechanics in unique and interesting combinations.  They can be challenging and even outright hard, but they're never completely impossible.\n\n*As of Jan 29, 2021 less than 15% of players have completed the base game at all, disregarding item collection, overall map completion, number of deaths, etc.*\n\nWhile the characters are not always the most nuanced, they all have their own personalities and a variety of interactions can take place.  The game's simple, yet driving digital soundtrack is very fitting to the setting in which this all takes place, and generally compliments the game's aesthetic as a whole.  (Full disclosure: I'm still listening to it as I'm writing this review.)  The room names, while usually thought provoking, can also be humorous and even trolly at times.  It's enjoyable to see this cerebral of a game have moments where it also doesn't take itself too seriously.  No spoilers here, it'll make sense if/when you read the credits.\n\nThese are all things which add up to a game that, although minimalistc by design, is greater than the sum of its parts.  My playthrough finished in just under 1100 deaths, so it's doubtful at best that I could pass the No Death Challenge.  However, I plan on revisiting this game a bit to at least fully explore the map while enjoying the groovy soundtrack and some of the more difficult (read: engaging!) puzzles again.\n\nAlthough this game can and will infuriate at times (Your Bitter Tears... Delicious), the satisfaction of solving these complex puzzles generally outweighs whatever frustration is felt in the moment.  However, if you're expecting VVVVVV to be as merciful as say, a Mario game, you will either be delightfully surprised or sorely mistaken, depending on perspective.  Should one choose to pay attention, it's possible to begin understanding what happened to this dimension and the reasons behind its bizarre physical properties.  It's not absolutely necessary, but to me it was a nice glimpse into the game and its internal logic.\n\nAll in all, as a supporter of indie games and a fan of physics and puzzles in general, I recommend checking out VVVVVV as a generally amusing and cerebral experience.\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1611969372, "timestamp_updated": 1611969805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "85573257": {"recommendationid": "85573257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315980012", "num_games_owned": 644, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1613075281}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: Just finished this today, and while it gets much harder, it still is plenty forgiving.

A rage game is a game where every obstacle is placed completely unfairly, the controls are sloppy and either too stiff, too slippery or somehow both and all of the levels and areas are horrifically designed. \n\nThis game is filled with incredibly hard yet fair challenges, excellently well designed levels and super snappy controls. Oh and also a cool cast of characters, a minimalist but still great looking art style and a small yet amazing soundtrack (which you can buy on bandcamp by the way. The album is called PPPPPP).\n\nI've bought this game, no joke, 3 times. I bought it first for the 3DS and managed to beat it after 3000 deaths and around 10 hours of total gameplay (at age 11 and I'm still proud). Then when my 3DS broke, I bought it on PS4 and beat it in 3 hours with 500 deaths. Then I discovered that the PC version had a level editor so that I could make and install custom levels, so I bought it again. \n\nIf you're not good at the game, you'll have fun trying to get the precise movements of each room down because the infinite lives and frequent checkpoints allow for extensive experimentation. But if you're good at the game, you have the opportunity to play the game over and over again because, if you're good, you can beat it in under an hour. And then when you get REALLY good, you can access the replays of different intermission sections and the time trials of the main areas, play until you can beat every single challenged the game has on offer without dying once, and then go for the mystical \"Master of the Universe\" trophy which is only unlocked once you've beaten the entire game without dying once.\n\nIt's fun, it's challenging, it's short and it's cheap.

It's defining mechanic is that instead of jumping, the player flips upside down. The developer has done a great job utilizing this unique aspect of the game and it shows in it's outstanding level design. VVVVVV is definitely a tough game to beat however. You'll almost be certain to have hundreds if not thousands of deaths the first time you play. But the difficulty is authentic and almost never throws something unfair at the player, with enough practice the player can master these obstacles and eventually you'll see your death count go down in subsequent playthoughs. While not necessarily complex or lengthy, the story does it's job of building the world and plot enough were the player has a good idea of what's going on around them. The short but sweet story also helps make the game feel more true to it's retro aesthetic, as most games in this time period had little to no backstory as well.

At one point I couldn't figure out what to do next until I looked at the map and realised all the grey areas are areas I haven't been to yet and intentionally made my way over to a new place. The only thing I don't like is that the controls are slightly slippery - that is, once you stop holding left or right, you slow to a stop rather than stopping immediately. It made it feel like surfaces were a little slippery and I fell off some platforms because of it, but I'm sure I'd get used to it if I played more.

It didn't receive the financial success that the devs would have liked, but over the last 10 years, it's picked up a cult following.  It's now a game recommended to anyone that really likes precision platformers.  After playing this, it's very clear that developers today have taken inspiration from VVVVVV.  It shows it's age and is pretty rough around the edges, but it's still a fun experience even in 2020.\n\nConsensus:\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier 4 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  Solid world building, exploration, and hard but fair platforming gauntlets make this a good choice for platforming fans.  However, it hasn't aged well over the last 10 years, and it shows.

It's a platformer, but only in the strictest sense. Your character does not jump, but instead changes the pull of gravity. The action button launches you in the opposite direction and you will keep going until hitting an obstacle. This could be on the same screen or through a large part of the map. This makes exploring the map a unique experience. The goal is to locate your crew and teleport them back to the ship. There are also 20 shiny trinkets scattered around the map, which are optional, but provide a welcome challenge and some replay value.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- The graphics. I am a sucker for the old school aesthetic. This looks like it could have been a C64 game.\n- The audio. The music was pretty good, and there are additional background tracks to unlock. While it was a little repetitive, it never became annoying. The minimal sound effects add to the retro feel.\n- Stats. The game tracks your number of deaths and time of completion, giving it some replay value.\n-Room names. Naming each room was a nice touch.\n\nWhat could have been better:\n- Game length. The main game was pretty short. I was able to complete the main objective and get most of the trinkets in less than 4 hours. However, there is replay value in going back to get the last few trinkets, play through the Time Trials, and explore user created levels.\n-Hit detection. Sometimes it feels like you should clear the spikes, but it is counted as a death. Nothing egregious, it just requires pixel perfect timing in some rooms.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if it's on sale. I wouldn't consider it a \"must have\" title, but it's a fun and challenging way to spend an afternoon.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1595143863, "timestamp_updated": 1595143863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72927954": {"recommendationid": "72927954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846808529", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1694709268}, "language": "english", "review": "one of the best games i have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1595129395, "timestamp_updated": 1595129395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72882538": {"recommendationid": "72882538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030205950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1595052310}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so full of life, the devs really loved working on this masterpiece, it is cheap, the soundtrack is just amazing and the challenging game is just good enough to keep you busy!\n\nSome of the achievements are truly a pain in the ass tough...", "timestamp_created": 1595058921, "timestamp_updated": 1595058921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601031661033630371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72856219": {"recommendationid": "72856219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027243832", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1595956723}, "language": "english", "review": "This game nuts", "timestamp_created": 1595013482, "timestamp_updated": 1595013482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72786456": {"recommendationid": "72786456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995664592", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1593982813}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Terminada historia principal en dos horas.

Your crew was teleported and you have to find them and take them back to the ship. Will you succeed? What will you encounter during your adventure? Will you rage? Play the game and find out.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nWhat do I mean by rage? Do you see the word \"Difficult\" the list of tags for this game?\nHahahahahaha. Well...\nThis game is short but very hard. It will take a lot of trial and error and many deaths for you to beat the game...\nUnless you are a king at games like this and can beat it without dying once. If you can, I'll give you my respect.\nAnyway, the music is great. I really like the music in this game. Back to the difficulty, this game will challenge you with all of the obstacles that you come across. And that one part with a lot of trial and error for a trinket Virdian can get to since a small block is blocking it...\nHELP ME!!!\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\nSince the game is difficult, it isn't for everyone. There will be some moments that you might just rage quit the game. In my eyes, it isn't for a casual gamer. Another issue I had is how Viridian controls. It feels like he is slippery, and moments where I finally reached a certain place, only for him to move a little bit into some spikes were frustrating. While this game is short, it uses that time to challenge you. From the story to the challenges from the achievements, this game will use its time to test you.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nI'll recommend VVVVVV ONLY to those that are looking for a challenge. If you get mad easily, step away from this game. It has nice music and a lot of replayability. Since it's short, maybe you would want to test yourself to not die as much as you did on your last try?

I like difficult platformers. Been playing a lot of LOVE lately, and Super Meat Boy is also a personal favorite of mine. \n\nSo where does this game go wrong? It's difficulty comes almost entirely from being unfair. I've only played for half an hour and this is what I've come across. Lot's of blind jumps that will have you dying over and over because the last solid ground was 3 screens back. Lines that auto flip you work in a strange way. And one of the biggest things is how you have momentum and don't come to a complete stop the second you stop pressing a direction. This is almost always bad in difficult platformers that require precision. Especially in a game with so many blind jumps. \n\nPart of what makes it difficult, compared to other difficult platformers I've played, is that the camera is mostly locked to the screen. So you will often have to make a blind jump, go to the next screen, and pray you are on track to go to the next screen. This is just downright unfair. Trial and error gameplay isn't difficult. It's just unfair. What's worse is that there are sections were the camera does follow you. And yet somehow, at least one of those sections also manages to have blind jumps in it. \n\nWant an idea of just how hard the game is? Just look at the achievements and percentages. Only 4% of players have beat the game with less than 500 deaths. And that's the 3rd most common achievement. And there's an achievement for beating the game without dying at all!? [spoiler] I'm sure I'll go for it eventually [/spoiler]\n\nSo what does this game do right? Quite a lot actually. It's cheap. The music is awesome. The story is engaging enough for the type of game it is. There's a large map to explore, with sections that act more like actual levels. The graphics are great. \n\nI have to recommend against getting it though, as the main part of the game is the game play, and it just isn't fair. It's trial and error gameplay disguising itself as difficulty. If you don't care about achievements or unfair difficulty, give the game a try. It's still a great game. It's just the unfair difficulty that's the problem.", "timestamp_created": 1592972179, "timestamp_updated": 1592972179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535655498504638672", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71220213": {"recommendationid": "71220213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373582606", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1618805592}, "language": "english", "review": "Vivid, vicarious, vanguardist, vintage, vore-inducing, very good.", "timestamp_created": 1592913965, "timestamp_updated": 1592913965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71164147": {"recommendationid": "71164147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025270092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 983, "last_played": 1592980504}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games ever.

You feel lost, and almost homesick for the station you started on.  But eventually you'll find some indoor sections, and begin the platforming part of the game.  These sections are really fun, and each screen is different and distinct, there is defenitely quality over quantity in the platforming.  They're defenitely challenging, but I wouldn't say to the level that it will make you rage.  There's a great sense of accomplishment when you complete these, and each ends in a great gauntlet that test's you on what you learn.  And once you've completed some of these, you start to feel more comfortable traversing the world, everything you've learned in the platforming starts to make the entire void feel like your home.  So I defenitely reccomend this game, but the one hiccup I might point out is that it can feel like the game gets easier overtime, not just traversing the world (I mean that's why I love the game) but in the platforming itself.

We overall had a fun but frustrating time with the game, and I had no desire to return to this...  until I got it at part of a bundle.\nComing back to it, most of the game mechanics and challenges came back to me pretty quickly and I proceeded to beat it in an hour and a half.

But that\u2019s also coming from someone who\u2019s probably actually spent closer to five hours total on this game, so take my advice with a grain of salt.\nIf it looks your style. go and get it.  What you see is what you get with this.\nGameplay wise, this game is a mixed bag of mostly fun and a little frustrating.  This game is full of hard challenges that are not for the basic gamer, the week of spirit who need to get gud.  Yeah - Casual gamers probably won\u2019t find as much enjoyment out of this.  You\u2019ll probably have some fun then get stuck somewhere difficult and rage quit, I should know because it happened to me and my friend.  The game does try to be a bit more forgiving with no lives in this game and multiple checkpoint which are very much appreciated.  you can die as many times as you want, no penalty.  Though, I think hard level design wasn\u2019t really where my rage moments came from - I think a fair amount of my frustration seems to come from the physics in the game.  The character is slippery, so I\u2019ve skidded into spikes many many times.  I\u2019d do something right but went a little too fast \u2013 fly into spikes or skid into spikes and have to do it again (with similar results probably).  It happened a lot.  \nAnd then that escort mission.  Skidding + a clone of you always following five paces behind + no mercy = frustration.  This part sucks, even revisiting it I still found it fairly annoying.  \nDon\u2019t get the wrong idea, though.  Yes, the frustrations stick out like a sore thumb, but most of the game is very fun.  I like the ideas here and it\u2019s well executed for the most part which made me feel engrossed in the adventure \u2013 even with the graphics the way they are. I think it was a fun little romp to revisit and it was worth my time.   I never started to question why I was even playing this game, a feeling I have with frustrating games or repetitive/empty games.  It engrossed me and I enjoyed it \u2013 most of it.

First of all there are the achievements. The base game is not super easy, but these achievements make it a whole lot harder. For example, there are time trails, where you need to finish sections perfectly (0 death and all trinkets, all in a certain time). There is also a lab with a Super Gravitron, where you need to dodge square bullets. This is also super challenging. \n\nThe game mechanic is smart: a platformer where you can't jump but only flip gravity, and I think this idea is executed very nicely.

With a collection of several excellent tracks that the player can select between, exploration becomes infinitely more enjoyable.\n\nThe story aspect is very minimal, which is somewhat normal in this genre. I would be pleased with more of a narrative, but I will not fault the lack of it.\n\nIf you are interested in a short casual platformer with retro style, this game is for you. If you are more interested complex and difficult games in the same genre, stylistic successors of this game (Super Meat Boy, Celeste, to name a few prominent ones) might be up your alley.\n\nAlthough I have enjoyed many other games in the same genre as VVVVVV substantially more, the groovy soundtrack and well executed core mechanics left me with an overall positive experience.\n\n6/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1577374148, "timestamp_updated": 1577374148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60559069": {"recommendationid": "60559069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206521213", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1335, "last_played": 1612121379}, "language": "english", "review": "OG game", "timestamp_created": 1577318647, "timestamp_updated": 1577318647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60556769": {"recommendationid": "60556769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198410829950", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1314, "last_played": 1698543453}, "language": "english", "review": "     One of the best, most difficults and more entertaining games I ever played", "timestamp_created": 1577315845, "timestamp_updated": 1577315845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60472970": {"recommendationid": "60472970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208300936", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1577331337}, "language": "english", "review": "Super fun and somewhat challenging platformer.

During my first run of this game, I didn't really enjoy it that much, but it was a game. One of the first steam games I ever played. And I'm glad I played it so that my experience could only get better. This was originally crowned as a rage game, and personally I think that label is stupid. It's not designed to be unfair, although it is for reasons I won't be going into because of how much else I have to rant about. It's not hard by any means, and yes, you will die plenty, but that doesn't make it hard. The progress you'll lose is minuscule, and you'll be able to get back to where ever you died in seconds. There's only a few screens you'll get stuck on for a while unless you go for the trinkets. Even then, it'll never be that bad.\n\nHowever, now we get to the completionist side of things. The achievement for getting 1 minute in the super gravitron SUCKED. GOOD GOD IT SUCKED. I don't mean that it's hard, though it is, I mean that it took me literal years to finish because it was so stupidly boring and hypnotizing, and I had such little desire to actually finish it, that this game is somehow my longest project ever. I left this game and came back to it at least 6 times, with several month long breaks between. There will be plenty of times where you'll die and have absolutely no say in the matter. You'll start losing interest fast when you're on you longest run yet, and die from pure rng. Thing is, that's not the worst achievement. Beating the game deathless. Is a thing. This is a game that has no right to have an achievement like that. It's so, so, so boring. The levels themselves are insanely easy when you've beaten them 20 times.

To top it off you even get a map of them once you complete the story (which every game needs imo). \n[*] Exploration is very liberating, soon as you start the game, pretty much the entire map is available to explore, which is very big, and very open. Watching the map increase in size by 10 units at a time is very satisfying, and makes your progress very obvious.\n[*] The game is fairly short, it took me 1:59:59 to beat it with most of the medals (I scraped up the last few afterwards). This works in its favour though, because the game it just so dense with gameplay; its a blast the whole way through.\n[*] There are achievements and minigames to unlock after gathering the collectables.
