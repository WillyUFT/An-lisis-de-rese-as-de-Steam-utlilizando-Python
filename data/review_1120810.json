There's not much exploration, or navigation, just demons in your way that you have to defeat. You can't even move to the next location until you finish the fights. Fortunately, the combat is very well done, both visually and mechanically.\n\nThere are a number of offensive and defensive moves available, as well as various special abilities that, when activated, either give you new moves or give you an extra effect to existing ones. Timing plays an important role in the combat, you can't really win here by mashing buttons. There\u2019s also a light rpg system, where you can improve both your character's vitality and stamina, as well as upgrade basic moves and spells. There are plenty of variations in combat, you can't really explore all of it in one playthrough. The game explains everything thoroughly, and perhaps even goes overboard with the tutorial pop-ups. It's fine on the first playthrough, but a bit tiresome on subsequent ones.\n\nThe visual design is fantastic, with beautiful hand-drawn backgrounds. Screenshots don\u2019t do these justice, since they're thoroughly animated and very layered, so they look fantastic in motion. The animations of our characters are also excellent, and the design of the enemies (most of which are inspired by Far Eastern folklore), especially the bosses, are great too. The sound design is also good, with meaty combat sound effects, and moody ambience and music. Unfortunately, there are only a few music tracks, so while they\u2019re nice, they get a bit repetitive after a while. I also have to mention the Chinese opera style narrator in certain cutscenes. I loved it.\n\nThe game is set in a Chinese fantasy world. We have two protagonists, an exorcist who makes a fatal mistake that costs the lives of his companions, and a half-demon who is trying to find a healer for his poisoned brother. The two stories are not directly connected, but take place partly in the same locations. It would\u2019ve been nice to have more world lore, but I liked the stories anyway, they had interesting characters, enemies and twists.\n\nThe game is not a long one, it took me about 12 hours to finish, but I had a lot of fun with it. I don\u2019t often play 2D games like this, but I really enjoyed this one.", "timestamp_created": 1684001781, "timestamp_updated": 1684001781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137771113": {"recommendationid": "137771113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073820081", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 477, "last_played": 1683655063}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1683195637, "timestamp_updated": 1683195637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467032968997955322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137586830": {"recommendationid": "137586830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053843750", "num_games_owned": 1046, "num_reviews": 662, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 382, "last_played": 1682873653}, "language": "english", "review": "\u304f__,.\u30d8\u30fd.\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000/\u3000,\u30fc\uff64 \u3009\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff3c ', !-\u2500\u2010-i\u3000/\u3000/\u00b4\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \uff0f\uff40\uff70'\u3000\u3000\u3000 L/\uff0f\uff40\u30fd\uff64\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000 \uff0f,\u3000 /|\u3000 ,\u3000 ,\u3000\u3000\u3000 ',\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\uff72 \u3000/ /-\u2010/\u3000\uff49\u3000L_ \uff8a \u30fd!\u3000 i\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a \uff8d 7\uff72\uff40\uff84\u3000 \uff9a'\uff67-\uff84\uff64!\u30cf|\u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !,/7 '0'\u3000\u3000 \u00b40i\u30bd| \u3000 |\u3000\u3000\u3000\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 |.\u4ece\"\u3000\u3000_\u3000\u3000 ,,,, / |./ \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| i\uff1e.\uff64,,__\u3000_,.\u30a4 / \u3000.i \u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'| | / k_\uff17_/\uff9a'\u30fd,\u3000\uff8a.\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 | |/i \u3008|/\u3000 i\u3000,.\uff8d |\u3000i\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000.|/ /\u3000\uff49\uff1a \u3000 \uff8d!\u3000\u3000\uff3c\u3000|\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 \u3000 k\u30fd>\uff64\uff8a \u3000 _,.\uff8d\uff64 \u3000 /\uff64!\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 !'\u3008//\uff40\uff34\u00b4', \uff3c \uff40'7'\uff70r'\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \uff9a'\u30fdL__|___i,___,\u30f3\uff9a|\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000\uff84-,/\u3000|___./\n\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\u3000'\uff70'\u3000\u3000!_,.", "timestamp_created": 1682900288, "timestamp_updated": 1682900288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456497311592102051", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137350127": {"recommendationid": "137350127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043108500", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 728, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1682560256}, "language": "english", "review": "Tough game, and it has a nice plot.

This game feels like it should've been in Early Access longer. Hell, on the female character you can see the outlines of the sprites because they weren't made transparent properly.\n\nOverall the art's great, the music's nice, the plot's generic but not offensive, the combat could be really good, but it actively shoots itself in the foot with extremely vague attack animations for a parry system you need to be predictive with, and awful boss attacks that guaranteed you'll die, and encounter designs that are purpose-made to be frustration-inducing and not really challenging in an interesting way.\n\nIt's a shame because when I saw this I immediately thought \"WOW IT'S OBORO MURAMASA BUT CHINESE AND ON PC!\" and now I feel guilty I made the comparison because I really just want to finish this game to say I did it and move on.

Eastern Exorcist is a great fast-paced action-packed game but it isn\u2019t too deep, nothing near Castlevania standards. There are some Items you get after defeating certain enemies and abilities you get for completing challenges. Challenges are specific stages you can complete using a shrine ( a mechanism similar to Dark souls bonfires), you will have bosses you defeated but they\u2019re tougher and you get rewards based on the time it took you to complete the challenge, beating these challenges makes the game a lot easier as you are given a lot of rewards to upgrade your lvl and abilities. Some of those challenges are introductions to the skills you acquire as if it\u2019s a tutorial. TUTORIALS themselves are annoying and abundant, almost every stage you enter at the start gives you a prompt which doesn\u2019t go away, and in a lot of the challenges and different stages the prompt has a lot of text to read but enemies spawn in and the game doesn\u2019t pause, so you end up taking damage while trying to read. And the animations for enemies spawning, entering combat, leaving combat and so on becomes tedious after a while. The cutscenes even more so. Too many and too slow.\nthe story itself is average at best and while dark it doesn\u2019t really explore the different ideas it presents, it is simply there to be there.\nI was surprised to see there was a second character altogether and a second completely different story and set of items and skills, I also liked the fact that some new challenges appear in playthrough 2.\nAll in all it was a fun game and it was fun doing the achievements as well. The girl character is way overpowered and easier to play.\nTLDR;\nPros:\n- Short and sweet\n- Nice Visuals\n- Fun and smooth gameplay\n- Fun bosses with mechanics albeit annoying at times\n- Fun challenge system\n- Easy 100% achievement\nCons:\n- Animations every time entering and leaving combat\n- Some cheap enemies\n- Lack of music and sound variety\n- Poor story and writing\n", "timestamp_created": 1669413523, "timestamp_updated": 1669413523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598588407039642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125515950": {"recommendationid": "125515950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086368484", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1416, "last_played": 1685363813}, "language": "english", "review": "Intriguing story, good gameplay and boss variation w/ just right difficulty.\nbut the stages is too linear filled w/ bland normal world enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1668508604, "timestamp_updated": 1668508604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518277108669281006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125394174": {"recommendationid": "125394174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081368130", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1695945397}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is cool.

The visuals and the feel of the combat system are the main selling points of this.\nIt's also more grounded than Muramasa, there are just a few bosses that need mid-air combat, but the rest is easier if you sit still and counter.\nThe parry window is generous and feels good; same with the perfect dodge, even if the following counter attack is only triggered if the player is not moving, which is kinda off putting during combat. Skill tree and the additional skills were also good, but imo the lotus one, the one which recovers stamina, is far superior to the others simply for its effect and the bad balancing around stamina. I guess the devs wanted a slower hack and slash combat? It'd explain why, at max level and max upgrades, the stamina management is terrible, especially if you are trying to speedrun.\nThere are a lot of bosses but very few enemy types, and you can undergo challenges or gauntlets to beat them again. The very majority of them were fair, the only thing ruining it? The final boss in Xue's story is a DISGUSTING SPAMMY STAGGERING TRASH, but overall they were good enough to use the combat system at its potential. Also, there are different bosses and areas depending on which character you choose, giving it a lot of replayability; but I think the balancing suffers a bit, since it's easy to overlevel yourself.\nThe story was fine, particularly good were the side stories with little unexpected twists (doggy :'c ), but they were not supported by dialogue, it was empty and bland. I also agree that a few cutscenes were hella fast, but at least the art was excellent lol.\nOverall, it's a good and fun experience, still above many other side scrollers, with a very fair price.", "timestamp_created": 1662202415, "timestamp_updated": 1662202415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.39682537317276001", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121114142": {"recommendationid": "121114142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144352527", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 797, "last_played": 1661264204}, "language": "english", "review": "Well this game fantastic", "timestamp_created": 1661264380, "timestamp_updated": 1661264380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120827706": {"recommendationid": "120827706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198803844893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1095, "last_played": 1660920017}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juego que he jugado en mi vida, 10/10 historia y combate.\n\nPd: Xiaoyu te amo.", "timestamp_created": 1660819297, "timestamp_updated": 1660819297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120760745": {"recommendationid": "120760745", "author": {"steamid": "76561199283319298", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1684794209}, "language": "english", "review": "the art is amazing and the combat is super fun lategame", "timestamp_created": 1660702896, "timestamp_updated": 1660702896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120721690": {"recommendationid": "120721690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008044297", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18, "last_played": 1660646893}, "language": "english", "review": "After beating the first boss, the game just goes back to main menu.

Recommended for everyone!\n\nPD: After completing the game: the only thing I did not like is that some bosses are really \"spammy\" so you need to deal with a lot of stuff at the same time. Meaning: can make you feel stressed and give up easly (played on the hardest difficulty in my first playthrough, as I always do). Plus, you can get through enemies without dodging. This can be a problem and developers did the wrong choice here because you can miss a lot of attacks. They should block your path unless you dodge so all the attacks hit the target\n\nPD#2: After the recent patch (russian language), the game has some broken things. Game looks blurrier / downgraded textures and some broken tree textures\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1660183494, "timestamp_updated": 1660590723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541117846965789795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119135357": {"recommendationid": "119135357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051059172", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1663348406}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice graphics and challenging combats.", "timestamp_created": 1658322502, "timestamp_updated": 1658322502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119134921": {"recommendationid": "119134921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071189953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 762, "last_played": 1661215609}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good!

It's not a Metroidvania and it's just a linear adventure from point A to point B with no exploration. While the game looks really good, and the combat system would appear to have what's needed to be a great game, the game is unfortunately not designed well enough to take advantage of its own combat system.\n\nWhat I mean by the combat system has what's needed to be a great game is that it has all the fundamentals. There's a 4 hit combo, a charged attack combo, and a gap closing move. You also have dodges, perfect dodges, blocking, and a parry system. Furthermore, if you delay hitting the attack button before the final hit in a combo chain, you'll do increased damage when you do actually press the attack button. Finally, there are 8 different passive skills/modes that you can enter (of which you can equip 4 of at a time) which drastically changes what you can do. \n\nThis is all good stuff, and it has the potential to be a really complex game\u2026.. But what sucks is that the enemies are not complex enough to force you to use everything in the combat system. I was hoping some enemy attackx I'd dodge, others I'd block, others I'd parry, and I would learn which attack is best to use depending on the enemy/boss scenario (e.g. like God of War 4)\u2026\u2026but the game never reaches this point. 80% of the time, all you need to do is the charged attack combo, and you'll beat pretty much all the enemies and bosses. This is because your character doesn't flinch when they're doing a charged attack combo using a certain skill. Furthermore, healing doesn't take any time and is instant (it's just on a short cooldown and you can use it up to 10 times). Finally, bosses have a barrier gauge in addition to their health. If you break the gauge with enough attacks, the bosses will get stunned for a few seconds or start getting flinched by attacks. So effectively, you can almost stun lock bosses by doing the charged attack combo over and over again. Even if the bosses get a few attacks off on you, you can just heal any damage the bosses do to you. It should be noted that I was playing the game on hard mode.\n\nI'll say that there are SOME bosses where the above doesn't work (i.e. the other 20%). Every so often, I'll face a boss where I actually need to dodge and parry. While that's nice, a few competent bosses here and there does not make up for the cakewalk of a game this is. \n\nIf the game is going to be so easy, I was hoping to at least be able to do cool shit like in Devil May Cry. Since you can equip 4 different passive skills, I was hoping to switch between them constantly in order to create cool combos\u2026.. But you can't do that in this game. This is because every single skill in this game works by gaining mana (via attacking, parrying, and dodging enemies). Welp, you can only gain mana on ONE skill at a time. You would think that would simply mean you take turns gaining mana on different skills, but that doesn't work either. This is because pretty much all of the skills also work by providing various passive benefits as you use them. If you change your skill while these benefits are active, you'll LOSE the passive benefits. So it's actually a BAD idea to switch skills\u2026\u2026.which sucks. I ended up just using 2 skills. One for enemies and one for bosses.\n\nThis is what I meant when I said the game is not designed well enough to take advantage of its own combat system. You have all these offensive and defensive moves, but there's no reason to master them. Hell, I beat a boss WITHOUT using the charged attack combo just to mix things up, and it was less effective than simply using the charged attack combo.\n\nThere's multiple progressions systems in this game. As you defeat enemies and explore, you'll get resources which you can use to increase your character's level, obtain passive abilities, enhance your passive skills, and enhance items that you can equip to provide passive benefits. While that's a lot of things to progress, it all honestly doesn't matter too much. After I levelled up 2 of the passive skills that I used, everything else was just window dressing, not something I became excited to obtain. \n\nThere's a story in this game, and it's nothing special. You're on a quest to kill a demon that killed your friends. Along the way, you have to exorcise multiple demons and help people. For a few demons, after you beat them a short cutscene will play providing you the background of why the demons became this way. I will say that there were a few stories that were interesting to see. Without spoiling too much, it highlights how horrible people could be back in the day, with witch trials, human sacrifices, etc\u2026 \n\nIf you want to spend a few hours hacking and slashing enemies with a challenge thrown in every so often, then you might enjoy this game. However, if you're looking for a game that's consistently challenging with a good difficult curve, then I would suggest looking elsewhere.\n", "timestamp_created": 1655949475, "timestamp_updated": 1655949475, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611517846584320068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": "", "timestamp_dev_responded": 1656407931, "developer_response": "Hi Rossoul, thank you so much for such detailed feedback and suggestions, these are all very good points and we are sorry that the game doesn't yet meet your expectations.. we will definitely take your suggestions into our future updates and new titles as well!

You'll miss a lot of interesting bosses if you only play one.\n\nI think this game has a lot of room for improvement, but it's still great as it is. It features beautiful scenery, flashy moves, creative boss fights and nice 2D action. Remember it's a side-scrolling game, so expect a linear world and little focus on exploration; the key is the action and the story.\n\nThere's a few translation issues. Combat could be a little smoother. Some sound effects are nice and some of them aren't. the menus are kind of hard to navigate. But even with all this, the game is at an excellent level.\n\nAs for the difficulty, it was easier than I expected.

It looks beautiful, and it plays pretty well. It's spoken all in Chinese, but there are subtitles. Parry Windows are a little tight, but you do have options of either guarding, parry, or evading. I do kind of wish you had more attacks, but there's quite a few spells to choose from; each with their own mana pools.\n\nI do have a few minor complaints overall though:\n-The spells are flashy, but sometimes too flashy that you cannot tell what's going on. I've lost my position a few times due to this\n\n-Some attacks you can parry, others you just couldn't- and normally this is a fine thing. But the telegraph for it won't always show up. So you kinda need to do some guesswork occasionally or just trial and error\n\n-There's a bit of platforming, but the Combat is like... The whole game. It's good, don't get me wrong, and I love the Dispel idea, but.... If that's a deal-breaker, yeah. You've been warned\n\n\nThough, let's end with some positives:\n+Story. I honestly really liked it and it had a very... Yokai feel to it all. Not to mention that both characters had completely separate stories! They legit had like 1 NPC in common. Some enemies and bosses you re-fought, but it was very very small. I did prefer one story over the other, but they were both great!\n\n+Art is a given, but even the creature design. Just... <3\n\n+The overall style of the characters. They don't have a lot in terms of movesets, but both of their spells and just overall style is really badass for how little there is. Not to mention the sound is amazing. Kinda wish there was more music overall, but when you parry or hit with a charge attack, it sounds like it hurts!\n\n+The Challenge Mode: you get this at savepoints, and the rewards feel really really good. They are timed with different tiers of rewards, but I never struggled with too many of them. Not to mention when you \"retry\", you're back at the state where you first entered. No limited amount of lives or damage taken requirements, just \"finish by any means\", and the biggest reward is just by finishing it. Anything else is just a bonus.\n\n\nI'll definitely recommend the game, no doubt.

If anyone has associations with the Ori game, he has hit the right place, although the type of gameplay is completely different. We get 2x heroes and 2x campaigns though, the game could suggest the order in which you play the game because you can go through the stories not chronologically.\n\nBenefits:\n- The game is simple in its assumptions\n- Bosses are the greatest threat (In Lu Youchuan's path the levels are more demanding than Ms Xsiahou Xue's path, but Bosas are definitely more difficult in the fox's path)\n- After death, we have a substitute for punishment, and shrines are just save files (This production makes the same mistake as Lords of the Fallen - introducing non-imersive mechanics)\n- Elements of the RPG system (in the challenges in the shrines we get new equipment)\n- The game lasts for a good 14 hours\n- Brilliant music that matches the gloomy atmosphere of the game (it's a pity that the developers do not make music tracks available on Steam)\n- A beautiful gloomy world from which the right amount of brutality pours out by Chinese standards - everything looks natural (Chinese Censorship Bark)\n- This world based on Chinese Mythology, although colorful, but it is properly subdued and does not scream - how amazing it is\n- A substitute for side quests (Just a pity that they are not voiced).\n\nDisadvantages:\n- The cutscene bitray could be bigger because the image doesn't look good, and I don't even know what resolution it is because these files are encrypted\n- The Mouse and Keyboard controls are completely messed up and are best played on a Pad\n- The game is divided into small pieces of maps, which causes a kind of lack of smoothness in the game and mum (\"Task\") has incorrectly marked shrines in some places\n- It is a pity that the double jump is not accompanied by any adequate effect that would justify this mechanic\n- After the last update, some strange graphic errors appeared - thin black rollers are visible next to some of the special effects, showing what geometric figure they were made on (I'm using the native resolution 16:9 1440p).\n\nFinal rating 8.5/10.

I proceeded to get through one boss in the alternate character (Xiahou Xue's) campaign on Normal mode before I got tired of and fed up with the game. I looked up some videos of the rest of Xiahou Xue's campaign on YouTube and decided that it just wasn't worth playing the game anymore. \n\nLet's get the positive things out of the way first.\n\n[b]The game absolutely nails the dark fantasy look. The atmosphere is top-notch: [/b]\nYou really feel like you're in a demon-infested ancient China. The audiovisuals when it come to hitting enemies are also generally crunchy and satisfying. Some of the flashback cutscenes that show the darkest sides of humanity can be quite intense and chilling. Imagine the manga Berserk being set in ancient China and you have a good idea of what kind of atmosphere to expect. The creature and enemy designs are also visually striking and often quite imaginative. \n\nAlright, now onto the negatives, of which there are a ton.\n\n[b]Nonexistent level design: [/b]\nYou go through 3-5 mostly flat horizontal screens with light platforming and enemy encounters in between that are mandatory to beat. Then you fight a boss. Then you go through the same 3-5 brief screens filled with light platforming and enemies. Then you fight a boss. Rinse and repeat. This is the entire game's progression in a nutshell. I know that this game's format is heavily influenced by Vanillaware, but even Vanillaware games does this format better by having more interesting variety in what type of screens there are between boses. Just look at Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir and how it varies things up between boss fights, with things like shoot-em-up autoscrollers and vertical screens, as well as generally prettier and more interesting background visuals. Meanwhile, most of the screens in Eastern Exorcist you'll go through are swamps, forests, marshes, caves, fields and deserted villages devoid of interesting details. \n\n[b]Frustrating enemy design:[/b]\nEnemy telegraphing and AI ranges from acceptable in some circumstances to poor in most circumstances. Telegraphs typically aren't exaggerated nearly enough and, to make matters worse, your parry and perfect dodge windows feel terrible. Lots of non-boss enemies I feel read your inputs and perfectly dodge away from your attacks the moment you press a button. Because your character's actions are mostly uncancellable, you'll often have to play very passively to prevent yourself from getting hit by a cheap attack. \n\n[b]Frustrating enemy encounter design:[/b]\nMost enemy mobs beyond the first few Rat soldier enemy groups you face make for sloppy, unfair and cheap encounters. The game loves to throw big mobs at you that are often filled with projectile spamming enemies that shoot at you from off-screen without any kind of audiovisual telegraphing to indicate an off-screen attack is coming your way. Getting stunlocked or beaten to death in seconds is a common occurrence. Boss fights also turn chaotic and random when minions show up to assist the boss. Again, the Vanillaware games Eastern Exorcist took inspiration from typically did this better. There's a reason why Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir has a special map on the top-right corner of the game's screen that shows the entire battlefield in a miniaturized view so that players can see off-screen enemies if they are trying to shoot at you.\n\n[b]Imprecise and slippery movement: [/b]\nJumping and platforming just doesn't feel good and precise. You always feel like you're landing on surfaces covered in oil. Even basic things like jumping to a slightly higher platform to attack a Rat Archer enemy can be unnecessarily difficult to pull off because of the terrible movement. \n\n[b]Combat imbalances:[/b]\nThe LV1 charge attack you get at the start of the game is more powerful and universally useful than any other upgrade or skill you'll have. You try to do the timed standard four-hit and enemies may often escape mid-combo. But with the LV1 charge attack and its timed follow-up, most enemies will stay stun-locked. When I played as Lu Yunchuan, close to 90 percent of my time playing the game was looping this LV1 charged attack over and over and over and over again. Anything else would get me killed. Not to mention this strategy is better for allowing me to maintain lots of stamina, as my stamina recovers while I'm doing the follow-up attack after the LV1 charge. I'm pretty sure I never did the jumping slam attack even once beyond the tutorials.\n\n[b]Stifling stamina system: [/b]\nIn the Souls games that clearly inspired Eastern Exorcist, you are always given the opportunity to boost your stamina so that you can do more types of actions prior to your stamina running out. Eastern Exorcist doesn't have that. Regardless of whether you're level one or level thirty, your max stamina remains the same. Even with magic skill upgrades that can restore chunks of your stamina under specific circumstances (like after a perfect dodge or after exorcising an enemy), the game still feels overly restrictive. \n\n[b]Final thoughts:[/b]\nI hated almost every minute of playing this. The 8.5 hours I spent playing it felt more like 85 hours. If you want an actually good Souls-like, go play Nioh 1 or Nioh 2 (or both) instead.", "timestamp_created": 1629874474, "timestamp_updated": 1629874474, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3,

Well I dont know if is just me or some times your timing on parry and dodge will slowly start being off and you will not get any right moments on them and another moment back to business and you will be parrying and dodging with np again.\n\nSame with boss fights.\nSome times you can follow pattern with np and next second bosses pattern becomes a shit show of spamming AoE or faster attacks that he can throw at you. Feeling is like they go into their second phase right at start of the fight.\nSome bosses even stop attacking if you dodge them and just cancel the attack then turn towards you fast and restarts same attacks.\n\nWhen it comes to environment (map) where your character is traveling it could be better connected like in Salt and Sanctuary game, have more different environment looks and some parts of the map are just empty.\n\nStill is nice game.\nNo fps drops or any thing.\nArt of the game is good.\nStory is ok.

It also has a NG+ mode which doesn't add much but is still fun to destroy all previous bosses with full upgrades.\n\nSome parts of this game however are not as well executed. Such as the level design and progression. The levels are very simple and get repetitive and the enemies have to be cleared at each part of the level which seems like a chore at times. The start of the game is also flooded with intrusive tutorials which broke the momentum of gameplay more than a couple of times. There are also various aspects of this game which are very unpolished. Halfway through my playthrough, I found out about the minimap system of the level you are currently in which looked abysmal and littered with what looks to be placeholder art.

[spoiler]Tip: Before a boss battle, you can spend all your power in skill trees so if you die you will lose barely nothing.

You can barely chose anything storydriven.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What's good?[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The art is quite beautiful. It's easy to notice that devs have put a lot of effort for their game to look very nice: Scenarios, character design, animations and cutscenes.\n[*] Gameplay is fluid.\n[*] The game punishes you for mashing buttons (your stamina bar gets depleted and you can't attack, defend nor dodge, but you still can parry), and rewards you for playing it \"correctly\" (perfect dodges/counters and parries).\n[*] 2 different characters to play, each with it's own story and \"different\" playstyle. [spoiler]I found Miss Fox easier because of her playstyle and her ghost invocation skill, which made boss fights easier.[/spoiler]\n[*] Different skill trees with \"different\" playstyles. They may not be completely different playstyles one from another, but they add different stuff for sure.\n[*] You may equip up to 4 different skill trees at a time. 1 will be active and you will be able to switch to the others while in combat easily.\n[*] No need for grinding. [spoiler]I would recommend you to do the challenges tho, since they give you A LOT of resources to build your skill trees.[/spoiler]\n[*] Devs are always fixing bugs/issues and improving stuff. They also take community's feedback in consideration.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]What's not so good?[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Stories are not bad at all, but I felt the script and dialogs were a bit loose.\n[*] The English translation is not the best, but still enough to understand the plot.\n[*] I experienced some framedrops at some moments, but restarting the game fixed it.

Now on to the next please.\n    [*]What's up with the rapid fire cutscenes? It's stupidly fast, let it breath, let people read the subtitle. A lot of scenes disappear even before anyone can read the subtitles. \n    [*]The jump control is pretty flimsy, there is no sensitivity and you can barely control the direction after jumping. Mario, Ori, Hollow Knight, all have better jump control than this. If you don't fix this, then even if you manage to make good platforms, it will be awkward to control.\n    [*]Here is one big main problem. The LEVEL DESIGN IS RIDICULOUSLY BORING. If you are looking for a platformer, or metroidvania, this ain't it. The design is simply walk for one end to one end, that's it. I know this is not a platformer, but this is just bad. Some rooms doesn't even make sense, it's just a small room, nothing inside, just so you can walk to the other end very shortly. There is no secret, no place to explore. The problem is, THEY CAN CLEARLY DO IT BUT DIDN'T. With the male playthrough, there is some areas near the end that is moderately bigger than other areas. With Chinese settings, they could have made multi level cliff battle, temple & pagoda stages etc, but all they did was a walkway. I actually get excited a bit when I entered the broken 3 story temple because the rest of the stages are just a straight line.\n    [*]Progress is very linear, there really isn't anything to do other than the main storyline. Game is also very short, probably 6 hours for each character. Although they have 2, so that is around 12 hours.\n    [*]Lack of NPC or interactable world/objects. Considering a lot of NPC doesn't have voicelines, this is a good opportunity to add more story and text to give the world more flavor and lore. The straight line environment, combined with the lack of story, lore, npcs, makes it a very dead world. Which is a pity because it was rendered so beautifully.\n    [*]Dodge is very weird, you cannot do a dodge counter if you dodge forward, only if you dodge backwards. So it you want to dodge counter a projectile, you have to dodge backwards following the bullet. So in the graphics it looks like the bullet hits you, but mechanically, you've dodged the bullet. Many games have done dodge counter even for dodging forward, I don't understand why this can't.\n    [*]Stage progression is terrible, you have to clear every enemies in the room to progress. This is really stupid and restrictive. You can always make some battles mandatory for story purposes, but don't make EVERYTHING mandatory. Whereas in other games you can do a creative speedrun, this one you can't, your speedrun is really just how fast you can clear each room.\n    [*]Certain enemies and attacks have very poor visual clarity, especially for one boss. You can barely see that stupid transparent projectile among all other effects.\n    [*]Minor prob: I choose male 95% of the time, but here the male design is ugly and boring, I wish there are skins to choose from. While the female one is much better, it's unbelievable that they make 0 marketing with the superior character\n    [*]Different buttons for block & parry. This is also stupid, while many other games makes a missed parry into a block, here you must make a choice. But a lot of situations in this game requires to parry, not block, so the block is almost useless. Because blocking will eat your stamina, and if you have to block a boss' attack, chances are it will eat up your whole stamina, which screws you anyway. You will parry 95% of the time that you almost forgot you have a \"block\".\n    [*]Ordered list\n[/olist]\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]PROS[/b]\n[olist]\n    [*]The graphics is really2 very good, ethereal, like a painting. which is why it's such a shame that there is nothing interactive on th environment. The style really stands out, not your typical pixels, and not 3d. You can really feel the atmosphere on a dilapidated temple. If they have big layered stages with this kind of graphics, [u]it will truly stand out from all the competitors.[/u]\n    [*]The Combat: It's really very good, very deep, the meat of the game, just marred by the \"stupid clunky jumping\". It's control is pretty tight, and there are 6 skills to choose from, in which you can use 4, and interchangable during battle in an instant, so that it allows you mix up combos and adjust to the battle. While there are some overlapping skills, each character has enough different skills that makes them play quite differently. When you can chain all of them together, it feels very satisfying. It's deeper than Ori & HK.\n    [*]Instant potion usage. No more complaining you don't have time to use potion, this time it's instant.\n    [*]The Boss fights: they are great and some are amazing. The fights, especially the endgame bosses for each characters are really challenging. While there is a clear lack of more technical bosses and stage variation (only 1 boss has a platform stage!), most of them requires a good amount of strategy and cannot be approached by mere button mashing. Unlike HK where the boss feels more technical, here it feels more like a \"versus\" battle.\n    [*]Abundant of check points. Luckily they didn't follow Dark Souls, otherwise having to fight minions everytime before you fight a boss will make it extremely infuriating. Here there's always a check point before boss.\n   \n[/olist]\n[hr][/hr]\n[b]RECOMMENDATIONS[/b]\nDear devs, if you are going to make a dlc, please make the [b]stages bigger, more interesting, multi stories[/b], otherwise, it is really pointless. Different backgound, but the same dull and dead walkway. \nIf you are making bosses, make it more technical like Hollow Knight, have multi platform stage, switch etc. Don't make it too much like a versus battle which you already have plenty here. \nAdd more music if possible, it's really lacking here. \n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThere's really a lot of good things here, I really love it, but the unpolished control and many rough issues dull much of the shine from making it a valuable diamond.", "timestamp_created": 1626281215, "timestamp_updated": 1627579224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 243, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903449535369873047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95706610": {"recommendationid": "95706610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027558121", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 317, "last_played": 1626242354}, "language": "english", "review": "Great art and engaging gameplay)", "timestamp_created": 1626242393, "timestamp_updated": 1626242393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95703907": {"recommendationid": "95703907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994378716", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1626236687}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not usually a big fan of 2D beat'em ups, and that's kind of what this game is at the end of the day, but the art style is charming as hell and the combat is extremely engaging. Being too aggressive or too passive both tend to produce poor results, each enemy type changes the tempo of combat and for me 70% of every fight is figuring out how to balance parrying, dodging, and just pounding the enemy at every opening. I know it says I've been playing for 8 hours but with some long mid-game pauses it's closer to 6 split evenly between the two main scenarios. They actually do play surprisingly differently, with Xue being a little more slow and methodical and Yunchaun rewarding more aggression.\n\nIf you like a Souls-like where every boss is a fast combat puzzle and your likely path to success is going to be learning their movesets and patterns and responding accordingly then there's a lot of meat on these bones. I sometimes experience minor frustration with timing my parries on certain bosses where I seem to be consistently just a hair too fast or slow, but parrying in Souls-likes has never been a place where I've shined. To me this is a good indicator that fans of the genre will find some challenge here but people with crazy good reflexes may want to crank the difficulty up to hard to get their kicks.\n\nSpeaking of, this game's got an assist mode!

But having said that, there are some things which demotivated me to continue playing the game:\n\nGenerally, the story feels pretty random/bland (perhaps because it's translated incorrectly or the dialogues are unfinished at the moment). But the main issue I'm having is that the controls/abilities feel flawed, I constantly found myself having to deal with input delay. And that's not because of the \"stamina\" system which some other people complained about, but because you're unable to break any action your currently in, which causes an annoying input delay. Considering the game's combat system is about tight, fast-paced ability executions, this input-delay is a huge point of frustration to me. \n\nThe last negative thing I'd like to point out is the leveling-up system, it feels totally unnecessary. Why on earth does the game contain a leveling-up system when you can already change the game\u2019s difficulty in the main menu with the difficulty slider? And even when you level up, the amount of power/health you gain is literally only like 1% per level up (which isn\u2019t a fast process either). The \u201ctalent\u201d-tree system also has this issue; whenever you spend a point in the talent tree, your special ability\u2019s damage increases by only like 1%. Not to mention that the special abilities themselves feel no different compared to your standard abilities.\n\nThe gameplay trailer they\u2019ve made looks and sounds amazing, but sadly I didn\u2019t see this reflected within the game once I started playing it.\n\nKeep in mind though that the game is officially still in Early Access at the time of writing, but considering the game is officially getting released in about 10 days from now, I can\u2019t imagine much is going to change by that time.", "timestamp_created": 1624718826, "timestamp_updated": 1624718848, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.59321218729019165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "93527626": {"recommendationid": "93527626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109612775", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 157, "last_played": 1623364206}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely worth the price", "timestamp_created": 1623350298, "timestamp_updated": 1623350298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46961328387260437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "92958870": {"recommendationid": "92958870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416217583", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 362, "last_played": 1622497952}, "language": "english", "review": "good game, a bit hard but balanced at the same time \nI had fun time playing it", "timestamp_created": 1622498052, "timestamp_updated": 1622498052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564707040786743164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91052387": {"recommendationid": "91052387", "author": {"steamid": "76561199037295630", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1631017155}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it so much.

Some are quite inefficient through the gameplay, so you will see rarely a moment when they good to be used. \n\nThat leads to having a lot of choices which you don\u2019t really use, so makes the game pretty much a hack \u2018n slash.

No, it's completely linear. A tough challenge especially on hard mode. I really enjoyed getting all the achievements. The character has some moves but nothing like the amount say Dante has in DMC. Mastering parry and dodge is the key to this game. Managing stamina can be tricky and sometimes I felt overwhelmed by repeated enemy attacks however a change in approach/strategy will get you through. I found that taking out the guys with arrows/projectiles first a necessary strategy. The hardest achievement was completing the game on normal difficulty but without levelling up, it was kind of brutal but fun and rewarding. Some people might say that the game is short on content. I think it is adequate at the price. On your first play through on normal it'll take about 4 hrs. On casual mode you can expect a NewGame+ time of 1hr 45mins  once you have mastered the moves and levelled everything up. Not going to be for everyone but if you are a fan of hack n slash platforming combat this one is well presented and fun to play imo. After finishing the game you get a hint at further content which will be nice. There is also a Trials mode which is basically survive as long as possible during a shorter version of the game no cutscenes etc. gotta kill all 17 bosses in order with a few mobs in between. It adds a bit of replay value but soon gets boring when you can do all 17 bosses in about 10-12 minutes if you know how.

It is a 2D side-scrolling action RPG created by Wildfire Game and published by bilibili. As you can check in the awards details, this game has unique graphics and design. The ink painting style graphic and dark vibe are pretty impressive. The gameplay is somehow interesting, but there seem to be still quite a few things to polish. Let's take a look at it with Nyanco-chan! (\u0e05'\u03c9'\u0e05)\n\n[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]\n\nEastern Exorcist is set in a Chinese style fantasy eastern world where the vicious spirits and monsters exist. It features the hand-drawn ink painting style with lots of wet scenes. You play as a skilled exorcist against chaotic evil demon to fight your way through the brutal world, and you experience some stories of joy and sorrow. The action battle system is to use your sword to execute demons and monsters with tactical combat mechanics. Various martial arts, skill systems, items, and more are available, but getting used to using the dodge is the most important in the current game balance. There are 3 difficulty levels available, except for the easiest casual mode, the rest may require some grinding for leveling-up. \n\nIf you are interested in the eastern dark fantasy, you may need to pay more attention to this game. Chinese mythology style monster designs are pretty creepy, but humans in the game sometimes have bad hearts than monsters when it comes to storylines. Story cutscenes unfolds in the form of Chinese opera that supports voice acting. The gameplay proceeds in the following order : 'Field Maps -> Normal Monsters -> Boss Battle'. There is a small temple(shrine) on the field map, where you can recover the health, get items, and grow your character in exchange for the collected monster souls. The gameplay is interesting and challenging overall.\n\n[h1][b][3] Pros (+) & Cons (-) [/b][/h1]\n[table]\n[td][list]\n[*][+] Good Potential\n[*][+] Serious Vibe & Story\n[*][+] Cool Swordplay Action\n[*][+] Ink Painting Style Graphics\n[/list][/td]\n[td][list]\n[*][-] Some Bugs\n[*][-] Limited Interaction\n[*][-] Repetitive & Grinding\n[*][-] Too Simple Mechanics\n[/list][/td]\n[/table]\n\n[h1][b][4] Verdict (Early Access): Game 7.5/10, Translation 8/10[/b][/h1]\nEastern Exorcist \u65a9\u5996\u884c. This is a stunning 2D side-scrolling action RPG adventure where the player can experience a Chinese style dark fantasy world. The game artwork is unique in the style of ink painting, and the action is specialized in swordsmanship. It is so cool. It's early access, but it shows good enough potential. There are three chapters in the current build, and the play time to complete the prepared content is about 7-8 hours. If you are looking for an action game with a dark mood, Eastern Exorcist is the game for you. Recommended!\n\n[h1][b]Side Note[/b][/h1]\n[code]Looking for nice anime games?

To see a similar theme in a 2-D side-scrolling action RPG game is just icing on the cake. This is the Review of Eastern Exorcist (Early Access on steam) developed by Wildfire Games and Published by bilibili.\n\nEVIL SPIRITS, DEMONS, AND GODS EVERYWHERE\n\nSet in an eastern fantasy world, you play as an exorcist who fights through chaotic evil while going through different regions/areas experiencing the different stories of joy and sorrow. From my playthrough, all I can say is there is very little joy here and most of the sorrow and how people who get succumbed to evil schemes and tactics plagiarize the world around them and they would do anything to see their plans succeed.\n\nI mentioned how Eastern Exorcist feels like a 2-D Sekiro game, and it does to an extent. You get power orbs as you keep killing enemies, which you can use to level up your character. You can only increase your health and attack power in the character level up screen and nothing else and they level up together at a fixed amount with the need of increasing power orbs every time you level up.\n\nGAMEPLAY & GRAPHICS\n\nThe combat is fast and fluid, the hit animations and registry of the hit on enemies is spot on. For an early access game, this feels likes a totally finished game in terms of gameplay. The UI is simple with a health bar and stamina on both sides and your abilities in between them. There is only one weapon, the sword, with which you will be doing your entire playthrough and also with your various abilities.\n\nEastern Exorcist boosts a near-perfect dodge and counter system which works really well and even awards players with extra mana if timed correctly which helps in powering up your abilities. Each and every ability is unique and you get them by defeating certain enemies/bosses and they all require a certain amount of mana to perform. Perfect Dodging will consume 0 mana, hence if you are someone who is good at dodging in souls-like games, would have no problem using abilities at all times.\n\nShrines are scattered throughout the entire game and you can teleport easily between them without any cost to power. Here you can level up your character or Excess Replenishment (buy healing portions) or do challenge quests and get rewarded with power orbs and much more.\n\nEnemies and bosses need to be dispelled by pressing RT on the controller when they are on their last breath, else they would respawn back again to full health. Certain abilities work perfectly with Dispel and grants the character unique abilities on top of it which can be customized on the pause screen. Enabling new abilities on the ability tree requires power as well as 1,2 or even 3 blue orbs which you get by exploring the surroundings near you.\n\nThe enemy variation in this game is another key factor. Each and every enemy is unique to the area you are visiting and the same goes for the mini and major boss encounters as well. They all have their own unique abilities and attack pattern and none of them feel overwhelming or overpowered. I finished the game on normal difficulty as there are easy and harder options as well and also a New Game + mode as well which unlocks once you finish the main story.\n\nThe game right now in its early-access state has three acts, each act occurring in different areas with their own unique levels, enemies, and boss encounters. You will come across a total of 7 new abilities along the way and you can switch between them in real-time by moving the right camera D-pad and use shortcuts to 4 of your favorite abilities. Each ability has its own attack power, range, and mana cost and should be used depending on the situation that it calls for.\n\nEach and every evil boss encounter you come across has an origin story that fills you up as to why the current state of affairs occurred in the first place which gives the fight a proper purpose.\n\nMUSIC & SOUND\n\nThe music and soundtrack in this game are dark with drum beats as you would expect during combat, sword attack animation sounds are proper and the cutscenes in the game are well done as it properly explains everything that\u2019s going around the character and the various bosses/enemies involved in the game. Cutscenes are shown in the form of Chinese Opera.\n\nMINOR NITPICKS\n\nMy only gripe with the Eastern Exorcist is the game\u2019s three-hour length. But I guess its fine since it is in early access and there will be more levels and character campaigns added later on when the game launches properly in the next three-six months.\n\nThe game has no advanced graphical options for now as it only has resolution and full-screen options for now.\n\nDisclaimer: Thanks to Renaissance PR for providing us with an early access steam key.\n\nConclusion:\nEastern Exorcist does everything well in all aspects of the game including level design, gameplay, combat, abilities, and enemy design but falls short of a mere three-hour-long only campaign for now which would be extended with a new story and character with the final built.\n\nRATING:\n9/10\n\nFor more Game and Tech related Reviews Please visit :\n\n https://www.techsyndrome.in", "timestamp_created": 1597766068, "timestamp_updated": 1597766068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74510451": {"recommendationid": "74510451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066864338", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1640545949}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked the game might need some polish but good game overall", "timestamp_created": 1597763084, "timestamp_updated": 1597763084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74507514": {"recommendationid": "74507514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042342015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 300, "last_played": 1660330812}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game with very responsive devs.  Side scrolling souls-like (in some ways) with interesting exorcism concept.

The dev. chose to significantly reduce the stamina cost on casual, so it's on the easy side now, but you can ramp up the difficulty if you choose.

The combat and the artstyle is amazing as well as the monster designs being ripped straight out of some Chinese mythological book or something.\n\nThe artstyle looks a lot like Eastern paintings which looks really cool. \n\nThe only downside is that leveling up is very basic. You use \"souls\" to power up and that increases your HP and Attack Power. But you can go into more detail with the Sword Art ability tree.\n\nAlso it would be cool if they made the health bar and stamina bar a bit larger or had an effect when you are low on stamina and health so it is more noticeable!\n\nEdit: So I am just near the end of the game from what I can tell, most reviewers seem to clock in around 6-7 hours (I am at 4.6 as of this edit). \n\nThe game gets linear in Chapter 2 and 3, which I don't mind personally, but at least have more optional treasure areas to find more orbs. \n\nFurthermore I hope the game continues to expand and add more chapters as it would fit the narrative very well (because you are playing a wandering swordsman/exorcist so he could so stumble upon any problem that needs solving).\n\nThe Early Access version also seems to have fluctuation in frames that are solved by pausing the game for a short while (I'd say give it ten seconds). This worked for me at least.\n\nSo to summarise its a fun Castlevania/Blasphemous style linear game set in a Chinese period that greatly utilises the setting.

The underwhelming 'Exorcist Arts' levelling system and the difficulty of the bosses varying wildly on Normal brings the game down. Linearity to the levels is disappointing as Chapter 1 has some minor backtracking which gave me hope for more but it just goes completely linear after that.
