Even though I don't have like 500h of playtime, it is still a great game to kill a few minutes and calm down.\nI definitely recommend it to people who want to do something senseless whilst creating something beautiful.\nRegarding the price: 5,99 \u20ac is more than fair and gets you this great chill experience!\nPerformance wise it should run just fine on literally everything, including the SteamDeck.\n\nBut I have some suggestions for improvement & feature requests (not only from me, I took some inspiration from other reviews):\n[list]\n    [*] It would be nice, to have more building types, like Bridges or Shops\n    [*] Also a cool feature would be the possibility - in addition to the automated decision - to be able to choose which type of building topping is used, like roof structures, rooftop terraces, lighthouses, towers, etc..\n    [*] Humans walking around would also add a nice touch to the game, because this way the towns / structures would be more alive (besides the birds).\n    [*] Also multiple brush tools would be a nice addition, for example to arrange houses in shapes, recolour houses, etc.\n    [*] For nice screenshots, alternative backgrounds would also be very cool.\n    [*] For more building customisation different roof types would make room for new possibilities.\n    [*] As an alternative to the normal camera view, I saw the idea for a 1st person view of one of the humans walking around your town, which you also can control, to go around the build town.\n[/list] \n\nAll in all it is a wonderful game to just chill out...\nDefinitely recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1699386871, "timestamp_updated": 1699386871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase":

Market stalls and other things to go on the streets like wells\n4. A Big one is people. The game is really colorful but after a time of playing it... It feels dead, like a ghost town. There's no activity or really anything going on.\n5. Brush/ placement controls\n6. A modding community. Even if only for resource packs, many people could add things nobody would've thought about, but that are great additions to the game.\n7. Another big one is land. Even if just a small island, it would make the game so much more interesting. You could build a city hanging off the side of a cliff over the water, imagine how cool things like that would be. \n8. Weather! The game has only night and day, which you must manually control. It makes the game feel like it's in a really choppy simulation. Storms would be very cool, especially if there were lightning rods on the roofs. \n9. Animals!\n10. The sounds of a city!

That's just wishful thinking tho, as the game is called as complete by the developer. \n\nDon't get me wrong tho, it's impressive what they did with this toy, as in being able to spawn cutesy coastal cities with so little effort and all procedurally, demands an incredible amount of effort and craftsmanship which I respect.

I've found a few of those features, but with the limited control you're relying on the game to delight you with these little surprises, and very quickly it's become formulaic with a mix of frustration that I can't get it to create what I'm looking for, and boredom that nothing new is happening.\n\nIt's irritatingly static in the graphics too, whilst yes it responds dynamically to your changes, once you stop it all stops.

As charming as the graphics are, it's beautiful, but it's held back from being a true masterpiece.\n\nI'd like to say \"it's only worth buying if you like this sort of thing\" but it's too unique to draw a comparison to other games, so I'll say probably worth it if you don't mind throwing a fiver away for a couple of hours entertainment.", "timestamp_created": 1687686872, "timestamp_updated": 1687686872, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540034055709838867", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140650270": {"recommendationid": "140650270", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038474549", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 175, "last_played": 1688681884}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple.

I also have some extra suggestions that I just think would be neat.\n\nThese suggestions are in order of what I think is most important.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT\n\nDrag to place:\nYou could quickly place tiles in the same layer by clicking and dragging, and it would place tiles following your cursor. You could hold shift and drag up and it would place blocks in the same column. Maybe you could hold tab or enter and you could quickly place a \"square\" (because of the irregular tile shapes it wouldn't be a perfect square) of tiles on one layer. Like holding left click and selecting multiple icons at once on your desk top. I'm not super sure how to describe it but I hope that gets my point across. Currently for me it feels better to use my touchscreen rather than my mouse to add tiles because it's faster and I feel like it's easier to not miss click.\n\nAlternate grids:\nI'd like to have a square grid or free placement to make more custom placements would be great. I'd like to make circular courtyards in specific areas and such.\n\nPlacing grassy areas:\nIt would be nice to be able to place grassy or foresty areas to make parks, and field plots to flesh out the town a bit.\n\nOptional courtyard:\nI'd like the choice between keeping the paved paths where courtyards are automatically generated. Like you could click a brush on the side and turn the courtyards green instead of it being automatic. It would also be nice to be able to use the courtyard tiles as the normal path tiles.\n\nAbility to chose building style:\nTheses a few styles of buildings for the different layers of the town, and it would be nice to have an optional advanced building UI that allows you to chose which building you want to place for each layer.\n\nLESS IMPORTANT\n\nChoosing path border colors:\nIt would be nice to be able to change the border on the path tiles from red to the other colors that are available for the houses.\n\nMore background options:\nI like the ocean scene, but I think a grassy and/or foresty background would be nice.\n\nMore building styles:\nMore buildings and styles of buildings would be nice, but that would come out to be the very lowest thing on my list of suggestions vs the rest of the building tool updates because it would require making a lot of new models and textures, and I would prefer the extra build tools.\n\nI do really like the ability to export the towns as .obj files, because they would be cool to 3D print. You could use them as model bases or TTRPG terrain. Other formats would be nice, because more options are always nice, but it's cool that you let us export it at all.\n\nI'd personally like the suggestions I listed because I would like to use this game as a reference for my D&D campaign town maps because I feel like it would be a really good and easy to use tool with a few tweeks. I would say the drag to place and the alternate grids would be the most important to do something like what I want to do, since I could just take a screenshot and label the buildings with editing that are important, and it doesn't have to be a 1:1 for it to be a good reference map as long as I had more placement freedom and easier to use building tools.\n\nI understand if you don't want to add all this since it's such a cheap game and it's very worth the $3.59 I bought it for on sale, but these are just things that I think would be really useful for me personally and other DMs that want an easy to use, cheap, and fun map maker.\n\nThank you for reading and thank you for the game!", "timestamp_created": 1682241422, "timestamp_updated": 1682241422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71730494499206543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137154363": {"recommendationid": "137154363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376735679", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1682229330}, "language": "english", "review": "super fun relaxing game if you want to sit back and chill this is the game for you its fun to build tall towers that go up so high you cant see the top love this game 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1682228936, "timestamp_updated": 1682228936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137149834": {"recommendationid": "137149834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300234595", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1691636661}, "language": "english", "review": "I have had this game for abt 24 hours and I am in so much aww, I never review games but I had to for this game, it is so incredible in every way.

You click around on a small 3D rendered map and buildings pop up.  Depending on where and how you click, the buildings may take various different forms like a tower or something.  You can choose what colours the buildings will be from a palette on the side of the screen.  That's all there is to this.  Visual bubble wrap. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with what actually makes something a game, a \"game loop\" describes the interaction and feedback a gamer has when playing a game.  Tetris, for example, has a game loop where a random block appears, the gamer interacts with the block to position it, and then the game decides if that finishes a row or not, increases the players score if any rows were completed, then gives the gamer another block to position.  Counter-Strike has a game loop where a player seeks another player, tests their skill against that player by shooting them or being shot, the computer rewards the player if they win, and then if the player survives, they repeat that loop.  There's no loop here, no true interactive feedback.  It simply is not a game, it cannot be \"played\".\n\nIt can be \"played with\", but then you can open up Excel and use your arrow keys to make the cursor move around in amusing directions if you really want... does that make Microsoft Excel a game?  No, it doesn't (except for the version of Excel that had that hidden flight sim easter egg... which is more of a game than this is!).   See what I mean?\n\nThere's not much else to say about this because it's not a game, which disqualifies this for recommendation to gamers as a game.  I suppose it's worth noting it looks nice... which just means it's a waste of effort that could have been spent more wisely on making an actual game.  This could have been the foundation for a charming Sim City style game or something... but no.  \n\nThere's also some technical defects that should be addressed if anyone still wants to go ahead and buy this non-game mobile app on Steam. \n\nFrom a technical perspective, as a mobile app, this doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the mobile app and not many meaningful ways to customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this mobile app is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this mobile app will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.\n\nBecause this is a mobile app, it carries a number of deliberate design deficiencies.  Compromises were made to cater to the iPhones that the mobile app was designed for.  These are unfortunate handicaps and limitations that PC gamers shouldn't be forced to accept, but it's evident that PC was an afterthought for the iPhone developers who are to blame for this.  The mobile app is deficient as a result of these choices, and would have been so much better without the handicaps that designing games for mobile phones forces upon a game.  Once more, mobile devs have made gaming worse for everyone.  I didn't spend thousands on building a gaming rig just so I could pretend it's an iPhone.\n\nThese technical defects push this mobile app below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nTownscaper has the preposterous price of around $6 USD ($1 more expensive than on the app stores, so that's a poke in the eye to PC gamers from these mobile devs), it's not worth it given the defects and shortcomings with the product, especially considering the sheer number of completely free, much higher quality games on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1681543225, "timestamp_updated": 1681543225, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.20648542046546936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136706332": {"recommendationid": "136706332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155777806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 188, "last_played": 1691717849}, "language": "english", "review": "Relaxing game.", "timestamp_created": 1681510788, "timestamp_updated": 1681510788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136587360": {"recommendationid": "136587360", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059666615", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1674748698}, "language": "english", "review": "plz add achievements like on console\n", "timestamp_created": 1681323723, "timestamp_updated": 1681323723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136550666": {"recommendationid": "136550666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322026400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 651, "last_played": 1695677049}, "language": "english", "review": "So relaxing!", "timestamp_created": 1681259118, "timestamp_updated": 1681259118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136526552": {"recommendationid": "136526552", "author": {"steamid": "76561199230559841", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1684124832}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Combining this with something like Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (TABS) where players could make an arena then have their pawns fight each other? Or incorporating elements of a tower defense game. Making sniper towers, or enemies behind corners? This toy could do so much. Defending a flying island from enemies? Yes please. Triggering a tsunami? or earthquake? or a fire?! \n\nTownscraper is a fantastic building block but only a building block thus far.

All the other ideas people have come up with have been ignored, and the dev's moved on.\n\nAfter designing dozens of structures, the game loses its appeal, but you're still looking at dozens of hours of enjoyment before that happens.   I just wish people were walking around, or you could go for a stroll.  I wish there were shops, or larger parks got playparks in them.... I wish there were boats that would sail around.  I wish there were fish or dolphins...

I hope you guys get the new update to enable the bigger map on phone and Switch like the PC version.", "timestamp_created": 1664087542, "timestamp_updated": 1664087542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522257208824157715", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122773072": {"recommendationid": "122773072", "author": {"steamid": "76561199321402804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1617, "last_played": 1682734005}, "language": "english", "review": "love\n", "timestamp_created": 1664060632, "timestamp_updated": 1664060632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477742820978164673", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122722421": {"recommendationid": "122722421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128486804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1673604918}, "language": "english", "review": "the best.", "timestamp_created": 1663993527, "timestamp_updated": 1663993527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122681810": {"recommendationid": "122681810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847754425", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1907, "last_played": 1686876838}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cute", "timestamp_created": 1663935351, "timestamp_updated": 1663935351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477742820978164673", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122643726": {"recommendationid": "122643726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233271108", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1686234778}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1663872193, "timestamp_updated": 1663872193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122590111": {"recommendationid": "122590111", "author": {"steamid": "76561199036617946", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 158, "last_played": 1689800886}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would break the refund limit in one session again", "timestamp_created": 1663779049, "timestamp_updated": 1663779049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122583736": {"recommendationid": "122583736", "author": {"steamid": "76561199014205286", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1664591845}, "language": "english", "review": "houses.", "timestamp_created": 1663770061, "timestamp_updated": 1663770061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122580515": {"recommendationid": "122580515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198408694254", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 302, "last_played": 1663854098}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game not very long ago and I already like the game.

It's simply a virtual stress toy which is fine to some, but not me. Although the game is clearly all about creativity, there is no form of progression which essentially locks the player into a small box of choices, rather than expanding slowly and inspiring the player to think outside of said box.. Unlocking new building types and being able to choose what types of buildings are placed would make this game way more enjoyable, encourage different flavours of creativity and increase it's longevity tenfold without hindering it's focus on relaxation and avoidance of a set goal.\n\nAt 7 minutes I feel like I have seen everything that this \"game\" has to offer, that is probably a new record.\nNotice though that I haven't said that it is bad though, because it isn't. It does what it set out to do quite well, the issue is that what it set out to do is incredibly lacking in content and ironically creativity,since it entirely relies on the player's. On top of that after my 7 minutes of playtime and watching the trailers I really don't see any increase in possibilities, nothing stood out as \"that looks cool, I should build that\", I've literally done everything.\n\nThe only downside I would say is that it bizarrely doesn't allow for player freedom, which inherently is an issue in a creative sandbox game with no goal. \nWant to have some stairs that go up to this other block? Nope, that's now a house.\nWant a long tunnel under a bridge? Nope, that's now a long solid block.\nWant to separate these to roads that are next to each other with a railing or gap? Nope, they are now attached and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nIt desperately needs a feature that allows players to alter a block's type or shape. The game would keep it's simplicity and flow, but will allow players to build what they truly want to. I would argue that this is the primary reason that 7 minutes was enough playtime for me to think I'd seen everything, because the blocks always play out in the same manner.\n\nIt really gives off that feeling you would get while playing Minecraft where you're trying to build something but the blocks are just slightly too big for that thing you wanted to build, so now that thing needs to be twice as big as planned. And even Minecraft has started to fix that with the addition of different shaped blocks, fences, walls, windows and other decorative blocks.\n\nAgain it isn't necessarily bad, but for a game that does so little it has no excuse to be anything other than perfect, which it just isn't.\nIt's fine for players that just want to click and build blocks but there really isn't anything more to it than that. \n\nPersonally I think I wouldn't have an issue with it if it was free as it comes off as a tech demo for something that might be bigger and better in the future, but right now it is a glorified fidget toy and not worth any amount of money.", "timestamp_created": 1660502499, "timestamp_updated": 1660502499, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481865882873535156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120599283": {"recommendationid": "120599283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839925141", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 3373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3247, "last_played": 1689566636}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Short Review:[/h1]\n\n\u2013 No puzzles or goals, just creative expression\n\u2013 Simple to use\n\u2013 Cute art style\n\u2013 Little customization, but you can change it up a bit with mods or custom palettes\n\u2013 Gives me inspiration for other creative projects\n\u2013 Super chill and relaxing game!\n\n[h1]Full Review:[/h1]\n\nI\u2019ve played for over 40 hours so far, and I can still see myself playing some more. This game is so chill, and I love it! A lovely little sandbox town building game. Cute art style. Colorful buildings. Fun little details that pop up sometimes (like clotheslines between buildings, or little sculptures in gardens). Simple to play. No puzzles or goals or objectives or obstacles, just creative expression.\n\nI\u2019m finding this game is also great for inspiration. Some of the towns I\u2019ve created have happened sort of by accident or just evolved into something once I started messing around, but now they\u2019re giving me ideas for stories or art. I\u2019ve also seen people suggest using it to make maps for D&D campaigns, book worlds, etc. I\u2019ve even seen fan art and animations, so clearly I\u2019m not the only one feeling inspired!\n\nI would personally like if there were a bit more customization. As it is right now, all you can choose is the color of buildings, where to put them on the grid, how to stack them, and the location of the sun for lighting. Certain build features can be manifested by learning little tips and tricks, but they still only work if you build in that exact way (e.g. you can get stairs, but only if you create a platform between two buildings with a certain setup). Roofs, archways, etc. form automatically based on certain rules (so you have some control, but you might have to adjust what you\u2019re building to make it work). You can get a grassy area, but only if you enclose a section fully within buildings. I\u2019d love if you could at least choose between pavement or grass for each separate area, and if you could add walls without whole buildings. Maybe some control over roof vs flat surface. But judging the game on exactly what it is meant to be\u2014a super simple automatic builder\u2014it succeeds. And there is still so much room for variety and creativity, even within the limitations.\n\nSome good news though for people who want a bit more customization is that there are mods, created by other players! (Just search online to find them.) They don\u2019t solve the problems I mentioned above, but so far I\u2019ve seen ones that offer different texture/color palettes (you can also make your own pretty easily), the ability to change plant color, and weather. Just these few things can open up whole new possibilities (e.g. I used some darker color schemes to turn one of my builds into a vampire town).\n\nSo if you want something to just chill with, or an easy way to explore your creativity, this is cute, and I recommend it! If you\u2019re looking for real gameplay or detailed customization, it might not be for you, since there\u2019s not much more to it than plopping down buildings. But there can be a lot of creativity and planning involved, if you really get into. Even more so if you download or make your own palettes and textures. With the amount of time I\u2019ve spent playing, clearly I\u2019m enjoying it!\n\n*Review (and pictures of my builds) can also be found on my blog (link in profile).*\n\n[h1]Accessibility:[/h1]\n\n(May not include everything)\n\n\u2013 No accessibility options.\n\u2013 Available for computers and some other devices, including touch screen.", "timestamp_created": 1660459441, "timestamp_updated": 1660459441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640815615653991699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120595186": {"recommendationid": "120595186", "author": {"steamid": "76561199215518790", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1694060051}, "language": "english", "review": "The best calming and satisfying game since the history of Mars.", "timestamp_created": 1660451992, "timestamp_updated": 1660451992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120594045": {"recommendationid": "120594045", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976530013", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1660449295}, "language": "english", "review": "\"No real gameplay\" is actually kind of overselling this software.

Sure, you can make screenshots of what you have built, but the .OBJ file export is half-baked (it exports 3D object with broken textures). Texturing the 3D model to replicate all the shaders is not something a regular person could do with 3D Builder or Paint 3D apps, it should work out of the box or not be an option at all (like on mobile).\n\nThere is one cool thing about it though - you can share your creations really easily, you just copy the state of your build to the clipboard and send it to a friend and they can paste it back into their app. So, when Wordle became viral, I was able to build a tool that converted Wordle results into Townscaper buildings https://tarmo888.github.io/Wordle2Townscaper/\n\nSo, while I have tried Townscaper on desktop, laptop, Android mobile phone, Steam Deck, and even in the browser, it's just a cute tool for me, which gets boring after 5 minutes.

"last_played": 1657064144}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]General Information of The Review[/h1]\n\nI do recommend playing this game and I feel like I got my money worth for how inexpensive this game is, however, I do wish there was even more to this game that would get updates in the future.\n\nI haven't played a lot of this game, since I played it during troubles with my internet, but I do intend to come back to his game and chill out working on creativity practice. I still got a lot on what I want to do, even getting into modifications to the game as to make and have different textures for different looks/themes. For example, having a more winter season to the builds I make. This game is mainly just a tech demo proof of concept type work, which is pretty well implemented rather than explicitly saying \"this is a tech demo\" with only basic textures that has no character to it.\n\nAlso, I know this game is described as a toy. But I call it a game due to what I consider, and what a lot others consider, a game is. Some people had complained to me about my choice of words when describing this game, but they don't seem to understand I consider a game as anything digital displayed on a monitor display where the user is interacting with the medium. Legit, some of you need to calm down because I decide to use a word to describe this product.\n\n[h1]Criticisms of The Game[/h1] \n\nBefore I get into this section, I'm happy with the game and I want to see the best for what this game has to offer. This is why I have criticisms of this game, so that maybe updates can come out in the future for improving the game.\n\n[b]What I'd Generally Like to See[/b]\n\nWhat I would like to see out of this game is more updates to it. There is a lot of support for this game and I would love to see the base game get more features for it to be better fleshed out. Like I said before, this is basically a tech demo and it will still have a lot of work I personally view as unfinished for it to be considered as a fully finished game. \n\n[b]Price Not Equal to What You Get[/b]\n\nThe asking price of this game is $6, which I do think is a bit too high considering this is literally just a tech demo. I would say the better price should be $3 - $4 for what you are getting in this game. I know some may say \"why would it matter if it is a couple dollars less, it's not all that expensive at $6 anyway\", to which I say, you are wrong. I care about the value of the game, this being the quality and quantity of content in the game relative to the asking price. Despite the content being great quality, there truthfully isn't much for this game to ask $6 out of me. Which thankfully I got this on the Steam Summer sale for a cheaper price more close to what I would pay for this game.\n\nIf there were more features to this game, of the same great quality, I can see myself paying $6 - $10 if you added some more quality content. In fact, if you fully developed this game to be larger than it is now, I can see myself paying up to $15 for this game. However, the tech demo that it is now just doesn't seem worth the asking price of $6.\n\n[b]Updates I'd Like to See[/b]\n\nLet me start off saying this, if they want to live up to the $6 asking price, they should have better modification integration for this game. This game doesn't seem to get any updates, but this one is a must if you want to meet up to the asking price and then just do nothing after that. I really don't want to have to deal with 3rd parties modifying the game as to make this game have all or most of the features I'd like to have.\n\nIn no particular order, here is a list of updates I'd like to seer:\n[list]\n[*] Better modification support\n[*] Playing music while building (I've only had menu music)\n[*] Automatic day and night cycles\n[*] Automatic and Custom seasonal changes (including snowfall for winter and leaves falling on the ground for autumn)\n[*] Aquatic structures (Boats is a good example)\n[*] More animal types (no humans, but could be toggle-able option)\n[*] Better sharing of work, especially for cross-platform\n[*] Better texture pack support\n[*] Manual object manipulation after the automatic placements\n[*] Two modes, one for relaxed back play and the other for more specific control\n[/list]\n\n[i]This is all of what I can think of right now, but there is for sure a lot that can be done to this game. At least have better modification integration, so we could have modders make these sort of updates to download ourselves.

I think the description as a toy and not a game is accurate, so if you are looking for something with video game stuff like objectives, etc, you will be disappointed. However, if you're in the mood to play with an artful software toy, then I'd highly recommend trying this, even at full price. Me personally, I wouldn't buy it again unless it was 50% off.

It's a toy where you click click click to create a block, then a little tiny house, then a two story house, then a tower by clicking on the same spot. There are conditions when you click that will create a slightly different building, so if you create a 6x6 \"wall\" (of houses) and you destroy the middle block at the bottom, that will create a ark. Yes, that's it. How long this will last it's up to you, but I'm quite confident that even the most relaxed player enjoying to build a town one house at a time will soon get bored because, once you've find out about the different behaviour you get by using different colours, or the \"flying\" cities, or about gardens, the discovery is pretty much over. While this game/toy explicitly has no real purpose other than be visually pleasant, It lacks of some advanced techniques to make it last longer: you cannot chose anything else than the colour. They could at least add the ability to chose the type of the building, perhaps from just 3 options to keep its simplicity, like house, church or palace. Or maybe chose a prebuilt building. Or textures. Or at least to fill a f** circle with blocks without having to create one by one. I mean, something to give just a bit more control. It even has no music. Since the developer clearly stated that the development is basically over, this game is pretty much dead and there will be no further addition, it will likely be just this very limited clickclickclick forever. Someone has started to add mods (multiplayer and \"first person\" walk) but that requires to install a loader and a bunch of other files so that's not available, for example, on mobile. But it shows it would be simple for the devs to include that and much more. Some more effort from the developer, which is apparently surprised his game (toy) is selling so well, would be really appreciated, and it would definitely change this review to a thumbs-up because the game on its own deserves it, but in this moment it seems to me just a dead project", "timestamp_created": 1652429508, "timestamp_updated": 1652433555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46074223518371582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115373767": {"recommendationid": "115373767", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968319411", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1652417975}, "language": "english", "review": "More of a \"toy\" than a game, Townscaper is an objective-less take on the town builder genre where you work to make a village that's interesting to view more than functional.

The map of the game shows the sea divided into a network of uneven, tiny sectors. Most of them are similar to a square, although there are also some similar to a triangle, a pentagon or even a hexagon. The grid of these sectors is not evenly distributed and from the ruler, on the contrary - everything here is curved, rounded, asymmetrical. At first glance, it looks strange, but when we start building our city, we will be captivated by the beauty of naturally twisted streets or houses with sometimes bizarre, irregular shapes.\nTownscaper\n\nBut let's not get ahead of the facts. I wrote that we feel the magic of Townscaper from the first click and there was not a word of exaggeration in it. We click and here, with the strangely satisfying sound of a bursting bubble, foundations emerge from the sea. Click a second time and a house stands on the foundations. We click a few more times, floors are added and the house turns into a tower. We can also remove blocks that have already been placed - demolishing the foundations will make our house stand on steel beams. Such clicking is simply pleasant in itself and evokes associations with snapping a bubble wrap - but this is just the beginning.\nCan you live here?\n\nThe real fun begins when we discover that by using different colors of the blocks and skilfully manipulating the surroundings, we can conjure up countless types of buildings. Do we want to build tenement houses instead of houses? Nothing easier. Or maybe majestic castles with towers and courtyards? This can also be done. Lighthouses? Cranes over the canals? Churches? Gardens full of greenery? Or maybe huge sky platforms floating on propellers? Also present.\n\nEverything is doable, it just takes your imagination and hours spent experimenting and discovering the block combinations that the game's creator came up with. There is no menu with a choice of building types. All we have is a cursor and a color palette that we will change before placing the next object. Seemingly it is not enough, but it must be added that for anyone who has a bit of creativity, the hours will pass imperceptibly here.\nI only regret emptiness\n\nOne more thing is worth mentioning. Well, Townscaper is just lovely. With every click, our town is enriched with new details - seagulls will land on the roofs of high tenement houses, clothes lines or flags will appear between the houses, benches and flower pots will appear near the houses, butterflies will begin to fly in the gardens. This can be counted endlessly.\nTownscaper\n\nBut here too, the Townscaper's biggest flaw is revealed. The cities conjured up by the game are so wonderful that you feel sorry for not being able to do anything more with them. Although I love classic city builders, I can wave my hand at the fact that this game allows us to build everything and without embarrassment that instead of placing obstacles in front of the player, it lets the player into the sandbox, where there are no restrictions. But what hurts me is that I cannot see how the built city lives, that I cannot see its inhabitants, that I cannot walk along its alleys or swim through the canals by myself.\n\nPerhaps these frustrations are a little premature.

Sometimes you want to add more to the build but it will turn into a balcony instead... little things like that are annoying and limit the building a little but I'd still rate this game high - its cool!!", "timestamp_created": 1647257891, "timestamp_updated": 1647257891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112159400": {"recommendationid": "112159400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128381081", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1647209554}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful graphics but no game play thus making this a boring game", "timestamp_created": 1647241399, "timestamp_updated": 1647241399, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454235374927520752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "112154234": {"recommendationid": "112154234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353526194", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 99, "last_played": 1647232230}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game, it's simple and enjoyable - very zen.
