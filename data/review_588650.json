relentless, exhilarating journey that seamlessly blends the best elements of roguelikes and Metroidvanias, creating a gaming experience that's both punishing and deeply satisfying.\n\nFrom the moment you take control of the nimble protagonist, you're thrown into a procedurally generated labyrinth filled with grotesque creatures and challenging foes. The combat is precise, demanding skill and strategy as you navigate through intricate levels, uncovering hidden secrets and unlocking new weapons along the way.\n\nOne of Dead Cells' standout features is its fluidity. The controls are razor-sharp, and the responsive gameplay ensures that every death feels fair. The permadeath aspect might seem daunting at first, but it's this very element that keeps you coming back for more. Each run feels like a chance for redemption, and the thrill of discovering new weapons and abilities adds a layer of excitement to every playthrough.\n\nThe game's pixel art is not only visually stunning but also serves as a testament to the attention to detail that went into its design. The atmospheric soundtrack complements the dark, foreboding tone of the game, immersing you in its mysterious world.\n\nWhat truly sets Dead Cells apart, however, is its replayability. The procedural generation ensures that no two runs are ever the same, and the vast array of weapons, skills, and power-ups allow for countless playstyles. The constant sense of progression, even in the face of defeat, is addictive and keeps you hooked for hours on end.\n\nThe developers have been incredibly supportive post-launch, regularly introducing updates and new content that breathe fresh life into the game. It's evident that the team behind Dead Cells is passionate about their creation, and it reflects in the overall quality of the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Dead Cells is a must-play for fans of challenging roguelikes and Metroidvanias. Its tight controls, captivating pixel art, and endless replayability make it a standout title in the genre. Embrace the challenge, hone your skills, and revel in the satisfaction of conquering the ever-shifting, hostile world of Dead Cells.", "timestamp_created": 1700602138, "timestamp_updated": 1700602138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150687539": {"recommendationid": "150687539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269246012", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 723, "last_played": 1685039476}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1700601259, "timestamp_updated": 1700601259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150687283": {"recommendationid": "150687283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198941580610", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 18152, "last_played": 1700601269}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is excellently innovative, and the amount of care that's put in makes this, to me, one of the best games ever.", "timestamp_created": 1700601231, "timestamp_updated": 1700601231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150686838": {"recommendationid": "150686838", "author": {"steamid": "76561199126669222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2958, "last_played": 1694428028}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is amazing\n\nits very difficult but has an amazing artstyle, good difficulty control, great storyline, choosable paths, weapons and skills, and a great soundtrack (although it is a bit quiet)\n\nif you can afford it and like difficult games, play dead cells", "timestamp_created": 1700601180, "timestamp_updated": 1700601180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150685935": {"recommendationid": "150685935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961402959", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 9973, "last_played": 1700601010}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of the best titles ever released.

No debate at all.  \n\nAs mentioned by the overwhelmingly positive reviews posted, this is one of the greatest games you could play or even have sitting in your Library.  Its sheer presence alone will improve your life even if you never play it.  \n\nI won't delve into game play mechanics or things of that nature.. it has been talked about extensively before in great detail.  What I will say is that it will be challenging but very rewarding.  Similar to a Souls-like game, its wants you to win and get better.  This game entered my life at a very difficult time and after not touching a video game for well over ten years at this point, I was immersed entirely in this experience.  I have died in this game Waaaay More than I have succeeded.. However, you will start each new run with potentially some new items, upgrades or even just better playing skills in general.  Initially starting out, I could barely even get past for the first few biomes, let alone finish a run or even defeat a boss.  At this point, in a short period of time due to the need to decompress from life, I have put in many hours of gameplay.  Filled with emotions ranging from joy, excitment, sadness, devestation and the desire to get better.  Each run contains one if not all of those emotions at certain points (losing two blueprints 3/4 into a run at the bank on 3BC is ROUUGHH).  Yet somehow the inner deep seeded desire to run it back and be better remains intact and possibly grows stronger.  \nIt's a rouge-lite game, there are many like it.. Its a metroid-vania style game, there are many like it.. But this one is special. I like to think of it as a Super-Sayian simulator almost (makes me feel old remembering the OG days).. You die and you come back stronger.  Games like Hades and Enter the Gungeon have given me similar experiences and are exceptional games that I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Dead Cells is special in its own right and I'm blown away that it still gets updated to this day.\nAfter playing this game at a friends house for a weekend a while ago, I became mesmerized. The moment I got the opportunity, I purchased this game full price with the DLC's (I highly recommend to fully support the devs) without hesitation even on a  some-what limited income.  It's been an Amazing experience to say the least..So Here it is! To many more hours of Happiness and Devestation in the future, just to run it back one more time.", "timestamp_created": 1700600339, "timestamp_updated": 1700600339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Pinnacle of it's genre. Incredibly tight and fluid controls combined with the absolute plethora of weapons and skills allow for all manner of playstyles, from long distance ranged gameplay to becoming a tornado of death blitzing everything in your path if you have the skill for it. However, if you like to adopt that sort of playstyle (as I love to do, I think the fast paced action you can have in this game is almost unmatched), you can never get too comfortable because one slip up where you get lazy and you can easily lose 75% of your hp and suddenly you don't feel so invincible anymore, if you aren't already dead. But it is not unfair, if you lose health it's on you.\n\nMassive amount of content and many amazing DLCs that are all worth it.

The ability to customise every detail of you character each and every run make the game offer quite a lot of replay-ability, however that can be said about every rouge-lite(like) so what sets Dead Cells apart?\n\nStarting off with extensive library of abilities, utilities, and weapons which the player has access to and that grows and expands as the player continues to explore. Along side these combat oriented things, you'll find several different costumes to re-skin your character -- some being references to other popular video games. Why this is important is because of one reason, the fact that some of the costumes have actual use in the game and can help the player unlock new areas/worlds.\n\nSpeaking of worlds, the shear amount of levels all utilising different types of level design and ways to lead players forward while still keeping true to their ground principles is amazing work. From the smallest detail always fitting, to the choice of enemy abilities working perfectly in combination with the level they're featured on is something few games accomplish.\n\nDead Cell quickly became game I hold in high regards after giving it a 2 hour test drive on PS5, it's a game I enjoy boasting about just as much as I love playing it.\n\nA great game with extreme amounts of depth AND it's only 2 GB!\n8.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1699828458, "timestamp_updated": 1699828458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150030285": {"recommendationid": "150030285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289118187", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3205, "playtime_at_review": 6061, "last_played": 1700790069}, "language": "spanish", "review": "ESTE VIDEOJUEGO ME VA A MATAR.

I played it a bit around the first three biomes (levels), movement and dodging felt good, initial weapons were a touch underwhelming, parry mechanic didn't feel like there was a lot of feedback or benefit to it, music was good and the art style looked a bit gritty but stylish. The game's sense of humour and hinted-at background lore reminded me of Hollow Knight. The art stye choices made some creatures or attacks feel a bit obscured but all-in-all I was glad to own this and could see it being a pleasant and competent distraction, well worth the cash I'd dropped on it.\n\nFor one reason or another, I didn't play it much. Rogue Legacy 2 dropped and I sunk time into that instead as it's art style was much clearer and the gameplay more immediately engaging. \n\nAfter finishing RL2 on my Playstation (a great game and available on Steam, check that one out too), I saw an update for Dead Cells that made me salivate - Return to Castlevania. I bought this, enabled the castlevania soundtrack and suddenly, Dead Cells clicked for me. The addition of the music and some call backs to games I knew gave me enough interest to spend a little more time in Dead Cells and I have to say, I was a fool for putting this one aside.\n\nDead Cells isn't an immediately engaging game and instead grows over time to hook you deeper and deeper into it's systems, combat options and exploration. In the first few playthroughs, you'll get the sense that it's a quality game with a lot of love and care put into it, but it might not really grip you in the way other Metroidvania styled roguelikes can do. The deeper and more fulfilling gameplay is largely emergent here - Dead Cells tries to teach you the basics of play with simple beginning weapons, an easy first two levels and some mysterious story beats, humour or objects here and there. The more you play Dead Cells, the deeper it's hooks get into you.........then you blink and it's 2AM and your Wife is shouting \"when are you coming to bed?\"\n\nDon't be like me and miss out on a fabulous experience - buy Dead Cells and give it more than a couple of hours to settle on you. As you unlock more and more items to appear in your runs, as you kill bosses and take more movement options on, as more biomes become available for you to explore, you'll realise that the early hours don't even scratch the surface of this gem. Late game, Dead Cells seems to evolve again, becoming as much about the strategy of picking biomes to match the opportunities that your item pool RNG has given you. \n\nIf you like action-platformers, Metroidvanias or roguelike platform games Dead Cells is simply a MUST BUY. I'm a fool for not giving this more time and I intend to correct that mistake. I'm teaching my wife to play so we can do relay-runs and she might understand how addictive this little game can become. \n\nLast thing: If you are a Castlevania fan and you are done with Bloodstained, Get this, get the Return to Castlevania DLC and have a blast - the Death and Dracula boss fights are wild and the music is always on-point. Maria's cat is brilliantly OP when combined with the Mushroom Boi pet.

I love rogue-likes and metroidvania games, and this smacks it out of the park.\nI think I find the game so fun because of the amazingly designed combat combined with the strategic aspect of finding synergies between your weapons for peak efficiency.\nThe game is really re-playable. With other rogue-like games, (e.g. Hades) I find that it can become quite repetitive and you can lose the motivation to play continuously unless you really like working towards far off upgrades. Unlike Hades, for example, Dead Cells offers lots of customisation and unique things that make the game a refreshing experience each time you start a run. Firstly, there are heaps of weapons to unlock and use, each requiring the player to buy them with Cells. Then, there are the upgrades, which are also bought from Cells at the Collector. The upgrades are really good in giving a more permanent change to each run, really making you feel like you're progressing. Then, there's the runes you can unlock, permanently allowing you to visit new biomes and secret areas that you otherwise wouldn't be able to go to. This is a really neat way of adding huge amounts of content without overwhelming a new player, as runes are rare and hard to find.\nThen lets talk about the biomes. The biomes are absolutely amazing and are completely randomly generated, giving a whole new experience to each run, so you never see the same thing twice.\nAlso, theres new content updates and fixes all the time, and it's great to see the devs haven't left it behind.\n\nNegatives:\n- There's a lot of DLCs which have to be bought to experience the game fully. I suggest if you want to get the most enjoyment out of the game, they are worth a look because they add lots of new biomes, and again, lots  of replayability. Unfortunately they cost a bit of money.\n- It sometimes can be frustrating if you are struggling to get blueprints to buy upgrades and weapons that you want. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can really do about this except play daily challenges which I think award you with a blueprint when you finish it...\n- It's currently not co-op or multiplayer. It would be really cool if multiple players could do runs together and fight bosses together, and I think it would be a really good addition to the game, but unfortunately it doesn't look like multiplayer is going to be added to Dead Cells, which is a real shame.\n- There's a high skill floor. By that I mean it can be hard for new players to pick up the game, and it will take many tries to get your first win. Just keep in mind that as soon as you pass that skill level to beat the game once, you will probably be able to beat it again and again. Great thing is, there's a virtually limitless skill ceiling, meaning your expertise in the game can always improve. Additionally, you can add more Boss Stem Cells to your run to increase the difficulty, therefore increasing the skill floor needed to beat the game on that difficulty. (I kinda turned that negative into a positive, but the game's just so good I can't think of much bad things to say about it...)\n\nAside from that, I can't think of much other negatives about the game. It's really well done, and a polished game. It's rare to find bugs, and generally they'll be patched quickly.\n\nDead Cells is a really good game, and I strongly suggest giving it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1698663868, "timestamp_updated": 1698663868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149178330": {"recommendationid": "149178330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092628158", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 3274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3274, "last_played": 1698630166}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1698649287, "timestamp_updated": 1698649287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149174899": {"recommendationid": "149174899", "author": {"steamid": "76561199237264592", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2139, "last_played": 1698640924}, "language": "english", "review": "Games including dlc only achievements should be criminal.\n10/10 otherwise, fantastic game of its kind", "timestamp_created": 1698641739, "timestamp_updated": 1698641739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149171006": {"recommendationid": "149171006", "author": {"steamid": "76561199211806347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12366, "last_played": 1698634952}, "language": "english", "review": "very good", "timestamp_created": 1698634408, "timestamp_updated": 1698634408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149170830": {"recommendationid": "149170830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799503356", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 605, "playtime_at_review": 2040, "last_played": 1700787891}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the best indie games I've played since Hollow Knight.\nCouldn't recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys a challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1698634124, "timestamp_updated": 1698634124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149166658": {"recommendationid": "149166658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119668755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 520, "last_played": 1683390378}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game called dead cells you would think everything was dead but no", "timestamp_created": 1698627406, "timestamp_updated": 1698627406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149164094": {"recommendationid": "149164094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960356887", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "playtime_at_review": 726, "last_played": 1700680883}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this for hundreds of hours on the switch, now I'm playing it again on PC.

is one of the best roguelike-Metroidvania games I've ever played. The excellent musical score, amazingly responsive controls, huge variety of weapons, challenging bosses - the developers have really just put everything together in an amazingly tight package.\n\nProps on the longevity of support, too - the game came out 2018, and there's a new free content patch that just entered beta testing this week.\n\nDead Cells has over 100 weapons, each fitting into at least one of the following categories: Brutality / Tactics / Survival. Brutality weapons tend to be fast, but hit for smaller amounts (swords and daggers, mostly), Tactics are almost all ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, and whips, mostly), while survival weapons are almost all hard-hitting, very slow weapons (mauls, hammers, etc.) Many weapons fall under two categories (for instance, most crossbows are both tactics and survival), so that you can wield multiple weapons using a single upgrade path.\n\nYou've also got two slots for skills, which follow the same rules as weapons, but can be anything from traps, buffs, magic attacks, or pets. Pets are handy because (with the exception of the Owl) you can just summon them at the start of a level and let them do their thing. Most of the other skills are more powerful, but require you to actually remember to use them when they're available to get the most utility out of them - which can be a problem in the hectic frenzy of combat that is Dead Cells.\n\nEverything in Dead Cells, from the music to the timed doors at the end of levels, pushes you to be a whirlwind of destruction, endlessly running forward to kill everything before you. It's actually not a horrible strategy - if you can accomplish it without getting hit.\n\nDead Cell's major claim to fame is it's extended game - specifically, its system of Boss Cells. Acting as a New Game+ system, each time you win the game under an increased number of Cells, you unlock a new Boss Cell. These increase the difficulty of the game - mostly by introducing harder enemies and reducing and/or removing the healing stations between levels. However, they also increase the number of scrolls available (which can drastically increase the damage of your weapons) as well as unlock how many cells can be spent on the Forge, which can increase the potency of weapons that you find on a run.\n\nIt's pretty much the perfect game for when you just want to go balls-to-the-wall killing some dudes for half an hour. Expect most runs to end in failure, but those runs that do not are some of the most amazing adrenaline highs you'll ever experience.", "timestamp_created": 1697423120, "timestamp_updated": 1697423120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734902501106262207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148313947": {"recommendationid": "148313947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022096876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8762, "last_played": 1661899517}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, I just like to preface that I've replayed this game many times over the years and this game is the perfect rogue like experience where its hard as balls, but every death felt justified and earned as it was mostly my fault.

Getting to the hand, is no easy task, as you will have to go through a series of difficult biomes filled with deadly enemies (and jam-packed with a bunch of items from bows to shields to swords and even grenades). Bosses are one of the easier elements of the game however. For example, the first boss you encounter, the Concierge is very easy to dodge and predict its attacks. Dead Cells is a great game that requires practice, if you want to even get far. The rogue-like element to the game makes it one of the most punishing games i have ever played.

The majority of the gameplay progression is exploring levels and finding items to better defeat enemies and bosses.  The player has some agency in routing through the dungeon by picking pathways that lead to predetermined \"biomes\" (i.e. If one wanted, one could go through the poison swap every run or the castle gates etc.).  The gameplay itself is very rewarding, with items and weapons all feeling fairly unique and having mechanics that encourage a certain style of play on a per item basis.  For example, the Baseball Bat deals more damage to stunned and rooted foes, so you seek out items that can stun and root foes, making combat be a setup for combos.  Simple but effective. \n\nI think most people who enjoy roguelites in general would enjoy this game.  If that's you, then give it a go. The DLC is not required to enjoy the base idea of the game, but they absolutely enhance the experience if you find the base game enjoyable. \n\n\nThis below is mostly just a rant, which is not well written and you can reasonably ignore. I just had to b*tch:\n\nMy biggest, and really only, gripe is the platforming.  Most of the times it is benign, mostly acting as a medium to facilitate the combat more interestingly.  At other times there are small, mandatory platforming sections throughout levels that can be fairly dangerous, but these are mostly manageable as well.  However, there are some \"optional\" platforming sections one needs to complete to unlock additional items or to obtain additional scrolls that increase your damage.  And I write \"optional\" because I can't imagine the game expects me to NOT attempt to get the \"fancy dinner jacket\" outfit for my character.  Furthermore, on higher difficulties, not going out of your way to grab additional damage scrolls can make the run significantly more difficult, especially since damage scales exponentially in this game. The game does not offer really any items to affect one's platforming ability, so one just has to be good at the game, which is fine in its own right.  But I'm not playing Super Meat Boy where I can just retry a level.  Some runs take me, and I might just be a poor player, 30 to 50 minutes to get back to these \"optional\" sections.  And the game isn't a necessarily difficult platformer like SMB either, but it is just infuriating to lose a long run because I missed an unintuitive jump too many times.  And I have only died perhaps a few times to each \"optional\" section compared to bosses or mobs, but it is exceptionally demoralizing comparatively.  Get rid of this crap, man.  If the items don't really affect my ability to complete some challenge in a *roguelite* then that challenge shouldn't exist or should not be able to jeopardize my run.", "timestamp_created": 1697050329, "timestamp_updated": 1697306062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482758641242980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148039677": {"recommendationid": "148039677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256247618", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "playtime_at_review": 3250, "last_played": 1699740808}, "language": "english", "review": "Genuinely this may be my all-time favorite roguelite.

This is a personal problem and I want to make that clear from the start. \n\nThe enemies aren't fun to fight against. I cannot comprehend the way they move and attack. There are no wind-ups for most of them and the devs use the exclamation mark as indication. I don't wish to condemn their capabilities but relying on an \"!\" leads me to believe they know the issue as well. \n\nSeeing a tiny \"!\" in a room filled with many types of enemies, with the explosion of colors and particles the game showers the screen with just doesn't feel fun. \n\nAnother issue I have is there are no \"items\". Almost all games in the genre have items that modify many aspects of a run but in this one, it is only ever gear. Weapons and tools. No items.

It's, like, a roguelike souls-like metroidvania-like, like you know? Modern buzzwords aside, Dead Cells is an action platformer with procedural levels that grant you infinite replayability. It's one of the best platformers with the smoothest movement, the most epic combat and some of the most beautiful 2D pixel graphics out there. It's refreshing to see a developer try and innovate on oldschool visuals like this, just shows how far we've come. This game has also taken huge inspiration from classic games and learned all the lessons of the days of yore, taking this knowledge and combining it with modern technology and experiences to create something classic but polished and approachable. It's like the ideas of classic action platformers finally realized to perfection. \n\nDead Cells can be brutally difficult, but considering how fluid the amazing combat is and how crisp the controls are, it's a pure test of skill. If it gets too intense, don't forget to just stop for a bit to take in the beautiful art and amazing music. Hell, I wasn't really a fan of Metroidvanias, Souls-like games or 2D platformers in general going into this, but this game is so good, I loved it anyway and it changed my mind on all of those. I feel like with this experience, I might try and conquer an actual Souls game now, and maybe a Hollow Knight or Shovel Knight on the side. Until then, I will always know that I have one of the best roguelikes on the market to fall back on.\n\nP.S. After you inevitably get seriously invested and then seriously addicted to this game, research the lore! It's kind of hard to experience it within the game itself because of the random dungeons and difficulty, but Dead Cells has some of the most fascinating lore ever! And a very shocking twist near the end too!

Stages are randomly generated, making them lousy and forgettable, with no true design. The \"music\" is droning with no real melodies or tunes. Just orchestral ambient sound like every other indie/western developed game! The graphics and aesthetics are terrible. Sprites and backgrounds are incredibly basic, while modern bloom and other lighting techniques are applied to pour excrement onto the already mediocre graphics, making the overall presentation nauseating. The environments themselves are also poorly designed and entirely unmemorable. The gameplay has the potential to be good, like the variety of weapons at your disposal. Unfortunately this game controls like Wayne's World on SNES. I'm not one to complain about short games, but I reached the ending of this in a mere 2 hours.

I can honestly appreciate all the work the developers put into the game. Even after so many years, they keep updating it regularly, throwing out new things and polishing core game mechanics.\n\nThe combat is fast-paced and there is a big learning curve. You will have to make peace with the fact that you will die a lot. Dead Cells is hard, especially until you learn the different mob patterns and get used to the biome layouts but you will get rewarded for each run in a slow permanent progression. Dodging is key because every hit will be very punishing if not lethal once you start running 5BC. \n\nThis might not be the game for you if you are looking forward to the lore part of the game. It's not its strongest asset. The game makes up for it with its variety of weapons, abilities, mutations and the superb synergies that come along with them.\n\nI suggest you start with just the base game and when you start getting better, you can buy the DLCs.

Was always nervous to try out playing any Rogue-lite/like games because the thought of dying and losing all progress seemed like the complete opposite of what fun sounds like to me. My only experience was that I tried Binding of Isaac and thought it was okay. Then one day I was hanging out at a friend's place and she asked me to try it out, I sucked pretty bad but I liked the movement and combat. It didn't matter that I died though because it wasn't my file, so I tried a few more runs and thought it was neat that you didn't actually lose everything. Then I got home and had the urge to try it again but had to wait until I visited again. I played it a couple more times over there and each time I left I wanted to play more but didn't want to wait until I was over at their place again so I eventually bit the bullet and bought it for myself. At first I thought I wasn't gonna have as much fun since I had to start from square one, then I played it and time and progression flew by quick! This has become one of those games where I can keep going back to time and time again and start playing whenever I have nothing else to play.

wield.\n\nThe humor is dark, the visuals so bold,\nA mix of the grotesque and the comically cold.\nThe graphics are stunning, pixel art grand,\nIn this ever-changing world, you'll make your last stand.\n\nThe soundtrack, it thumps, like a heart in your chest,\nAs you fight through the levels, never knowing what's best.\nThe boss battles loom, challenging and grand,\nWith patterns to learn, as you face the next brand.\n\nSo if you seek laughter in the face of your doom,\n\"Dead Cells\" is your game, in pixelated costume.\nIt's quirky, it's tough, a true rogue-like surprise,\nWith humor and

controls are pretty bad even with a joystick, sometimes looking in a specific direction can be bothersome. The early levels are too repetitive and the weapon variety, although there are many different weapons, is laughable because they all play the same. Grinding for souls is tedious and takes too long, and the hitboxes are very flimsy. There are also times where I've died without knowing what killed me at all, because as you move forward you can randomly find a trap or some enemy that will just take all your health away in one abstract hit that you have no way of knowing about without getting hit first.\n\nOn the surface the game looks great, but for me that's all it is. The substance is not there. It also seems that some things changed since the original release with the character's reactions with NPC, and for some reason the game's MC became a goofy dork that makes autistic animations everytime they have to interact with an NPC or a situation.\n\nI think it's almost impossible to make a roguelike metroidvania, but I have definitely seen it done better before.

Once you get into it, it's really fun. It lends itself to fast-paced gameplay, zooming around tearing through enemies, which is incredibly satisfying. Improving feels rewarding, and earning your first few Boss Cells (rewards for completing a run which send you back the start to do it again, with increased difficulty) is really satisfying. The OST is also exceptional and the artstyle, though a somewhat mixed bag, really shines in a lot of the backgrounds for the different environments.\n\nThe problems - which to be honest are inherent to the game from the beginning - really start to show themselves once you hit 3/4BC as the game just becomes such a complete slog. \n\nThere is definitely an element of mechanical skill to Dead Cells - you need to be able to react to enemies, obviously. But a large part of getting good at the game is purely knowledge. There are an absurd number of enemies, each with their own attack patterns and telegraphs. Becoming familiar with all of these is the biggest component of \"gitting gud\". Each biome has its own pool of enemies (some enemies show up in multiple places; others are exclusive to certain biomes), so learning a biome essentially constitutes learning how to read the enemies within it (and re-learning that pool each time new ones are added with new BCs).\n\nBecause the game never changes fundamentally between the Boss Cell levels, you're running the same biomes every time. You're therefore faced with a choice - you can just stick to the one route and minimise the amount of setbacks you'll face learning totally new enemies in addition to the BC difficulty increases (which really, is optimal, for reasons I'll get to), or you can mix it up for the sake of variety, but substantially increase the time you spend playing as you get used to dealing with new mobs. In the case of the latter, the variety is largely cancelled out by the frustration of losing what progress you'd made, since your existing mechanical skill only carries you so far against completely new enemies.\n\nSo you do the former. And this is what makes sense, as there is quite literally a best route in the game. Sewers->Prison->Sewers->Graveyard->Cavern straight up just gives you more scrolls. And you want scrolls, because the multiplicative scaling is really the best way by far to counter 5BC. Either you nuke everything, or you get nuked. And when one scroll is worth potentially hundreds of percentage more damage, of course you're going to take it.\n\nAll of this to say, grinding 5BC essentially just constitutes staring at Toxic Sewers for hours on end, especially if you're doing lots of runs to try achievements, or multiple routes/bosses. It ceases to be fun entirely.\n\nSome other miscellaneous issues:\n- The scroll system is poor. As soon as you start scaling, you're locked into a colour and two thirds of weapons become actively detrimental pickups.\n- Weapons suffer the same issue as enemies. There are so many that you can either devote hundreds of hours to learning them, or turn on custom mode and engage with a handful you're comfortable with.\n- The visual clutter is the worst I've ever seen. The accessibility update options mitigate this somewhat, but it's still not great. Pixel vomit everywhere.\n- The game insists on having platforming sections despite the platforming being godawful. The jump feels sluggish and you snap to ledges to mantle them from miles away, removing pretty much any and all room for tight, skilful platforming. It's actually frustrating when you try to make a precise jump past something only to snap to it from halfway across the screen because the game is more interested in catering to people who have never played a platformer before.\n- A lot of the \"difficulty\" comes from cheap enemies that wallhack you from off-screen and just very high volumes of very high-damage mobs that just get spammed more and more as the BCs go up, rather than any tests of mechanical skill, or game knowledge, which is part of what contributes to the sloggy feeling.\n- The writing is painful. The game tries to have its cake and eat it too with le spooky mysterious vague lore a la Hollow Knight, but also le epic Rick and Morty taking nothing seriously jokes and banter, none of which is funny. One of the more poignant story beats (though that is a generous description) is undercut by the cringest line and le epic troll middle finger moment I've ever seen. It's like the Marvel \"so that just happened!\" on crack.\n- The super secret ultra final twist boss is wildly underwhelming. One of the blandest, easiest final boss fights I've ever encountered. The rest of the bosses are also nothing to write home about. The game's combat shines better in biomes, at least before the grind wears you down.\n- The devs milk this game to an obnoxious degree. Middling, half-hearted updates and DLCs years after launch, balance patches for a single player game - just move on lmao. All it serves to do is add bloat, which is bad for the player, because all these new weapons just take up space in your loot pool over the weapons you actually want to see, unless you're willing to sink potentially a thousand hours in learning every single weapon, but the combination of how insane an undertaking that'd be, and the existence of custom mode, makes me assume that isn't how the game is intended to be played.\n- Also on the devs, they literally launched the game without an ending, and while the DLC that added it was free, the rest slotting into the main game despite being paywalled feels a little slimy.\n\nOverall, Dead Cells is a game that seems to discourage you from engaging with it. It's designed in such a way that optimising for the smallest amount of content makes the game most bearable. And given how obnoxious it becomes anyway, maybe that's for the best. If you're content just playing this to 3BC, you'll probably have a blast, but as a full experience, I can't recommend it, especially for a comparatively high price tag (especially accounting for the DLC) as indie games go.\n\n5/10 - The core gameplay carrying the first few difficulty tiers isn't enough of a silver lining to outweigh the unpleasant grind Dead Cells becomes.", "timestamp_created": 1691621285, "timestamp_updated": 1693781192, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642946541309356689", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143744689": {"recommendationid": "143744689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198820930542", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 224, "last_played": 1693595420}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego adictivo, muy dif\u00edcil pero con controles f\u00e1ciles de aprender, muy muy buen gameplay, las animaciones y sonidos est\u00e1n muy bien logrados.

I used the training area to practice against this boss, but I still couldn't get it down. I think this boss battle difficulty is too high, even on custom game mode.

(Okay so that isn't true anymore, but Dead Cells is my 2nd best game of the year. Sea of Stars beat it lol. Sorry.)\n\nTechnically, I began playing it in 2022.. but it was for under 2 hours and then I stopped. As the new Castlevania DLC was coming out in March 2023, I was thinking then would be a good chance to pick the game back up and give it a better chance. After all, I didn't hate the game. I just stopped playing it for some reason (a strange trend I do when I start a game then proceed not to play it for an extended period of time)...\n\nRegardless, about the game. Every part about it is absolutely delightful. The gameplay? Fun and challenging. Winning battles feels rewarding and even when you lose, you're still learning. The weapons? Fun to use. I was a brutality enjoyer when I first started, then I slowly started sinking into the survival class. I've never been a fan of tactics unfortunately... But the game is pretty balanced for the most part. You can also turn on some features to make the game a little bit more attuned to your tastes, to help you ease into the harder difficulties. When I started 5BC, I had been using the cursed chest aspect, but slowly overtime I began to stop using it (I wanted to be able to get gold costumes lol).\n\nThe amount of items that there are in this game comes nowhere close to what a game like The Binding of Isaac has (literal thousands of hours), but it also doesn't have a shortage of items. I'm 139 hours through playing and I still haven't found all the items (where's the ukulele!?). I know I could just use the item made to get blueprints guaranteed, but it doesn't feel as nice then. But it's always there if you ever want to get all the items.\n\nThe diversity in areas? Amazing! Of course if you don't own the DLC's, you'll only be going through the same one or two paths over and over. But with the DLC's, it offers you so many different paths to take and of course, all the other stuff DLC's have to offer. If you haven't picked up Dead Cells, I would suggest getting the DLC's with it. It makes the game so much bigger in so many different aspects.\n\nAnd the music.. OH, the music. It wasn't as great as something like The Messenger, Hades, or Omori in something I would listen to again, but the music absolutely does not disappoint. And the Castlevania OST as well? Even more fantastic! I actually prefer using that one. The music on Fractured Shrines with the Castlevania OST on is my favorite track. Next to the music in the spoiler biome as well.\n\nI'm pretty sure there's a LOAD of categories I'm missing about this game, but that just shows how much there really is to it. Just.. get Dead Cells. You won't be disappointed.

With its dynamic combat, procedurally generated levels, and stunning pixel art, this game offers an unforgettable experience that leaves you craving more.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nThe pixel art in Dead Cells is a visual treat. Each environment is meticulously crafted, from hauntingly beautiful dungeons to eerie forests and treacherous castles. The attention to detail and smooth animations add depth to the game's world, making every moment visually engaging. The blend of dark and vibrant colors sets the perfect mood for the game's challenging and atmospheric gameplay.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nDead Cells' gameplay is where it truly shines. The fast-paced combat is a joy to master, offering a satisfying mix of sword-slashing, arrow-shooting, and spell-casting. The game's \"Roguevania\" approach, combining rogue-like elements with the exploration of a metroidvania, creates a compelling and ever-changing experience. Each run feels fresh, as the levels, enemies, and loot are procedurally generated, keeping you on your toes and encouraging experimentation with different playstyles.\n\n[b]Audio:[/b]\nThe audio design in Dead Cells complements the gameplay perfectly. The ominous soundtrack sets the mood for the intense battles and exploration, while the sound effects provide visceral feedback to your actions. The clashing of weapons, the creaking of doors, and the eerie echoes of the environment immerse you in the game's dangerous world, adding to the adrenaline rush of combat.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nWhile not heavily story-driven, Dead Cells offers subtle hints of lore that pique your curiosity as you progress. The game's mysterious narrative and enigmatic characters encourage you to piece together the game's world and history bit by bit. It's a testament to the game's design that even without a prominent plotline, players find themselves drawn deeper into the game's secrets.\n\n[b]Difficulty:[/b]\nDead Cells strikes a satisfying balance between accessibility and challenge. The initial stages provide a smooth learning curve, allowing new players to get accustomed to the mechanics and enemies. However, as you progress, the difficulty ramps up significantly, demanding quick reflexes and strategic decision-making. Each death feels like a learning opportunity, motivating you to return and improve your skills.\n\n[b]Grind:[/b]\nThe grind in Dead Cells is thoughtfully balanced. While gathering cells and blueprints to unlock new weapons and abilities requires some effort, it never feels like an overwhelming grind. The diverse and rewarding upgrades make the progression feel worthwhile, encouraging players to explore different paths and strategies.\n\n[b]Game Time:[/b]\nWith its replayable nature and ever-changing levels, Dead Cells offers a significant amount of gameplay. Depending on your skill level and desire to uncover all its secrets, you can easily spend tens to hundreds of hours immersed in the game's challenging and addictive world.\n\n[b]Price:[/b]\nDead Cells' price is well worth the experience it offers. The depth, variety, and replay value justify the cost, making it a standout title in its genre.\n\nDead Cells is a triumph of game design that sets a new standard for action-platformers. Its addictive gameplay, stunning pixel art, and engaging audio create a seamless and immersive experience. If you're a fan of challenging and rewarding games, Dead Cells is an essential addition to your gaming library.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[table equalcells=1]\n[tr]\n[th]Rating[/th]\n[th]Category[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]9.5/10[/td]\n[td]Overall[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1690485688, "timestamp_updated": 1690485865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142897015": {"recommendationid": "142897015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216376973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 6348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5161, "last_played": 1698158460}, "language": "english", "review": "yup", "timestamp_created": 1690467500, "timestamp_updated": 1690467500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142895905": {"recommendationid": "142895905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198975887965", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1694560310}, "language": "english", "review": "Im gay", "timestamp_created": 1690466175, "timestamp_updated": 1690466175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142886232": {"recommendationid": "142886232", "author": {"steamid": "76561199111970465", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3804, "last_played": 1693617107}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't stop playing for the past 2 weeks", "timestamp_created": 1690452100, "timestamp_updated": 1690452100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142874605": {"recommendationid": "142874605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198856638054", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2307, "last_played": 1688690851}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lindos los dlc y gui\u00f1os\n", "timestamp_created": 1690433093, "timestamp_updated": 1690433093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142867191": {"recommendationid": "142867191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336715367", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 9930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "playtime_at_review": 4264, "last_played": 1700179643}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Help!!
