At the end of each segment you get multiple choices for how to react and proceed.\nThe most interesting thing is that if you lean too much into your depression and always take the easy route, some of those options are crossed out, so you can't choose them even although you know they would be good options. You still see them and know they're there, but you can't choose them. Instead you're forced to choose an option that you know is bad for you and your health, but you can't help it or do anything against it - just like with a real depression.\n\nAs a person who struggled with severe depression since childhood, still suffers regularly, and later with suicidal tendencies as well I can say that [u]this representation of how life feels for a deeply depressed person is the most accurate and most relatable depiction I've ever seen.[/u]\n100% of what the protagonist feels and describes could've been copied from my diary and dozens of times I felt as if the game had quoted me, like literally word by word, the withdrawn and auto-destructive stuff as well as the hopeful trying-to-survive stuff.\n\n[h3]I totally recommend this game for people who struggle to understand why depressed people have so many problems with stuff that works easily for healthy people.[/h3]\nRetarded statements like \"pull yourself together\", \"think positive\", or \"Why are you depressed? Life is so beautiful\" do not work against real depressions and by saying something as ignorant and inconsiderate as this you only make it worse for the depressed person. Depressed people need security instead of guilt trips and assurance instead of being called abnormal.\n\nI also recommend this game for people who already suffer from depression which may sound counter-intuitive and discouraging, but I promise you it's not. Depressed people should try this at least once not because they need to be taught something (although the game does a quite good job with that) or because they need to see how much worse it can get... but to learn one simple but very important thing:\n[b]There are people out there who understand what you're going through,[/b] even if it seems that no one does. And I'm not talking about therapists only. [u]You are not alone.[/u]\n\nThere are more important things to learn from this game:\n[list]\n[*]A strong social support network is essential for coping with depression.\n[*]It's important to be able to tell from case to case whether socializing could help you no matter how difficult it feels to agree to it, or if it's too much right now and you need rest.\n[*]Don't be afraid to admit that you have problems. Accepting them is the first, HUGE, and very hard step on the road to recovery. Everything after that usually becomes easier.\n[*]Taking medication does not brand you a lunatic or make you sick, quite contrary: Medication can really help with depression. The game uses bronchitis as an example, I always use diabetes: Just because the dysfunctional part of your body is [not the lung, but] a gland or a part of the brain, you're not alien or abnormal. You wouldn't be ashamed to replenish your insulin household, then why should serotonin (or anything similar) be a problem? Depression is an illness like any other and there are ways to treat them.\n[*]A person that doesn't understand what you're going through has no grounds to judge in any way and shouldn't be taken seriously at all. There's no shame in seeking help from those who do understand you.\n[*]And last but not least: Seriously consider getting a pet (or two or a dozen), if you don't already have one. Animals, unlike certain humans, accept you the way you are. [u]If they start to love you, they do it unconditionally.[/u] They don't shame you for a lack of energy, instead they're there for you and interacting with them can be extremely soothing. If you feel lonely, but also think that you're unable to spend time with people, a pet is a surefire way to combat loneliness.\nI have 7 cats (and wish for dogs and donkeys, if I could just afford them...), so you can believe me. Anywhere they are is the safest place on Earth for me and I have no idea whether I love them more than they love me or the other way around. They're the second-most enriching part of my crappy life... the best part is my wonderful wife.\n[/list]\nYes, I have a wonderful and understanding wife that I would die for to protect her and that I would do anything for to make her happy... [u]because she's willing to do the exact same thing for me.[/u] She's my personal guardian angel and thanks to her and our pets I can finally somewhat enjoy life.\n[b]I didn't know that that was even possible, but after playing this game I appreciate her and everything she does for me even more.[/b]\n\n[h3]Dear fellow depressed person: I wholeheartedly wish you that you find that kind of support in your life as well.[/h3]\n[u]And I recommend Depression Quest from the bottom of my heart.[/u] The amazing people behind this are geniuses that managed to tackle a very serious and difficult topic in a truly helpful way with something as simple as a semi-interactive short story.\nIf I was wearing a hat, I would not only take it off for them, but also never put it on again.", "timestamp_created": 1695190619, "timestamp_updated": 1695191741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49253728985786438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146316071": {"recommendationid": "146316071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074219576", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1527917949}, "language": "english", "review": "i appreciate this games portrayal of the struggles of depression. its just a choose your own adventure book, but your depression limits what options are available. and the quest is to find the mythical state of stability... it can be emotionally hard to play through, but good if you want to understand depression better or if you want to feel your depression be understood, if only a little.", "timestamp_created": 1694752232, "timestamp_updated": 1694752232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146003023": {"recommendationid": "146003023", "author": {"steamid": "76561199142639193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 27, "last_played": 1668316385}, "language": "english", "review": "Not necessarily bad, but as someone with clinical depression it almost treats depression as a quick thing you \"get over\".

The protagonist, whom you are playing as, attempts to manage his illness (depression) while navigating struggles with his love life, social life, career, and family.\n\nAs someone who has lived with chronic PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and depression for over 20 years, I found that the decision-making structure for this game was perfectly fitting. Much like in real life, your choices in [i]Depression Quest[/i] matter. When encountering a variety of scenarios you will be presented with multiple decisions (which can either reduce or increase your depression and symptoms); however, the more depressed your character becomes, the more the depression \u201ctakes the wheel\u201d in driving decisions and certain positive decisions become unavailable.\n\nThe stated goal of the developer is to help people (who live without depression) better understand depression and dismantle stigmas against those living with depression; for sufferers, they hope it provides them with some level of comfort by validating their experience with depression and its symptoms.\n\nAdmittedly, I played through this game for the first time over 5 years ago (when I was in my mid-20\u2019s) and I absolutely abhorred it. I found myself feeling incredibly uncomfortable and insulted by the way the experience of depression was represented. However, I decided to revisit [i]Depression Quest[/i], now in my early 30\u2019s, and felt a level of slight comfort that the developers had intended for us sufferers to feel. That said, because this is a \u201cchoices matter\u201d game, I suspect whether or not you hate the game will depend greatly upon the choices you make throughout the game, whether or not you have depression, and where you are in managing your own depression (if you\u2019re a sufferer). As the old adage goes, \u201cwhat we often hate in others are the reflections of things we hate about ourselves.\u201d\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\u2022 Trigger warning (RE: depression & suicide) prior to beginning the game.\n\u2022 Choices matter and effect the outcome and which \u201cending\u201d you unlock.\n\u2022 Background audio/music is soothing, but becomes staticky/glitchy the more depressed you become (alluding to how disruptive depression is to inner peace).\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\u2022 Multiple grammatical/spelling errors, weird/unfitting word choices, and occasionally missing words which can be disruptive to the flow of reading and feeling.\n\u2022 Emotional impact on the player can be positive or negative, potentially increasing depression symptoms for sufferers if triggered.\n\u2022 Visuals are subpar, and don\u2019t add anything to the experience.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\n[i]Depression Quest[/i] is an interesting text-based experience for those without depression that are interested in learning more about living with the illness, but may be either triggering or comforting for sufferers of depression. While it certainly isn\u2019t \u201cGame of the Year,\u201d [i]Depression Quest[/i] may be worth trying if you have 1-2 hours to spare for something serious and emotional (rather than fun, lighthearted, or mindless).", "timestamp_created": 1688449002, "timestamp_updated": 1688449002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545820832252502441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140932731": {"recommendationid": "140932731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171368185", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 93, "last_played": 1688076855}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck you, 4chaners.", "timestamp_created": 1688076953, "timestamp_updated": 1688076953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451877087354660034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140165839": {"recommendationid": "140165839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384333034", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1686932282}, "language": "english", "review": "This isn't your usual game. it's more of a tool, to help you understand what is going on with some of the people around you.

You might think your choices can motivate your character, but you quickly discover depression is complex. Very. Everyone goes through depression, it's not all about suicide, but this is a pretty severe story. It's more about the crushing weight of expectations you build up for yourself when you don't think you are fighting hard enough. When you feel you are letting people down, a cycle where you let yourself down starts, often with bad sleep patterns. I found myself slipping into character and out again, I've been in similar situations. Situations all described with brutal honesty in these pages. Perhaps sometimes the dialog to read is just a bit too long, but each day has a unique challenge for you, and so you read and process. After a while you notice that the sound effect \"colour\" or tone is continuously changing, and that the little chapter point photograph is picking out a detail for your character. Just as you start getting invested in your character and can see some light at the end of the tunnel, the story closes.[h3]No Conclusions[/h3]Depression , like this game, has no happy endings, it's really a set of many journeys.

It presents a stripped-down narrative that makes it easy to identify with the protagonist. Nothing can truly simulate depression except depression itself, but this game does a good job at translating one aspect of depression - the erasure of your agency that prevents you from getting better even when you know what would make things better.\n\n\n[spoiler] People talk about how the gameplay mechanic of how certain options are crossed out and simply can't make some choices. But there are some other interesting aspects of the narrative. Sometimes your condition will change for the worse no matter what option you choose - which is honestly great at capturing the ocassional futility of your difficult choices even when you find the strength to make them. Additionally, when things get bad enough, you will be forced to pick only the worst option and you will have to proceed through the game while your condition keeps getting worse. It's subtle, and frustrating, but that's the point. That's what depression can feel like.[/spoiler]\n\n\nI wish the game was longer, and a bit more complex with more storylines.

It is a game in its barest form. An interactive text story with no visuals. I played it through once and for me that is enough. There is definitely some reliability here personally. I write that as someone who suffers from Depression and is suffering from a fairly bad bout at the moment. Not all of my experience syncs and for some, it probably does not relate at all. Looking at a few reviews people mention that it is insulting to people with depression. I do not feel that. But, it could come off that way depending on your experience. As the intro says it is made by people who have experienced depression and are trying to show how this feels to others. It is not a game really. But as a form of expression, it is interesting what the medium can do. It's worth a try with the caveats listed above. \n1) don't go in expecting a game. Even along the lines of a visual novel experience (which I love and was how I came across this)\n2) It's not everyone's experience. it may not relate to you and this is fine. But take it as the creator's experiences with it and trying to relate that in this interactive fiction. \n--\nI feel the negative reviews do not really take these points into account. \nI agree that the medium is not the best for conveying depression. In the sense of picking options. I agree with others that it is not that simple. I did like the way that some were greyed out. sp you did not have a choice for some answers. Depression makes these impossible which can be the way these things feel sometimes. You do know the right answer but picking it is hard. Of course, you know the right one. But for the way the game is played I am not sure how else it could have been conveyed, To be true to myself I went for how I felt I would answer right now if it were me.

As such, take the rest with a grain of salt. \n\nI guess I can say my opinion on the writing, which I found to be terrible, and akin to a self-help book. Literally every paragraph in the game starts with \"You\", everything is all about \"you\", and, again, I do not think that this is not how depression feels like. This augmented egotism of \"the character\" can also be seen in other, key places in text. I remember I chose to help an online friend with something in-game, and after I made that choice, I was greeted with a text that read like: \"Sure, you can't really work on your project right now, you're tired, so why not help a friend?\", which is clearly egotistical, and not something that a person with depression would necessary feel like. \n\nI checked one of the authors/developers of the game, and a list of books that they wrote came up:\nA) Be Happy, 170 Ways to Transform Your Day\nB) Now Is The Time: 170 Ways to Seize the Moment\nC) It's Never Too Late: 172 Simple Acts to Change Your Life\nwhich all sound like self-help books.

I have completed one playthrough and feel like I have an understanding of the story the game wants to portray, but I haven't explored every single outcome.\nAs a reference I have battled with severe depression and anxiety myself and have been going to therapy for 15 years. This doesn't necessarily make me any more qualified to review this game than anyone else, but that's the experience I have going into the game.\nI have also seen another person comment about some kind of controversy surrounding the game and I want to be fully transparent and say I have no idea what that is in reference to, and wanted to do an unbiased playthrough before I looked into what this might be. If I discover that this controversy drastically changes the way I view the game I'll change or delete my review.\n\n\nFirst of all I appreciate the very clear content warning you get before you start the game. The disclaimer explains that this game couldn't possibly describe a universal experience with depression, as there simply is none, and I like that they took the time to make sure everyone knows this going in. \n\nMy impression is that this is a fairly simplistic depiction of what depression can look like for a \"generic\" person. This doesn't have to be something negative as most people will be able to relate to some aspects of the story. The downside is, of course, that it simplifies a very complicated mental illness, possibly giving players a false idea of what depression is like, or alienating people's own experiences. I do feel like they gave a good enough disclaimer at the start, and as such I don't have too much of a problem with it.\nWhat I personally found most realistic was that you were incapable of choosing certain \"good\" options, depicting how you can be physically incapable of doing something, even though you know it will make you feel better. These crossed off options were sometimes in the theme of \"shake it off and feel better\", showing how that common advice is impossible for a lot of people. Simple, but effective.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is that it's very easy to make the \"best\" decision in most situation, easy to realise reaching out to a therapist is the correct action, that being open with your significant other will make you feel better. These \"good\" options always pay off in some way, which I feel is a big mistake. Pushing yourself to be social, or to do something you don't feel like because it is the \"healthy\" option, will not always make you feel better, and will unfortunately sometimes make you feel even worse as you are pushing yourself past your limit. Again, this will not be true for everyone, but I feel like the game gives a potentially harmful view that not only is it easy to make the decisions that will make you feel better, but that these decisions will always work. \nIronically there is a parental figure constantly pushing you to do just this, to think and do what she deems healthy, and the main character thinks about how it is not that simple, only for the game to then make it just that simple. \n\n\nI feel like this game was made to act as a bit of an introduction to what depression can look like, how someone seemingly \"normal\" can feel that bad. It is simplistic and almost a bit naive at times, but if you don't expect it to depict your own exact experiences it does an okay job. It felt like the creators wanted to give people a bit of hope as well, showing that someone can improve under the right circumstances, and give a simple view of what those might be. \n\nThis game wasn't a revelation to me, nor did it depict my own personal experiences. But that was never it's intention, and it would be wrong of me to expect more than this somewhat basic introduction. It's okay enough, and considering it's free I'd say I recommend it to people wanting a brief summary of what depression CAN feel like. I don't find it bad or harmful, merely one side of a very complex issue.", "timestamp_created": 1658790461, "timestamp_updated": 1658790461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

I won't go deeply into that because that's a toxic minefield, except to be forthcoming and advise that I received no money or \"compensation\" for this review. \n\nAnd despite all the controversy, when I sat down to actually play Depression Quest, I was disappointed to see it's not even a game, it's just a Choose Your Own Adventure/E-book that got self-published on Steam (presumably because no actual book publishers would touch it with 10' pole, the writing is atrocious).  The e-book has a theme about depression and mental illness.  The e-book explores basic slice-of-life daily confrontations that people with mental illness/depression face. \n\nSo we have a couple of problems here already that make this unsuitable to be a game on Steam, which is for PC gamers, not e-book readers.  My gaming rig isn't a Kindle.  Because this isn't really a game, it can't be recommended to PC gamers as if it is one.  I'm certainly not going to tell people to stop playing DOTA2 or CS:GO so they can read this e-book instead.  Secondly, this wasn't written as a game for gamers at all.  This is more an attempt at \"art\", hamfistedly dumped on Steam in the guise of a video game.  As is always the case when non-games are dumped on Steam for the sake of \"art\", this doesn't make art better, it's just making video games worse.  Which is not to say video games can't be \"art\"... games like Death Stranding, Life is Strange, even Red Dead Redemption 2 feature amazing and deep storytelling as well as brilliant technical implementation that immerses the gamer so completely there's no other way to describe their emotional impact than to call them works of art.  But you can't just take a crappy ebook and publish it on Steam and call that \"art\".\n\nTrying to address social issues through the medium of video games is misguided and can be harmful.  While it's plausible to suggest the intention was noble, this can do more harm than good.  It's my opinion that it's improper to use video games to push political or social agendas.  Especially things that aren't even video games.  This offers nothing to the benefit of PC gamers.\n\nOn matters of technical execution, Depression Quest is a hard fail.  The game engine and technical implementation are considerably worse than your average Ren'Py high school anime fan fiction (and boy, Steam has hundreds of those), although there is a working full screen mode.  At least Ren'Py asset flip fan fictions have asset flipped anime characters and artwork to try pretend that they're actually video games and not crap E-books.  The developers of Depression Quest didn't bother even pretending this was a video game, and the whole thing could easily have been done as a web page.  So why is it on Steam?  I already have Chrome installed. \n\nBecause this arguably doesn't qualify as a game, and offers nothing of value to PC gamers, I can't recommend it.

I think that a lot of the challenges the player encounters in this game are on the menu sometimes whether you are depressed or not (stink job, insecurity, social isolation). For example, many of us have probably thought \"If I died today, nobody would notice for a bit\", if we have been impacted by \"COVID lockdowns\".\n\nThe takeaway from the epilogue is very good; though not entirely unique, it's a good way to view things.

All the options end up sending you to the same story, and the endings don't vary that much.

I agree with some other user's reviews saying that it may be a little to \"fictional\", having that kind of music in the background and making some of the decisions not that realistic makes it a weird balance between a believable story and a playable and interesting game. As a little sidenote, the game did have some misspellings and weird written sentences, but nothing to serious...

I even think it risks romanticizing real issues such as depression, by making it a beautiful tragedy with emotional music and no agency of your own to get out. In real life, people have far more agency over their own life, even when facing depression.\n\nIt's not interactive enough to be considered a game, and I'm stating that as someone who can deeply enjoy visual novel style games.

Well, thankfully I don't because me at 2014 and me at 2021 are pretty much two different individuals. Or at least the former one was still new to seeing bigger picture of life and now I can appreciate \"not a real videogame\" too as I've expanded my view on both videogames and art in general.\n\nDepression Quest was a think 2014, a rather simple interactive novel, the famed \"not a real videogame\" genre that was there since 70s-80s.\n\nOk, fine, I will stop picking a fight now in my reviews, I promise.\n\nDepression Quest is a rather short interactive novel which showcases what it's like to have depression in attempts to gain both understanding and companionship. I actually remember thinking \"why would you make such game\" years ago on similar videogame but actually the game provides such answers, that I've already listed, literally on the very first in-game page. I can respect that. \n\nGame makes one of the points come across by often showing you but disabling the best options, so you have to pick one of the worse ones. Unlike Emily is Away it also didn't make me angy. Probably because it does have multiple endings. Go figure. It's obvious which options are the best options but this game is best explored by picking options of \"what I, an adult, would do in real life already\". It also tries to show that it's best to have some early help, otherwise it gets harder to get out.\n\nIt wasn't too pleasent of experience but interesting. Well, and it made me feel the feels. Fine enough for a free game.\n\n\nAnd now, the meta review, exactly what you've all awaited for!\n\nGAMERGATE FUCKING SUCKS!!\n\nI would be dumb enough to hear bad things about author and come to dunk at them in 2014 before I understood whole \"innocent until proven guilty\", \"kakfa trap\", \"those screenshots and words from Internet ought to be verified in some way\" and, most importantly, the idea that some things are 'private' and should be handled by either authority or friends due to inability to verify from Internet or simply because random people on Internet are really bad at doing the proper amount of natural social punishment anyway and just make everything worse as they are more interested in doing damage than recovery.\n\nFem dev of the game was accused, something about getting advantages with seks, fairly common accusation of successful woman (with seks life). And also the sane type of feminist. Apparently, she slept with journalist who gave high rating to this game albeit it turned out that someone else wrote said review or score. And then they got whole fight for \"ethics of game journalism\" going which is such a badly undefined goal (what is ethic exactly?) that is it any wonders that instead of going after reviewers that would overrate AAA games or try to run campaigns against corporations, they went for literally the weakest actor? Not that there was any organisation, it's just certain people wanting to protect \"videogames\" which is rather undefined thing when it's open market and said developer made her (with male co-developer) own game too.\n\nGamers usually meant nerds like me, now gamers(tm) became a joke, good job teenagers. I do love going on circlegamingjerk tho. Once per month. When they aren't being contarians.\n\nBut you can learn something useful like the troll tactics. Just come and visit game's Steam terribad forum. For example, you can study one of the most popular pattern which goes the following:\n1) Start a discussion while claiming, openly and loudly, that you haven't even heard of a game or barely care, just curious about drama.\n2) Ask few very focused questions that would provoke reaction and controversy, at which point smarter reader figures out that something is wrong.\n3) Go on full offence now while you \"smartly counter the points of the provoked person\", even going on \"it's not a real game hahaha\" monologue, immediately making all smart readers ignore your posts because smart reader is the reader that doesn't try to fit the world to his beliefs but tries to learn more of the world (interactive novels as game forms, non-fun video games) in order to build a more complicated worldview that still follows logic.\n\nTake a look, I dare you.\n\nAnd if you want an actual criticism of journalism without any withchunting, just YouTube search out \"Jackie Chan is an 8/10\".", "timestamp_created": 1638395454, "timestamp_updated": 1640588690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513485968112945557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104780004": {"recommendationid": "104780004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052587792", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1638236043}, "language": "english", "review": "I just wanted to see what made the gamers so angry and instead I saw a scarily accurate reflection of myself in the player character.", "timestamp_created": 1638237308, "timestamp_updated": 1638237308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680544853210449219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104058054": {"recommendationid": "104058054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128554130", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1130, "last_played": 1672784279}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1637923493, "timestamp_updated": 1637923493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100234031677246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "104015085": {"recommendationid": "104015085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044438720", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1638052667}, "language": "english", "review": "I am someone who suffers from depression.

quest isn't supposed to teach you how to deal with depression, it isn't supposed to teach you what is depression, Depression quest gives to you an experience that you (hopefully) doesn't goes through in your daily life, that's what makes the game beautiful on it's own way, it's a game about acceptance, about superation, and about experiences.\n\nfor all those who negatively reviewed the game, i understand them.\nBUT what we truly need to understand is that this should NOT have a \"Kill yourself\" button, it shouldn't have a \"Take Meds\" button.\nthe game is about decisions, and those decisions are impactful as to how your experience with it will be, if you for any reason hate this game, and when i mean hate i mean HATE, in the sense of totally despising it and seeing it as nothing but an aesthetic game for Emo kids, then all i'd have to say to you is \"you simply didn't understand it\"\n\nthe same way people don't understand games such as Pathologic, Omori or even Grimm's Hollow, and just think of them as \"edgy games\"\n\nDepression Quest is an Abstract Masterpiece and it deserves every single good thing said about it, you don't \"need\" to understand it, it's just an experience, and i hope you reading this never has to go through a similar experience in real life.\n\n\n\nSide note: the fanbase is edgy, this doesn't means the game itself also has to be, STOP TURNING DEPRESSION INTO AN AESTHETIC ON ITSELF.\nHowever, this game isn't making aesthetics out of depressed people, it is making art out of depression, both are different things, and should not be taken the same way.\nsimilar to how the Caretaker made a full 6 hour album out of Alzheimer's Disease, and he didn't make it into an aesthetic, he made it a style of expression through art, and so did Depression Quest.\n\n\nthanks for reading                                                                                        -J", "timestamp_created": 1631318809, "timestamp_updated": 1631318809,

I never mentioned what pros and cons this visual novel (VN) had, so I'm back here to add them. \n\nKeep this in mind -> I haven't played this VN in ages, and I refuse to do so because the gameplay was so...depressing. I'm listing everything from memories of 1-2 years ago, so I'll probably get things wrong. Do I care? Hell naw! \n\nPros: \n- Great storyline, but the characters lacked depth (They should've had a better back-story. I really wished that the secondary characters had more spotlight)\n- Did an okay job with depicting depression (It can be improved, of course)\n\nCons: \n- The layout of everything is shit (It's hard to navigate sometimes, sorry, all the time)\n- The descriptions make up for 95% (I'm over-exaggerating) of the VN, which makes the gameplay dull. One way this can be fixed is if all characters have more dialogues and simplifying the descriptions. \n- Everything is from the main charcters POV  \n- No character design (It would be nice if the VN had designs of every character, but I understand that a low budget can hinder that)\n\nDas all for me.

There's obviously a lot of history behind this game and the backlash faced because of it, though it's such a non-threatening game. My reasons for not recommending it are more about technicalities and how it could have been a stronger game if it was more interactive. A lot of negative reviewers questioned the validity of how depression is portrayed, and that's not only missing the point but also playing up the notion that someone can feel they are knowledgeable enough to criticize others' personal experiences with depression. \n\nDepression can be experienced in all sorts of ways and this is literally stated in the game, that it doesn't speak for everyone. Depression is not always staying in bed all day; there's high-functioning depression and so many other degrees and variants of it. I think that comparing and feeling the need to prove that one's mental illness may be more debilitating is the least helpful thing to include in a review. Everyone's battle with depression should be valid. \n\nI think the devs highlight the train of thought and false perceptions of depression pretty decently, especially with the guilt and feeling worthless based on other's ability to succeed in life, not to mention wanting things to get better but knowing it's more complicated than simply \"being more positive\". Depression often defies logic and it can seem impossible to make choices that would benefit us. It's a lot more complex than just taking the first step and \"being strong\", and it's easier said than done.\n\nMy main issue with the game isn't the commentary on relationships and how depression can affect romantic interests, family, friends and work, but on HOW the devs brought this to the attention of the viewer. The long-winded paragraphs felt so heavy-handed and dragged the narrative, which could be an adequate way to describe depression, but it became too wordy for me. At times, it felt forced with the second person view, and maybe if the devs would have given us a character to play as, using first or third person, and showing us actual scenes instead of the paragraphs of text, it could have been more impactful. I thought the crossed out choices were interesting though, as it plays on the doubt in our minds and how we feel we have no other options, or how our mental illness convinces us we're trapped.\n\nWhile this is a free game, I feel like there are far more engaging and thought-provoking games out there (that are also free) that portray mental health in a more interactive way, one that is also innovative in storytelling. Obviously this game is not focused on entertainment but more on experience and insight. Perhaps if this would have been a format of opening a phone or computer screen, having apps and answering texts with the choices, that could have worked better. Maybe our character could be receiving countless emails and messages, and we are unable to respond and put our feelings into words, because it can be hard to describe depression. So while I appreciate that the devs opened up conversation and a look into how depression can affect daily life, and how it's not synonymous with laziness or self-pity, I wish it could have been presented in a different way rather than spoon-feeding the reader with almost textbook-like definitions. I don't find it helpful to criticize the content's authenticity or accuracy, but I feel the construction of the game could have used much more work, as there are other ways to present and explore mental health than through paragraphs of text. I am grateful for the epilogue though, and the devs pointing out that there is not an neat resolution to depression and it's more about providing more outlooks on how to deal and cope with it.

It does suck that it cuts out options for you as you carry on through the game, also that the options seem very limited sometimes, but then again, this game is only trying to show the player a basic viewpoint of one of the MANY differentiating lifestyles/experiences an individual suffering with depression may go through. \n\nI think it's rather shitty that some reviewers are trying to trivialise the experience/s the principle character goes through though. Whether you understand depression from personal experience or not, I still think it's good to be open-minded about this game and what the game creators are trying to show you and make you understand at the end of the day. I would absolutely recommend this game for someone who needs a general understanding on how depression can work on individuals at times.

While this more than likely isn't going to cure anyone's depression, it could benefit some, and it is a great educational tool for those without depression.

But to someone without depression, it can help them understand that depressed people literally can't make certain choices, and that it's hard for them to do these things, and it is a disorder that builds on itself. While I can see why some didn't love it and why it is controversial, I think it does it's job well and can definitely help people understand depression better.  \n  \nIf you are depressed, please do your best to keep fighting, keep trying, keep seeking help when you can, and understand you are not alone.

The one thing I will say about these reviews, however, is that they aren't looking at the fact that depression takes on many many different personalities in many different people. The depression that plagues the character is this story was, in fact, a lot similar to my own experiences. I was diagnose with PTSD, Anxiety, gender Dysphoria, and Depression when I was 13. Before that point, I was suffering daily. I was on depression medications, but they weren't helping me. I had severe suicidal ideation daily, and made two attempts in the span of two weeks. I felt a lot like what the character in the story was describing. Constantly feed into negative feedback, staring at walls for hours and hours, constant anxiety, etc. I never fully acknowledged my depression, though. I never thought it was enough to get therapy for, and with the route I took in the game, that reflected that very clearly. Another thing I noted was the fact that the character you play as in the story never fully pays attention to their own needs or wants. They only ever notice whether they mentally can of cannot do something. This is exteremely accurate part in depression, from my experience, at least, I never thought to think of what I wanted or needed, I only thought of whether I could or couldn't that day. However, once I started intense therapy and medication, I finally realized my own value. I finally realized the fact the my problems don't burden other's if I don't put it all on their shoulders. I believe I got an incredible ending for this game. I took the route of medication, pushing the character to do things outside of their comfort zone, pushing them to talk to others, to go to therapy. I pushed them to talk to family, even when it seemed hopeless. These things are what helps someone get through mental illnesses, and I learned that the long way. Another accuracy in the game was the fact that the character's depression got much worse before it got better. That is the case always. It's going to be mentally, physically, and emotionally draining, and you will get worse. But, in the end, it's worth it. I loved the slow acknowledgement of one's worth and accepting one's limits. I loved the slow and detailed progress, barely noticeable, but when you look at where you were from where you are now, you can see the change. You begin to acknowledge your growth and improvement, and how far you've come. You move on to have yourself in you best interest, and to put yourself first. You realise the boundary between need, want, and have to. This character hated their job, but they needed the money. After a long while, though, they began to have to make a change. Need is important, yes, but when you mental health is steeply declining because of the source of money, you have to leave that job before it gets worse. Anyway, I went on a bit of a rant.

I like how the crossed-out options capture the feeling of not being able to do the things you should do. The biggest negative is that it's impossible for a game of this style to capture how hard it is to do the things you can; it's easy to just choose the things you 'should' do and wonder what the point is. Instead, I picked the options I felt like picking.\nIt's good that the game offers choices that can help you feel better. And it did what it could in a short game. But since it's a representation of life, I feel the need to point out solutions that are missing. A big one is the binary between 'therapy' and 'not therapy'. I've had a pattern of starting therapy, then quitting and not seeing anyone for years. I didn't realize how important it is to get a therapist that's a good fit, and that trying again would make a difference.\nAnyway. It's a well-written story, and worth playing.

I have the answer - it doesn't matter. In the end you will never see cosmic horrors in real life, but if you do see them, it means your life is about to end anyway. Meanwhile your 5/2 is soulcrushingly real. Everyday tasks are hard. And I, personaly, don't understand concept of \"friendship\" anymore. Still, despite all that, I do consider myself unmotivated, rather than depressed.\nThis... novel depicts a rather dual situation, where random (coz it feels like it) people notice that you are not well and give you positive feedback, but close family and your partner don't. Sometimes compliments and nice words feel out of blue. It happens because you - as a player - are not attached to any of characters. Not your mother, not your girlfriend, not your friends. You spend little to no time with them and, honestly, some of reactions (especially \"you don't know me at all\" when you try to communicate and express your concerns/deelings) took me by surprise (in a bad way). To summarise all above - it's too short and doesn't build a mood at all.\nWhy am I saying all this? There is a game, as you probably know, that's called \"Nights in the woods\". You know where this is going. Worldbuilding of this game is fantastic. Despite it looks, It touches various complex subjects, including depression, mental illness. I always wondered how they depicted last one so... accurate and real? Well it's no question for me now. \nThe point is you can feel how it's like to live day by day in a small town, reconect with your friends, discover yourself once more. It feels real. It's funny how game about cartoon cat makes you truly feel like you are not alone and nudge you to reconnect with your family, when actual \"game\" about depression fails miserably.\nWhen I played \"Nights in the woods\" I prayed that there would be continuation. Guess that's my proof that god does not exist. You can fix your depression, despite this game message. You can't fix a dead person.

It can be a vicious cycle, but I digress.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you're either living with depression or know someone who's living with depression.

These things tend to help, but they require a lot of trial and error, and it's not as simple as picking a dialog choice and saying \"I'm going to do this today!\" The game kind of acknowledges this by crossing out certain options if you're \"too depressed\", but that can lock you into bad endings and ultimately leads to a deterministic view of depression I don't agree with.\n\nThe protagonist is an educated middle class person with a steady job. His depression doesn't come about because of any intractable or historic problems in his life, and he already has an established support network that he can trust (friends, family, girlfriend, drugs/therapist he can afford). Although it's a good thing that we have a game that can talk about depression, this is basically depression on easy mode, and I think a lot of people will have a hard time relating.\n\nAs to whether Depression Quest is technically a video game or not, I'm not sure. The game is basically a Choose Your Own Adventure story presented as a series of webpages with a crappy 90s style music loop that I turned off. I got it for free, so I'm not complaining. The \"Is this a video game?\" question has been asked many times about many things over the years, and I'm okay with leaving this to the academics. What really matters is whether you get something out of it.\n\nA lot of people really don't like Zoe Quinn, but I think it's important to be able to separate an artist from their work. You can like Depression Quest and appreciate its contribution to our culture while completely despising the person who made it.\n\nThe game was free, it didn't take long to play, and I got a few things out of it (though not a lot). There still aren't many games about what it's like to live with mental illness, so Depression Quest still has some value in my opinion. I tentatively recommend it to anyone who has experienced depression or who's curious about it, and has a little time to kill.", "timestamp_created": 1595083019, "timestamp_updated": 1595083019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561033010482788086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72778184": {"recommendationid": "72778184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127639913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 968, "last_played": 1655969281}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played.

Depression can be caused by traumatic events. It can also be caused by a chemical imbalance, diet, or the environment in which a person grew up. Of course the protagonist has no reason to be depressed. YOU DO NOT NEED A REASON TO BE DEPRESSED. It just happens. I'm relatively privileged and successful, and surprise surprise, I still think about killing myself at least once a week. \n\nIt's clear that the protagonist also has anxiety, and that constant overthinking is definitely something that contributes to feeling depressed. You'd be depressed too if your brain constantly told you that all of the people you love and care about actually think you're a burden. \n\nPeople are also complaining about how all the PoSiTiVe DeCiSiOnS aRe CrOsSeD OuT, ThAtS sO NoT HeLpFuL. No shit. Everyone who's depressed KNOWS the right thing to do. We're just too depressed to do it. A very prevalent side effect of depression is a lack of motivation and desire. That's why the protagonist struggles to do anything. That's how depression works. Of course some people with depression can function perfectly fine- but everyone's different, and there are different levels of depression. \n\nLastly, people are saying that this game doesn't help depressed people. Uh, okay? It's a game, not a therapist. This is supposed to be a simulation of the mind of someone with depression and anxiety. \n\nAlso, the people who are complaining about not being able to get the \"good\" ending are wild af. I got the good ending on my first try. I guess y'all just suck at having depression.\n\nAnyway, the game was an interesting experience and I could relate to a lot of what the protagonist was feeling. I've been struggling with depression for ~8 years and have more recently been going through mental hospitals. I think this is a very accurate depiction of what depression is like.

It has a very well written text, which can make a moving, powerful and compelling narrative, which is in my opinion a monumental task, since it talks about a person suffering from a condition that is difficult to portray at the degree and severity it is shown here, by a narrative standpoint. It\u2019s hard to write a story that happens mostly in someone\u2019s mind. There is no adventure, no quest. It\u2019s a text game about choices, that sometimes you are unable to muster yourself to make. It\u2019s a narrative designed to portray frustration, impotence, exhaustion, insecurities and fears, which are backed up by the game\u2019s own mechanics. What you can\u2019t do are as meaningful to the story as what you can, and it\u2019s always interesting to see a game that uses its mechanic as a story-telling device.\n      But one of its more captivating traits is, without a doubt, how real it feels and why. One of the things that made me fall in love with a lot of independent games is that many times the histories told in them feel real because they ARE real. The feelings the character experiences feel real because they were felt by the team who wrote them. I saw and sympathized for the protagonist\u2019s suffering, and cried in joy because of the battles they won against depression, because you can see the suffering and you can see the battles in each of those lines. And the game is made not to entertain, but to share stories and raise awareness about an illness that haunts many across the globe. It just\u2026 Hits Differently.\n          I will not lie, it\u2019s not an easy and joyful ride. Sometimes we find in games a way to escape real life and its horrors, and it is not easy to play through a game that makes you remember feelings you wish to forget and feel pains you\u2019ve never felt before. But it\u2019s of the utmost importance that games like this get made in my opinion, so we know what we run from when we\u2019re trying to escape reality, and to better understand pains that we might never feel, but that are very real. \n", "timestamp_created": 1592261497, "timestamp_updated": 1592261497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47999998927116394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "70639486": {"recommendationid": "70639486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063838241", "num_games_owned": 826, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1591866989}, "language": "english", "review": "We got really depressed and lost the game... yet we didn't die?

My updated thoughts will be at the bottom of the review.\n\n\nDepression Quest expertly puts you in the shoes of a person suffering from depression; I've been playing for five minutes and I want to fucking die already.\n\n\n\nThis \"game\" is a joke. It doesn't go much further than \"You have depression. You have no energy to do anything. Isn't that horrible?\", oversimplifying depression to an extent not unlike the one commonly seen in more mainstream media, where depression is portrayed as \"You're sad, everything sucks, boo boo\". The saving grace in those cases is that the story typically isn't all about depression, and that it's usually somewhat enjoyable. Depression Quest has none of those saving graces. I'd say its only saving grace is being free, but even without having paid anything for it, I want a refund. A refund of my time, my precious five minutes that never will come back, that is.\n\nIf you're curious about it for the memes, feel free to try it out, but you probably won't get much from it. Like, at all. In fact, you'll probably end up losing.\n\n\nUpdated thoughts:\n\nSo, I kept being told that the game gets better, and I figured that even if my first five minutes playing this game were so awful that it made me never want to play again, five minutes probably isn't enough to offer a review. So I booted it up again. For context, I'm a writer, and I have depression, so I think I know what I'm talking about here, to some degree.\n\nMy first playthrough went something like this: I booted up the game, and being no stranger to visual novels, which this feels closest to, I tried to get in character. Wasn't hard, since the game pretty much forces you to. At the beginning, if you choose any other option other than the 'depressed' one, you're told no and sent back to choose, this time with the option you chose crossed out. I ended that playthrough in about five minutes, my character completely drained out and unable to do anything, all the options crossed out. And I felt the same, which is why I wrote that review.\n\nThis time, I decided to try to play in the \"correct\" way, trying to choose the options that would help my character whenever possible. The game gives you some context at the beginning, with highlighted words that you can click on for an explanation of who these people are, likely to help you get in character.\n\nSo I kept playing, choosing every option that seemed 'social' or like it would help MC. Often I wasn't given much of a choice, the amount of options that get crossed out can get to as many as five out of six, but even when it's not that bad, it often results in a 'right' and 'wrong' answer. \n\n\"You're in X social situation, what do you do? \n\nA: [strike]Go out with your friends, be happy[/strike]\n\nB: [strike] (Reluctant) Go out with your friends [/strike]\n\nC: Explain to your friends why you're depressed\n\nD: Do nothing, stay home, suffer\"\n\nI'm paraphrasing for the sake of the example, but this should give you a rough idea of how the game gets at times.\n\nPersonally, I believe this might have been done to make you feel cornered, like you feel when, y'know, you have depression, but the result still is that many options are there more as a formality than to actually provide anything.\n\nThere's a constant reminder in static-filled boxes at the bottom of every screen, of how you're feeling and whether you're taking medications or going to therapy. I guess so you don't forget that you're depressed? Though again, the whole atmosphere of the game contributes to making you feel like shit.\n\nThere are also some errors in the writing, off the top of my head I can think of [b]\"You pass by a blue Camero and jump as it beeps at you, causing you to jump in surprise\"[/b]. \nSo I was so startled I jumped, and then my jump surprised me and I double-jumped? I jest, but it's something to take into consideration whenever you're writing.\n\nFor another example, at one point the option to say nothing in a conversation was labeled \"Notice that your hands are shaking\", which makes me wonder if this person was willingly ignoring their hands. I feel like simply labeling it \"Say nothing\" and [i]then[/i] in the resulting text screen describing MC's hands shaking would've worked better. The game is filled with these \"show, don't tell\" problems. \n\nWithout any ill-intentions to the game's writer, most of it honestly reads like a teenager's fic where they try to present a depressed character, not so subtly trying to convey the message that they are the character and they're the one who's depressed. It's full of little issues you'd expect from a teenager writing their first short story for a school assignment.\n\n...I mentioned before that the game excels at making you [i]feel[/i] depressed. It might've come off as sarcasm, and it mostly was, but the whole experience is very draining. It's true what the warning at the beginning says, so if the intention of the developer was to make you feel like shit while playing, they really accomplished that. \n\nBut what I noticed in this second playthrough is that after a while, the game really manages to get you in character. You begin ignoring the top-most choices on your own, because you know they're the ones that are crossed out and thus inaccessible. But at one point, which I think is genius if it was intended, you're given the option to take medications. And that's what sparked me to come write all of the above, because all the options are available, but I didn't feel like taking it. I [i]know[/i] that's the right choice, but I still don't want to take it. I was basically conditioned throughout the whole playthrough to reject the top-most choice, so now I find myself rejecting it entirely on my own.\n\n...Maybe I'm projecting myself too much, who knows. Everyone will have a different experience. Do I recommend this game? Ehh.... Still no. It has some really clever moments but it's still pretty dull. Fittingly for \"an interactive (non) fiction about living with depression\", everything in the game is made to wear you out and get you in character, which comes its detriment. It's an unpleasant experience. Think about it, to provide a comparison, as Darkest Dungeon. That game is not shy about wasting your time grinding for a character only to have them die and make you do the same with a new character. Thematically, it works wonders. As a game... it gets boring. It's the same with this one. Everything about it reinforces the depressing atmosphere, which is perfect for a story about depression, but unsurprisingly drives people away. I mentioned it briefly in the comments, but there really isn't any indication that the game will get better. It just happens as you play. You have to take a leap of faith and hope it will be worth it at the end. That's wonderful as an analogy for depression, but awful if you just want to play a visual novel.\n\nI don't know who the person who made the game is, from browsing other reviews it's clear that there was [i]some[/i] drama, but I've avoided even acknowledging that until now, because I think the work deserves to be judged aside from the author. \n\nI don't know and I don't care if I'd respect this author as a person, but after giving this another shot, even if I still don't like it, I can say for certain that I respect the work just a little more.", "timestamp_created": 1580305960, "timestamp_updated": 1595089456, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612272083759307861", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62250507": {"recommendationid": "62250507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119834610", "num_games_owned": 854, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1579686244}, "language": "english", "review": "Goddamn, I'm still so salty at this game, that I just HAD to download it and have it run for like 2 hours so I could just write yet another negative review for this game. \n\nWhile it might not be as relevant as it was way before, when I \"played\" it, it never got any update, and I'm quite surprised it has a staggering \"Mixed\" reviews score instead of the way more deserved \"Extremely Negative\" one. \nNot only will this game won't help you at all if you're suffering from depression, nor does it portray this ailment properly if you want to know what does it mean to live with it. First time I played, I remember, going unironically into it, trying to find some answers, since I had been living with these quirky mental health issues ever since I was 11, and found out a badly written, badly presented, and with a really annoying music that glitches out as you advance into the story. After I had ended one playthrough, I couldn't relate at ALL with it, and in fact felt as they were making fun of such a serious matter.\n\nIt's also really ironic that the dev of this game pushed a guy to suicide after false allegations of sexual abuse against Alec Holowka.

Yeah.  Sure.  Screw it.  Why not?  The \"game\" or narative, or choose your own adventure is about a guy who is depressed but sure seems to have a lot of support in the form of friends, family, and a lady friend.  I could not help but think that the character you \"Play\" has it a whole lot better than I.  He's got friends.  He's got a girlfriend.  He's got a mom and pop.  He doesn't seem to have a full blown drug addiction nor does he have people in his life that are not happy when he is unhappy, and are not happy when he is happy.  He doesn't seem to have people in his life that purposefully prey on his weaknesses and conspire to keep him in a sorry state, nor does he have soulless non-human but human looking drug dealers that do everything in their power to keep him strung out and lacking anything remotely resembling dignity or self esteem.  His Girlfriend in the game seems to be helpful enough..and he certainly doesn't have a female in his life that has marked him long ago as the weakest in the herd who does her level best to destroy any ideas of self worth or independence from her or his current situation, using a combination of sex, guilt, drugs, and gas lighting to slowly eat away at the remaining anchors that keep him grounded in sanity and on this planet in general.  He has a job and income and things that belong to him that he bought with is own money.  He has friends that seem to care about him, not simply a collection of people that wormed their way into his trust so that they could steal from him, feel better than him, talk shit behind his back, tell lies about him for fun, and make it more or less impossible to for him to get a fair chance at much of anything in the area where he \"lives\"....However, I suppose the point of this \"game\" is that he has every reason to feel well adjusted and loved, but he simply does not.  And this is an aspect of Depression.  You don't know why you are like this you just are.  It came into your life with such subtlety that you are not sure if there was ever a time you -didn't- feel this way.  Meanwhile the same tropes seem to follow you where ever you go, \"Cheer up.\"  and \"Suck it up\" and \"Quit being such a drama queen\".  All you know for certain is that you annoy people.  They genuinely don't like you and you genuinely do not like you.  One more hit, one more shot, one more pill, it doesn't matter.  It's all going to be over soon....\n\nLife has a way of kicking you in the balls or punching you in the tittys when you are at your worst and at your lowest.  We never really get over anything.  We just learn to live with whatever it is that is trying to break us apart.  To all those suffering from this Chronically Acute Disease, you do not suffer alone but sometimes reaching out to someone only serves to illustrate how far gone you are.    You deserve to feel better, however.  You deserve to have a genuine, heartfelt smile, not just something you put on for others so they wont feel upset in your presence.

Maybe Grust, the founder of Crappy Games Wiki and all other reception wikis, is right after all. Depression Quest is one of the worst games i have ever played in my life. There is very little \"gameplay\", just clicking on some choices that affect some storyline about an other who has depression and must do something for some reason. Even the game states that it is not meant to be fun. In fact, it is not a game, it is just a choose-your-own adventure quest. If the developer Zoe Quinn is going to make a game about depression, at least put something that can be remotely fun. Fun can lead to happiness, you know and happiness can be a cure for depression if done correctly. As for the story, well the whole story is just a boring young adult drama about an other who has depression as stated above, and is not at all happy. Also, there are multiple paths, but there is no ending because according to the game, there is no neat resolution to depression. Why? Who cares. What about the music? The music is just one somber piano loop that never stops with some occasional sound effects like the chattering at the party. Now there is one redeeming quality to this game and that is the fact that Depression Quest is completely free to play. You can play it free as charge so that you can suffer through this depressing game. In conclusion, this \"game\" is one of the worst and I can imagine people playing this game and getting even more depressed after they are done.

I'm going to pretend that controversy doesn't exist, and try to be as objective as possible in my assessment of it as a [i]game[/i]. But right off the bat, let's just get a quick subjective/cheeky review out of the way, if only to remove such temptations from my system...\n\n   Depression Quest: Lives up to its title. Depressing as heck. (Though not entirely devoid of hope.)\n\n   Okay, on with the more serious review.\n\n   There's no denying there's some quality here. It's well-written - always a good thing for a game almost entirely reliant on [i]words[/i] - and the music and atmos sounds are very effective. I'm certainly going to \"recommend\" it: because of said quality, the fact that your choices really [i]do[/i] matter, and because it's FREE. That said...\n\n   I would be very wary regarding [i]who[/i] I would recommend this game to. Me: I like melancholic art. Especially when it has some degree of catharsis, which this does; at least if you choose the slightly more proactive decisions offered to you throughout the game. Which is, granted, a potentially inherent flaw in the game's design from the word \"go\", as my understanding of \"depression\" is that it's something that doesn't exactly encourage proactive behaviour. That said...I played through once being proactive, and once being as negative as I could possibly manage, and both outcomes seemed sufficiently believable in and of themselves.\n\n   Let me slap a bit of personal context on this. I myself was diagnosed with depression about a decade ago, and decided a couple of years later to wean myself off the medication. I've been largely fine ever since, so whether I was ever genuinely \"depressed\" or just going through a particularly bad patch - following a break-up and half-arsed suicide attempt - is anyone's guess. I'm a pretty resilient type on the whole, and have a tendency to actively seek out art that [i]confronts[/i] me. If you're not that kind of person: STAY. THE. HECK. AWAY. There's every chance this [i]won't[/i] be a cathartic experience for you; quite possibly the opposite. I see plenty of reviews joking that this product might push you towards suicide, but believe me...they're only [i]barely[/i] joking! This is not \"fun\" or lighthearted stuff, to say the least.\n\n   But it [i]is[/i] genuinely artistic, and is genuinely well-done (aforementioned reservations about proactivity aside). Just know what you're getting yourself in for. If you're still on the fence, I'd happily recommend Tomorrow Don't Come as an alternative: it's shorter, closer to a regular \"game\", and more guaranteed to deliver a cathartic experience. I can't stress enough that I'm only recommending Depression Quest to those who don't demand to be \"entertained\" by each and every game that they play. \n\n   Don't say I didn't warn ya!\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\u200b\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\u200b\nCheers!)", "timestamp_created": 1550069292, "timestamp_updated": 1559828826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562965333461761475", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48938224": {"recommendationid": "48938224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327462603", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 199, "last_played": 1548595982}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly?

This simulation is rather short, of course, and can be completed in one sitting, so it obviously won't have the full weight of an actual personal experience, but it does use interface elements in a few key ways to serve this purpose:\n\n* It is entirely text-based.  If you were here for a video game, no, sorry, the most you get are some still photos of stuff.  The way you play this game is, thus, \"boring\" and dull, but that's actually fitting and evocative of such an experience.  (The repetitive, slow, dour music reinforces this slow-moving yet oppressive aura, Meanwhile, the writing is appropriately descriptive of this aura and of how a lot of seemingly mundane and sometimes even enjoyable activities feel like a chore to approach.)\n* The visual style is just words on a grey background.  This style is similarly \"boring\".  (There are some colors, of course, but when life is glum it's still not consistently glum either anyway.)\n* The most important interface element that I appreciated is that, when the game offers you choices at decision points, it often scratches out (and makes unchoosable) the ones that would \"make the most sense\".  They represent things you can think about doing, the kinds of things you \"know you should\" do, but just can't muster up the courage or will to make them happen.  This mechanic is an extremely apt portrayal of this phenomenon, in the form of an interface element.\n\nThe story in the game is only a snippet of life, and it's only a snippet of life of a person who isn't you and won't be entirely like you or anyone else.  However, it does have a variety of nuggets that make it relatable, in my opinion -- particularly the dour emotions and shackled outlook that come with such an experience in one's own life.\n\nNote: The controversies related to the developer are a thing I don't care about, and my review has nothing to do with them, aside from the fact the hullabaloo surrounding the controversy actually caused me to discover this game.\n\nDisclosure: I got this game for free on Steam, because, well, it's a free game on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1548106216, "timestamp_updated": 1548106640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558282136917114258", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48390667": {"recommendationid": "48390667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079384691", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1547759685}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I didn't play this game with the idea that it will somehow help me, more out of curiosity tbh. At the age of 17 I've been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which later evolved into a full depression, so I am more than used to dealing with it. \nIt came out quite surprising, to see how much I could relate to the protagonist, knowing that while it's a character, his thoughts were or are the thoughts of a real person. Of course, while I could identify myself with the protagonist, some people could not and it's okay, because even if depression has common points, not everyone is going through the same things. And this is a thing not many understand and criticize.\nBecause I could relate so much, I was able to get the good ending first. And it may come out as fake or whatever, but I was literally in the protagonist's shoes for most of the story. I too, saw therapists and took medication which both helped me in the end. And I made all the choices the way I did in real life. I'm not saying I got through with my depression, because as it was written in the end, you don't really \"cure\" depression. It's a thing you will probably live with your entire life but you have to manage its effects.\nIn the end, what I wanted to say is that, while it's not really a game, I think the meaning of it is to help you better understand depression, in one of its forms, both for people dealing with it personally and people who have friends or relatives going through it. For those dealing with it, it doesn't magically fix your depression, but it shows that you are not alone and there are ways of improving your life. For those who have someone close who is dealing with it, it raises awareness and helps you empathize so that you can be an effective help for them.\nI think the developers did a really good job, I don't see why some people blame them and it saddens me when I read mean comments coming especially from people who claim they are depressed. Again, this game is not meant to fix your depression and I don't see how one would take it that way from the very begining. While I don't question whether or not you are trully suffering from depression, I think that keeping an open mind and not taking a defensive stance would help you better your condition and ultimately, your life. Anyway, that is what I did and it helped me a lot. However, I understand that this may come as a rather difficult thing to do for some people. I know this because my mother was once depressed too, didn't want to acknowledge that, her depression later turned into schizophrenia and OCD (from which my therapist told me), ultimately culminanting in her suicide. This is why I wanted to tell you that at least from my point of view, keeping an open mind in all of this is very important because a behaviour contrary to that is what makes a tiny snowball turn into an avalanche.\nAll in all, I hope all of you who read this are well (as much as possible) and are making progress in your life. Just remember, little steps are more important sometimes than bigger ones and have patience with yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1547761911, "timestamp_updated": 1547761911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.620746314525604248", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48364056": {"recommendationid": "48364056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006048556", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1547642416}, "language": "english", "review": "As somebody, who struggles with depression from time to time, I couldn't really find any merit in this game.

As you go through the story, you will make choices for the narrator. Should he call his girlfriend and tell her how he's been feeling, or should he just go to bed? [i]Depression Quest[/i] can be played through in about 30 minutes or less, assuming you read every page in full. \n\n[b][h1]Why I [b]do[/b] recommend it:[/h1][/b]\nEven when you choose all the choices you believe are \"right,\" the game doesn't always give you the best or happiest options the next time you have to make a choice. I love that they do this because it is an accurate representation of depression. Everything is exhausting, everything is hard, and the negative feedback loops are nearly impossible to escape from. I particularly liked one choice I had to make partway through the game, after having chosen all the \"best\" responses up to now, where the character is clearly still experiencing the full brunt of his depression. He can't sleep one night, and the game asks, \"What do you do?\"\n\n1. Force yourself to sleep.\n2. Go to bed. It shouldn't be that hard.\n3. Just close your eyes and let it happen. Why won't your thoughts back off for five seconds?\n4. Snap out of it. What is wrong with you? Why can't you stop stressing out for five seconds?\n5. You're probably going to go into work tomorrow exhausted and fuck everything up and get fired.\n6. Go to your computer. Sleep is clearly not happening no matter how long you lay here. \n\nSeeing as numbers 1-5 are actually marked out with a red line in the game, you are only given one actual response option you can choose (#6). Options 1-5 show the negative and self-loathing thoughts a depressed person may be experiencing all at one time while trying to come to a decision. I love how authentic the game is in its portrayal of depression (and, in my opinion, a sprinkling of generalized anxiety on top of it all). Depression does not let you make choices easily, or sometimes [i]at all[/i]. The fact that the game occasionally doesn't give you an option to truly make your own choices just adds to its authentic representation of depression.\n\n[b][h1]The Good:[/h1][/b][list]\n[*] Excellent representation of depression\n[*] You are given the opportunity to actually get help for the main character. I think it would be too sad if I couldn't have some kind of happy ending for him, even if it would fit with the theme of the game.\n[*] Short playthrough\n[*] Free\n[/list]\n\n[b][h1]The Bad:[/h1][/b][list]\n[*] It's possibly in danger of portraying depression as an easily solvable puzzle if you just get yourself a pet, therapist, and drugs. While it does a great job of showing the experience of depression, I'm a little concerned what the takeaway might be for players who have never experienced it. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1547152086, "timestamp_updated": 1547152103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526881694793701172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48074938": {"recommendationid": "48074938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198395478833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 753, "last_played": 1563551297}, "language": "english", "review": "EBOY SADSKI", "timestamp_created": 1546535828, "timestamp_updated": 1546535828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503168284893035889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47972717": {"recommendationid": "47972717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129912256", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 102, "last_played": 1546217282}, "language": "english", "review": "only for those who dont have autism and for those who have depression", "timestamp_created": 1546217412, "timestamp_updated": 1546217412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47794414": {"recommendationid": "47794414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192906059", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1545704668}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhwlFRjkTOg]\u201c\ud835\ude54\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a'\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68.\u201d[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1545704670, "timestamp_updated": 1545704670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512485861778259277", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47754781": {"recommendationid": "47754781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347065620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545596563}, "language": "english", "review": "Look I don't know if this is just me or my computer or what but I was barely able to get through 2 sessions of the game.

Really good presentation of what a person who suffers from depression has to go through, what he feels in certain cituations.

It won't help them solve it but it will show that someone actually understands how it goes and that they are not alone with this.\n\nEdit: just for fun tried a \"what if\" route while choosing actions that I would never choose in actual life and wow, it is really inspiring when you see how character slowly recovers and more and more options that were previously locked become available.", "timestamp_created": 1541579877, "timestamp_updated": 1541582577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519063830375671387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45623491": {"recommendationid": "45623491", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975959510", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 9, "last_played": 1541342199}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a free, short novel.

You can simply play something much more fun or hang out with your friends instead of wasting your \"Important\" time on writing a bad review on a game. And for the actual depressed people playing this game, thinking that it will help their depression; Look dude, this not a game for you. It is a game for the people who have empathy, a little free time and some patience in them (By which, I mean people around you that want to help you but don't really know how it feels to be in depression.) and it really isn't a game at all, it is a simulation to raise awareness and make people emphatize when they see someone depressed. I only wasted an hour on this game and did only 1 run and reached the good ending. However, my depressed friend played this (And he is the only reason i played this game) and he got a game over in like 15 minutes (Source: he told me that) just because he played the game like it's actually real life. To get a good ending you need to think like the protagonist, feel like the protagonist and think of the outcomes when you are making decisions. If a depressed person plays this they will get a bad and depressing ending like 80% of the time. My run wasn't the greatest and it certainly wasn't the worst one. Surely, one time I almost lost the game. But i knew that it would be fine if i just moved on. And that is exactly what the game tells us in the end of the good ending:\n\n\"Instead of a tidy ending, we want to just provied a series of outlooks to take moving forward. After all, that's all we can really do with depression - just keep moving forward. And at the end of the day it's our outlook, and support from people just like you, that makes all the difference in the world.       Thanks Again\"\n\nYou are probably asking; \"why did this random guy on the internet spent time on a stupid review?\"\n That's because I get triggered when I see people criticizing a game unfairly. You can't criticise a game if you don't undertsand it's story,characters and (sometimes) the lesson that the game teaches us. If you criticise a game without having a general understanding of these three. it would not be fair. It's like judging a fish by it's ability to climb a tree! It's just stupid. \n\n Also, this game is not perfect. It has flaws just like any other game. And it is also not fun at all, it's mostly reading text and trying to understand the plot to make good decisions.\n\n To sum up, this wasn't a review of Depression Quest. THIS was a review of the REVIEWS of Depression Quest and if you managed to read all of this without being bored. Instead, trying to undertsand my point then you will probably get the good ending in this game. Anyways thanks for spending time on reading this review.

I have more fun writing this review, trust me.\nI know, it's supposed to give you the impression of depression, but it does not. \nIt gives you the impression of someone who actually wants to KILL HIMSELF soon, which is quite nice. \nShould have named the \"game\" (it's not a game) \"SUICIDE ME\", if you die you win. \n\nEach page gives you a brief synopsis, followed by 2 to 4 answers, ranging from positive to negative.\nThe most positive answer is locked by default, so you have to pick either a some what positive answer or up to two negatives, which revolve doing nothing or act like a social outcast.\nEvery answer should have been \"go to bed\" it wouldn't change much in that horrible fanfic.\n\nMost annoying this is to have to read the links, which lead to a page, with some background.\nSo, you are constantly switching back and forth to the page you are supposed to read and reading background shit no one cares and give an answer \"you think fits\" or at least the developer think would fit.\nJust read the page, background doesn't matter at all. Don't think. just pick an answer, go for the worse, detached ones to get the highscore.\n\nAfter a while the game changes one of the boxes below, describing your mental state.\nYou can influence that by picking answers - obviously.\nThe only quest here is either make those boxes positive, which actually lets this boring diary appear like a game.\nOr make them worse, which people with dark humor (or masochism) can use that as a competition for the worst gameplay session.\nMan, I really want to make them say \"KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF, KILL YOURSELF\", which would be sadisticly fun. I don't care about the protagonist here.\nI think I won't be touching this \"thing\" again unless I can't willingly succumb to despair on my own and need a nudge for my mental state into the right direction to crash to the floor.\n\nNow, back to the actual content.\n\nIt makes you depressed - well at least a similar feeling of that, called \"boredom\".\nHere is where the game excels and manages that very good.\nWith heavy depression, you wouldn't even play this. You would be too powerless to read most of it.\nI hate to read shit about depression or someone else having this \"illness\",\nbut it's nothing you can order at Amazon to experience yourself.\nIf I could package depression and ship it, man, I'd be rich by now. \n\nSo, to give a brief overview about depression:\n- You feel constantly alone\n- You feel constanly tired\n- You don't want to talk to people\n- Doing your daily stuff make you even more tired and you ask yourself if it's worth it.\n- You do everything to do something else. \"Make food? bleh, I eat Cookies instead.\"\n- You try to do everything right to everyone to avoid arguments.\n- Even small critisism can throw you into the abyss, because you have no balls to deal with it.\n- You are single, because no one wants a detached, deranged mind which is sad all the time.\n- Pets suck as they need care, you don't want to do.\n- You doubt your own existence as worthy. \n- WTS: A box of depression, contents: Disappointment. $4,99 PM me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1539183282, "timestamp_updated": 1539183282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490760713815689087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45164656": {"recommendationid": "45164656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206385093", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1482525438}, "language": "english", "review": "not really worth anyone's time\ni myself am clueless as to why i played it a while back lol", "timestamp_created": 1538943951, "timestamp_updated": 1538943951, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.48384585976600647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45150345": {"recommendationid": "45150345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221606804", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1469455935}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to die, not because of the content of game.

It shows the impact, not only on yourself emotionally and physically, but on those around you. Your friends, significant others, family... they all feel the weight of your change, even if you try so desperately to hide it. \n\nDepression is scary in the sense that sometimes you do get over it... great, it's lovely and uplifiting... but some of us never truly do, it's chronic, ever overshadowing every facet of our lives.

Of course the author would use their version of depression, since writing what you know is story telling 101 and also because IT'S DEPRESSION. A topic thats slightly less hard to write about than quantum mechanics. If you believe otherwise i challenge you to write a story about the topic without it coming out as a edgefest like HATRED or a cringefest like the average sonic fanfic.\n\nThe games mechanics aren't all that deep and i'm fairly certain the branching paths are mostly smoke and mirrors to hide the games linearity. Fair enough, but that's every game. By this point you should know never to trust any game claiming total freedom, especially from AAA games. The crucial difference is Depression Quest never wasted 400 hours of my life only to get a ending worthy of a DOS game. Isn't that right Mass Effect? Besides the fact that it's short, it's free so why are you even complaining?\n\nAbout the LGBT, GamerGate, reviewer conspiracy thing. I'm a slavic male, your kapitalist ideals have no effect on me.\n\nAnd about the game it's self, it's too short for my tastes, i'd love to be able to live through the cliff notes version of Marty Stu's life sorta like the Roy simulation from [spoiler]you know where,[/spoiler] except it's not a joke. I think this would also work better as more of a third person experience, make the main character be a character, not just a pure surrogate for the player. Had i been making this game i'd use heavy juxtaposition to take the load off. That would lead to a game thats more like Dropsy than Depression Quest however, but i guess thats a good thing since i'd probably turn the ending into Zombie Shooter [i](real game, look it up)[/i] given enough time.\n\nSo i suppose it's a good thing i don't make video games.\nMay the salt commense.", "timestamp_created": 1534881662, "timestamp_updated": 1534881662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44230759": {"recommendationid": "44230759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133935204", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1650198872}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly a great game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1534601901, "timestamp_updated": 1534601901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44174647": {"recommendationid": "44174647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083174123", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 163, "last_played": 1508852187}, "language": "english", "review": "not fun, lame, propganda tool , there are c64 text based adventures whit alot beter gameplay.\nif you wanna cry watch a sad movie.", "timestamp_created": 1534367904, "timestamp_updated": 1534367904, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469597697257995605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "44056206": {"recommendationid": "44056206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016517729", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 93175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 69579, "last_played": 1542627357}, "language": "english", "review": "[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1][i]\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u266b Jake Hill -

It's not meant to completely encapsulate depression from every angle or perspective, only to present one side of it and start a conversation from there. Definitely worth trying out.\n\nI'm a little late to the party, but originally it was confounding to me that this, an hour long text adventure, of all games, would cause such an uproar as it did a few years ago. It's such a sincere attempt at communication regarding dealing with depression, an issue that no sane human being would choose to be on the other side of. At the same time, in a weird way, the passionate reactions make sense. There are many ways to approach the scenario in the game. You can see it as an outsider trying to sneak a peak at what some people go through, who can't really relate to the situation but will hopefully come out of it having learned something new about the human condition. You could be someone like me, who is going through depression and finds some close aproximations in the game to experiences of my own, even if they don't line up completely. Or maybe you're someone who's going through a carbon copy of the game's bleak scenario. Either way, if you're willing to fully commit to the hour or so that it takes to play through it, you'll come out with some sort of strong reaction. Some people will appreciate the feeling of vulnerability and exposure the game asks of you, a feeling that's typically a prerequisite to the start of any conversation about a serious topic. Some people will be offended that a videogame dared to try to get them out of their shell and get them to feel. Some will dismiss the game completely. Every emotional reaction is valid. What's inexcusable is taking this reaction and letting it manifest as insults to the game's creators in the forms of sexism, misogyny, or worst of all, violence. Obscene reactions like that are how conversation is stifled, and very real issues, like the fight against depression, go undealt with. This game is a work of art that's meant to start a conversation, and I'd encourage anyone with a passing curiosity to give it a try. It's free, and it takes about an hour or less to finish.

Strangely, many of them appeared to be obvious troll posts. Among those rated as the \"most helpful reviews of all time,\" here are some recurring themes I noticed, and my thoughts on them after playing:\n\n\"This is an unrealistic and/or insulting portrayal of depression.\"\nI am a doctor. I talk to people about their depressive symptoms. I prescribe anti-depressants and am familiar with their effects. I have also experienced depression first-hand. While no one story can hope to reflect everyone's unique personal experience of depression, this story is a satisfactory portrayal of the experience for many. It was particularly strange how one reviewer claimed to have formal education in depression and then criticised the game for veering into social anxiety rather than depression. As any medical student who showed up to the first lecture about depression should know, depression and anxiety disorders are so intimately linked that they are often inseparable.\n\n\"The choices either have no effect, or encourage negative behaviour.\"\nTo my surprise, when I played the game, the complete opposite was true. Perhaps the developer overhauled the game between these reviews and my playing, or the reviews are outright fabrications. When I deliberately chose options to lower my mood, certain subsequent options that would require a better mood became unavailable. I did the best I could to chip away at the oppressive weight, within the confines of limited options as a result of reduced mental resources (this is a realistic portrayal of a common experience). As a result of my choices, I was able to engineer drastically (within the bounds of realism) different endings. While some reviewers complained they they were unable to be magically cured by the ending, that's precisely the point; a journey with depression is often a chronic issue, marked by small incremental steps.\n\n\"The options to simply snap out of it were crossed out.\"\nAgain, this is precisely the point. The idea that one can simply \"snap out of it\" is a prevalent myth in society, born of ignorance and an ongoing cause of significant harm. To whine about this is to be part of the problem.\n\n\"The character's reasons for being depressed were not explained.\"\nAgain, precisely the point. The medical condition of depression does not need a reason. While depression can be precipitated by certain events, often there will be no reason apparent. See above point.\n\nTLDR:\n- The game does satisfactory job given the limitations of what it is and the enormous complexities of the subject matter tackled.\n- A strangely high proportion of the negative criticism seems to range from obvious troll posts to brazen fabrications, possibly politically motivated.", "timestamp_created": 1527517058, "timestamp_updated": 1527518007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623531341552734375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "42294944": {"recommendationid": "42294944", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991133436", "num_games_owned": 778, "num_reviews": 110, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 34, "last_played": 1527379752}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending made sense. the people who dislike the conclusion don't get that you never eventually have a final boss fight, irl.

purchases in their videogames are the same people who decry the presence of social commentary in their games. The implicit idea behind both of these positions is that video games exist as a form of escapism, to not have to contend with these kinds of issues 'for a change'. Wouldn't it be nice if a person from a racial or social minority group could expect to be able to do the same thing within video games? To not be reminded of their under-representation and how their perspectives aren't accounted for when a game is marketed and designed? The white male gamer seems to identify more with the main kind of social stratification they might recognize, which would be economic. A poor-middle class gamer doesn't want to encounter a 'rich' gamer who would be able to effectively bully them out of their fun in virtually every game an 'affluent player demographic' would frequent. No gamer wants any multiplayer game they play to feel like they're up against a boss from Dark Souls (obligatory reference) just because some user with a wingding username dumped a credit card balance into virtual items.  This is relatable to most anyone in the gaming community, regardless of personal background. Multiplayer games for most people are a place where people can unwind from a long day or week; Competitive player bases constituting only a minority of most multiplayer gaming communities. \n\nThe idea that competition in games is required to be completely on level grounds is novel, but it is also untrue. This idea in conjunction with the escapist needs video games satisfy (for many) constitute two points of a line that this group of players draws between the 'real' world and the contrived worlds of video games. They seem to believe that the two worlds can be completely alienated, with the coincidental exception of economic stratification as a social issue in their games. Prominent speakers in the gaming media community have continually come out and spoke in unison against the presence of pay-to-win scenarios in recent major games releases (Such as EA's NBA2K18, Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Bungee's Destiny 2). From within the community, the syllogism for this seems only obvious and practical: \n'If it's not fun, no one's going to want to play it. \nSo if you allow a pay-to-win scheme, the game will be less fun for most players and thus turn most of them off the game'. \n\nThis truth is taken for granted, because it decontextualizes the natural realities of video gaming as an interest. There are financial, technological literacy, cultural, and physical barriers to entry in video gaming as a market, pass-time or culture. And gamers to a certain point don't have a problem with that, a large portion of them appreciate the sense of sub-cultural exclusivity and wear it as an indicator of identity.  There has been a crisis of identity in the past handful of years, as an internet culture war plays out into all subcultures of the internet. It wasn't that phenomenon like Gamergate was spontaneous acts of an aggressive subculture to a supposed feminist \"agenda\" in gaming journalism. The members of the Gamergate community were just haplessly unaware of the social context their movement had been fostered in. To them the \"GameJournoPros\" Watergate scandal overlooked the revenge content of a post of a scorned ex-partner.\nCorruption in the video game industry comes in various forms: Paid reviews (which was the apparent 'larger problem' with Depression Quest being featured in indie game review articles), Advertisement and promotion deals for gaming journalist websites by game developers (Kane & Lynch Scandal covered by Larry Bundy), conflicts of interest between games journalists and game developers, award ceremonies or other business interests, and so on. So while the post detailed that there was indeed collusion between video games journalists and business interests: To the other subcultures of the web who were aware of other games 'scandals' (Drivergate, and so on) for a revenge post of a young man against a woman trying to promote a socially-positive game to be the straw that broke the camel's back, the culture of the movement had chosen a misogynist hill to die on. The corrupt journalists in question didn't need to contrive a false feminist narrative for other media to pick up, that was the honest perception of people who encountered this scandal along with other gaming scandals in the past that hadn't generated such cultural inertia. The profuse debates and conflicts both online and at gaming conventions turned a movement that began as a set of Twitter hashtags  into a set of tags for Twitter bots to silence accounts with. This drove gamers toward digging in their heels and identifying 'feminist agendas' as the problematic element used to encourage or pardon corruption in their industry, and with that came the constant derision of 'social justice' perspectives in video games. Even if the bulk of Gamergate-identifying members had been genuinely only interested in using the movement as a means to eye-poke gaming journalism for being corrupt (Such as TotalBiscuit, who took part while fighting cancer), what brought the revenge post to their attention initially were archives and screenshots of bitter mgtow members on 4chan who felt the need to propagate the post because it had been 'censored' on more reputable forums. Because the revenge post had picked up this kind of traction, people introduced to it as a 'smoking gun' piece of evidence were socially-informed of its supposed significance. The idea that journalists aren't allowed to or don't convene or speak to each other because that would somehow warp their profession is unseemly. Almost as unseemly as the accusations made against Quinn in the post itself, that somehow the allure of men who can potentially promote a free indie game was simply irresistible to her. The cultural backlash against Depression Quest for supposedly being the motive for this barely significant instance of corruption was immediate and long-lasting, and came to symbolize the kind of game corrupt videogame media would endorse as a form of political insulation. And with this gigantic unpacking of context, you have the social context of Depression Quest within the 'gaming' community. Its consistent 1.6/10 Metacritic score, overall negative Steam reception consist primarily of political commentary. This is despite a consistent smattering of recommendations for the game from self-reported depression sufferers on both platforms.  Taking all of this into account, I wanted to understand the approach Zoey took when creating the game at the heart of a vortex which managed to swallow up the likes of Richard Dawkins, Tim Schafer, and get considered a 'hatewatch' issue by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \nThe profound irony at the heart of all this is that the social issue Depression Quest seeks to address is politically benign. Depression is a mental illness, and like most major categories of mental illness it does not discriminate along a person's social traits. What would the 'agenda' of producing a game that emulates some of the defining features of depression be? \nHaving just completed a third play-through of the game, \nThoughts: \n- The two things I found it did well; incidentally I questioned the deliberate intent behind. I didn't think the game was intentionally funny. \n- The character is a negative stereotyping of people with depression. An unlikeable socially anxious, self-absorbed and chronically dishonest person with no sense of tact. Even if you've suffered depression, identifying with this character seems to just signal the self-berating tendencies of depression. \n- It's not really a choose-your-own adventure because you rarely ever get presented with a choice. \n- The game ends abruptly with a very poor rationale for not writing the game a proper ending.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519679697, "timestamp_updated": 1519679697, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509770214557647705", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "40313476": {"recommendationid": "40313476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198812555270", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1589511937}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Spreading Mental Health Awareness[/h1]\n\nAs someone dealing with anxiety and depression, this text-based game is spot on.

It's not much of a game, to be honest. The mechanics, however, are well executed as is. Apart from this, playing the game really makes you know how depression works. It makes you frustrated. The main character doesn't have energy for everything, sometimes he just can't do something even if you previously chose the \"right\" thing to do, and that's the beauty; it's how depression works.\n\n[b]Story: 7/10[/b]\nThe story follows a man with girlfriend, boring job and a loving family. The struggle with depression is real, as you encounter different kind of social encounters, and all that is very exhausting for the main character. The story can go to very different directions depending on how you guide the MC. The story feels real, but so far, all the stories have felt too short. I wish there would have been more. The story could be better, but it delivers the message.\n\n[b]Over-all enjoyment 8/10[/b]\nThis is not a game to \"enjoy\" exactly, but it does make you feel sad and frustrated and, well, depressed.

Something that I have often seen is someone present a work that is deeply personal to them but without the needed self honesty and reflection for it to be anything more than pretentious. What I mean is that they come with a work that they believe is perfectly profound and meaningful in such a way that is rarely seen and it goes over like a wet fart. It's not to say something personal can't be done or done well but this student film style pomp is the sign of something that is not done baking as a creative.\n\nThis is a story that was not critically looked at by someone who did not at some level feel it was profound.

Instead it feels without direction and character.

However, personally I feel that there are some choices missing and consequences were under-played (maybe because me not being able to read as the writer would have wanted as I just mentioned). I also feel like some greyed out options could have been left open and other scenarios could have been written depending on your chracter's mood. Like for example, right now, depending on the mood you enter a scene, you have options available and I feel like more could have been enabled but with more disastrous consequences if your mood wasn't up for it. In short, I think this game lacks some depth (option and writing), but we are all entitled to our own opinions. I didn't want to write a review for this game at frist but then I thought I should because this game deserves to be played (even if I am not recommending it). Take it as a story, accept that your choices are only there to give you different possible outcomes and not to make you choose how the story develops and then feel good or bad about it later, and then it's enjoyable. This lack of depth and necessary state of mind to go through this is why I said it does not deliver what it promises and why I am not recommending it. It is nevertheless a good story, and I even played it twice to get a different outcome and see how it plays out, so I actually recommend it in a way if you know what you are getting into. This is actually quite short, took me exactly 96 minutes (yes, I get the joke) to get through it twice.\n\nAlso, if you want a similar game but way better in delivering what it stands for and with graphics, go check out Actual Sunlight. I played it on mobile a while back and it is way better but not free. And I also want to add that I have nothing to do with Actual Sunlight or anyone related (just your average consumer who played the game).\n\np.s. There is no save system. You will have to start over if you quit (not much of a problem if you remember your choices).", "timestamp_created": 1512937659, "timestamp_updated": 1512937659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38198522": {"recommendationid": "38198522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321634414", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1509236618}, "language": "english", "review": "gucci", "timestamp_created": 1512876401, "timestamp_updated": 1512876401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38196926": {"recommendationid": "38196926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189329297", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1577065879}, "language": "english", "review": "saw this game had made polygon's list of 500 best video games so I gave it a go.

There are times in the VN that I think are just the MC dealing with depressing times than actual depression. And even when depression does hit, it doesn't carry the intensity of an actually depressive episode. Though decent with its idea, the game almost trivializes the weight of some depressive episodes. Like when during a bout of depression, are still given the option to call somebody or go outside, when in reality depression just saps everything from you that from personal experience, I just choose to sleep in.\n\nI can understand the idea of the negative spiral, almost being on the receiving end myself if it weren't for intervention from the people around me and the understanding of some of my professors. Though the emphasis on how it truly feels to be in a depressive state isn't well done, the problems it poses when it comes to human relationships is definitely true. The episode where you just sleep in after work, and wake up to see missed calls, messages and just been unable to reply from exhaustion really is something that does occur. And depending on the individual, can range from a sense of emptiness in knowing that you missed out on some conversation, to the continued depression of feeling that you weren't present in the lives of your friends.\n\nAnd if your friends do know about your condition, the VN does try to show the problem of being friends with us. We try to be good friends, and we legitimately feel worried if we are burdens because of the unpredictability of our depressive episodes. But we still do crave human relations even if we dont always know how to go about doing so. Most of the time, our depression does get the better of us and we breakdown, being unable to even muster the strength to call somebody or anybody for that matter, because we feel incapable of even expressing ourselves. We even feel like there is no point to self-expression since during such a mental state, we feel like there is nothing we can do.\n\nAs for social situations, not everyone that is depressed is so hopelessly useless in making friends. We are capable of having fun and meeting the people close to us, just not when we have depression. Some of us are even good social liars, we can tell people that we are fine, we even look like it, which is why the condition is dangerous. Because sometimes we don't want the people around us to know, or worry, or have to walk on eggshells around us just to accomodate us. We really just want to be treated like your friends, like people. Not some mental crutch you have to \"accomodate\", which just makes us feel worse.\n\nWe aren't that fragile, we aren't so socially hopeless. We just have times where our proverbial shit hits the fan. Yes, severe cases or instances of depression do hit us. We sometimes cry during our sleep, have nightmares about things when we wake up. Depression can cause us to go into anxiety attacks about our inability to do anything. But they aren't always triggered by something. This VN gives off the impression of melancholy and general sad circumstances of depression, that it seems all pervasive but its actually not.\n\nI have a manic-depressive disorder. Under the DSM-5 its considered type II Bipolar Disorder, which I had and was discovered by a professor whom noticed certain trends in my behavior. Despite that, I was not and have not been on medication or treatment for the majority of my life. Yes I was different, but I have had friends, I have had happy moments, but they are at times marred by an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and emptiness at times. During negative bouts, I try to sleep in though your mind at times becomes overactive. You might second guess yourself and the actions around you, you become hypersensitive to spoken words and think that its all negative comments about you. You can tune out the entire world for even weeks at a time, not going to lecture and dragging your ass to tutorials because you know you have to despite feeling like its utterly pointless. Its not entirely debilitating though I have missed an exam during one extremely emotionally taxing episode of depression which lasted about a week during my second year. But, I have completed my studies with close to a first-class honours. We are not as hopeless as portrayed in this VN, but the condition is not to be trivialized.\n\nWe do have suicidal thoughts during really bad times because we feel incapable of handling the complex feelings we have. We sometimes think if we died, would anyone really care at all. Maybe everyone would be happier if I wasn't around. Yes we do think that despite having rational minds. Depression can screw with our logical thinking eventhough some of us even studied formal mathematical logic in our university. Here is the catch, despite being good students, getting good grades, having a good family, having a loving partner, we WILL STILL experience depression. Its an inability to be happy and marred with debilitating melancholy that characterizes depression. It will hit without warning, without triggering, with no sense of timing. My ability to write this is because I am not in a depressive state right now.\n\nWhich is why I have to write this review. Its not informed enough as a VN to talk about depression. The danger is not the diagnosis of depression. Its the mismanagement of it. Its when people like us, whom when unfortunate enough to go through severe instances of depressive episodes have NO means to recourse, that things can go really bad. I don't have such an extremely debilitating case of depression that its entirely like the MC, but from personal experience of the worse of my depressive episodes, it can be like it. But the characterization is just wrong, like when given the option to do X or Y during depression, we just dont feel it. Our minds cannot handle the decision in very bad situations, and we shutdown, opting to tune out everything. We forget to eat, we forget to call, do work, play... etc... We just try to pass the day. Almost like a comatose state, which I have personally went through. It goes through tears and unimaginable grief at seemingly pointless things, our brains just think of everything that went wrong, will go wrong, the problems we cause others until the proverbial snap, and we just need to be alone.\n\nThen, it is in those moments of our vulnerability that people recognize as depression. Its something that literally feels like its manipulating our minds, forcing us to do things we wouldn't do when outside of it. We don't ALWAYS have depression, it just hits us like a truck randomly for extended periods of time. Yes it can be hard, but the MC seems to be dealing with a really severe case of Depression, mixed in with social anxiety. But it could equally be from both the sad circumstances and mental condition. Maybe this is the kind of thing that the developer thought could get the message across, but depression is too complex a mental condition to just put into a game. Its something that needs to be handled with waaaay more tact and complexity than just this game. I can understand the good intentions coming from it, but it just doesn't put across the real problems depressives face, and instead puts it from too much of an external perspective to really be trying to bring the experience of depression to the player.", "timestamp_created": 1512567545, "timestamp_updated": 1512567545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38034667": {"recommendationid": "38034667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295650124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1466535989}, "language": "english", "review": "bwahahaha zoe quinn eternally btfo how can she ever recover", "timestamp_created": 1512311792, "timestamp_updated": 1512311792, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.344938725233078003", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38023512": {"recommendationid": "38023512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255283116", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 39, "last_played": 1534008044}, "language": "english", "review": "Given that it was one of the first of its kind, it's a pretty decent game.

I have moral objections to the carelessness with which it approached its subject.\n\nI find Depression Quest to be harmful for the cause it attempts to defend. Depression Quest is bad not for depressives but for anyone who would wish to inform themselves about depression by playing an educational game based on it.\n\nI did not initially get very far in Depression Quest, I was actively repulsed by it within minutes and I was forced to come back to it a few times. This is not due to its hamhanded, burdened writing, but because Depression Quest stated in its writing and what little gameplay I was subjected to that it is not interested in educating anyone about depression.\n\nIn the introductory page of Depression Quest, the game states that \u201c[Depression Quest\u2019s goal is]\u2026 to illustrate as clearly as possible what depression is like, so that it may be better understood by people without depression\u2026\u201d  \n\nThe player is then introduced by the main character who is represented by \u201cyou\u201d. Here is where the game may have needed a deeper examination in the writing stage.\n\nDepression Quest is an interactive fiction, much like a choose-your-own-adventure book. This means that by referring to the character as \u201cyou\u201d (which will then be internalized as \u201cme\u201d or \u201cI\u201d), the game necessarily has to be the one telling you how you feel. Consequently, the game saddles itself in the uncomfortable, frustrating space between allowing yourself to feel your own emotions and empathizing with another person\u2019s story. Instead of learning about depression by relating to the experiences of another or by making your own informed decisions based on the situation at hand, \u201cyou\u201d are handed thoughts and emotions and forced to make decisions based on what you are told that you feel.\n\nAt best, this is merely bad writing and bad game design. To be told that one is depressed without any true sense of context (not that real life depression needs context to exist, but we\u2019ll get back to that) and then limit a player\u2019s options based on said depression is frustrating and unintuitive. The very first choice given to the player has visibly cut off the most positive action that can be taken because of a prescribed emotion that has been saddled on the player. This is maddening because the other three options are extremely negative, depressing options. \n\nAt worst, however, this informs a calloused, offensive view of depression. Where the stated goal is to inform others about what depression feels like, the game is not only tight-lipped but dictatorial about emotions. On the surface, this would seem to be what depression means, but when a player is forced to empathize with nothingness, where emotions are prescribed and positivity is blocked off without the slightest hint of context beyond a tedious, menial job, the player who will, by their nature, be fighting against the boundaries of the game will be filled with one thought\u2026\n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t this person just cheer up?\u201d\n\nAnyone who cared enough to read the opening introduction to the game will know why this character cannot cheer up, it\u2019s because they have depression, which is a mental illness that prevents cheering up. But I, the player, do not have depression which is why I am playing this game. I am here to learn about depression, but consequently am given a meaningless scenario without context with which one can only hopelessly fight against. Without the buffer and tenderness that empathy to a fleshed out, acting and feeling character can provide, we are only asked to hop into the body of another person, act in their best interests and then be reprimanded for doing so.\n\nSo if Depression Quest doesn\u2019t inform its players about depression or allow them to make choices (again: blocking positive answers such as \u201cshake off your funk and go have a good time with your girlfriend\u201d from usage), what is the substance that takes up Depression Quest\u2019s overly long play time? \n\nThat substance would be vague, unsatisfactory explanations of the general idea of what it is like, not to be depressed, but to be a little sad. Near the start of the game is a sentence that I would like to conclude this little rant by deconstructing. \n\nFirstly, some context. The main character (again: \u201cyou\u201d) are working on a \u201cproject\u201d (never explained either, even in its own explanatory page) that is distracting \u201cyou\u201d from the tedium and meaninglessness of your nine to five job. It is a freelance project with no backing and is simply a personal creative exercise, possibly made to be monetized at some point. It has no deadline and no collaborators.\n\nWhen the main character returns home from work hoping to continue their project (Here, unable to \u201cOrder some food, grab a drink and hunker down for a night of work.\u201d), a form of vague panic begins to creep up on the \u201cplayer\u201d and then the game states that \u201cAll you can think about is how incredibly far behind you are,[\u2026]\u201d and that the work seems insurmountable.\n\nLet\u2019s take that sentence apart.\n\n\u201cAll\u201d, all means entirety. A sum. \u201cYou\u201d. Ascribing this entirety to me only after a few pages of contextless description. \u201cCan\u201d, ability to. \u201cthink about\u201d. By saying \u201cAll you can think about\u2026\u201d, the creator is in fact stating that the player is helpless behind this vague mental blockage (described only as \u201cpanic\u201d). The second half of that statement \u201chow incredibly far behind you are\u201d is nonsense. This is clearly not a project with a deadline or true obligation (\u201cYou started this project some months ago and have, miraculously, managed to keep at it.\u201d), thus \u201cfar behind\u201d is a concept that exists only in the mind of this character who clearly does not represent me.\n\n\u201cAll you can think about is how incredibly far behind you are\u2026\u201d is a damning phrase that tellingly states that the player is not only unable to surmount this vague, unnoble emotion that has been forcefully given to them, but also in that submission, they exist only at the behest of complete nonsense that doesn\u2019t exist in the mind of the player or even the main character but rather the creator who believes that simply describing his/her actions and thoughts and not the concepts that inform them is enough to make someone finally understand what it is truly like to be depressed.\n\nDepression is a tough thing. It is not sadness or strife as described by Papers, Please or Spec Ops: The Line. It can come without warning. It can manipulate your life and remove any form of agency from your actions. People who have not suffered depression may not understand what that\u2019s like. It needs to be handled with greater care and understanding than the simple act of describing sadness.\n\nImagine if I were enacting an emotional exercise with another person. Imagine I told this person that they were depressed, but that taking certain actions may help them become less depressed. This person then tells me that they would like to go out for ice cream to alleviate their depression.\n\nIf I told this person that depression simply doesn\u2019t work like that and all they get to do, all they are able to do, without any explanation, is go home and waste away in front of the television, would I not be grossly oversimplifying a state of mental illness?\n\nWould I not be providing a disservice to anyone who suffers clinical depression by trivializing their experiences?\n\nWould that not be a wrongheaded, self-indulgent, callous and hurtful way to describe a serious, harmful psychological state of being?\n\nI am not accusing the creator of being insensitive. I am accusing the creator of being indulgent. Depression, being the bilious virus it is, demands more care than its creator was willing to provide.\n\nThat\u2019s not evil or malicious. It\u2019s simply a shame", "timestamp_created": 1505798187, "timestamp_updated": 1576611040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746368169784545898", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35036399": {"recommendationid": "35036399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037569578", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1505652494}, "language": "english", "review": "10/kms Even the depressed one has a better life than mine's", "timestamp_created": 1505696848, "timestamp_updated": 1505696848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586474299430847168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35025455": {"recommendationid": "35025455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145307786", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1505604551}, "language": "english", "review": "Depression Quest is an interactive novel \u2013 nothing less, nothing more. It does not have any gameplay nor challenging riddles that will put one's mettle to the test. Moreover, it is not a be-all and end-all guide to depression but it does not claim to be. It is made clear by the authors that the sickness varies from person to person, hence it is an impossible task to describe every type of it. I, for one, believe that the story is universal enough to convey the message well \u2013 that no matter how well-off one might be, it can happen to anyone from all walks of life.\n\nThe game looks like this: a few photographs at the top of the page, a wall of text in the middle with hyperlinks (additional information in the beginning, going to the next page, and making choices), and three bars at the bottom informing the player about the character's mental state, whether they attend a therapy and supplement it with medication or not. Personally, I am not fond of the bars but they do not get in the way and one can simply ignore them. There's also a monotonous soundtrack with sparse instrumentation and a couple of sounds added depending on the context. The writing is decent for the most part, albeit with minor mistakes here and there, and it is paced rather well. However, I absolutely love one thing they did: many of the options are crossed out, depending on your state. I reckon this is a neat mechanic that illustrates well what depressed people have to go through \u2013 they [i]know[/i] what is the right thing to do but they lack the energy and motivation to make it happen.\n\nThe game has a number of endings and a few ways to get there so there is no one way to \"win\" it. My only complaints are that the novel ends rather abruptly and there is a major inconsequence one can possibly encounter when exploring one of the ways. Other than that, it is a decent novel, [strike]absolutely worth the price[/strike]. However, understanding depression is not an easy task so one has to be open-minded in order to get what the novel is really about.\n\nP.S.

It may not represent everyone's experience of depression but it is highly accurate for some people (and the protagonist explicitly has severe motivational issues).

Depression Quest does just that, only with regards to depression. \n\nIt teaches people all the wrong lessons. For example:\n\n1. You have no control whatsoever over your life and your decisions once you are depressed\n2. Opening up to other people or family members is counterproductive\n3. Seeking professional mental health isn't something that helps. (On my 1st playthrough the game openly prevented you from doing that. It was a choice that is crossed out and I was not allowed to pick it. During my second playthrough I was able to pick it and even took medication.  Guess what - it had no visible effect on anything, same ending, same situations etc.\n4. The choices you make are in the end meaningless\n\nAll this puts the player into a mindset of learned helplessness (it is an actual psychological term, feel free to look it up), which is arguably the worst and least effective posture you can adopt when dealing with depression.\n\nOn the technical aspects and plot of the game \u2014 the writing wasn't horrible, but nothing to write home about either. Character development was nonexistent and the characters were shallow and stereotypical. The characters were easily the worst parts of the narrative. For example: the author intends to present a girlfriend of the player character as nice and loving, but she inadvertently comes off as pretentious and tacky. Ending the character's relationship with her was the only good decision that the game allowed me to make (obviously wasn't the author's intent).\n\nTo make one thing clear: I'm not depressed, but I do have an academic background in psychology. This game has a great premise and and tackles a very important subject and I want to applaud that. \nHowever, that alone doesn't make a good game. The execution is bad and the underlying psychological assumptions are just wrong. It is not a game that teaches you how to deal with depression, rather it teaches you how to stay depressed forever.\n\nI can't recommend it to people with depression, nor to people who want to learn about it, nor to psychology students. It is a counterproductive, bad game that does not reflect the scientific insights that modern psychology provides when dealing with the serious mental disorder that is depression. \n\nBig thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1495826874, "timestamp_updated": 1624181317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784973680973052979", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31974624": {"recommendationid": "31974624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274199893", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 100, "last_played": 1495808894}, "language": "english", "review": "It's an awesome story game !

This game assumes the worse case scenario for using energy conservation strategies. \n\nFrom the persepective of the author this game makes sense, but the subjectivity of depression will not mesh well with the conformity crowd as clearly seen by the public's ignorant responses.  \n\nI recommend it in the context of understanding a perspective instead of acheiving some abstract/meaningless goal (regular video games).", "timestamp_created": 1493613327, "timestamp_updated": 1493613327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31431677": {"recommendationid": "31431677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055432142", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1493440223}, "language": "english", "review": "First off: I am very well aware of the drama surrounding this peace of work, I as many other people who participated in #GamerGate think that Zoey Quinn, the devolper of this game, is a despicable person. Never the less a game should be judged on it's own merits, not the personality of it's creators. And thus I recommend this game for a very small niche of gamers.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a highly subjective review, it covers a topic many will find very emotional, including me.\n\nThis \"game\" is surprisingly good. \n\nIt's a text based, slice of life, rpg where you play a not very relatable character.\n\nBut as I said in the beginning it is suprisingly good. It's well written and the situations the player's character finds himself are relatable, even if the character's reaction often are not. If you do not struggle with depression yourself this game will not be of much value to you. But for me the game was able to stirr some emotions. That's a feat in and off itself. I made me go from \"this guy is whiney b***h\" over laughter at situations involving a cat that might not have been that funny, but I laughed anyway, to legitimately making me cry.\n\nAs with all games of this genre it's meat and bones are the supporting cast of characters. And this game has some.\n\n\nAlex, the main character's girlfriend stands out in particular. To me at least. She is a well written, loving girlfriend. Even though she comes of as being an idealised version of one, never the less she hit just the right emotional spot for me.\nBut that might have to do with me having gone through a rather bad break up a few months ago. \n\nThe older brother Malcolm is another great character. He is the kind of older brother I strive to be, again just the right emotional spot.\n\nI don't use numerical rating systems, and I don't think this piece of work might even be able to fit one. So all I an say is: Feel free to try this game out for youself, it's freeware after all. I don't think you will get the same emotional reaction out of it but you might find something enjoyable in it.", "timestamp_created": 1493442038, "timestamp_updated": 1493442038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519255757331848145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31427996": {"recommendationid": "31427996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030715955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1509417126}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, unsurprizingly, depressing.", "timestamp_created": 1493426033, "timestamp_updated": 1493426034, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425249189138412476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31426872": {"recommendationid": "31426872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038938031", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1493421116}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a game.

It is neither fun nor educational as it demonstrates only what it might be like, for some people, to have higher than normal levels of social anxiety, but does not accurately portray living with depression, and it reads at a teen fanfiction level which makes the limited options even more frustrating.

Go on and play.)\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to tell those considering downloading Depression Quest this: Depression Quest is not a game. Depression Quest is an experience, aiming to help people understand the trials and tribulations that come with depression. At this, it does an incredible job. In all the stories I've read, all the games I've played, and in all my experiences watching someone try to explain what depression is like, Depression Quest is one of the most realistic representations I've seen.\n\nThe music used sets a somber tone, that pulls you into the lethargic, dreary state that the protagonist is in for most of the \"game\" (depending on how you play.) This only furthers it's ability to connect you to the protagonist. In this, mixed with the simplistic, yet elaborate backstories of nearly all the charcters and the seemingly devastating amount of stress placed on each decision, the creators have made a beautiful piece of art.\n\nMany people, as I have seen in the reviews and online forums, have spoken about it sometimes being \"dramatic,\" or \"over-done,\" but it's really not. Depression is different for everyone. What could seem dramatic in Depression Quest, would be paradise to someone suffering from extreme, heavy-set depression.\n\nSo in the end, I implore you to play this. It's an amazing experience, and you will not be disappointed afterward.\nYou might not by happy. You might even be sad, or upset.

While the phrasing can be a little awkward at times (\"You are a mid-twenties human being\"), it's a good read if you have around half an hour. I'd say give it a go.\n\nSome of the criticism of this game is valid: \nIf you don't like reading, this game is not for you. The way depression is portrayed is a little simplistic, and characters seem a little too supportive at times, which is usually not the case in reality. The cross-off mechanic that prevents you from accessing certain options seems restrictive. At least in my experience, depression doesn't really work like that. It might be interesting to try to attempt something unreasonable and be worse off for it. Also, having a depression indicator is a little on-the-nose; players should be able to judge for themselves. The UI could also be a little more interesting in general.\n\nOn the other hand:\nDespite what I said earlier, the game does an okay of job of portraying the battle with depression. The characters are very supportive and the game encourages looking for professional help and reaching out to those who care, which is good advice. It's not too long, it's free, and provides an interesting insight into depression, if nothing else. \n\nAlso:\nSome of the other criticism is very unfair. It really isn't the \"worst thing ever\" as some seem to be making it out to be. It's not that fun, but neither is dealing with depression.

I ended up putting my feet into the shoes of the main character and ended up making choices on what I would do instead of what i thought was best for him. Some scenarios seem to have a correct answer, but it's important to understand how it would make the character feel.\n\nIn short, this \"game\" captures depression in a fairly accurate light and helps to understand what the daily routine is. The story is stunning and even feels like a crawl. as if everything your doing is pointless as the days keep ticking by.\n\nFor those who wish to learn about depression this is a good place to come.  although this can also be fairly trigging to those who do suffer. It can help show you the advantages and disadvantages of anti-depressents and what the health care system can provide. \n\nIn short, a solid 8.8/10 for me.

Te introduce en un bucle que cuanto mas se ejecuta m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es salir del mismo porque genera pasividad ante el problema y falta de motivaciones.

It's a topic that is hard to talk about and certainly carries a heavy stigma.\n\nDepression Quest leads you through a series of decisions that influence the life of the character you play as. You are not named or gendered, which allows for any player to project themselves into the role of the main character. You deal with working to make ends meet, maintaining romantic relationships, and maintaining relationships with your family. I've only played through once, but it seems to be a game with many different results based off of your decisions. \n\nThe stated purpose of the game is to let the player have a better understanding of depression, or at least how the developers have faced depression. I think this is done quite well. As someone who has been through a major depressive stint, the game hit close to home. In particular I found the elimination of choices to be one of the most well done aspects of the game. The answer that's usually perceived as the way out or the most healthy choice is crossed out. In this way, you are shown the option, you contemplate it, but ultimately cannot do it. Simply put, it's hard to translate a depressive mindset into a choice based game, but I found it to be done well.\n\nHowever, as someone who has faced a lot of these issues of depression, it is somewhat difficult to play the game. I'm glad that there was a warning in the beginning telling people that the game is, well, depressing in nature. Particularly, I found it interesting in that now as someone who has been getting help, I see the logical errors in a lot of the depressive cycles and decisions the character makes. It's always saddening to see the options that worked for me crossed off.\n\nIn this way, I think the game illustrates its point very well. However, its hard to recommend in a lot of ways. I think its eye opening certainly, but its hard to want people to go through a lot of the sobering decisions.

That's not good.\n\nTo put this in perspective, a few weeks ago, I had to play a few text based adventures made by my classmates. The developers were (are) not yet professionals, and some of their games were better than others. However, they were all written in a very similar format to Depression Quest. Very rarely did I slip into a daydream, or wish I was doing something else, when playing my peers' games, something I cannot say for Depression Quest.\n\nSelf insertion characters, as well as depressed characters, are very hard to write. I should know. I have written characters who have mental illnesses, or have just been down on their luck. I had to rewrite them all several times to keep them likable, realistic, and sympathetic. But the narrative keeps beating me over the head with how depressed the protagonist is. It's pretty much their only character trait. The secret to writing self instertion characters is to give them a backstory and personality of their own. I'm pretty sure Depression Quest Protagonist has a backstory, but a very shallow personality.\n\nI'm not overly fond of the piano either. I don't claim to know much about proper music, so to get an idea of how to compose a better piano score, just play Long Live the Queen. It manages to express a wide range of emotions with just the one instrument. (And that game was also developed by a predominantly female crew. :) )\n\nHowever, I'm going to give credit where it's due.

I\u2019m an inexperienced programing student and I\u2019m currently studying the concept of game feels and game play aesthetics.\n Depression Quest is an incredible narrative game with a powerful story, this choose you own adventure style game is definitely not for everyone and tell its story through the interactions and choices made by the player, it puts the player into a very dark frame of mind and gives them a taste of what depression is like for some people, this game is not designed to say \u201cthis is how depression feels for everyone\u201d these Indi games are excellent examples of how extremely touchy subjects can be explained to people through the power of games. I loved the use of visuals and sounds that set the sense of pressure bearing down on the player, and the amazing way the game forces the player to make very irrational decisions which in turn effects the player more and more as time progresses. This game has been designed to allow the player to step into someone else\u2019s shoes and be immersed in another person\u2019s reality and it can be hard, people generally don\u2019t want to play a game that will make them depressed but I strongly recommend this game, games such as Depression quest and dys4ia can allow a person to gain insight into another life and help you grow and a person. \nSome quotes of the game like- (you are severely depressed. Your moderation levels are nonexistent. You alternate between feeling totally apathetic to panicking about things out of you control. You lack energy to do much more then to sleep the days away yet you constantly feel worthless prevent you from getting any actual rest. You feel like dyeing but ironically are to drain to actually act on these feelings.)  Hits close to home and dills in the fact that this game is not for fun, it\u2019s not for adventure, it is a tool for learning and a treasure trove of emotion, Depression Quest describe how hard it is for family and friends to understand mental illness. This game starts in the middle of the main characters life and allows you to make choices on how to handle everyday situations such as work, social activities, pet companionship and relationships, each and every choice you make can narrow the options and choices you can make later on in the game and inevitably lead you through a panicked stat of mined, there is no real ending to this story, there\u2019s no special combination of choices you can make to gain a happy ending, this is done to show that there is no easy answers and it\u2019s a hard pill to swallow for most people.\nIf you have read to the end I thank you and thank you to the team who developed an incredible game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1477649135, "timestamp_updated": 1477649135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488746374845504761", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "26186727": {"recommendationid": "26186727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239148214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1477316789}, "language": "english", "review": "This may not be a game for everyone but it definitly gives an idea to people without depression of what it's like. altough not everyone with depression has the same story so for some people it can be very different.

For the amazing game, for the beautiful (true) story, and for the incredibly helpful tool it can be to so many people who want (or need!) to get a glimpse of what is it depression all about. \nDaniel", "timestamp_created": 1466548604, "timestamp_updated": 1466548604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489904999732971191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23682588": {"recommendationid": "23682588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062301817", "num_games_owned": 740, "num_reviews": 271, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 144, "last_played": 1455243378}, "language": "english", "review": "Most people disagree with calling Depression Quest a game. While I personnaly think it is and hope we will broaden our definition of games in the next years, let's put that aside. It's not because it does not qualify as a game that this interractive experience must be bad. \n\nI already did a review for this game on my blog and may provide a link for it one day, but for now I'll be concise: it shows amazingly how depression MAY be experienced (there are a whole lot of different experiences, this one represents only some of them). I like how it disables some options depending on your mental state, demonstrating the fact that some people experiencing depression lack initiative. I know it's frustrating for the players, but so is it for those people. If you approach Depression Quest as a \"fun game\", this is a big flaw; if you approach it as a game that tries to convey what it is to be depressed, this is excellent. \n\nIt's full of little details like that that I appreciate, and the writing is good. It might not be award-worthy, but it's easy to read and it puts you in the mood very well without being \"emo\". \n\nThe player may not have full control over the outcomes, but there are still plenty of branching that will make you see a whole different set of texts from one playthrough to the other. Anyway, even when you \"fail\", what follow is interesting and will teach you a lot about depression. You have to play this game in a mood of exploration, of \"read, make a choice, see what happens, learn\", not in a mood of winning, or discovering a fantasy world, etc. That's what we, the players, are used to, and maybe this is why Depression Quest is so hard for us to see as a game, or at least as \"well done\" (for whatever it is). \n\nIt's strange how I've seen games with similar or more risqu\u00e9 concepts get the same praise as this one without all the hate. Really strange...\n\nNote: I didn't really play 7-8 hours. The game was running on my computer while I was away.

You'll be seeing a lot of that in the game. Get used to it.

Still... a free game is a free game, even if I'm late to the party.\nLong story short; you have depression. Life sucks because your character feels trapped between a crappy job, an overachieving brother, unsympathetic parents and an antisocial outlook. The solution is just to keep doing stuff.\n\nSeriously, that's it. Don't stay in bed all day, try to be social, open up to people who understand, find excuses not to be a lazy shit, accept help (maybe don't take the meds?) and lie to your parents who wouldn't understand.\n\n2/10\nDropped a mark for lack of proof reading", "timestamp_created": 1464076089, "timestamp_updated": 1464076089, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470711320638656616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23161911": {"recommendationid": "23161911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082947467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1492534825}, "language": "english", "review": "Having experimented depression myself, this game describes exactly the vicious circle I was trapped in.

It's lightweight and there's not a whole lot going on with it. \n\nIt's also free, as in zero dollars, and you can delete it if you don't enjoy it. At $5 or even $2 I feel like I'd be giving a bad review since there isn't a lot of content here but for zero nothings it's a neat thing. \n\nThe developer makes a clear note at the beginning of the game that this is not supposed to define depression or be exactly like any one person's battle with it, however I did find myself almost eerily relating to it at times. \n\nI thought a very cool part of the game was how you were not allowed to select the \"best\" option. For instance, it gives you the choice of \"Go to the part reluctantly\" and \"Stay home\" but you cannot select \"get over it and go and have a good time\" because from this person's persepctive, that's not even a possible option. I relate. \n\nIt is mostly pretty well-written, not amazing. Simple language and vague details I suppose in effort to make it more relatable. \n\nThe music is okay, nothing special, but you can switch it off if it irritates you. \n\nThe game is very short, I played through the story in about 20 minutes and I am not a particularly fast reader. I tried a second arc where I picked all the \"worst\" options and while much of it was the same it did provide some different results and a different ending. \n\nI will agree that there's not much to this game, it's short and overly simple. \n\nHowever, I found it relatable and at the whopping price tag of free I think it's neat. \n\nIf you're looking for action-packed adventure, this is not even vaguely close. \n\nIf you're looking for a robust and detailed game, again, not for you. \n\nBut if you take a look at the screenshots and read the description of the game and it sounds interesting to you, it probably will be. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461356536, "timestamp_updated": 1461356536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479797959327697754",

Despite the short amount of time it took to complete, it felt like an eternity.\n\nI wanted to give it a fair chance, but there was no game here. The design of the game is just lazy. It's so bland and uninteresting to look at that I really couldn't focus on the story. It's white background, with black text, and a picture on top that pertains to the story.\n\nWhenever I could actually look at what was going on, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of originality of the situation I was in. The story is that I have a girlfriend and family who all love me and are concerned about my depression. WHOOP-DEE-DOO!!! I got excited when someone gave me a kitten. I thought that would make it a good game, but the cat POSSIBLY only shows up one other time. There was no connection with any of the characters really since they're all nothing more than cliches.\n\nThe game has a total of ONE TRACK of a short piano piece on a loop. There will be background noises sometimes depending on the area which can make this short track even more annoying than it actually is. I would go insane listening to it as I merely got the gist of what was going on. I can't imagine what would happen if I took the time to go over all the details.\n\nThe whole thing about this game is making choices. It doesn't matter how many choices the GAME says there are because in reality there are only two every time. There can be 6 choices the GAME gives you, but there are really only two. It lists some options only to cross them out because you're \"TOO DEPRESSED\" which is just the most infuriating thing a game about choices can do. I understand my character is depressed, but don't tell me you're restricting my options because of this. Depression doesn't mean incapable of choosing to do enjoyable things. Depression doesn't make some options impossible, but it does make some options more difficult to make because of the emotional weight that just doesn't seem like something to bring around other people. The choices that were presented in this game seemed like they were made to guide the player towards one over the others. I can't choose the crossed out option, but I can choose the option that's the crossed out option with different words. The obvious right option sometimes is actually not always the obvious right option for someone who isn't depressed. The writers basically assume that this is how a normal life should be and anyone who isn't living like this is depressed. I don't have time for parties, internet interaction, and Netflix with a girlfriend when MY JOB is on the line. Depression should have nothing to do with that. Do my choices really matter? Only when it comes down to choosing to see a therapist and taking medicine is when it truly matters. The game is always telling you that you're not doing those things, so obviously the player can deduce that those are the things that must be done in order to win the game. In the real world a therapist and medication does NOT fix all cases of depression. Sometimes these things cause people to become more lost and more depressed.\n\nI do not believe that this game depicts depression exactly. There are many ways people can struggle with depression and I've only seen one very generic and uneducated depiction in Depression Quest. The writing is made to make your character obviously sad when sometimes it's not always so obvious even to those affected by this terrible state of mind. I, along with some of the other reviewers here, have struggled with depression and know how it feels. The game gives a trigger warning to anyone who has been depressed that this game might be too real and may emulate our own lives too well. IT DOES NOT!!! If anything it offends and belittles anyone in this very serious condition. I know it wasn't their intention to do so, but that's how I feel about it.\n\nDepression Quest is a pretentious way of bring attention to this issue. I'm not even happy that some of the money they receive to support this game goes to the Suicide Hotline. It should ALL go to the Suicide Hotline. It's insulting to think how these people have made money off of this. At the very least, it is at the least totally free if we choose it to be that way.\n\n1/10 since it was free.

Things like complaining that not all reaction options are available or criticizing an allegedly clich\u00e9e or cheesy or pretentious writing or how the music is dull and repetitive shows a horrifying lack of empathy, a refusal to see and experience a situation from someone else's viewpoint or to even look at it; upset of not being handed an I-win-button, annoyed by discomfort, by the game tucking at things suppressed in the psyche.\n\nI suspect that at least some of the negative reviewers who claim they have been through depression themselves and this game is no good for portraying that have merely been 'successfully' conditioned into dealing with an uncaring world by becoming more uncaring themselves. Because if you can't stand the pain anymore, you have to become the pain. But everybody just becoming as egotistical as the society that affects them is not a solution, but the very expression of the problem.\n\nThe general emotional experience of the player character I can relate to a lot, while many situational elements not, but that doesn't matter. This game is art in that it conveys an experience to the player, so I guess it is only natural that all those who are fueling the problem will not like it. This game is like an enactment, through showing the mirror and making people attack their projection or focus on evasion points.\n\nIts high negative review ratio is like a representative for the emotional distance and uncaring that depressed people might have to deal with every day.\n\nIt was easy for me to come to a very positive outcome, just by choosing what I would have chosen in a real situation, not even the supposedly strongest, ideal decisions (if there even is one, because everything has up- and downsides). The player character is relatively lucky. Other people might not have any of the potentially positive influences available to tap into. For them it might be a losing game from the start. Unless we change that.\n\nIf the negative critique points mentioned are your grievances, too, then take that as a sign that you are not helping with your current mindset. And maybe I shouldn't even say mindset, because as this game conveys quite well, the mind alone cannot solve problems of the heart. It is caring and the will to make an effort for a better world, to accept inconveniences based on empathy for others, that solves such problems. And that requires a certain amount of courage. Not so much the kind of courage that makes the warrior wield a sword against a foe, but the kind that makes him cut out a parasite from his own body.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Dowlphin/status/704736089823645703\nAll the mind can do is square the circle, but it can never remove the sharp edges that cause injury.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Dowlphin/status/701880481181208578\nTrue caring hurts.\nThat's why it's unpopular.", "timestamp_created": 1456857185, "timestamp_updated": 1457130113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555239975452423096", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21565435": {"recommendationid": "21565435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064692925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 107, "last_played": 1456689636}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that you play as a man who is depressive.

The game says that our character has social anxiety, so how he made a girlfriend. Maybe we can say the girlfriend found our character, not our character found her. Then it's okay with me.

In that it was successful, although this also led to some trepidation before playing - as a sufferer, I didn't feel the need to revisit what I already experience, especially as it was very likely to remind me of my own difficulties.\n\nI gave it a shot, mostly because I'm at a point where I felt I could explore this theme, and I wanted to see how others have handled expressing it. For me, in my play through, I was pleasantly surprised. I started by making the choices that I knew I would make in real life, and that led downward. But then I started doing what I knew I should do - seeing the therapist, taking medication, confiding in friends - and as you do that, the game rewards you by showing you that those choices can help. It was oversimplified, but close enough to real to be encouraging.\n\nWith that said, I'm not sure that this is a game that will help sufferers, but I gather that wasn't its intended role. I remain nervous that choosing the wrong options could lead you to the conclusion that you are stuck with depression, and accordingly I think I'll remain with this one play through for a bit. However, the settings are close enough to real that it might help non-sufferers to understand a tiny bit of what depression can feel like, and maybe help everyone understand that there are ways out. And this seems like a very good thing.\n\nOverall, after months of being wary, I'm glad I finally found the time to play it through.

Big time. A lot of the thought processes, situations, and dialogue that are used in this 'game' are somewhat relatable to some of my own experiences. The not feeling good enough for your partner, being emotionally exhausted, having to pep yourself up for menial activities...It's a lot more difficult than people realize, and I will give some credit to Depression Quest for trying to shed some light on that, for the small hints of it that are there. \n\nHowever, while I understand what this was trying to accomplish, there are better ways of doing so. This is not a game. It is an interactive journal essentially. It is trying to be a new-age look into a 'deep' soul that ends up sounding very pretentious. I just know most people do not want to sit and read walls of text(s) of sad things, which is probably one of the major reasons Depression Quest has been so negatively received. There's also the fact that the story overall really isn't even that engaging. I started skipping over entries after the seventh one and just clicked the most positive options to get to the end. I also can't stand the title. As another reviewer stated, Depression is not a 'quest' where you get a nice little reward for making it to the end. It's draining and exhausting. It's learning how to cope and when you think everything is fine and figured out, the rules change again for no reason. Basically, it's not nearly as straight-forward as this 'groundbreaking game' claims to be.\n\nI read a bit on Zoe Quinn and her desire to create a more straight-forward game because all the ones dealing with Depression are more metaphorical and about symbolism (which I prefer personally).

Not that depression is fun but the fact that your choices affected you in different ways. I saw a review that read something like \"this is kinda a slap in the face, I have depression\" and at first I kinda agreed but there was nothing that really bashed on depression or made light or fun of it. the morale of the story is to fight depression instead of letting it keep you from living.

So while it does fall short in terms of length and actual gameplay, it at least makes a effort to try and emulate the real ways that depression slowly eats away at you like a crippling disease.\n\nThe fact is that in the end it actually displays the effects of depression better than most other games, movies, and TV shows. Because depression is a monster in your closet that you can't ever be rid of. No matter how much people say things like \"Just go get help\" or \"Do something to not be depressed\", that's just not possible because that beast called depression will always be in the back of your mind chewing on your thoughts and making it seem like every possible choice will just make you a burden on others. Often people suffering from depression will never seek help, and the best help they can receive is by their friends and family noticing the problem and getting them that help (sometimes whether they want it or not).\n\nTo sum up:\n\nGameplay: 3/10 (Pretty much non-existing)\n\nStory: 5/10 (Could be much longer and more compelling)\n\nExperience: 10/10 (For anyone who has actually experienced real depression and been diagnosed, this game may or may not be relatible to your own experiences)\n\nFun: 0/10 (This game is about depression and doesn't have a happy ending)\n\nWorth it?

I myself have been diagnosed and struggle with clinical (or major) depression. I downloaded and played through the game today, read all of the note from the producers in about 1 1/2. My experience, and the choices that I chose throughout the game really helped me connect with the same behaivors, and the impact of my choices in real life. While the game itself may not be for everyone- and may insult or desenitize others with depression or similar diagnosis- I would say it in my mind very similar to what I myself have experienced as a person diagnosed with Depression. \n\nI would simply like to thank the producers for their involvement in this project, and while I may not ever touch this game again, I would recomend it to some friends- their outcomes, their resolutions may not go well, but maybe they might just be able to grasp how difficult depression can be to handle from day to day. One choice can affect everything, making positive choices- even when you feel empty, guilty, hurt, embarrest- like you are a failure or ugly inside, and don't know how to tell anyone else- That is one of the hardest things to do. No ammount of telling someone to try harder or be a better person will change if they don't trust themselves to feel safe, or to feel loved, beautiful, or capable to live as they want to. The only reason I have this ability is because I made that choice to open up no matter how afraid I was everything I did would fail. \n\nThis might be a game to some people, but for me, it's like reliving a part of my life that I didn't know how to connect to before.

You really do feel for the main character who just doesn't know what to do.

Now it is a text based adventure and I did finish the game in under an hour.  There are different routes you can take the story like try to get professional help or keep it all bottled inside.  I did get the best ending where my character is getting help and told his girlfriend about it.  It's not exactly a happy ending, but that's how it is for some people struggling with clinical depression.  I highly recommend playing through this game once.  I am glad that it's free on Steam as even asking for a dollar is kind of a little overpriced for a one-and-done game.   I don't even have this installed in my computer anymore.

I've been suffering from depression since ten years old and I can't let some game make it look like you'e just \"lazy.\" No fuck you. You're not just \"lazy.\" You're depressed. Depression is not as simple as an emotion. Depression is a location. That location is the end of the road, a gun to your head and screams. When your mother and father get divorced. When your mother beats you so badly child protective services has to get involved. When a ten year old child has to see his own brother accuse his non biological father after his original father killed himself. The man who raised him when he was a six. The one who did all this. And he accuses the ten year old boy's father of beating him when he was young. When it turns out the mother was cheating on the father. When you realize the garage door opening at five in the morning at night was the boy's mother going to the gym to cheat on the father. Depression is watching your whole entire world fall apart. This game just makes it look like you smoked a bit of weed and are lazy and sleepy. This game has nothing special other than depression. I don't believe anyone on that team had ever experienced depression. Because the real thing about depression is. There is no escape. It will follow you around and whenever you're having a happy moment you remember the bad moments, you always do. Even when I had no will to live, when I just wanted to end it all. I still soldiered on, I hated myself. I thought I was shit, like everything was my fault. I soldiered on because people cared about me, people loved me. People talked to me. They taught me how to love myself, they taught me how to be myself again. Talking in this game doesn't help, it doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help your character which is a total and utter lie. So at the end of third grade the boy was depressed. By fifth grade the boy was happy. And by sixth grade the boy was loved. From one depression survivor from another, don't kill yourself. You might think nobody cares about you, but really all you had to do all along was open your eyes and experience the good. Therapists are overrated, talk to a dog and or cat. They're much better listeners. I love all of you in a brotherly way survivors and sufferers. Don't give up.

Calling it a game however, is a bit of a stretch in my opinion considering depression itself is not a game.  I am seeing lots of reviews that are written by people that seem to think that the \"solution\" choices being unavailable is ridiculous, but from my experience wtih type 1 bipolar disorder the lack of those options is nothing short of realistic as a representation of the workings of the mind of the severely depressed.  Hell, I would even argue that the options presented *aren't hopeless and dark enough!*  That, however, is just reflective of my personal experiences with very intense and deep depression where hygene and food intake are put completely on hold and every other thought that goes through my head is self deprecating or suicidal.  However, the authors explained the choices and decision options very well in the description when they stated that eveerybody experiences depression differently, and it is quite simply not possible to cover every single possible decision and experience angle.  Besides, if they DID manage to cram in... say 100 different decision options, it would result in the game not being what it is supposed to be - a glimpse into the mind of one \"average\" depression afflicted individual for the purpose of educating those unfamiliar or curious about what could be on the mind of a depressed person.\n\nIs this title for everyone?  Hell no.  There is no happy ending or real control illustrated in the text... this is EXACTLY how MANY, MANY people with depression feel and see the world and is completely intentional.  The only goal of the seriously depressed is to make it to the next minute of their life.  The princess is NOT in another castle... she bled out in her bathtub last week.  If you expect a sunshine and lollipops style ending with just the right combination of choices, you're in the wrong place.\n\nDoes this title reflect poorly on the depressed, making them appear lazy?  Only to the grossly uninformed or those with a deeply misguided view on depression as a weakling's illness that's cured with force.  (Please F*** right off - you only perpetuate or worsen the problem)  The described emotions herein are very true to life and the lack of a real \"ending\" is truly reflective of the illness.\n\nShould people give this a try for s**** and giggles?  If you are truly looking for giggles or a sense of accomplishment after  completing this, you are looking in the wrong place.  Trust me.  Uncertainty orbits the depressed mind like a moon and often eclipses the soul from the light.  People curious about the depressed or those faced with living with a depressed person absolutely should give this a go.  The reality of the depressed person won't make you smile or laugh, so this game will not either.  Reality's a bitch like that.\n\nDo I reccomend people try this out?  Definitely.  Just know what you are getting into, and that everybodies experience and attitudes are going to be different.

Everything is exhausting, even something as simple as making dinner or talking to someone. You want to ask for help, but instead shut down and distance yourself from others, genuinely believing you don't deserve their attention. Asking why you can't choose the better option is the same as asking why poor people don't buy money.\n\nI think the good and bad endings could have benefited of more differences between them, simply to emphasize the importance of getting help and support during these times.

This review will be slightly nit-picky and slightly spoiler-ridden, but no one who reads this is really going to care about that.\n\nStarting off with the very first line of this story we have this: \"You are a 20-something human being\". Okay, cool. But yet it reads that your significant other is named \"Alex\", again, not a huge deal until you realize that Alex is a female, meaning the only two demographics of \"human being\" that the author recognizes are heterosexual men and homosexual women. If you are a heterosexual female or a homosexual man, tough cookies hombre! I mean, why even include this if it's so obvious that this story is about a female and her experience with \"depression\"? to make people feel included? great job there! you couldn't even include a sexuality slider somewhere? And let's talk about the protagonist here: over the course of the story she is clearly socially awkward with what seems to me to be a rather average case of ADD.\n\nThroughout the pages of the story you will see notifications about her depression level, and the lowest I could get it to was \"mildly depressed\" However, knowing what clinically describes depression and how depression actually feels like are two wholly different beasts entirely. Honestly in my opinion this person was just fed up with their awful job at kinkos or fedex, or where-ever and simply wasn't cut out for customer service. Hey, I get that some people aren't meant for that sort of job! But I don't care HOW depressed you are, you are NEVER too depressed to order a pizza over the phone, or most likely over the internet. Heck, I'm almost willing to bet that because of a bad mood you might get extra toppings on it, maybe get some sort of dessert, too!\n\nReturning to your depression however, lets take a closer look at what you claimed to have done in order to calm your mind, shall well? Netflix. video games. playing with your cat with a laser pointer, browsing social media.. never at any point while reading through this whatever-it-is did you once make a reference to, or make any attempt to do some sort of physical activity for the purpose of stress-relief. A sedentary lifestyle, which the protagonist seems to have displayed throughout this story leads me to believe that they were not in fact depressed, but simply bored. This lack of physical activity in the protagonist's de-stressing routine may have led to additional stresses, such as an inability to deal with others and making one become quick to anger. (Which really isn't helped by the cliche nosy mother character you seem to have.) It could also explain the complete lack of progress on this \"secret project\" they keep whispering about. Though maybe this motherly issue is somehow related to the fact that the protagonist very well may have lead a rather sheltered life up until leaving the nest and the mother is simply putting on a harsher front to help toughen her up. In either case the protagonist is overly sensitive to perceived threats and probably needs trigger warnings when watching the news.\n\nIf all of this wasn't enough the protagonist is also quite paranoid, not to the point of delusion really, but every single thing is like \"oh geez, oh man! what if! aaaarg!\"  And ya know what? this protagonist needs a good slap in the back of the head, NCIS style. Not everything is a personal attack, not everything is a slight against you, In fact most people on earth have some of these effects simply due to aging. Yes, even an inability to sleep.\n\nSo, is the protagonist in this story depressed at any point? I believe the other reviews will answer that question nicely.

There are enough reviews that focus solely on the developers, and you can always read online to learn more about them.\n\nSecond, to say that this isn't a game because the only elements are role play and choice, well would it help if there was a targeting reticule and a timer so that you could make the choice quicker? Maybe include some QTEs? If so, then it'd be no different than a Telltale Game (a developer I really like, by the way). In other words, I don't buy into the game/non-game debate. Interactive fiction is interactive fiction, regardless of the level of interaction required.\n\nOkay, so what is this? It's essentially an electronic choose-your-path adventure where the lead is already suffering from undiagnosed depression, but the decisions you make determine whether things spiral uncontrollably, worsen slightly, improve slightly, or even turn around.\n\nIf you do not suffer from depression, this game may provide insight as to what people are saddled with on a daily basis. Then again, if you are one of the types who feel people should just stop feeling sad, then Depression Quest likely won't change your mind.\n\nIf you do suffer from depression, you may find -- despite the fact that symptoms manifest differently in everyone -- elements of yourself depicted. In some cases, you may feel that every single page is ripped straight from your own life story.\n\nI played this game like I would with any other RPG with player choice: I played the opposite of how I believe myself to be. In other words, I sought help and I opened up to the people around me, much like how I'd flock to the dark side/bathe in evil points or whatever the particular currency happens to be in the title.\n\nIn doing so, I... I felt uncomfortable. Like I was lying to myself, not to mention those around me. I felt guilty for leading them along, and pretending like things were okay. I went along with the therapist's advice, and even went out with people, and engaged my family in discussion.\n\nAfterward, I sat for a bit and wondered why I am unable to do these things in real life.\n\nImmediately, I restarted and chose the polar opposite of whatever I selected in my initial playthrough. In other words, how I really felt. It was disastrous. \n\nI sat for a bit longer. Why did I have a stronger emotional attachment to characters and choices in this piece of software compared to those around me? Around those who have stood by me, and attempted to support me?\n\nThis was all a lot to absorb. I will need to dwell on this further.\n\nSo, as you can see, not everyone will have the same reaction to Depression Quest. The unfortunate thing is while emotional and psychological variances are bound to occur, the narrative differences regardless of choices are slight. As you can imagine, the polar opposites yield dramatically different results at certain junctures, but it is otherwise the same regardless. I would have preferred to see more variety, and a few more callbacks to earlier choices, rather than copied and pasted pages that happen at preset times. Not only to encourage replays, an act that also could help people on both sides see how the littlest decision can have a profound impact, but also to make the experience more unique for the end user.\n\nHuh.

What do I mean by this? Well, lets take a look. \n\nThe game itself is essentially a wall of text with a couple of highlighted text that links to more walls of text. This \"game\" is more or less an interactive story that follows the same format as the \"choose your own path\" Goosebumps books (if anyone remembers those?) After each page of text you are given a few options of how you want to react to certain situations. Each choice will take you to a new wall of text explaining your actions and following the resulting story. Some choices close off other choices later on (I assume, otherwise the crossed out choices presented to the user are arbitrary) giving the user a sense of control over the outcomes. It follows this format until the writers couldn't think of anything else to write and thus they leave it open-ended. They explain this in the game's epilogue where they conclude that the life of a person with depression does not come to a nice and tidy ending, and thus, the game would not have such a conclusion either. This would have been believable if it were not for the games writing. \n\nThe writing is horrible. Not only is there missing commas and other punctuation that would help the reader actually understand tone and pacing of sentences, but the writing style is written at a 7th grade level. This is not an insult as many great books and stories are written with this level of vocabulary and sophistication to achieve greater audience appeal. The problem with this is that the writing randomly throws in \"big\" words and pseudo intellectual vernacular to give the reader the illusion that the writers are actually smart educated people. The writing, however, speaks for itself. \n\nThis brings us to the music. I actually quite enjoyed the musical score. As a musician (I think most gamers are to some extent), I can enjoy the mood and atmosphere that the music presented. The music did achieve its goal of gradually gnawing at the player (myself) with a certain sense of beauty and anxiety. Well done!\n\nThe layout of the game was very simple. If I want to play a simple game, like cookie clicker for example, I want the user interface to be outstanding. Now, I can appreciate the fact that a game trying to give a non-depressed user a lens to perceive the world through the eyes of those who are depressed, will inevitably be a little bit more bleak and bland. This however, is not the case for Depression Quest. The interface looks like absolutely no thought went into it at all. It looks as though it was designed 100% for utility and no thought went into aesthetics. \n\nNow, for the \"vibe\" I got from the game. This game dripped with the privileged and shielded eye of a white middle class female who thinks she understands the plight of people suffering depression. It was highly offensive, as someone who has seen, first hand, the affects of depression on family members, this sort of arrogant sense of superior empathy disgusts me. This game is equivelant to a middle class white person making a game about the social-economic struggles of a black person in poverty.

However, I find it's often best to do things the hard way.\n\nIn the opening screen, you are presented with the statement, \"This game uses audio as a part of the play experience.  We encourage you to play with the sound on.\"  This is not a good idea.  The music is very haunting and fairly immersive, but only for the first few bars.  It quickly devolves into a grating noise that is either looping or just played with annoyingly similar chords, throughout the game.  It does not enhance the experience.  If anything, it hurts it.\n\nThe story itself is a major problem.  As the game states, people experience depression differently, and the game can only shed light on so much.  However, the game feels lazily put together.   There aren\u2019t many options, just a few blanket ones.  As you plod through, more types of options are locked or unlocked based on your decisions.  But even with the amount of text displayed on each page, the story was very lacking.\n\nThe characters felt like two-dimensional effigies.  You could not get attached to, or even empathize with, any of them, because there simply wasn't enough to them.  It was as if each character was their own dating website profile, with only a few words plugged into each text field.\n\nAs the protagonist continues to get worse, (or better, as it's hard to tell since it often feels vague) more options are blocked off, leaving the player stranded on a route based on just a few decisions they made early on.  Though this is somewhat accurate to reality\u2013people living with depression find themselves unable to do even simple things like get out of bed or shower, at times\u2013it seems to railroad the player into one of three possible routes:  The good end, the bad end, and the neutral end.\n\nThe truth is, these ends come with some loaded messages.  Productive actions will be rewarded, yet by choosing not to make productive choices you will be heavily punished.  This message is incredibly dangerous to spread to those with depression who are playing the game in an effort to feel understood.  It spreads a message of helplessness and worthlessness.  After all, you are made to feel you\u2019ve lost the game, and downright worthless for having done so, if your choices weren\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d choices.\n\nAt the end of the game, in the credits, you are pretentiously thanked for \"being willing to play games that are meant to be something other than simply 'fun.'\"\n\nEven though I have referred to \"Depression Quest\" as a game throughout this review, it really is not.  This is a \"choose your own adventure\" book, or an exercise.  There are no real gameplay elements in this thing, save from being able to make choices that have lasting effects.  And yet, it is making itself out to be something better than \"fun\" games, despite having almost none of the qualities that make a game, period.\n\nIn fact, it's barely even a game book.  In \"choose your own adventure books,\" the story is engaging, and what you do matters in the pursuit of your goal.  \"Depression Quest\" is not engaging, there are no stakes, and it's hard to tell what effect you're having.\n\nLong story short, \"Depression Quest\" is, at the most, a meretricious, amateur attempt at creating a \"choose your own adventure\" game book, loaded with text and grammatical errors, being projected as something above and beyond other video games.  This is ironic, seeing it accomplished none of its goals.\n\nIt fails as a video game.  It fails as a game book.  It fails as a teaching or therapeutic tool.  It fails at depicting what living with depression is like (especially if you consider the testimonials I've received from friends, family, and online sources).  It even fails at being an expression of the author's personal pain, as it does nothing to instill any sort of empathy in the player.  It's all so tedious, unimaginative and even narcissistic, that it comes off as a whining teenager's journal, destroying any attempt of connecting with the player, even at a superficial level.\n\nWorse still, the game's history renders it even more unenjoyable.  What really did or didn't happen is irrelevant.  Obviously, it doesn't make any sense that the creator would have fraternized with online game journalists for monetary reasons, seeing that the game was always free.  However, after playing the game and seeing what it's all about, it makes perfect sense that they would for pure publicity.  That is quite possibly the only way that this game would have gotten any form of notoriety.  Otherwise, it would have faded into obscurity in less than a week.  And it worked.  The scandal is the biggest reason that anyone knows about it.  It has given its creator more publicity, voice, and money than their talents could have ever brought.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the subject of depression is impossible to put into game form.  \"Actual Sunlight\" is one that better achieves this.  Although, some may think that it's more of a visual novel than a game, it still has more and better gameplay elements than \"Depression Quest.\"  Better writing with a deeper, more meaningful story, and makes no lofty assertions about what it is.  The stakes in the game are clear, and you can empathize with the characters.  Its creators put thought and care into their game, despite it being simple in the game play aspect.\n\nIn closing, \"Depression Quest\" was one of the most poorly made, pointless things I have ever spent time on.  The creator owes $25 to every person who has ever downloaded it.", "timestamp_created": 1446777764, "timestamp_updated": 1446777764, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498545944690704346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18898434": {"recommendationid": "18898434", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979363806", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1446763444}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1446763453, "timestamp_updated": 1446763453, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495283037424087524", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "18895679": {"recommendationid": "18895679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075744152", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 32, "last_played": 1446755701}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really, really interesting.

I'm not quite sure what's going on there, there are clearly some things happening behind the scenes to determine what you can and can't select, but it doesn't give much agency to the player if they can't really tell, at the very least, if and why their decisions have led to fewer choices. If this formula were visible perhaps there'd be a greater connection that would convey the point more.\n\nMoreover, the effect would perhaps be more dramatic if the very first choice you made didn't involve a crossed-off option, increasing the contrast when you fall deeper into depression. To be fair, the first few choices crossed off were definitely things I myself wouldn't do, and again, I'm a relatively happy person, so there's still the question of if this aided in the conveyence.

None of the friends save for Amanda seem to be helpful individuals. I would hope that if I had the behavior of our protagonist, someone would try and talk to me or do something. Depression is a legitimate struggle to get out of, but this game makes it feel like a game. By trying to simulate someone\u2019s very personal experience, you make someone with a legitimate medical issue seem whiney. You can\u2019t really relate to the protagonist if you haven\u2019t had depression, and from people who have had depression, it would seem inaccurate. My brother has Bipolar disorder, and has intense periods of depression. He acts completely different from the protagonist in these periods. No one supports the protagonist unlike the girlfriends and family of the real world. While some people don\u2019t get the support they need, I feel someone would at least notice early on. If you wanted to make an impact, make the game from the point of view of someone only slightly depressed, and have game options that can make it better or worse. Starting from the bottom makes it hard for the \u201ctypical\u201d person to get into the mindset of the depressed individual. \n\tAside from the faults in its portrayal of depression, the game feels boring. The red crossed out text is just frustrating in the early game where they are not even a conceivable option. They would be better off when they are something a player could access. The static-text is aesthetically unpleasing as it stands out from the rest of the games aesthetic. The photos on the top often feel like its going for an artsy feel, but overall they feel pointless. This game feels like it\u2019s trying to be artsy, being important. It wants to be profound and interesting, but it comes across is trying too hard to be sad and not capturing what it set out to do. The game only got the attention it had due to scandal, and it shows. The gameplay is boring and the commentary is weak. I would not recommend the game to anyone who wants to understand depression. You are better off with an old textbook or internet entries.

This does NOT convey depression accurately as far as decision making and the general vibe. I got more and more frustrated as the answers only dialed down to \"depressing\" or \"More depressing\". Nothing about the story is engaging. It would be better suited to use this character in a third person to give them some empathy. However, to sound more \u201cImmersive\u201d I suppose, they stick you in the first person as the player. Problem with that is, I would NOT make those choices in those situations.

Honestly, as a person who has struggled with depression in the past, I wasn\u2019t expecting much, but this train wreck went far and beyond my expectations. From the outset, it\u2019s obvious the maker has never struggled with depression. The player character has the perfect friends, family and girlfriend. Additionally, the ways in which  this guy gets over his depression are the most by-the-book I\u2019ve ever seen. Get a cat, go to therapy, take medication, talk to someone. Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat. There were absolutely no creative liberties taken with the story at all. Quinn\u2019s writing was also little more than a dreck slog. There were walls of mind-numbing blather you had to crawl through to get to the next boring text tree, with 4 blocked-off options because you were TOO DEPRESSED. There wasn\u2019t really much to the gameplay, either. You got to select randomly from a bunch of random text lines, and it was outstandingly obvious which ones you were supposed to take. The sole points where the game chucks you a fastball is when Boring McCaricature is moping about a party, and if you choose wrong between going into your girlfriend\u2019s room and nursing a Bud Lite, the game shoves a massive branding iron down your throat, shakes you about and screams \u201cTHIS IS DEPRESSION\u201d as loud as it can. After that single incident, after which your girlfriend may or may not get pissed at you for asking if she preferred Friends or Parks & Rec, which sends the player into a spiral of depression so awful they can barely drive themselves to get out of bed in the morning. I am being completely serious. In other cases, the game seems to get Difficulty Whiplash. There are random points at which entire paths are blocked off because your guy is too glum to sit at a desk for a few hours. At other points, the obviously correct answers are right there, displaying none of the difficulty of telling someone about your depression or going to therapy. You just click a button and WHAM, everything\u2019s shiny, cap\u2019n, not to fret. \n\tOne of the most common arguments I hear for the validity of the game is that \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be fun! It\u2019s supposed to send a message!\u201d Yes, but there have been tons of other games that have not been meant to be fun. Thomas Was Alone and the Beginner\u2019s Guide both come to mind. Then what\u2019s the difference between the two games? Both Thomas Was Alone and the Beginner\u2019s Guide were engaging. They had interesting, human characters that players came to care about. Depression Quest had none of that. It was a boring, detached recounting of how depression survivors wish things had gone starring the flattest, least sympathetic characters ever created.

Ok, so not really a game... but a piece of interactive fiction. There is a lot of text to read, at least the first play through. You are presented with a variety of options, but choosing some may cause later actions to be crossed off. This is interesting, but it sucks a lot of interactivity out. \nI also don't like the medicate moral that I think this story is pushing. I also think that it provides an incredibly narrow portrait of depression. I respect that, because it doesn't need to. It's the portrait of a single static character rather than a dynamic one that morphs around the player.  I think that using a more dynamic character scheme would have increased replayability, however, I'm not going to count that against the game. \nThe problem lies in the way it quickly degrades into cynically clicking the remaining available options. After the first 2-4 reads, you realize that very little changes with each play through except the ending. The ending only changes depending on choices. There is nothing to encourage a player to see all the endings or to try new combinations. Maybe there isn't supposed to be. I don't know.\nThere are some spelling and grammar issues, but having been an avid interactive fiction player I've noticed that that isn't uncommon. I note this because a lot of reviewers bring it up. Sure, they could update it with better spelling and grammar. Or they could move on to another project. Most choose that latter and it's not a bad choice. Most interactive fiction isn't professional, but made free to play by hobbyists for hobbyists. \nDoes the game achieve the goal of creating the atmosphere or portraying a singular portrait of depression? I'd say yes. Others might and do disagree. I wouldn't say it is the best at portraying depression. Calunio's Depression is probably the best representation I've seen. A major difference is perhaps that this game gives us a character that is incredibly human. We see her as human and as another individual entity, but we achieve only the closeness of an onlooker. Calunio's Depression works by giving us a shell of character and starts with conception. In black and white, the player must slowly and painfully grind to walk a short jaunt to the boss. You win, but he curses you so that with every new screen you arrive, you lose experience. Every new scene causes an exponentially greater experience loss. Meanwhile, you are questioned on the nature of happiness, and no matter how hard you attempt to level, you are never the strongest. Before you lies a tower that seems impossible to climb, a final challenge. Can you reach the end before your curse overwhelms you? Depression Quest may portray a story of a depressed lady, but Calunio's Depression gives out a depressing atmosphere drags you into it (for good or ill.) The powerlessness felt between these to games are incredibly different in both nature and magnitude. \n\nAt the end, I'd merely say Depression Quest is heavily flawed. I wouldn't recommend it to most people I know. It is free though, so maybe try it sometime.

In my opinion is... Ok. I'll simply list what i like, and disliked.\n\nDislikes, starting off is the most glaring issue for me, the pretentiousness. The language, and tone just is so pretentious, there's a special way to write things seriously, and this game did not do it right, it just comes off as pretentious. (Sorry for saying pretentious so many times!)  Secondly, this isn't that bad for me atleast but i think the developers wouldn't appreciate this comment, it seems more like a... Pet game. I can't put myslef in the main character's shoes. (even though i have had suicidal deppresion.) It justs seemes like, im nudging around this sad little creature. Last, i really couldn't sypathise for the main character. the deppresion was very sappy, and cheesy, there really weren't any reasons for him/her to be depressed, he/she just was. and the existing reasons were terrible. the deppresion just seemed like a petty teenager overeacting to life.\nI also would have liked to be able to controll this person more. If this is susposed to be me, then i shouldn't be able to just make trivial nudges. Also, the \"What do i do?\" thing, was stupid. the options were so limited, and i got to choose so few things, the main character got to make important decisions without me even consenting!\n\nLIkes, I got a very good sense of... Satisfaction when i \"beat\" the game. I felt like i had helped my little pet make the right choices, and actually was touched by the ending, i found myslef smiling, becuase i had this felling that i had made my little pet happy. As i have had depresion the red corss over the best answer was good. if you're deppresed there are times when you want to, you know you should, but you jsut can't.\n\nAll in all, i wouldn't recommend playing. It shows a very melodramatic, unrealistic view on depresion.\n\n4/10 stars, a passable game.\n\nEdit: I also have learned the \"reputation\" of the person that made this game, and I honestly don't care.\nWhat I care about is that this is called an \"Interactive Fiction\" Yes It's FICTION, this is a FICTITIOUS story, at best it's realistic fiction.

But believe me, there are things which would make it a considerably better game as well as a considerably better educational experience.\n\nMy overriding impression is that this game would have benefitted a great deal from having a depression specialist on board as a consultant, preferably one with clinical experience.\n\nFor example, the protagonist seems to have serious social anxiety issues.  While legitimate, this is not the same as depression, as any expert (or well-informed amateur) can tell you.  It seems a disservice to those trying to learn about depression to conflate the two.  Though depressives often appear to be antisocial to their friends, in many the phenomenon stems from issues which have nothing to do with anxiety.\n\nFurthermore, it seems to me this role-playing game (in the truest sense of the word) would have more impact if it allowed more limited healthy options, especially early in the game.  For example, cognitive-behavioral therapy explores the differences between low expectations of enjoyment of activities and the actual enjoyment unmotivated depressives sometimes ultimately derive.  It is about experimenting and taking risks.  Without any options for experimentation, the game provides an effectively pessimistic prognosis for mental illness but hardly a realistic one.  The game represents depression as a problem that PRECLUDES any therapy at one point in the game--quite literally, \"Call the therapist's number\" is crossed out in the game, blocking you from choosing it.  Because depressives never see therapists, right?  Facepalm.  So many negative reviews of this game deal with this frustration: The game is presented as a role-playing game but does not offer sufficient choices to meet that implied promise, with choices too limited even for--and this is important--people with depression who are role-playing the game.  Depression has legitimate challenges even for people who DO seek therapy or other healthy options, but the game glosses over that fact by forbidding you even to choose those options at certain points in the game.  I get it: the game wants to limit your choices based on how healthy you are, which is in turn determined by earlier decisions in the game.  But this sense of being railroaded into a particularly unhealthy path happens right at the beginning of the game, which probably is what created the intensely negative reviews.\n\nI am impressed with a few of the details, many of which may be unknown to those without experience with the illness.   For example, describing your condition as \"feeling ill\" or \"not feeling well\" when you have to cancel a social engagement, because people don't understand \"I am depressed.\"\n\nThere are a few English problems here and there, which always annoys me.  Since when is your friend Amanda a \"they\" or a \"them?\"  And a number of others.  The game could use with some editorial polish, for sure.  By the way, it's \"lying in bed,\" not \"laying in bed.\"  Unless you are a chicken.  This game is chock-full of this particular mistake (\"lie\" vs. \"lay\").  And a few other content (not grammar or punctuation) mistakes that won't be caught by a spell-check.  Also, \"it's\" = \"it is\" and \"its\" is the possessive form.  Copy-edit your damn game!\n\nPlaying the game a second time, and playing around with different options has made me notice little pedantic jabs at your choices that make this seem even less like a legitimate choice-driven game.\n\nThe biggest challenge for a game like this, in my opinion, is making the experience accessible and coherent to individuals who have never struggled with depression.  In this area, I think the game sadly fails, and I think all the negative reviews are a direct reflection of this fact.  Limited choices are fine, but limitations need to be comprehensible to those who are playing the game, and that's where the game needs work.  It's definitely trying for that, but doesn't quite hit the mark.\n\nI'd love to see a remake that focuses more on this kind of accessibility.\n\nP.S. Valve, please allow us to post full reviews.

The issues won't speak to many of us: being invited to college parties, working a 9-to-5 job, trolling Craigslist for new jobs, owning a car, living away from one's parents in one's own apartment, having a girlfriend, watching Netflix, being able to afford and have access to therapy, etc. It's not just an issue of \"privilege,\" as the introduction points out. Some of these culturally specific aspects would actually seem like [b]punishments[/b], rather than privileges, to many people in the world. Living alone, away from a supportive family? Who would [b]choose[/b] that? It's amazing that this entire cohort of people doesn't suffer from depression.\n\nBut that's where this game seems valuable to me: it's a window into the lives of this strange generation of people, who manifest in their personal, interpersonal, emotional worlds the brunt of capitalist America's crushing isolation.\n\nWe all live with capitalism, even if we're not self-centered millennials. We all can sympathize with aspects of the protagonist's life, even when it's unfamiliar (and annoying) to us. It's good to think with.\n\nI do wish the developers put a bit more effort into the presentation: the design is drab, and though the music is fitting, it would have been nice to have some variation. I didn't expect to be entertained, but a sleeker experience could have made this effort more palatable.\n\nA personal message to Zoe Quinn: stay strong and keep doing what you're doing, because even if it's not everybody's cup of tea, it touches many of us and adds something good and useful to the world. \"Gamergate\" is an embarrassment to any decent human.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank the developers for supporting Linux!", "timestamp_created": 1440356146, "timestamp_updated": 1440384410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553993642330169678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17666777": {"recommendationid": "17666777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078351395", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1440277496}, "language": "english", "review": "I think the most important thing you have to remember is that this game doesn't have \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers. This isn't something that you have to try and win, because that's entirely not the point. Some people might hesitate to call this a game, but I think \"interactive experience\" is a bit less catchy. Nonetheless, it can offer you a bit of insight into depression that simply talking or reading about it won't achieve. Things like being unable to bring yourself to act upon options that seem so obvious or effortless to \"regular\" people, and how frustrating that is. Being fatigued by repeated interactions with well meaning but oblivious people that offer no solution or resolution. Finding occasional comfort in unexpected places.\n\nFor those complaining that this game isn't an accurate representation of depression, I'm not sure if you've actually played it or are able to read, or understand humanity at all, because if you did, you'd have seen on the very first page that it doesn't pretend to represent ALL cases of depression, nor is that even possible since, besides the innumerable different types of mental illnesses out there, everyone with even basic depression experiences it differently, and live with it under unique circumstances. What I got out of it was a familiar retrospection of how my life and experiences had been several years ago, and occasionally (but fortunately rarely) still relapse into every now and then. But it wasn't exactly the same obviously, as I'm not actually dense enough to expect a 30 minute free game to somehow perfectly mirror my whole life experience.\n\nDepression Quest is very honest about merely being an attempt to provide people who know and care about someone who has depression a bit of potential insight into their otherwise private and closed off lives and consider what sort of reactions from loved ones help and what actually makes it worse, despite the best intentions.\n\nIf this does not apply to you but you're just curious, it's free! \n\nBut for those to whom the events described in the game are familiar, but genuinely struggle to explain what they are going through to loved ones, this could potentially be something valuable.\n\nFor me, it illustrated the concept of \"I understand what you're going through/went through\" so much better than a vague verbal reassurance that, when you're in that situation, often feels ingenuine or meaningless anyways. Just remembering the familiarity of that creeping hopelessness reminds me why the vapid suggestion that people should \"just get over it\" is so uselessly dismissive, and that dismissiveness comes from the lack of empathy, due to a lack of perspective. If this game can offer people a bit of perspective, that's value.\n\nI'll admit I wasn't overly fond of the music, it was a bit more distracting than probably intended.

I cannot stress enough that you play it for yourself with an open mind to get an undilluted opinion and ignore this review and any others.\n\nSo... I know what Depression is. I've been diagnosed with it for the last 15 years alongside High Anxiety for all that time. \nYou want to know what Depression is like? Let me tell you instead of you playing this game.\nImagine sadness. Imagine extreme self-disappointment. Imagine self-loathing to as high of a degree as it'll go. It's not always the same, but to my knowledge... Mix them into one emotion and you get Depression.\nIt is literally the worst emotion on the planet. Mostly all suicides are caused by feelings of Depression. I have no study, no way to prove that, other than just plain logic and understanding.\n\nThis game does not convey the feelings of Depression.\n\nIt is sad, yes, but Sadness is not Depression. On it's own that is. You need a slew of other different, but similar emotions but also the faint hope that it can get better and mental habits of being pessimistic about your life, you and everything around you.\n\nI've played and read all lines of both endings and choice options. there's multiple choices in most cases, but in most cases the options are locked because the dev most likely didn't program that far in a text-based game. I could also say because of [arbitrary/contrived reason].\n\nLet me be perfectly clear. This game is not depressing, it's not saddening. To me... It's insulting how hyped this game is on the store page.\nIt's got the pacing of a pop-up book, the writing of an overly-emotional stereotype writing about how awful life is and for a game that boasts \"multiple endings\" I would have imagined that the developer would've coded in a suicide ending, since I literally did every awful option and nothing really different happened.\n\nThe game is as engaging as listenning to someone whine about how awful their life is. I know, it's supposed to convey the feelings of being Depressed, but the thing is... Unless you're a wordsmith (which The Quinnspiracy isn't) then it will never work in text form.\nThe game would have worked better as a more interactive game that isn't text-based or an auto-biography of part of the dev's life.\n\nWhile I was playing-no... While I was reading this e-book it felt like I was reading what amounted to angsty, emo fanfiction and not even good fanfiction.\n\nSome options of the game aren't labeled too great, sometimes the result being the opposite of what you thought the option would do (so... control problems in a text-based game?) which basically boils down to those options being improperly labeled.\n\nThe soundtrack is... well it's actually just a track, one song looping over and over and not even with a clean loop either, at certain times you'll hear crackling or popping in the audio as it loops.\n\nAll in all, this game utterly fails at what it tries to do. Not only that, but it makes Depression laughable, comparable to stupid pre-teens who thinks depression is a cool thing, who we all know are a complete joke, and that's the literal opposite of Depression.\n\nI've seen better pacing in books you can read in any library anywhere, the game wasn't at all uncomfortable for me, it wasn't like an unfiltered mental diary, more like a \"pity me, I'm sad right?\" type of story written by some spoiled kid who got grounded for the first time.\n\nJust like any poorly-made text-based game, you can look at the first sentence/paragraph, the last one aswell and essentially miss nothing story-wise, ignoring everything inbetween, only with this one, you can look at jsut the last sentence or two and know all you need for the next decision.\n\nThe Choice-based content is actually true to a degree, but the multiple endings are comparable to Mass Effect 3's \"What color will your ship's explosion be\" type of ending, each one summing up all you've done, with ONE sentence of difference ignoring all else (summing up your run doesn't really count) which doesn't matter because this game is extremely far from being long, even if you read it all. I stopped reading all but the last sentence and first one halfway through.\n\nPros:\n- Content based on Choice is true to a degree.\n- The \"art style\" of the game works decently.\n\nCons:\n- Completely makes a joke of Depression.\n- Fails to give an understanding view of depression to the player.\n- Text drones on about the player's awful life and at times feels like empty complaining and whining.\n- There isn't really music, just ambience with awful loop crackles. It loops 3 or 4 times in a 15 minute period.\n- You can ignore most of the text without loss of story/choice context.\n- Some choices are literally always locked no matter what you do.\n- There's a choice or two on the first screen that is locked.\n- Due to the third point, the game is dull and couldn't be further from being engaging even if it's in 1st person.\n- The wording in some pages are poorly done, or done wierdly to confuse the reader.\n- The Endings are technically the same save for one or two lines of text that don't change anything.\n\nThis game gets a 1/10. It makes a joke out of Depression by coming off as whiny and complaining about how awful life is, saying how awful everything is rather than using words to imply the feelings so the reader can dig and feel them that way.\nIf that wasn't a thing and it did what it'd do, it would be a 5/10 simply due to everything else just being passable. It's not well-made GameSpy, it's just passable. I've played many text-based games that are more well executed than this, some of them being Zork, Trials in Tainted Space and Unification Wars. Trials is in beta.\n\nTo improve it I would suggest a complete redo of the whole game. It needs or be worded better, don't tell us, make us imagine it so we can be THERE, not watching ourselves like a ghost would. Be less preachy or Emo-y (if that's a word).\n\nI would also suggest the ambience loop be cleaned up and have the crackles removed.\n\nMake the endings ALOT more dramatically different. Not a single sentence of difference, I'm talking the difference between a life that will continue to be happy, or literally suicide (say if you choose all the good options and then all the bad ones in another playthrough).\n\nIt doesn't even need to be longer.\n\nWill I give it Forbidden status? Well... based on how it's been released a full year, I'm inclined to say yes, but I will hold off on that as per the usual for my statuses.\n\nI live with depression every day. I know how it feels. This game? Not one single moment did I EVER empathize with the character.

I would give this a Neutral rating if I could, but I can't, and I would only do so because of the idea. The game itself is too simple. The audio is nice, but the game is a choose your own adventure with a slight twist.

That's right. It uses depression as the driving force of a story. Not that it can't be done, but this game delivers it in the most awful way possible. The game gives no insight on how the psyche of a depressed person truly works, and utterly shames the issue completely. Developers, you should feel ashamed for this. I feel ashamed for this game, as a player, and as someone who deals with others with depression daily. A simple google search could have given you plenty of insight, but instead you choose the most bland, stereotypical version of depression, and followed that through. Why on Earth would you all think your base knowledge was good enough for such a complex issue?!?! If this game was truly for insight on depression, you all should have spent more time adding in various stories that at least include each form of depression (Chronic, Persistent, Major, Bipolar(Manic), Seasonal Affective Disorder, Psychotic, Postpartum, Premenstrual, Situational, and Atypical. There you go, listed all known forms of depression, go research them and deliver the players a PROPER informational Story on each form of depression with actions backed by research from professionals proven to help against depression. Not just \"Take the meds, get motivated\" bull shit.) As a person who deals with this, depressed people can lie to others, can manipulate cunningly well to hide a more sinister side to their depression, which can ultimately cause themselves Fatal injuries. Some depressed individuals, if not all, plan out their deaths to prevent any intervention. This game shames all of those people. This game shames the issue. This game is shameful, and any news site or what have you that tells you that it is accurate to the psyche of a depressed individual clearly need to research their shit.\n\nAlright, now the game is nothing special. It's a shoddily, quickly done Visual Story (If that can even be justified), with a looping audio of a \"Piano playing a minor key for emphasis on the mood which makes the game cheesy and irritating to listen to\". Not to say the piece is bad, but when it loops it becomes grating on the ears quickly. Devs, add in different audio tracks, options for said audio, and the like to suit the mood of the story. When things go well, make the melancholy music fade somewhat or become slightly more cheerful. When there are dips in the story, make the audio change accordingly. The audio, as it is, is half-assed and lazy. I can play any D-minor improv and get the same effect as this audio. Improve the game's audio, and story, those are it's fronts and they are both LACKING. Obviously the game was designed to play on people's heart-strings and suck out as much cash as possible. So make it do that, because right now, you all are FAILING MISERABLY AT DOING THAT. You are failing as a team to deliver a sensational, informational, honest story that could be BEAUTIFUL. It has the premise of a good Story, so make it good. If you need help with that, read EDGAR ALLEN POE a few times, Read notes from depressed individuals, spend TIME with depressed individuals. Learn about the people, then their psyche, and then deliver the steam player base a sensational story.\n\nFix it, or rebuild the game completely, but don't leave it as a decaying piece of shit it is now. If you all fix it, I garauntee a lot of negative reviews that are relevant will turn positive, and you all might not have such a bad track record later on.\n\nIf you, the individual thinking about this game, truly want to learn about depression, don't waste your time on this piece of garbage, and instead look it up online and learn from professionals who deal with it daily. This Free game isn't even a game, nor is it even informational on the situation it tries to convey and talk about.

Through the expansion of my journey i found that the game was to teach and give players a feel of what its like to have Depressioon. Upon downloading and launching the game I was ever so graciously greeted with a \"(not responding)\" message that some games naturally have upon launch. Once i had reached the title screen i was intruduced to the most enlightening piano music i have possibly ever heard in my life. Instinctively I started playing skipping the controls and other useless information. The first page alone had way to much dialogue so naturally i was all \"wow nope\" and went straight to the options. Without any idea of what my options were actually affecting I picked the most negative one i could. Since everyone knows depression is a fake disease the only possitive choice I made was adopting a cat so I could officially become a cat man. Then I proceded to dump my girl friend Alex so i could oficially be a lonely cat man. I then decided that my love for cats was greater than that of myself. So in this process i realized the only reason I hate myself is because im a male. Finally I ended the game by becoming a flaming male feminist who wanted to eliminate all other males, and once done. Commit suicide. I ended the game with a personal high score of 420 Depression Points which i then cashed in at the arcade shop for a stuffed slice of pizza. Great game over all.

I, like everyone, have had bad days, but nothing severe enough to consider depression.\n\nThat said, the mission statement of the game seemed to be that depression is more than just being a downer or being mopey or a whiner.\n\nHowever, I found that the gameplay doesn't support this mission statement.\n\nWhenever I came to a decision to make, I chose what felt reasonable to me, a non depressed person. Don't feel like going out with your girlfriend to a party? eh, just do it anyway because it will make her happy. Even then, I chose to stalk in the corner and not to talk to anyone, but it didn't seem to matter.\n\nShould I call a therapist? Yes. Should I continue seeing the therapist? yes. Should I tell people that I'm depressed? Yes. Should I stay on my medication, even when I am feeling a little better? yes. Should I move in with my obviously loving and awesome girlfriend? Yes.\n\nAnd at the end of the game, I was living with my girlfriend, seeing a therapist, on medication, with an adorable kitty and my family was very accepting of my condition. I still didn't really like my job, but I realized it was a small part of my life and just something to get through. I was being more sociable with friends and, for the most part, fighting through my depression very well.\n\nThere was never anything that would imply a depressed person is incapable of making these decisions. \n\nThe game is, essentially, implying that depressed people are just being little bitches and intentionally making the wrong decisions.\n\nThat said, I enjoyed the narrative and the choices, though intentionally limited, felt like I could control my fate, rather than being told that I'm depressed, so I can't possibly recover.\n\nIt's a free game and it only takes and hour, and I found it rather enjoyable.\n\nDespite its failure to meet its mission statement, I did feel like it enhanced my understanding of the thought processes depressed people go to in order to will themselves back to a good state.

On top of that for the first half of the game what seemed like wrong choices (since they were doing nothing) turned out to be right choices closer to the end of the game. The fact that seeing what I thought would be common sense and the right answer rejected and then picked up later sort of brought the feeling like I could have done better in the game even though, in all likelyhood, I had a near perfect game. \n\nI also had an issue with the music. I get that it was supposed to help greaten the story, or maybe even cover over it, but  it wound up distracting me from the story. I of course didn't turn the music off out of fear that the generally labeled \"sound\" would somehow be important later in game (it wasn't). By the end of the game I was not only not affected by the music but I was out right sick of it.\n\nAnother issue is that some of the points are automatically crossed off. This lead to a more straight-forward feel to the game instead of the (hopefully) intended mood of it being a choose your own adventure. By the end of it I felt like there could have been a completely better and different game if you didn't focus on keeping the character so depressed for half the game. \n\nSo in summary I feel as though Depression Quest has a lacking storyline, monotone music that will bore you to tears, a confusing choice of story options, and a lack of creative writing that will never really help draw in the player. \n\nI rated it a 4/10 because it was honestly not a bad game considering it was free, just medicore at best.

They often have stories, sometimes involved and emotional stories, but in general video games are generally escapism or competition of one form or another. Depression Quest, on the other hand, admits up front that it is *not* \"fun\". It's an attempt to communicate how depression feels and impacts someone's life, and I believe that it succeeds admirably in that.\n\nThe game itself is short -- a little over an hour, depending on your reading speed -- but in that time it puts you in the shoes of someone who is dealing with depression. The story is told in text, with branching dialog trees at various points, similar to \"Choose your own adventure\" books or other interactive fiction. The clever thing they do at various points is to list various options, but then remove them. In most games that feature branching dialog, the good/bad/snarky options are generally very clear; BioWare is (in)famous for this. In Depression Quest, too, there are clear \"right\" choices and answers, and the game will show them to you, but they may be crossed out and unavailable based on your mental state. This simple mechanic is brilliant, as it accurately models how depression can feel; you know what the \"right\" thing to do is, but you just can't seem to do it.\n\nIf you want to know more about how depression feels, or if you're trying to understand or help someone who may be dealing with depression, this game is well worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1435761758, "timestamp_updated": 1435761758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16815134": {"recommendationid": "16815134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131220774", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 43, "last_played": 1434144007}, "language": "english", "review": "Welp, depression sucks, this quest sucks, this narration sucks, Zoe sucks.

It would be misleading to classify it as a video game, or even a visual novel, and should be approached accordingly. The awkwardly titled (yet entirely appropriate?) Depression Quest is a cold, presumably personal take on depression. In the course of my first playthrough, completed in one sitting lasting about an hour, I felt it was more of an opinion piece, a snapshot of depression, wrapped in biographical accounts, situations and perspectives. \n\nFor me, it didn\u2019t work. The quality of writing is average at best, suffering from overwriting, repetition and a jarring form of second person narrative that too often insists on telling the reader how to feel and why. Perhaps this is intentional - one of the aims of Depression Quest, I\u2019m told on the opening page, is to help people who do not suffer from depression to understand those who do. This could work, yet I also find that the plot was fairly generic - we assume the role of a character who is depressed for undisclosed reasons, and as a result, he or she has no energy for hobbies, work, family and friends. I\u2019m not entirely sure what message Depression Quest carries about depression as a whole, other than that it happens. This may sound good on paper, a frank depiction of depression, the sort that doesn't necessarily have an underlying cause or meaning, but it\u2019s akin to filming a man crying continuously for several minutes - there must be more, ultimately, to truly engage the audience, to give them a reason to care and empathise. \n\nThe interactive element of Depression Quest is also questionable, multiple choices provided at the end of every other page of text. As with so many other choice-based titles, this creates an unsatisfactory overall narrative, and the idea that you can go back and change things, achieve the best possible ending, is in stark contrast to the realities of depression. Beyond that, it also creates logic problems - without spoiling anything, in one scenario I achieved a positive outcome, and a mere two pages later things had fallen through, without any real relevance carried in the writing. The music, too, is poorly implemented, the same piano piece, while fitting, looping over and over and in the end serving as little more than a frustrating distraction from the writing. Ambient sounds are introduced in various scenes - coffee shop sounds in a coffee shop, for instance - but this does little to enhance the experience. Nor do the images, small snapshots of images vaguely linked to the current scene, which seem to have various amounts of blur depending on your character\u2019s depression level. This is another thing I don\u2019t understand - depression, in my own experience, does not affect visual or auditory senses. I do not start seeing fuzzy images or hearing static no matter how low my mood is. \n\nUltimately, then, I found my experience with Depression Quest underwhelming. Regardless, I recommend the title because it\u2019s free, because a playthrough will not eat up a lot of time, and finally, because it is a personal experience that will invariably resonate with different people in different ways.

I'll preface this by saying that there has been a lot of \"controversy\" about DQ in gaming spheres.  Most of us that are clued in to the gaming subculture know all about it and I'll only bring it up just this once during the review.  The only thing I will say about it is that this review is [i]utterly detached[/i] from the poopstorm.  I'm here to tell you what I think of DQ as a game in it's own right.\n\n[b]ProTip:[/b] If that already sounds too \"SJW\" for you, this game is definitely NOT for you.  Don't download it, don't install it, don't worry about it.  Everyone else, read on.\n\n\n[i]Download this FREE game if you:[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] Are interested in learning a bit more about depression.\n[*] Are looking for a very casual narrative experience.\n[*] Are interested in what all the \"hullabaloo\" is about.\n[*] Aren't a Burgers & Fries poopstain.\n[/list]\n\n\n[i]Decline this quest if you:[/i]\n\n[list]\n[*] Want interesting gameplay, such as puzzles, shootmans, or jumping.  This is not for you.\n[*] Do not have an open mind about clinical depression.\n[*] Are looking for something that is \"fun\".  This is a game about DEPRESSION.\n[*] Are scurred of scurry SJW skeltins hurtin' your fee fees!\n[/list]\n\n[u]The Bottom Line[/u]\n\nAs the title suggests, this really isn't a \"good\" game, or even much of a game at all.  It's a short story exploration and there is no real \"win\" condition exactly, no highscores, no frag count, and no real \"questing\" despite the title.\n\nIn short, it kinda really sucks as [i]purely[/i] a game.\n\nThat isn't why you should play DQ though.  You should play DQ if you think you may suffer from depression and don't know what to do.  You should play DQ if you have \"that friend\" who seems nice but is always a \"loner\" and you don't know why.  You should play DQ to learn more about a prevalent mental health issue that suffers from intense stigma.\n\nIs Depression Quest the \"answer\" to depression?  Hell no.  It is only one facet of the story.  Depression is something that plays out differently for everyone that experiences it, and no one experience is the end-all definition of the condition.  That all said, however, there were a few situations in DQ that hit close to home for me, despite other scenarios not being necessarily so.\n\nThe take-away here is that you should absolutely not feel alone and that you should seek SOME sort of help.  From family, from friends, and your other loved ones.  Depression's best ally is isolation.\n\nDon't expect a lot from this game.  It's not a revolution.  It doesn't even say anything new.  It is just another helpful point of view in the overall discussion and nothing more.  Really.  That is it.\n\nIt's also free, but you can donate if you wish.  That's really all there is to it.  After all the hyperbole I fully expected to be forcefully neutered by a crack team of dye-color haired SJW cuck-warlords just for playing it.  Nope.

For the most part this is achieved successfully, although due to the complex nature of the subject matter, the experience, or 'game' in itself is far from perfect.\n\nThe choice of text to respond with can at times be limited, lacking in complexity, often with one answer alluring to a positive ending, while the other choices would all be negative. Despite this, the narrative path that I was guided along had the ability to not only convey great emotion, but was emotive in itself, even reducing me to a tear or two at one point. One issue I did have was being unaware of whether there was any save game feature, fortunately the game is only around an hour long so this wasn't too much of a problem, but I was initially unaware of the length and whether I'd be able to finish it within one sitting.\n\nTo some extent my opinion may be biased, as due to my history of depression I can most certainly empathise with the main character of the story. Nevertheless, for those willing to take part in what you could call a 'Depression Simulator', there is a lot be learned from the mental condition here, or if you are like me, along with empathy there is some comfort in finding an iteration of depression other than your own. Above all this, there is a wealth of emotion to be felt from the narrative, although for the most part this is admittedly downbeat rather than happy; just a point to consider.\n\nEither way, if you don't mind taking on a purely text based interactive story, rather than an actual game, I would most definitely recommend this title...I mean apart from anything else it's free isn't it, why not really? \n\nAll the best to all of you by the way, especially to those of you that are suffering in any form, it can get better. :)  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1434229258, "timestamp_updated": 1434229258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16365939": {"recommendationid": "16365939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150900205", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1435577458}, "language": "english", "review": "I found this game to be amazing. \nI have depression myself, and I can completely understand how the person feels. \nOne of the things I really liked was how they crossed out the option that normal unaffected people would choose.

Regardless, if you are patient enough to immerse yourself in the fictional character through the text, I think the experience warrants it. It employs one particularly clever trick - showing you options which you want to pick, but preventing you from picking them. This gives you (the person behind the keyboard) a sense of frustration, and through that, an understanding. Those banned options go through your characters head too but, like in real life depression, they [i]can't[/i] do them any more than you can click the buttons.\n\nIt has some story telling issues, the biggest of which was that time was poorly represented.

It\u2019s kind of sad. This may help put me in the mood and let me understand what depression is for some.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with depression in the past, and no, it\u2019s not fun. It\u2019s tiresome and\u2026 depressing (Lol, kind of like this review). But depression is a bit different from one person to another, so knowing how it was like for myself and some other people I\u2019ve been close to, I was curious about how this game would portray it.\n\nFirst and foremost, the writing is decent. Fortunately for the player, there aren\u2019t any serious flaws that derail the story completely. BUT, there definitely could\u2019ve been more elaboration on the character\u2019s past(s) or relationships with others. There was no real detail about the player\u2019s workplace, or even their boss. Having that relationship explored more could\u2019ve greatly helped the story, even if it was for a short moment. \n\nHalfway through the game, I just stopped caring about the outcome. Which is weird for me, since I\u2019ve trudged through some pretty boring interactive fictions in the past, including those old school text adventures very few people would ever want to play (unless you\u2019re into that sort of thing like me).\n\nTechnically, I found this game irritatingly lazy. There\u2019s no save function. I know this seems trivial, but even with the most homebrew of interactive fictions through platforms like Gargoyle or the InfoCom reader, there\u2019s usually a save function. If you find yourself bored wanting to quit to carry on later\u2026 YOU CAN\u2019T. You have no other choice but to start from the beginning.\n\nThe \u201cbranching\u201d story is misleading in the description above. This game is marketed as an interactive fiction with decent options to change the ending, but in reality, there isn\u2019t. Most people aren\u2019t going to play this more than once to realize this, but there is only one ending. Sure a couple words and things may be switched around or replaced, but it\u2019s a lie. Sure your \u201cstats\u201d may be a little better or worse, but it doesn\u2019t change the context of the game greatly enough to be considered truly interactive.\n\nAnd yes, I understand the crossed out options are options that would be available if you weren\u2019t depressed, but since you\u2019re given so little options, the variance is negligible. Therefore, replay value is at an all-time low. And even though I didn\u2019t want to, I replayed this sucker more than I wanted to. I even went with the worst options available to me, singling me out to depressing options (no pun intended), to see if I would have a super terrible ending\u2026 it never came.\n\nFrom personal experience with depression, I faced myself at the edge of a bridge considering suicide since I\u2019m a terrible swimmer. The choice of suicide never came in this game.\n\nI know this sounds absolutely terrible and I apologize to anybody that may be offended, but when you think the world is better off without you in it, you only drag the people around you down, that God has either forsaken you or isn\u2019t even there, or if you killed yourself the world wouldn\u2019t skip a beat, then yes\u2026 suicide, regardless of the stigma, is a viable option to somebody that is depressed, regardless of how terrible of a choice it may be.\n\nAn option for this could\u2019ve been suicide, then showing the aftermath of what it would do to the family and friends of the player.\n\nUnfortunately if this choice was made into the game, you never get acquainted well enough with your family and girlfriend enough to actually care. They overall seemed paper thin in character, and sure this detail may be thrown aside as a viewpoint of somebody that's depressed. I get that. But if you want to really grind at the readers views and heart, you need to connect them to the characters and their feelings, including the supporting characters. This may seem pretty basic, but the supporting characters are just as important as the main. And no matter how crappy this sounds, suicide could\u2019ve opened up another heartbreaker end game scenario in the fact that your new kitten would die of starvation because you killed yourself and nobody knew about it for, I dunno... let's throw out some arbitrary numbers: 4-5 days to a week at most.\n\nSo yes, I found this game lazy in mechanic and programming. From the lack of options, lack of ending, and lack of a save function. I felt like it always ended with a sigh with no resolution. Which is funny, since the writers at the end of the game thank you for playing stating, \u201cthere\u2019s no real end to depression.\u201d Which may be true, but I just found lazy. For a good story, there could still of been a resolution of what happened, even if it\u2019s, \u201cOh, nothing happened. You stayed depressed and went into a deeper spiral of darkness. Lost your job, and found yourself homeless.\u201d Or, \u201cYour girlfriend Alex, wanting to help you, excorted you to go see a therapist.\u201d Or, \u201cYour family, admitted you to a psyche ward, because they realized your depression got so bad, you weren\u2019t able to function in day to day tasks.\u201d OR, \u201cYour IM friend Attic, realized you didn\u2019t go see the therapist, attempted to get you help in person. You denied. So he called a Suicide help line.\u201d OR, \u201cANYTHING beyond the same thing, nearly every time.\u201d\n\nThe music was okay at first\u2026 then it got annoying. And in the end it seemed to actually add to the boredom I found with this game. It definitely didn\u2019t help the more times I played through it. Luckily there\u2019s a mute function in the menu, or you can always just mute your computer audio.\n\nBUT here are the pros\u2026\n\nI appreciate what the game attempts to do.\n\nThe pictures getting fuzzier and turning black and white was a nice touch.\n\nThe music getting a little distorted the more you get depressed was kind of a nice touch.\n\nI found no typos (unlike this review)\n\nFinal verdict:\nThis game should be Pong and Forgotten.\n3.7/10 \u2013 Not worth your time unless you\u2019re really curious. OR, you\u2019re a diehard interactive fiction novel gamer and want a taste of everything at some point, despite whether or not you\u2019d like it or not. Which unfortunately for me, I fell under this category.\n\nP.S. I'll probably make a video review of this on my YouTube Channel. I know this is shameless advertising, but idc. It'll probably get me some views and subs because of the whole gamergate crap.

Speaking from a depressed frame of mind I would say that it failed horribly and more demeaned depression that supporting it. Theres far too much focus on what the 'player' experiences than what they are feeling, which is kind of the point of depression. Things are difficult to do when you're depressed because you dont feel like it, not because the choice itself is hard. Striking through half the options doesnt make the choice harder, it makes it easier. When you're depressed every decision brings your life to a hold while you have to sort it out, you dont just click the closest option. \n\nNot sure if I got my point across at all well but the simple answer is no, this is not a good...

I believe that this is an accurate representation of a form of depression, not all forms, but a common form of it. This was an emotional game and definitely got to me, I teared up during some of text, started grinding my teeth, and felt multiple anxious 'heart drops' during the course of the game.

I felt like I was wheeling a wooden plank through a series of rooms, so lacking in personality or any distinguishable features that I found myself bored, and struggling to read the text that was telling me how I was 'feeling'. It worries me that the person this game is portraying is dull, boring, robotic. While some ambiguity and vagueness is needed in order for any player to put themselves in the character's shoes, I felt like that vagueness was taken to a point where we can no longer truly care for the character. \n\nI was also troubled by the lack of options. As someone who has experienced depression, I know that there are times where it feels like options are limited. But people don't express depression in the same way. I have been the person that, despite feeling like death inside, I went out, feigned happiness. I went out and did things, even if I wasn't being honest with people, and that was part of my problem. That was something I had to deal with for years, giving the appearance I was happy and healthy, when I wasn't. I was disappointed to find that so many of the options I'd have chosen, the options that would make sense to not just me, but probably many other people just trying to survive, and maintain the life one has, were just simply crossed out, as if the mere thought of doing such a thing was preposterous. \n\nI couldn't help but feel just a bit insulted by that.

It's even hard for people with a mental illness to understand in someone else, due to a large variety of factors, such as severity of symptoms, what those symptoms are, support network, etc. However, I think this game does a really good job of telling you exactly what it can be like.

However, there are a few things you should know before you get into it.\n\nIt is exactly what it says on the tin: an interactive (non)fiction game. \"Interactive fiction\" fits better than \"visual novel\" because it's almost entirely text-based. Sure, there are some accompanying pictures, but the text is the main focus. The \"(non)fiction\" label fits well because while the scenarios and characters are entirely made up, the underlying premises are very real. The descriptions of how the main character feels and what they're thinking are scarily accurate for someone suffering from depression. You can tell that the people who wrote this have firsthand experience with it.\n\nPlaying this made me anxious, not gonna lie. The breezy writing style lets you immerse yourself in the main character's persona, and I had some heart-poundingly anxious moments while playing this. The scene where you talk to Attic about what's going on damn near made me cry, because he said exactly what I needed to hear in that moment.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is how easy it is to railroad yourself onto the worst possible path, and end up with the \"bad ending.\" The choices you make at the beginning of the game have much more of an effect on the outcome than your later choices. The degree to which your options are limited in the last half of the game is a tad unrealistic; having been in the depths of this debilitating condition myself, I can say that even at my worst, I could still at least attempt to bring myself to do things that were blocked in the game. I found this unneccesarily restrictive. I understand that it's meant to illustrate the hopelessness that one often feels when deeply depressed, but it still felt unrealistic.\n\nBottom line: this game is not \"fun.\" It's not meant to be \"fun.\" It's meant to illustrate the struggles that depressed people go through every day of their lives, and I think it gets the point across really well.

For this reason I think this is an alright way to try to vaguely understand how someone with depression might be feeling.\n\nThis is just my advice. I do not recommend choosing the \"right\" responses based on what you know to be the best course of action. Try choosing options that are maybe a little isolated from people. Avoid what might be considered uncomfortable for an introverted person.

You know what you should feel like or what you should be doing but you just can't do it. It's just not possible. That also is a great way to show people who don't suffer what it feels like.

There are some misspellings and grammar errors but they are fairly minor. It's not particularly fantastic storywriting, but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be as accurate of a representation of depression as possible. Depression isn't romantic.\n\n I also don't feel like it portrays depression as being \"whiny\" as some people say, however it may seem that way because the person's feelings are unwarranted. This is actually a huge part of the problem of our societies' attitude toward depression - that it has to have a reason, that the person's feelings are invalid if they don't have a reason. This only makes people suffering with it feel worse. \n\nI feel like despite the fact that this plainly says it is not a \"game\", people still expect it to be. It's not, it's more like a visual novel. The reason choices are crossed out is to portray the idea that people with depression feel like some choices are IMPOSSIBLE. Whether they are or not, the person feels trapped by their own mind. If you go back and make different choices, you would find that choosing to open up, see a therapist, take antidepressants, etc. opens up more options. \n\nI DO wish it didn't end so abruptly - In particular, if you choose the options to not get better. This sounds really messed up, but I think the story could make more of an impact if it led to the character's suicide or self harm or something. As it is written, while the indicator at the bottom shows that you are getting worse, the story doesn't really describe it. It should delve deeper into the thoughts and feelings of the character, rather than just describing it as exhaustion, anxiety, etc. It doesn't describe the self-hatred, etc. of someone with severe depression. I think that's part of the reason people think the character seems \"whiny\". \n\nIs this game a perfect representation of depression? No. But it IS eye opening and perhaps could help some people relate to a person in their life that may be struggling with it. Depression is something that needs to stop being treated with a stigma, and it needs to be talked about more openly. Hopefully stuff like this can help with that.\n\nFinally, to anyone struggling with depression - You can make it through this. You're not worthless.

I had a good playthrough with mine so this is all coming from my personal experience. \n(Also anyone who plays this game I highly recommend you do something that cheers you up because it DOES get you down)\n\nThis game has hit close to home for me, I sympathize with the main protagonist on some levels. I have suffered from depression before and continue to face obstacles because of it. Before writing this review, I've noticed how people say \"this doesn't accurately represent what depression is like.\" Everyone is different. People go through depression differently be it extreme or mild. Besides this game is only giving us a basic idea of what it's like for someone to experience depression in their daily life. It may not have been how YOU experience it but that doesn't make the game completely inaccurate.  \n\nNow about the game itself, since you have to make choices in this game I actually appreciate having a \"back\" option to change your decision. Although there's no button on screen, you simply click the backspace button on your keyboard to go to the previous pages. I enjoyed reading the different outcomes and it helped to decide which route I'd rather take. \nDepending on the decisions you make, later in the game some of your choices will be scratched out. Often they are choices that may seem simple and the logical thing to do, but it's not that easy for your character who's having neverending battles with his/herself. More choices will be available to you, the player, when you make the right decisions and help your character fight against the depression. \n\nI must note that the audio caught my attention. The somber piano music is very mellow and slow. It is played on a loop but it honestly didn't seem repetitive to me. Each page or section in the game has more sound going on depending on the setting. There's a scene where your character is at a party and you can hear jibber jabber and party music all while the piano still plays. I think that's rather clever to keep the piano music. In my opinion it symbolizes the character's depression.

A positive review!\n\nDepression Quest was a very interesting game to play. I do not suffer from depression myself but I do have a few close friends who do. The actions that go on in the game are accurate to what my friends care to share about their situations. I like how the game brought me to the lowest place I could (it made me tear up at points) and I actually felt like what happened to the protagonist was happening to me. So, when a happy or improving moment came up, I felt like I was actually getting better. I know depression cannot be cured or solved, same as was addressed at the beginning and end of the game, but getting better is possible.\n\nThe game's physical qualities were also very cool. I really liked the static-looking effect applied to the \"status\" updates at the bottom of the pages. The sound effects were a really nice touch; they fit the scenes nicely enough where they did not distract me from the game's happenings. They provided good background noise so that each scene was not defeningly silent. I know that's a weird prase to say but, I often find it hrd to concentrate on reading something if there are no other sounds or noises happening and the silence itself is bothersome.\n\nThere were one or two spelling/grammar mistakes, but so little to the point where it does not take meaning away from the game's message. I really liked how Attic asked the protagonist for help for his personal issue; I felt good that I had the option to help him fter he helped so much before, I felt like I actually helped someone.\n\nOverall, a really good game. A great experience for someone without depression to get a glimpse of what someone with it experiences everyday. I wish more people could have apprecated it like I did. \n\n--Drew\n   3/27/2015", "timestamp_created": 1427437095, "timestamp_updated": 1427437095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15069294": {"recommendationid": "15069294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093047639", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1410721138}, "language": "english", "review": "I kinda liked the storyline for itself, kinda a nice little story for free.

BUT. Just in case the name and the description aren't clear enough, I'll say it here: THE CONTENT OF THE GAME MIGHT BE TRIGGERING TO PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION. Also, I STRONGLY disagree with the reviewers who said that the protagonist is just \"sad\" and not \"really depressed\". There isn't just ONE valid way to experience depression and it's really crappy to invalidate other people's experiences just because they don't match your own.\n\nSo, anyway, it took me a while to get into it, but once my choices actually started mattering I found the game to be enjoyable. I also liked the way that the static on the pictures changed depending on your current status; it's a minor detail but something that I think really added to the mood. The number of choices you could make were also affected by your status, which I thought was a nice gameplay touch even though I was super frustrated that it kept me from doing some of the things I wanted to do (which, of course, is the point of the game mechanic). While I would have liked more choices that were ambiguous (ie. not clear which the \"good\" one was), I did like that I was able to make similar choices in-game as I have done with my own life (and that the outcomes mirrored what happened in my situation as well). For me, playing through the game helped remind me of the struggles I've gone through, what I've overcome, and that it's okay that I still struggle with things.\n\nThat said, engine wise, I've played better Twine games. I am not sure if the devs were using an old version of Twine or what, but I didn't like how the three statuses (depression, therapy, and medication) were at the bottom of the page since that meant I couldn't just look at them whenever I wanted. I also found the writing to be clunky. In particular there was too much \"telling\" and not enough \"showing\", and also in the beginning your \"girlfriend\" was randomly written as \"significant other\" and in the middle of the sentence the pronouns would switch from being \"she/her\" to \"they/them\". I am pretty sure that it was just something missed in the editing process, but it did highlight for me that the game failed to ask me what my SO's gender and preferred pronouns were, which is something that all Twine games I've played have done.\n\nAnyway, this game is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it for someone who thinks they might be triggered by playing as someone who's depressed. But it's free and only 30 mins to an hour of gameplay for one playthrough, so if you're bored and in the right frame of mind why NOT play it?\n", "timestamp_created": 1426158773, "timestamp_updated": 1426158773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501119375228881836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14839940": {"recommendationid": "14839940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019560552", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1408180870}, "language": "english", "review": "Crap.", "timestamp_created": 1426094897, "timestamp_updated": 1426094897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489688277244567871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14815710": {"recommendationid": "14815710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045064896", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 154, "last_played": 1423191808}, "language": "english", "review": "Support this game and stand against the gamergate movement.", "timestamp_created": 1425947069, "timestamp_updated": 1425947069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492927789688110352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14809779": {"recommendationid": "14809779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032742599", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 51, "last_played": 1425876941}, "language": "english", "review": "I see a lot of reviews talking about how Depression Quest isn't a fun game, and at least one review saying that the game reduces the serious subject of clinical depression to being a whiny bitch.\n\nTo be honest, you should play the game. I finished it in 55 minutes, and I see a lot of the reviews played for a lot less time than that - to beat the game that much faster, you'd have to avoid reading which eliminates the point of playing a text-based game or you'd have to flake out part of the way through and write a review without fully understanding the subject of your own review, IE talking out of your ass.\n\nThis is not a fun game. If you've ever played Spec Ops: The Line or This War Of Mine, its one of those. This is a game expressly created to address the issue of depression in an interactive format. I'll get the gaming stuff out of the way first.\n\nFun: 0/10\nReactivity: 10/10\nEffort: 1010\nGraphics: 1/10\nGameplay: 1/10\nStory: 7/10\n\nThis is not a fun game. It was never meant to be fun, or feel like a heroic journey against impossible odds. This is a game designed to take the experience of being depressed, of feeling like you're a worthless piece of shit and nothing you do matters, and present that in a format where people who aren't depressed might understand. Since we've established that Depression Quest has little to no value purely as a video game, how does it meet that design goal?\n\nBased on my personal experience with the game, I'd say it does. It presents the feeling of being depressed in the long post-process paragraphs after you make decisions which your character reflects on. I'm not gonna lie - you're going to need to have a basic understanding of human empathy and need to be paying attention to read through the lines and see the emotions rolling around in the character. That said, that'd also be true if you were speaking with a person who is depressed and trying to open up to you.\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but somehow a free game about the experience of depression is controversial, as established by this game's history as kicking off the GamerGate lunacy. But as a simple unbiased player, I find this game unfun and a step to the side compared to what I normally go to video games for. However, that's the exact design goal of this game, and I feel it succeeds in what it was trying to do. Even the controversy can be interpreted as success, since more often than not depression in my society (USA) is interpreted as being a whiny bitch who won't take responsibility for themself.\n\nAs an experience, I give this game an 8/10, and I would recommend every gamer play this at least once.", "timestamp_created": 1425916781, "timestamp_updated": 1425916781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526057660579681396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14804157": {"recommendationid": "14804157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040493042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1407817046}, "language": "english", "review": "Depression got a hold of me\nDepression I gotta break free\nDepression got a hold of me \nDepression it's gonna kill me\n\nit's gonna kill you too.", "timestamp_created": 1425875069, "timestamp_updated": 1425875069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14803982": {"recommendationid": "14803982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125763212", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1425873201}, "language": "english", "review": "Why can't you make the main Character kill himself?\n", "timestamp_created": 1425873338, "timestamp_updated": 1425873338, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492332875728607178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14801478": {"recommendationid": "14801478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053381161", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1425855370}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This is a great game, its not a magic cure too depresion, its a experience, too see from another point of depression in a way that you can actually feel it.\nIf your looking for a game like any other dont try it, but if you want to see this sickness from another point of view or actually want to know how someone can feel it in way of its multiple manifestations i strongly recommend you to try it.", "timestamp_created": 1425855659, "timestamp_updated": 1425855659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14788760": {"recommendationid": "14788760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075656222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1425795895}, "language": "english", "review": "To the three developers of this game, Take it as a Criticism, a Harsh and yet a valid and constructive criticism, from someone who aspire to become a game developer.\nHonestly, were you even trying? My First issue with the game is the stup*d soundtrack, boring, and it becomes nuisance in no time, it's so terrible that i cannot even concentrate in the text, the very long and boring text about someone with a very shit*y life, after the first five pages a was like \"Ok, it will start anytime now\", but, a text without gameplay it's not a game, it doesn't have the any of the four basic element that consist a experience as a game, you beign developers, i think you should know what element are those, in case you don't know, fear not for you incapaity, i will listen those here, they are Alea (The Random factor in a game, Aka Luck Factor), Agon (The Competitive Factor, Aka Skill), Mimicry (The Roleplaying Factor) And Ilinx (The Vertigo Factor) The only factor i saw was roleplaying, you say the game brings the experience of someone who suffers from Deppression, i will come back to this later, right on the bat i see the first choice on the blocked, cleaver, giving limitations to the player to make the \"Game\" Challenging, i chose something, even if it's not what i would chose because what i would chose is not an option or it's blocked, but after some turns i just get annoyed by this design choice, i'm just chosing random things, making the \"Mimicry Factor\" not really there, but i'm feeling generous today, but every bolder choice that would be better if you where in the main character position only results in your own demise, beign blocked or becoming a unhappy cat owner, an i guess this is not how depression works, would you care to send me the contact of the psychologist or the psychiatric doctor that gave you consultorship for your project? Because that person is a incompetent, and that is a important thing, in any matter, developers can't say \"I Think\" about a problem this dangerous such as depression, you NEED consultory, you NEED someone who know what they are talking about and when your friend offers help to you YOU CANNOT EVEN GET THE F*CKING THERAPY RIGHT AWAY, the game make a huge burden for you to call the doctor, even if you should encourage depressed people to do so, well, since the soundtrack is stupid, the gameplay is non-existent and the content is bullcrap, the graphics must be Outstanding, Crysis Level sh*t, but they at it's best, Lookable, they don't hurt your eyes, but they are not an eye candy, the fonts are boring and the background is so bright that make the text feel take a huge effort to read, which should not happen in a TEXT BASED GAME, why not use the Visual Novel style? It's good enough for what you need and feel better, in general, by not making your text based experience feel like a 1-ton Burden, and i didn't even talk about the reused resources like the same photo beign used over and over again.\nNow, in all Honesty, how DARE you call yourselves Game Developers? People study, they learn, they work hard, they give they bests to produce and successfully release a Game, Japanese developers expend a great amount of money to release their games in conventions like Comiket, ocidental developers have to raise a great amount of money on IndieGoGo, Kickstarter, etc, and get past on Steam GreenLight, i've see so many people trying, and even small RPG Maker games made by some random kid deserve some praise, you know why? Because you can see they, even if they didn't know much, they gave they f*cking best, hell, I even defend Super Man 64 sometime because how ambitious the developers imagined the game and how DC broke they legs, but i can clearly see that you guys didn't even GAVE A F*CKING SHIT ABOUT YOUR GAME, Video-Games are Art, expression, text, media, imerssion and emergency, how Dare you Negglect those meanings so much and make this abomination? Hell, Big Huge Games Broke because they made Kingdoms of Amalur which is a great game, but didn't sold enough, they gave they best and it was not enough to those great developers going (Some of they even worked on games like Conkers and my eternally beloved series, The Elder Scrolls) and they could not keep it, And you get here by Sucking Balls, LITERALLY, Now it's time to get back to the depression point, and that's what i'm feeling now, i wanted to be parted of this industry my whole childhood, i learned what i could from what i had, read a lot of book in game development, and then, when i finally get in the university, i see this monstruosity, do you know how i felt? Broken, everything i idolized was now unholy and dirty, my passions and aspirations broken, and i'm not talking about this \"Gamer Jornalism\" Bullsh*t, it was always stupid to see people with no knowledge in games harshly criticizing thing they know shit about, as a Future Developer, i feel ashamed of you, and you should feel as well, your names may carry shame and hatred, people will remeber you not as developers, but as atention seeking morons, who think everything can be bought by the right price, but know, tha me, and many more like me, who are really passionate about we do, what we want to do, what we love to do, your ART, that you carry no weight for us, we will not be bought, we will not bow down, we will always give your best to make this industry better, and more acessible, a world where everyone can play, a world where everyone can develop, know that you will not stop us", "timestamp_created": 1425797438, "timestamp_updated": 1425797729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430000633001327515", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14788093": {"recommendationid": "14788093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166996658", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1425794125}, "language": "english", "review": "I doubt Zoe Quinn had permission to use the Netflix logo. 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1425793657, "timestamp_updated": 1425793657, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511042356491088867", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14783400": {"recommendationid": "14783400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139626414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 64, "last_played": 1425767489}, "language": "english", "review": "So it's so bad...I forgot to depress.", "timestamp_created": 1425766655, "timestamp_updated": 1425766655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479288965463638306", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14754474": {"recommendationid": "14754474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073761746", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1425616590}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't really care to get caught up in the hullabaloo that is \"The Five Guys Scandal\" in which the lead , Zoe Quinn, was accused by her boyfriend of sleeping with game journalists to leave an artifically large review.

I think it stands up on its own really well. I've held judgment of it because I never bothered to install it, but taking the leap to click play is one I'm glad I took. \n\nWhile the story itself is highly cliche and likes to play into a very simple monologue, it does give you a feeling of uncertainty as to what will happen with the decisions you make and what decision you will have to make next. As someone who suffers from clinical depression, I did find that it was somewhat accurate in the descriptions of how it feels to be depressed, to go to a therapist, and be on various medications to \"cure\" yourself. \n\nRegardless of the controversy behind the creator of the game, Depression Quest does a decent job of telling a story about a real life issue. Whether or not one can classify this as a \"game\" is a completely different topic, but it is a rather interesting way to engage an audience through a different medium than ones that are more commonly used (like speeches, books, etc.). In my mind, there's no difference between Depression Quest and visual novels, because neither is focused on the typical aspects of a video game like graphics, gameplay, or performance. Rather, it wants you to invest your time much like you would with reading a novel. It is only a matter of what medium Quinn uses to convey the story.\n\nOverall, you shouldn't expect much out of this title. It took me exactly 52 minutes to complete the story. However, you shouldn't be expecting a whitewash, cut-and-paste tale about how depression is bad and how it can affect you. If you do choose to install Depression Quest, I would recommend you to not go in expecting a triple A-class story, but you also should not be expecting a narrative that wants you to hold pity for the protagonist. \n\nI would rate the overall experience of Depression Quest a decent 6 out of 10. The story is flat in some parts, and many other parts seem to be shoehorned in for no apparent reason; however, the writing is eloquent enough for you to hold interest long enough to complete the story.

I wasn\u2019t that much informed about how and why it started but the gist of it was that a few female game developers were getting harassed and they blamed male gamers for it. This, as you could imagine, split the internet in two where one side was saying that all gamers are chauvinistic males who hate all women that have anything to do with games while the other side claimed that female developers were just trying to gain attention and whenever they weren\u2019t given, they would scream how everyone hates them simply for being female. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less. I don\u2019t mind girls playing games. I play games with my wife all the time and I\u2019m hoping to get my daughter to play games with us one day too and picking either side seemed wrong.\n\n[h1] I couldn't find a reason to NOT give this game a try [/h1]\n\nOne of the people who was deeply involved with \u201cGamer Gate\u201d was Zoe Quinn, a game developer. I really can\u2019t remember but I think she claimed that some gamers harassed her about her games saying how they are terrible simply because she was a female game developer. One of those games was this one: \u201cDepression Quest\u201d. Obviously, I had no intention of buying a game simply to see what the fuss was about but\u2026 the game is free, so there really was nothing stopping me from trying it out.\n\n[h1] Ever wondered how depressed people feel? Now you might get an idea... [/h1]\n\nDepression Quest is a game that\u2019s supposed to help NON-depressed people understand a little better how depressed people feel and, after playing this game, I feel like I understand it a little better.\n\nAs much as I\u2019d like to give you a sob story about how I too was depressed when I was young, I don\u2019t want to lie. I don\u2019t think I have ever been depressed, even when my parents got a divorce, I always found a way to keep a smile on (mostly because of video games). \n\n[h1] A choose-your-own-adventure game where you have choices that you can't make [/h1]\n\nDepression Quest is a choose-your-own-adventure kind of game with a little interesting twist.  You will spend the majority of your time reading about how you live your life each day only to make a choice at the end of each page about what you will do next. You are a person who is suffering from depression. While you seem to be leading a somewhat normal life, there is undeniable sadness, lack of motivation and anxiety in you that is slowly but surely making you more depressed. As you read through the pages and make your choices, you will slowly become less or more depressed. This is where that interesting twist comes into play. Normally you have at least 3-5 options available at the end of each day, however, the top ones, which are the less depressive choices, are crossed out. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that this is something Zoe Quinn wanted us to understand about depression. I \nbelieve, she wanted people to realize that when a depressed person gets to make a choice, they simply can\u2019t make optimistic, fun or exciting choices because of their condition. \n\nEven though a depressed person knows that they should be dancing on the dance floor with their loved one, they simply can\u2019t make themselves do it because of their depression so they awkwardly try to avoid as much contact as possible.\n\n[h1] Your goal is to become happier or, at least, less depressed [/h1]\n\nWhile you don't really get to read about most of the top choices in this game, they are still very visible even though they are crossed out. This is a good motivator to help your character improve. You want your character to feel happy enough to make the top choices. \n\nAs you become happier with yourself, the topper choices start unlocking, but if you don\u2019t try hard to improve and avoid all help, you start becoming more depressed, meaning, you start losing the amount of choices you have (even the ones in the middle and the lower ones). If you don\u2019t do anything to try and get over depression, you will sink so deep that you will have no other choices but to exclusively do the most depressing thing (only the very bottom choice will be available to you).\n\n[h1] Not much to talk about in the graphics department [/h1]\n\nThe graphics are non-existent. You will mostly be reading page after page of text with an occasional photo. The more depressed you get the blurrier and messier the text gets and the happier you get, the clearer it all becomes. \n\nThe game is, unsurprisingly, really short. It took me about 30 minutes to get through the game on my first play through and every other one took less. \n\n[h1] I was pleasantly surprised [/h1]\n\nDespite the length and the minimalistic graphics and gameplay I really enjoyed this little game.  While I certainly don\u2019t understand depression and what depressed people go through every day, I think this game opened my eyes a little about this serious condition. I still don\u2019t want to take sides about \u201cGamer Gate\u201d, I am thankful to Zoe Quinn for making this free game.\nIf you have half an hour and are in a mood for a choose-your-own-adventure game with a unique twist, then give \u201cDepression Quest\u201d a go. While what the game tries to inform you about is no laughing matter, this game can be fun.\n\nNext game: Desert Child\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/844050/\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

Actually, i think i could say don't expect a game at all. It's an introspective and interactive reading that will put you in the shoes of a young man suffering from depression and social anxiety, and will put you in front of some choices that will affect the story and the \"finale\". [i]Depression Quest[/i] has been created from people that lived depression in first person, and is trying to make people that doesen't know it understand what it REALLY is, and help those that are experiencing it. Personally, i think that to live fully this game experience, you should know FOR REAL what are we talking about. A person that is a complete stranger to the concept of REAL depression, might find the game superficial and boring, thinking the you just have to make the \"right\" or the \"healthy\" decision to beat it. But it's not exactly like that. Personally, i loved the experience, loved the story, loved some characters. Could it be because i see myself in them, i don't know, but i don't care. I find that it's a good game, and i recommend it to everyone that wants to take a journey to discover this disease, or REdiscover his prospectives about it. The ONLY bad thing about this game, is that there's NOT a SAVE OPTION. It's true that, if you're Flash at reading, the game only lasts 30 minutes or so, but damn, if like me you're a person that takes things slowly and calmly, you will restart the game from the very beginning at least 2 times. So, try to play it all in one take, maybe in a lazy afternoon with nothing to do.\n\n[b]Italiano[/b]: \n\n[u]Partiamo subito col dire che per giocare a questo gioco bisogna saper leggere BENE l'inglese. La lettura \u00e8 parte fondamentale di quest'esperienza di gioco, e andare avanti di traduttore e \"the cat is on the table\" sarebbe frustrante se non impossibile. Questo putroppo rende il gioco non alla portata di tutti, ma le cose stanno cos\u00ec. Speriamo tentino di tradurlo, un giorno.[/u]\nDetto questo, non aspettatevi il solito gioco. Si potrebbe addirittura dire \"non aspettatevi un gioco\" e basta. E' una lettura interattiva che vi metter\u00e0 nei panni di un ragazzo che soffre di depressione e ansia sociale, mettendovi davanti a delle scelte che andranno ad influenzare il corso degli eventi ed il \"finale\". [i]Depression Quest[/i] \u00e8 stato creato da gente che ha vissuto la cosa in prima persona, e tenta di far capire a chi non ci \u00e8 mai passato cosa si provi, e di aiutare chi invece sta vivendo il problema. Personalmente, credo che per vivere pinamente quest'esperienza di gioco, bisogna conoscere bene di che cosa si sta parlando, e non solo per senito dire. Una persona totalmente digiuna al concetto di depressione VERA, potrebbe trovare il gioco superficiale e noioso, pensando che basti fare sempre la scelta \"giusta\" o la scelta \"sana\" per completare bene il gioco. Ma non \u00e8 esattamente cos\u00ec.\nPersonalmente, ho amato l'esperienza, adorato la storia, e mi sono affezionato ad alcuni personaggi. Sar\u00e0 perch\u00e9 mi ci rivedo molto, ma francamente non importa. Lo trovo un bel gioco, e lo consiglio vivamente a chiunque voglia intraprendere un viaggio per scoprire questo disagio, o riscoprire le proprie prospettive a riguardo. L'unica, e intendo UNICA pecca, \u00e8 la mancanza di un opzione di salvataggio. E' vero che se sei Flash a leggere, il gioco dura a malapena mezz'ora, ma diamine, se come me sei una persona che se la prende molto con calma, ti ritroverai a dover rincominciare tutto daccapo pi\u00f9 volte.

Visual novels tend to have images of the characters and backgrounds, which is part of its style and appeal.  Suffice it to say that it wasn't a great leap for me to switch over to the \"gameplay\" in Depression Quest.\n\nThis game seems to set out to give the reader a taste of what it's like dealing with depression, although realistically it can't cover every possible life scenario such as class, gender, orientation, race, etc.  It describes the struggles of whether or not to include those close to you in your treatment, to see a therapist, to get on or continue with medication.  Learning about things like the 'feedback loops' that were mentioned can be life savers to folks dealing with depression.  To quote the old GIJoe cartoon, \"Knowing is half the battle\" and insofar as presenting the information in an interesting, descriptive manner, I think this game does that quite well.  It's a well-crafted game, although I'm not sure how well its replay value would be.\n\nMy one gripe is very much with the music.  The piano riff put me in a negative mood before I read word one of the game.  I don't expect hyper anime-style music, but maybe something a little more neutral in tone would have been more suitable.\n\nI will recommend this game as it did resonate with my own personal struggles with depression and presented the information in a straightforward, entertaining manner.", "timestamp_created": 1423404798, "timestamp_updated": 1423404798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491114974021911621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "14374363": {"recommendationid": "14374363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087610435", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1424894751}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good insight to what goes on in the life of the depressed.

I have never seen a single book, visual novel, movie, show, article, website, etc. give a proper understanding of depression. No healthy mind can understand a suffering one. (Well, there are some exceptions to this yet I am speaking of the majority of healthy minds) We simply don't have the ability to understand the extent. It is simply cruel to expect that of a game made by a limited number of people. They did their best to explain the mental suffering to those who have no issue with it. Also, the majority of the public is quite sensitive to issues as suicide and thoughts of suicide. This did a fantastic job at not giving too much visualization for those who are sensitive yet just enough to still show them the severity. \n\n     The next problem, is that people point out it is not a \"game\".  This is a visual novel. At no point was it intended to be a game in which you could play and enjoy. It gives you choice as to what you should do yet it does not tell you to \"play\" it per se. \n\n     Finally, many people say that it offers little choice and simply tells you a story. Yeah...no shiz. It is a visual \"novel\". This means that it is supposed to give an experience instead of let you play a lot. The choices you make do affect the outcome but the goal is the same. To speak to you about depression. The choices you make are determined by earlier choices. This shows the \"player\" that if you stay in one mind-set, things will continue down that path.\n\nAnyways, that is all I have to say. I quite liked this game and don't feel that it is being judged correctly. People become really harsh to games with sensitive topics and I just wanted to give a nice review for this. I don't mean to offend anybody and if I have, I thoroughly apologize. I have little experience at a lot of things and hope that people don't take my words too seriously.

Every single choice you make leads you to exactly ONE alternate snatch of text, and then directly back to a screen which you'd have wound up on if you had made any other choice. On top of that, the game does NOT tell a cohesive story, with a beginning, middle, and end. out of nowhere, you get a screen explaining to you that it didn't have an ending, because depression never ends (oh I see, it's completely insurmountable, good to know). \n\nI could forgive all of this if the game was simply able to cause me to empathize with sufferers of depression, but in that, and many other regards, it utterly fails. The people heralding this as a grand artistic step for video games absolutely baffle me.

I do feel though that's just there to show what he'd choose if he was mentally capable to at the current moment(most of the time if chosen right it might become available) and not so deeply affected by his depression.\n\nRegardless though playing this game helped me realize(or rememebr more clearly/understand) quite a bit about myself since I used to feel some aspects of depression after some events in my life occurred and I thought I couldn't be happy after them. I did figure out a way to get past them and got rid of habits, some mentioned here such as going to bed at a healthy time and helping others. A lot of this is real life and can happen to any of us. Depression hits you randomly but you gotta be strong enough to break from it. Granted its hard but encouraging yourself and others can do a lot of good to help those feelings melt away.\n\nI would recommend a friend to play this at least a few times if you enjoy real life themed games cause this one is written pretty well for how generic it might seem to be layed out.

The best ending in the scenario presented isn't necessarily the right one in real life.

There are still a lot of people who think it's a choice/lifestyle. I think DQ busted that myth just fine, but it's not always evident when someone is depressed and there is a spectrum of kinds of depression. There isn't always consistency with depression.

It doesn't fit the mold of what a \"modern\" computer game is. Us old fart garmers will remember this type of gaming experience with fondness.\n\nThat being said, I can really only reccommend  the game for people who want to experience or learn about clinical depression or people who want to deal with their clinical depression in a positive way.\n\nIt is ingenious in its audacity and for tackling an often overlooked mental disease. It is innovative for its attempt to recreate the experience of a disease at a very realistic level. All the little things are there, such as the thought among many depressives that they don't actually have a disease when they are able to deal with it effectively (yes, that is a real thing) or excusing your tiredness for simply being tired, instead of the effects of a disease. Effects on concentration, focus, seeking diversion (as a result of the disease, not as a way to find enjoyment as it is with many people), social anxiety, interpersonal relationships, and others are all modeled. It takes the form of a choose-your-own-adventure (as interactive fiction generally is) and so there is some replay value to it. I personally played it several times and, since I don't know how the different paths of the game are determined, it's actually kind of fun (yes, in that ruminating depressive sort of way!) to tease out how the choices are rendered.\n\nThis is a game that does not have a wide appeal and is a very niche product. It is a game that has a therapeutic effect for suffers and/or is a way for the curious to \"play\" with the disease and challenge some preconceptions of yours or your preconceptions of those who suffer from the disease.

Depression Quest is an interactive educational simulation about living with depression. It attempts to use game mechanics to communicate to the player what living with depression feels like. The mechanics are simple and certainly nothing revolutionary. But what makes me excited about this game is that to me it serves as an indicator that the medium of video games is maturing to a point where games can start to cover serious topics like this and tell deeply personal stories.\n\nThe game of Depression Quest is basically a text-only roleplaying experience that repeatedly presents you with a scenario and then offers you several choices of how to deal with a the presented scenario. For instance, your in-game girlfriend may call you up and ask you if you'd like to attend a birthday party. You're then given several choices like \"attend\" or \"politely decline\" or \"say you're not feeling well\" or something like that. The catch is that while you can see all of the options, the ones you can actually select are almost always limited based on how depressed you're feeling. There's a few blurbs of text near the bottom of the screen which essentially serve as your \"depression meter\" and as you get better or worse, more or fewer options are available to you. As far as a simulation of depression goes, it was pretty effective. Sometimes you can see the option you'd really like to choose, but you just can't pick it, which is kind of frustrating.\n\nThe game states that its authors have personally struggled with depression before which makes Depression Quest's story feel very authentic. Now I'm not sure if it was the quality of the writing or how personal it felt, but I was alarmed at how many times the writing really struck a chord and resonated with me. There were many times where I was like \"Oh wow, I think that to myself all the time\". Again, I've never struggled with the serious, deep kind of depression this game is about, but those thoughts I had were a testament to how relatable the writing is even to someone who doesn't know much about the subject matter.\n\nAs someone who has never personally dealt with depression before, this game was a very educational tool for me and I'm very glad that this game exists. I hope it helps to raise awareness of what exactly depression is and how the people suffering from it can feel limited in their lives. I also hope that this can influence more developers to make more really personal experiences like this game. It's probably less than an hour long, but it's totally free and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a personal game or anyone who would like to try to roleplay what it's like to live life with depression\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/", "timestamp_created": 1417215733, "timestamp_updated": 1417215733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455175071954727173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13118041": {"recommendationid": "13118041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076350489", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 73, "last_played": 1417160479}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, well worth the simple hour it took me to finish.

There are very focused aspects about procrastionation and how despite wanting to do work your mind trails off to Youtube or Tumbler.\nMy only problem with this game is that most of the time, having a girlfriend is the most overpowered aspect of your protagonist that helps get your person out of depression.\nI've only played thorugh this once, but from it i simply chose options that made our relation ship open and honest so that she can help with the depression. Im not sure if shell be helpful for each playthorugh but from this, it felt a bit too easy.\nWhat if you dont have a Girlfriend and your numerous attempts and rejections account towards your depression?\nWhat if this, along with your inability to open up to family [in my playthorough family sucks], spirals you further into depression so that when your friends offer an ear, you decline because if you cant even tell your parents, who can you trust?\nI know that for me personally i deal with alot of problems with finding a significant other and it hurts alot, but because my family and friends encourage me to open up with them i dont feel bad about not having one. But honestly if you're having a serious depression crisis, would you be willing to accept any help unless you have someone who you can depend on completly because you love them? That's what a relationship offers you, so unless you have REALLY persistent friends or family, then youll be stuck.\n\nIt would be an AMAZING expansion to have a hardcore difficutly [what is this Halo? YOU CASUAL!] where you dont have a girlfrined [or even better you just lost her], your parents are oblivious to your depression, no therapist, and your friends arent persistent to give you help. Digging yourself out of this would be a real challenge.\n\nAlso, im not sure if this is implimented, but a few choices could also have a few perma perks or hinderences like how getting a cat adds the option of playing with it. Such as if you try to down the cup of whisky to \"loosen up\" for your girlfriend, you might develop alcoholism. Or if you Chose not to do work and not get motivation to continue working, you might be without a job and furthermore, without a place to live O.O idk, something i just thought about.\n\n9.5/10 [cuz if felt a bit short but definalty a good read for a hour]", "timestamp_created": 1417042229, "timestamp_updated": 1417042229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13083404": {"recommendationid": "13083404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024959089", "num_games_owned": 738, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1416955010}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is simplistic in graphics and gameplay, it's true. After all, it's a visual-novel like game. But the main theme, depression, is portrayed through music, writing and most importantly -lack of- choices. If you are used to playing games where you're supposed to win, this game is not for you. It's really disappointing to shoot an enemy only to find out they are invulnerable. But the point of Depression Quest is exactly this.\n\nI went through depression and I believe it's different for everyone. To me, it was pretty accurate. Though I was single during most of it and one can argue the game is 'easy' because you have a significant other in it. If you're unemployed, single, poor and your family is not supportive; it's the expert mode of the game. I guess if those were true for Depression Quest, it would be much, much longer and many wouldn't bother to play.\n\nI had fun playing it, though my description of fun might be different than yours. I love stories that makes me think, cry, or just makes me feel intensely. I felt saddened at times, chucked at others. If you went through depression, this makes you feel kind of nostalgic, and silly in the hindsight. If you aren't, it's still worth playing. When you're overwhelmed with negative feelings it's hard to see what leads to recovery and what contributes to the negative feedback loop. In its simplistic way it shows the exact way to recovery.\n\nIf you know someone who is suffering from depression, this game can make you relate. To outsiders it seems easy, just be happy, right? But some options are in fact crossed out just like how it was in the game. You need to be understanding and patient to help them get through. They can read even the tiniest disappointments and it can be really hard to speak out, because it's damn embarrassing. Try to not take their reluctance personally. It can be hard, but usually you're their only support and it's a big responsibility. Act on it.\n\nThis is not a conventional game with clear objectives and straightforward ending. It's closer to real life and it can be considered what's called an art game. Its dull graphics and sad music is contributing to the depression theme and not a minus to me. And please, please consider the fact that it's a free game.\n\nI only got to one ending and even though it was a good one it was still overwhelming. I'll try other branches and endings as well, but I need some time before I do. Oh, by the way, if you clicked on a wrong option, you can go back by pressing backspace.

I\u2019m not sure if I was just dealing with grief or if I genuinely was depressed, but I played it hoping I could get an answer. My views are personal as a result.\n\nI found the options for what I could do to be more restricting as the game went on, unnecessarily so to the point where I found it harder to feel immersed in not even being able to try to do some of the things I\u2019d like. Considering I did get medicine and psychiatric help after the devastating end to my long-distance 5 year relationship, I\u2019d have like to know where I would have been for pursuing the same type of help in the game. Some choices in general, particularly the ones that didn\u2019t allow me to talk about my problems, created a greater disconnect between my feelings and the protagonist. In particular, moments where I would simply \u201cchoose\u201d not to allow my girlfriend Alex to understand my gnawing feelings that she may to be with someone else--uncannily like my own situation--were extraordinarily frustrating. The fact that the game was becoming linear at the moment I began to actually identify wit the protagonist made this feel like a lost opportunity to me.\n\nEither I\u2019m too wrapped up in my own thoughts to truly empathize with the protagonist, or the developers failed to get a reliably feasible representation of what it means to feel depressed. If it\u2019s the latter, it definitely comes in part from the emphasis on feeling doubtful for anything rather than the actual struggle it takes to pull-through with wanting to save yourself from yourself, which would have made the game give more agency to the player as well as accurately portray how depression is a behemoth of a challenge to feel you can overcome, not a parasite that forces you to make choices you don\u2019t want to.\n\nWhile the atmosphere left me ready to cry some more, the game wasn\u2019t immersive enough to make the experience feel well-executed.

I know that sounds like an excuse, but believe me. I've clocked in one playthrough of it and in that one playthrough, more thoughts crossed my mind than any 12 hours spent on a typical shooter of your choice. In fact, I think it's wrong for me to even bring up the term 'shooter' as though in comparison because shooters are games. That's something many people who criticise this tend to complain most about. That this is a poor excuse for a game. In doing so they miss the biggest and most powerful message that this game does it's ultimate best to send.\nDepression is not a game.\n\nI've read plenty of complaints about this game from people who do have depression that found this game insulting or offensive. The last thing I, or Depression Quest, want to do is devalue those people and their experiences. But I can assure you that the opening message of the game openly admits that it's only trying to give a semblance of depression and what it's like, though they can not, in fact they can never, fully encapsulate everything about it. No two experiences of depression are the same, something the multiple choice nature of this story can only reach for. The game is honest about itself, which I think everyone at least can appreciate. It's not the be-all, end-all definition of depression. It's a taste, based on a limited experience set to try and share the pain that is experienced in the real world.\n\nIf you have depression, the game warns you beforehand what you're getting into. You may not get along with this game, which is completely okay.\nAs for me? I do not have depression. Nor do I understand depression. But Depression Quest did for me what it set out to do. It showed me - if only just a little - a little of what it's like. In an ironic use of the word, it's through 'play' that I'm given a bit on insight into how hopeless life can be. This is a game that teaches and shares. It might not be music that resonates with you, but the important thing is that it's heard. And I heard it.\nAnother complaint I've read is that your 'character' has no personality and is an empty protagonist. Again, something has been missed. This is a game told through written 2nd-person narrative. You are the main character. This is your life that you're playing through and these are your decisions. How restricted you are is how restricted you could be if you had depression. How you're told that you're feeling is how you could be feeling if you had depression. The game is saying through it's presentation of the story and 'main character' that this could be you. This could be your life. And for some people, this is their life.\nYou're given choices on how to make decisions on what to do, some of which are completely inaccessable. Even though you know that it's there, you can't do it. You're told often how you feel and what your mental state is, so sometimes you'll try to do what seems like the right thing only to realise that your character is only feeling worse. You'll wonder what the right choice was, or even if there ever was a right choice to begin with. Again, not everyone faces the same kind of depression, but to see into the eyes of even one kind is... eye-opening. And regardless of how it ends, you can't simply resolve everything because, once again, this isn't a game. This is life. This is depression. This is no idealised, escapist happy ending for feeling better. This is depression awareness.\n\nIn summation, no. This game is not fun. You are not meant to have fun playing it. You are meant to think, to consider, to choose and possibly to feel. If that's not what you want, if this isn't what you're looking for, walk away. But if you're up for it, dive. Dive right in. This is less of a game and more of an experience. An experience with depression for those unenlightened to it. Even if you disagree with it and it's portrayal, that's all the more reason to try it.\nI promise. Devote yourself to one playthrough and you'll come away with something meaningful. Positive or negative, this is a game that redefines what games can be and what they can live up to. This is something more games should aspire to try and perfect.\n\nSo yes. I recommend it.

It's not about trying to find the best outcome for your character, or watching them fall into ruin. It's about you and how you would cope. (and if you didn't do so well even after investing yourself into the game maybe it's time to talk to someone. That said I'm not a trained professional, not that you should ignore me)\n\nI'm not sure why I got an ending that made me feel hopeful in just one playthrough. What it has done is given me an impression that this was a well thought out game that, if played right, can be a rewarding experience. Realistic was a word used to describe it. \nHowever, I can't entirely agree with that description because depression can contain a myriad of situations, and it would be inaccurate to say the scope of this game covers all of those factors.\nThat is why for the purpose of having an indepth experience the player should try immersing themselves as best they can in the role of the character. Temporarily, it hopefully goes without saying. Just like DnD.\n\nWhat stops most people from picking it up is one word.\nGame.\nDespite the vast amount of information out there right at people's fingertips (first-world countries at least)I'm still not sure why some still see things in black and white.

Fun is only one thing that games provide ohhhh snap.\n\nI'd recommend this game. Most of you playing might not get the ending that will make you leap for joy, but them some of you have never had depression, not that having it is the only criteria to enjoying the game.

The game may have a different effect on non-depressed people, but to me it was a frightening, affirmative and strangely relaxing experience all at once. \n\nIt's funny how people complain about the non-activeness and whether this is a game or not. Of course it's a game: you make decisions that have an impact on the ending. The gameplay itself is a direct reflection of depression: the correct answers are right in front of you yet you can't reach them; they're crossed out. Of course meeting your friends and opening up about your feelings is the right way to go, but somehow there's this invisible barrier that prevents you from doing so. There's also no indication of how many days/weeks/months/years have passed in the game. Every day starts out the same and ends with the same nagging daily grind/groundhog day feeling of failure. Many depressed people have a warped sense of time like that.\n\nThe writing is fantastic. The protagonist has enough character to make you feel sympathetic towards him, yet at the same time he's enough of a blank slate to project your own experiences on him. I do not have the exact same condition as him, but with every incident that occured this \"yes! I can relate\"-feeling grew and grew. Maybe the writing failed non-depressed people but to me it was spot-on.\n\nI found two or three typos and the music was a bit distracting at first, but you get used to it quickly. \n\nI recommend giving the answers you would in real life (if they're available), it gives you an interesting insight into yourself. Throughout the game this exact nagging feeling I described overcame me more that once as I tried to get by with my evasive answers. I didn't get the \"good\" ending, yet the game left me in a somehow positive, affirmative mood. \nI am not alone in this.

Slightly ironic that these are the same people claiming their issues are about ethics in games when they give such biased reviews themselves.
