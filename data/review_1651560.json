As the overseer of my quaint village, the gentle rhythm of growth and prosperity resonated with the laid-back charm that sets Fabledom apart in the realm of city builders.\n\nThe heartwarming essence of the fairytale setting infused every aspect of gameplay. From the quaint cottages to the bustling marketplaces, each building breathed life into the village, creating a tapestry of charm that made every moment a joy to behold. The meticulous attention to detail in the design and the gentle soundtrack transported me to a world where the magic of storytelling seamlessly intertwined with the mechanics of city building.\n\nOne of the unique delights Fabledom presented was the element of diplomacy and trade, where interactions with neighboring settlements were more than just transactions. Navigating alliances and friendly competitions added a layer of strategy that balanced the serene pace of the game. The choices to either forge alliances or embark on friendly challenges provided a refreshing twist to the typical city-building experience, making each decision feel meaningful and impactful.\n\nThe pursuit of a royal romance, a key element in Fabledom, added a fairy tale touch that warmed my heart. The delightful prospect of finding a prince or princess not only added a personal narrative to the game but also became a charming goal to aspire toward. The interpersonal dynamics and the ripple effect on the village's prosperity added a layer of emotional investment that made the journey all the more engaging.\n\nIn the end, as my village flourished and the bonds with neighboring settlements grew, Fabledom became a haven of tranquility and joy. The harmony of city-building, diplomacy, and the pursuit of true love created an experience that felt like living within the pages of a storybook. Fabledom stands as a testament to the magic that can be woven when gameplay and fairy tales coalesce, providing a haven where players can immerse themselves in the art of crafting their own happily ever after.\"", "timestamp_created": 1700445088, "timestamp_updated": 1700445088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150424631": {"recommendationid": "150424631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137264407", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 491, "playtime_at_review": 376, "last_played": 1700419178}, "language": "english", "review": "Lost 6 hours in one session, and was very pleasantly surprised by the game in early access.

I wanted a simple city builder that wasn't just buildings. I wanted interactions with characters, challenges, and the option to play \"freestyle\" without worrying about time passing or funds. This game satisfies my Zoo Tycoon needs. \n\nCute character designs and city details. Chill music, nothing too distracting or anxiety-inducing - option to turn the music down, and I'm guessing off completely but I haven't tried. Two options to play with limitations (ex: starting with low funds) or play \"creatively\" where you have limitless resources. Easy controls, easy build options, quick tutorial... Love the objectives - constant flow of new challenges, messages, announcements, etc. to take on with the option to dismiss or delay the challenge. Lots of flexibility so you can play the game how YOU want to play, even if you select the standard play option.\n\nI was worried it would be a farming sim - although there is farming, it's not the highlight and you don't have to physically move the character and press A or B a million times to uproot carrots. It does it automatically when you assign a worker to the farm, so you get the taste of farming without any of the repetitive actions I've come to dislike so much in the wave of farming sims that have flooded the gaming world. \n\nI don't have a good gaming computer, so my only complaint so far is self-inflicted: the graphics are too much for my computer, so it runs a little slow on startup and when autosaving.

Not yet. \n\nI really wanted to love this game.. The magical creatures showcased, the fun chill management, and i loved seeing the progress they were posting in their logs- and now, after having \"totally legally\" tried it when it first came out, and whilst it was very flawed, i saw they had updated it a lot and i decided, now its time to give it a go! Bought it, now im refunding.. It has fundamental flaws, and ones unfixed - it isnt worth your time or money yet, if you are already on the fence about it.\n\nSo first of all i found out, after only 15 min that apparently when i used winkey+prntscr for a screenshot of some funny text, that the game would hang (this isnt reliable, i couldnt replicate?) despite running smoothly, and then crash, and it took me another 10 min, trying to reload back into my auto save to get back, it would crash repeatedly, and then finally for no reason would let me back in - there was also some graphical glitches associated with it, like the ground texture being completely black. I eventually figured out that the ultra settings (im on a beefy system and it ran highest with very high fps) somehow the game would bug out graphically or crash. So was forced to play on medium settings..\n\nAs for the actual gameplay itself, it has a cute gameplay loop and a lot of neat and fun ideas but it suffers from a few things - for a relatively chill looking casual game, it actually manages to put you in a perpetual under-powered state, leaving you constantly feeling struggles once you reach the \"second act\" or whatever you wanna call it. And it becomes kind of a dull repeated struggle, and limits your progression, it sort of went from \"oh look we're having fun, and chilling\" to banished like management of \"your people are dying every winter!\" and the fundamental issues in design really showed their face here, you get too little people, to manage your buildings, even when played perfectly & with prior knowledge. \n\nThe problem isnt so much the difficulty though as it is that, it doesnt feel satisfying, being left with excess nothing, feeling like you didnt really progress. And meeting the \"noble goals\" is almost entirely imbalanced early game, being if your goal structure isnt already built (like if your goal is to catch fish, and you have just placed the building to be constructed, which happens often because you are progressing in the game and they pop up as you unlock them) theres 0 chance you can manage in time. It was kind of 50/50 if the goal was achievable or not. Again i think this game is suffering from a crisis of \"am i a hard game, or a relaxed cute looking game\" and being left in a position that constantly doesnt feel like \"i could have done better with this\" but instead \"well this is just unfair and unreasonable with what i was able to do with the population i been given\" \n\nAnd some other minor gripes, is that - theres no variation besides \"skin color\" in the people you get, everyone just looks like the same fat eggman dude or the same eggman looking woman, with only slight difference.. And they dont actually seem to have any level of life or soul in them, you cant really follow them around and name them and care about them, well.. you can if you try and make up your own story in your mind, but it doesnt come to play in game, which i feel is a lost opportunity, in many other management games, you have someone that you know what they do \"oh john/jane doe here is a farmer, and he's been struggling with their tasks and making due and likes to go to the bar in the evening\" or whatever, you end up with \"another mindless eggman drone\" - and i genuinely thought and hoped that this game would bring more life into the mix. And if you enter it thinking or hoping it will, you're be a bit let down im afraid\n\nThe Encounters are interesting and i love a lot of the mechanics, however, they also suffer a bit from \"i dont know what i want to be as a game\" be it hard, or relaxed, indept and following your \"heroes\" or just a \"this is military unit #7\" I think the game needs more identity and love in terms of \"the people and personalities\" and very much needs to ease up on the gas, or at least go harder and deeper on the petal. This in between life doesnt mesh well and isnt working out as a pleasant experience. \n\nI hope this has helped you. Ill leave some design suggestions\n- allow trading earlier and easier, so you can exchange resources \n- give more people, or increase effective output \n- give people more life and interaction, talking & going to have a meal or a drink, relationships!\n- give people variation and not just eggman#32... If they MUST have THE SAME body and face, at least give them hats/clothes? But id much rather be able to identify them. Make them people\n- when played \"optimally\" the game doesnt feel like you have much choice, id like to VIABLY be able to have more options.. Or focusing on a specific type of field like \"this village is focusing on stonework and imports more food\" or vice versa. The game feels too.. \"closed loop\"\n\nGood luck, and have a pleasant day.\n", "timestamp_created": 1699330618, "timestamp_updated": 1699330618, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438980937004089355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149659703": {"recommendationid": "149659703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134899537", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1700001066}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is everything you could want in a town builder sim and more.

If you're a fan of light, simple city-builder type games, then you'll feel right at home with this one. I've been following this one since its early days on Twitter. It's had a LOT of polishing up and feels very well put together, and the dev team is fantastic and very receptive to its fanbase!\n\nGAMEPLAY: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAlmost perfect, for what this is! It's your typical square-grid builder type interface. UI feels good, it's simple and to the point. Placing buildings isn't terribly finicky, and has improved a fair bit since the game's initial EA started. But there's more to it than placing buildings and making your citizens happy by giving them access to resources. On the side, you can direct a hero to interact with event items scattered throughout your area. Often, this yields rewards. In the future, heroes will have a much greater role in terms of gameplay. Lots of potential that's actively getting realized, bit by bit!\n\nGRAPHICS: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nFantastic stuff! It's very cute and stylized, has a low impact footprint on systems, and does a very decent job giving off that cartoony fantasy vibe. The shaders and particle effects integrated in the environments are very well done and textures blend seamlessly in with each other in a very organic fashion. I'm excited to see what other visuals we'll get as the game grows.\n\nSOUND: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nMusic is nice and fits the vibe well, changing dynamically with events as they come, they did a decent job keeping the feel of a fantasy hamlet without going crazy on the brass and string section like you find in so many other games to feel \"epic\". Maybe that's a personal taste of mine, but I like that the music is a little more understated and subdued to feel relaxing and immersive. The sounds of the villagers, buildings, and environment ambiance is also very well done. Nothing's loud or too plosive on the ears.\n\nSTORY: \u2605\u2605\u2605\nOkay, so there's not much to tell, but it is pretty charming at premise! You take on the role of a lord, new to the region, and start off building a settlement for your little villagers. Shortly thereafter, you'll begin to integrate in the community of other local empires as a new neighbor, while seeking out a cute, romantic bond with one of the regional lords and ladies! Along the way, you'll solve dilemmas for your people and send your hero out to investigate mysterious events in the realm. Right now, it's pretty simple for what it is, but the devs have much more in mind for this game as it grows. The game's trying to tell a story with you at the helm, after all.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAs this is an early access game, there's still a lot to improve upon and give us as users. Right now, unfortunately, there isn't a ton in the way of accessibility features. But the devs are listening in discussions and are eager to jot down and use feedback to improve the game. No colorblind support as of yet, but the game does allow for personalized controls. Newbie experience with the game makes learning how to play as a first-timer to city builders a breeze, and you can disable such tutorials if you're already practiced at it. And the UI's got a fair number of languages supported! (English, traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese) More can be added as time goes on and development focuses on these QoL additions.\n\nOVERALL: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nDefinitely worth picking up and trying! It feels great to play and it'll only get better with time and more feedback from the community! This is a much smaller dev team and they're very eager to make this game go far.", "timestamp_created": 1698443363, "timestamp_updated": 1698443363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148982692": {"recommendationid": "148982692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248515750", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1318, "last_played": 1698718873}, "language": "english", "review": "After about 20 hours in this game, I'm really enjoying it and can tell that this is one I will come back to and play again and again. I'm playing this in Early Access, but it feels polished. In fact, the only reminder is that some of the late game features are yet to be released and I've just started seeing these items pop up in-game.\n\nIf you are a fan of the city building games, this one is definitely worth a try! The artwork is beautiful, the soundtrack is excellent and the controls/gameplay feel very natural. As with any game of this genre, there's a bit of waiting from time to time, but they have graciously given you the ability to increase the speed of time (or pause, which is also helpful) as needed. Overall, I'm looking forward to playing the final product, but this is already plenty of value, in my opinion.

I think if there were more ways to make money - buildings generating money, trading with other kingdoms for money, selling items perhaps, then maybe that would help solve the problem. Maybe if there were things to do in those waiting periods that would help? Mini games of some kind? Fishing, interacting with the citizens, being able to help move along the building process, helping with farming, things like that. All that being said - I loved the art style, the narration, the idea of it being a fairy tale, being able to choose between the other princes/princesses and partnering up with them, going to war with the others - all of it is a great idea. Another suggestion - I think it would be great to build your own castle. Maybe have a pet dragon to participate in your military. Anyways - I don't think it's worth the price in it's current state.

This is definitely not the kind of game to speedrun or grind for more serious players who enjoy other city expansion games like Cities: Skylines and SimCity.\n\nThere are a few features of the game that could use some tweaking and adjusting, such as the ability to prioritize the construction of different buildings. Whenever I have had this box checked, it does not seem to make the Fablings \"prioritize\" the selected structure, and they continue to distribute resources to other buildings instead. I also read a review mentioning the capability to decline courting other rulers. While I do enjoy the feature of discovering your own \"happily ever after\", I agree that there should be an option to simply remain friends with the leaders of surrounding realms. Finally, there seems to be a lack of efficiency with resources being moved from one place to another, as I have found my Fablings sitting around with \"nothing\" to do, despite there being ongoing construction and expansion.\n\nRegardless, the design and roleplay aspect of the game is a cute and fun integration for a city builder, making it a simple yet entertaining game to play when you have a few hours to spare. If you're interested in this game, I would wait for it to go on sale, or for more updates to be released to justify the listed price, as it is quite high for an early access game. I believe there is plenty to do between updates, and a lot of fun to be had. This fantasy-esque city builder is straightforward and quite easily addicting, and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1690673226, "timestamp_updated": 1690673226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676722526550292969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143025154": {"recommendationid": "143025154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400570845", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1696317518}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy and relaxing game to play, I also like how you can change the speed of the game, pause it and save. \nI love the narrator. \nI have come back to this game a lot on and off, trying out different layouts.\nLooking forward to more updates and added features to this game develops.  \nI can see this gaming staved in my favorites list for a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1690643145, "timestamp_updated": 1695442980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142948645": {"recommendationid": "142948645", "author": {"steamid": "76561199496925556", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 212, "playtime_at_review": 920, "last_played": 1700325604}, "language": "spanish", "review": "j5mtel", "timestamp_created": 1690543840, "timestamp_updated": 1690543840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142913646": {"recommendationid": "142913646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372110218", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1690517970}, "language": "english", "review": "All in all I would consider this a pretty good game!

Currently it is very bare bones and not much here for more than 8 hours of play and little incentive for replayability. \n\nThere's a bunch of opportunities for this game to make the game feel better.\n1. Needs to be a clearer explanation of where income comes from - if it is only from the citizens then I believe we should be able to generate gold from buildings, or depending on the quality of worker (peasant vs commoner) we should be able to generate resources faster - so we can trade (sell) to other kingdoms for gold. \n\n2. We need to be able to relocate people to different houses.  I have 2 areas in my city for housing vs workplaces. I would like to make sure my people work closer to home so I can manage happiness. But population automatically fills older built houses instead of houses closer to workplaces. I should be able to relocate people so I can move them to houses closer to workplaces I need to fill. \n\n3. Stockpiles - it would be great if stockpile employees worked to distribute resources amongst other stockpiles - so that we we don't end up with 1 stockpile on 1 end of the map with all the coal - for example.\n\n4. Labourers Hut - more than 1 labourer should work on a building at a time. If there is only 1 building being built, all labourers should be working on it - not 1 working and the others sitting around. If there's multiple buildings, then a fair distribution of labourers if fine. However, if a building is prioritised then all labourers should focus on it. \n\n5. Buildings should be able to be rotated once built. It's a small QOL thing but it would help. Condomoniums are the worst for this. If the townhouses have a door facing another building or a wall then people can't access it and get stuck all the time. \n\n6. At around 100 pop gold generation is too slow (if you've kept up with jobs and everyone is employed). It takes 10 minutes to save gold to do 1 action, then you just wait around. Very disengaging part of the game. \n\n7. Walls don't seem practical. Given cities are built in a sprawl and extended out based on tiles purchased, I don't understand how walls would be an appealing aesthetically as they would be going everywhere. \n\n8. Pathways should have an upgrade option. If I want to upgrade my dirt road to cobblestone I should be able to just select and upgrade, or have an upgrade tool similar to the destruction tool. Also upgrading should be discounted (eg. dirt to cobblestone would cost 3 instead of 5)\n\n9. I'm sure this is planned for when the fishing hut becomes available - but fish tiles in the water should actually show fish (think Age of Empires)\n\n10. Finally we should be able to place buildings down even if we don't have the resources for them (but not able to click build) so we can do \"town planning\" with the buildings' outlines.  \n\nOverall I think this city builder has a lot of potential, the devs just need more time to put more meat on the bones. \nExcited to see where it goes.", "timestamp_created": 1689728447, "timestamp_updated": 1689728447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769153356552124023", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142346215": {"recommendationid": "142346215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198381158192", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 271, "last_played": 1685885271}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are adorably cute.

Many of its features, like expansion into adjacent areas through purchase and modular buildings, have appeared in other games and proven to be deep and interesting mechanics that are worth reusing, but this specific combination of them with this specific presentation left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't normally put a lot of stock into this sort of thing, because city builders can only have so much deviation, but even really basic stuff like the design and layout of the UI, down to the color and shape of the dropdown boxes, are eerily similar. I'm not necessarily opposed to looking at an interesting idea and making some tweaks, but you have to actually do it better to be successful.\nUnfortunately, a major part of this game's similarity- deliberate or otherwise- is every new world starting with a mandatory quest-based guided experience that locks off buildings until the tutorial is ready for you to place them, hand-feeding you rewards to compensate for the fact that you have no control over your own income for the first hour or two. Even if I set aside the fact that I feel like I've done this before, I have to do it on the pretense that most city builders necessarily follow a similar formula, so locking off obvious inclusions like farms and woodcutters until I'm ready to handle them feels like a waste of my time.\nThe places where this game does innovate are arguably marks against it, because the two immediately obvious from the first minute are a grating narrator you can't opt out of and the predefined goal of finding a romantic partner. I could just turn the voice volume down, but honestly, the urge to turn off the narrator is more an urge to have control over what I'm doing. The storybook presentation, framed as a flashback retold from after the end of the game, highlights that my goals are pre-defined- and that I've done this all before. I understand the drive to present a more narrative-driven take on city builders, and assuredly there is a point where the game opens up and gives the player more to work with, but so much about this game conspires to highlight that lack of input.\nMaybe my gripes are personal ones, and other players can look past them.

Buy if you want to help developers and play an incomplete game. Don't understand those who buy then complain it \"doesn't have enough\". Like what do you expect, get a refund and don't leave a review, at least, until it has been an EA for a year and doesn't get you 20 hours. Obviously, I've sank time in this game and it doesn't include the free beta test time.\n\nIt is a fun casual, basic, EA game, which is what I want and need at this time. Only EA issue I have is that the food ratio to citizens sucks bad. As in 3 farms for 45 people and they die because there is no food. Not sure what the issue is considering having 1 farm for 24 citizens makes it through winter? Before you comment, they have full staff and 40 lots, plus being efficient with placement (farm in middle of plots). Granary is literally next to farms and housing, but all citizens can't find food as there is none. Worked in beta fine but not now? Could be specific to me, as I had other issues I overcame myself without developer involvement (see later in post,) Found out that by trying to increase happiness (having two happiness items per house instead of 1 food and 1 happiness literally tank food production to the point of no amount of farms could keep up, but now I'm 15 points lower in happiness, needing to add a crap ton of things that increase happiness). I still stick with balancing as an issue as you get punished severely for not following developer standard. It's either an easy game by following developer constructs or punished into oblivion for any deviation. I still recommend though as early access gets a pass and for the current $15 it still worth it. Just tow the line and minimize your own ideas! Tweaked to have 10% of houses be focused on happiness instead of all or most.\n\nThe good:\nThe game is a \"CASUAL\"fable/medieval city builder, and is simple at this time. They are adding updates every week to every few weeks and is a small dev team. Want something in depth, there is a plethora of games city builder game; THERE IS NOT A LOT of games for casual city builder so f*%$ off. The team is good at reaching out, but know that discord it the way to be heard and is best communication tool for reaching them. Though the game has a builtin bug report tool, send it to them and talk to them on discord.\nAs a \"CASUAL\" city builder it ticks all the right boxes, though it is currently limited in building and housing depth. I would say each play through can be about 10 - 20 hours barring any bugs, this would include maximizing as much as you can out of each play-through so your time may vary.\n\nThe bad:\nFood as stated above, might be my game, as I had to trouble shoot some unique game bugs myself... had to find every registry entry and file to fix it, it is an EA after all and I did not reach out to devs, just sent in-game bug report. Now only issue is food weighting issue after initial farm 1 farm 24 people, 3 farms for 44 people? Seems to be a scaling issue? Again not sure if unique to my install or not. Have seen food issues in discussions on Steam, but not when having optimal placement (at this point I know to keep well within all limits.)\nThere are balancing bugs at this time, food, quests (once a particular building is unlock you will get quests and fail if you don't meet criteria (hoping they will fix and not trigger until a certain amount of time after the building/person is built to achieve quest; e.g. wheat farm or hero), negative effects (commoners hate peasants so much that it takes one \"happy\" building to counteract two peasant houses [you have to have every livable space within the happiness area of at least 2 buildings to keep up with the amount of people who want to join for every major milestone achieved; e.g. the happiness drops as you gain population to the point you can't keep up after reaching 60 - 100 {depends upon build?} I have 2 happiness improvements to every house, plus an Inn and hospital, but have to add a theater just to keep up to get close to maximum amount of people willing to join]), more things unlocked that add happiness? now the citizens expect it immediately and now you have to compensate, certain arbitrary milestones? Now you pay dearly [e.g. happiness meter drops based on size], take the ratio as 1 negative is 2 to 3 happiness as a guideline. So most of my houses start at 6+, then add an Inn, then a hospital and yet I'm at 53% and get 1 out of 2 people? But never reach a total of 3 people? Maybe they change the maximum and I missed it)\n\nOther thoughts:\nIf you made it this far and want to know why I recommend it?\nIt is a good game and I give a lot of leeway for multiple reasons.\n1. If you don't refund in 2 hours, you will get your money's worth at around 10 - 12 dollars for an early EA game and should know with an EA game (refund and buy again later if not enough content, first few play-through(s), rush through and do as much as you can as quickly as possible; though it has enough content it will take longer to get through all content). Knowing it is an EARLY EA GAME! This is not a full fledged game! Had to put it out there for all the people who think $15 should be a AA to AAA game and use \"other games\" as a rule of thumb. They are all different sized teams, developmental knowledge, and requirements. Use the 2 hours to gauge and leave... I feel two hours gives you a good feel about a game. Ask in 1 hour 30 minutes in to a game, do I feel like I could get my money's worth? As the game readily upfront states what is available in game and can be unlocked, what will be available later, and anything beyond that is speculation and not known/guaranteed. Guess I grew up in a time when 2 hours for every game was a godsend, talking CDs and not DVD or HD-DVD/Bluray discs. We're talking original Playstation demo discs with multiple games. Plus I'm old and a tightwad so I am keen to what is worth my money... been playing since original Atari.\n2. Has replay-ability for a basic city builder\n3. Developers seem to want to work with as many people as possible, whether on Steam or Discord; moreso on discord? They appear to be active on both, but see lots of references to reaching out to them on Discord?\n4. Had a demo, which they should bring back. To me it allows people to get a feel for the game and is the only reason I jumped on it so early. I felt it had \"enough\" content, and ended up paying the $15 as for me it was worth it. I'm a cheapskate and don't give money up easily... might be why I spent so much time troubleshooting my issue(s) myself (didn't want to join discord and didn't file a Steam bug report in discussions. I feel, for me, it is easier to figure it out myself than jumping through community/people/groups.\n5. Adding new stuff and active development.\n6. Though I'm stopping for a short while due to some bugs and not having as much fun... I know I will come back when have time and interest in trouble-shooting issues that may be related to my install and machine; a \"true\" clean install at this time feels like too much of a burden (see later comments) ... I feel like it is something with the files on my computer and not the game itself... Not willing to do a reinstall of OS to be 1000% sure.\nI have a family, a full-time job, plus I have multiple projects for my home, friends and neighbors (I truly like to keep myself busy (work in IT, but enjoy working with my hands and physical labor [additional bonus for those who care; I did 57 TONS of dirt by hand to my yard; yes I'm stupid and crazy but I enjoy the work...after it was done, not so much during... would've rented a skid loader/bucket had I know in before that it was going to be soooo much, life events caused it to balloon past what should've, such as life!}]). As a bonus, I like to hike and camp to get away from everything!\n\nEdit: Updated, once figured out food issue.", "timestamp_created": 1686800508, "timestamp_updated": 1686970701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536679506301879883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140075179": {"recommendationid": "140075179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366766564", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 498, "last_played": 1686900166}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice and easy to pick up city builder.

So the good side of that is it was such an adorable, beautiful, and bug-free fun little game, I had no idea I was playing an early access game until I hit a solid brick wall and the game basically stops abruptly and tells you there is nothing else to build. So 100% my fault for not paying attention before jumping right in... So far I love it. I wish it were complete but I love it. \n\nA couple things I hope get improved on either by launch or in a future update:\n\n- I really wish there were kids and true \"families\" in this game, all you can really do is st a head of household but it would really add to the fairytale element if there were better ways to be connected to your villagers. Like a noble lineage of family members with kids and grandkids all passing along the same last name and home. Right now it's all kinda randomly assigned houses and no family setup at all. It takes away from the \"story\" element of this game to me. \n- Who am I? So I know I am a central character to the game but I have no avatar and no real identity in the game. So I am courting another ruler but then what? She isn't moving in obviously, there's nowhere for her to move in and so far I doubt we are having any kids since there are no kids in the game... I just wish this story piece was bigger and better since tha seems to be a major theme of the game. \n- Along the same lines of the above, I wish there were genetics, again I REALLY wanted to see lineages and true fairytale families, aka the \"Wolfe\" family managing the pigsty... rather than \"random villager number 4\". \n\n\nBut aside from the above it felt relatively well balanced, the dialog that was included was great, the basic gameplay never felt hectic and gave it sort of a mellow meadow with birds chirping kinda vibe. It was slow, meandering, pleasant, low stress, high enjoyment, cute little nuances with minor non-catastrophic challenges. I can see some room for it to fill out a bit more but I think so far it feels pretty solid for what also feels like a half-built game. So even half-built it's worth it and cute.

'Tis very magical game!\n\nThe art: \nStunning! High quality. Looks very detailed, must have taken quite a lot of time to do so for a small team.. The design, colour, shades: perfect. Cool shade, stunner!\n\nThe audio: \nI absolutely love the narrator's voice lol. It is so perfect for this game. The voice is top tier. Sorry if you are not that old yet, narrator, but you make me feel like I have a grandpa that reads me bedtime stories  If you have any audiobooks I'd definitely buy!\n\nThe music: \nPerfect. Calming. Serene. Not too much and not too little.. I played 55 hours in 5 days without muting the music. Some other games I play have overbearing music that I have to mute the it \n\nThe animations:\nThis too, I love that it is very well made. Not just some generic boxy robotic half-a$$ed animation like many games of this genre have. The movements are so smooth. Smooth like \nbutter!\n\nThe intro book & the romance: \nThe first time I launched the game, I feel like a kid again, soo exciting  The romance and courting: just nice.\n\nTHE STANDARD AND CRATIVE MODES:\nI ABSOLUTELY LOVE THISS!!! Standard mode if players want to play from scratch and earn & unlocked buildings! Creative mode with every building unlocked is SUCH A BLISS.!!\n\nAll in all, I can't wait for next magical updates and patches for known issues such as starvation.  For me, the current \"lack of content\" pointed out by others in the reviews.. It is understandable as it is so early into the release. Of course it is gonna take some time to have more content... \n\nThank you for the game and you hardwork is appreciated \u2764\u2764!", "timestamp_created": 1685031582, "timestamp_updated": 1685031582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138969430": {"recommendationid": "138969430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104378742", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 523, "last_played": 1685478408}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun cute game.

It says I've played it for 8.7, but the .7 of an hour was easily the first time I played where the game loaded me onto a map with no trees or rocks. Rather than realizing this could be problematic, my newbie self thought, \"maybe fog of war?\" Not the case. Moving on.\n\nI got this game because I wanted a city builder with a fantasy aspect. I was really hoping for wizards, magic, unicorns, the works - but in my own little fantasy city. The most I saw was that the pigs have wings, otherwise everything else is just medieval. They promised more to come, so maybe the fabled magic is there in the future. \n\nThere are tiers of building - but not to indicate your status as an evolving builder. The lowest tier building must continually be built to support peasants, the higher tier building (the one I had access to) gave me a different sort of citizen that had limited use. Honestly I wasn't sure why I had to upgrade to the second tier building, as this was neither useful for supporting my mini economy (commoners can only do limited jobs), nor easy to get. I suppose the sense of accomplishment was pretty much it. \n\nSpeaking of economy, it's very simple. You have X houses that support Y peasants, and you need so many farms to support the peasants, who work the farms. So on. That's the challenging balance so far - getting the stone masons and flour mills to support your little people - who you need to work these things, thus growth. Beyond that, I didn't have access to other economy tools. Adjusting taxation was going to be available at a later date (or so the screen said), but I was really hoping for a little council system or politics or something once I got high enough tiered. I also wanted to see my buildings change look as I advanced to indicate my progress (from clay walls to brick and so on).\n\nFor building space and such I did feel pushed to expand my territory at appropriate times. I'd get squished and either have the money to expand or realize the need to save a little to get it done. This aspect felt balanced. I liked the idea that some buildings made homeowners unhappy, while some made them happier. This was a fun challenge - I just wish I could see them go in the buildings and come out with smiles or something. That would have been rewarding.\n\nI also liked the music. It was calming and chill, exactly what I wanted for my Covid brain to zone out on. The graphics, while simple, are colorful and lovely, and that appeals to me greatly. I found myself building away contentedly for quite a while before the game finally went, \"well'p you're done for now. Thanks for playing early access.\" \n\nI know they have lots in store for this game (a good portion of options were greyed out), so I might come back when it's all done. I hope they don't make me pay more money because charging people to beta test a game is already not cool. Really hoping for more whimsy and personality once things get hammered out.

Desarrollado por Grenaa Games y publicado por Dear Villagers lleg\u00f3 en acceso anticipado para PC a Steam el pasado 13 de abril de 2023 y la recepci\u00f3n ha sido realmente buena (89% de m\u00e1s de 1000 rese\u00f1as son positivas).\n\nComo amante de los juegos de estrategia y la construcci\u00f3n de ciudades os puedo decir que es un juego que me llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n por su est\u00e9tica y jugabilidad y que me provoc\u00f3 mucha curiosidad por saber si merecer\u00eda la pena. As\u00ed que en estas l\u00edneas de abajo os cuento lo que he encontrado tras probar Fabledom en su etapa inicial de acceso anticipado.\n\n[h1]Una historia de pr\u00edncipes y princesas[/h1]\n\nEl bonito constructor de ciudades Fabledom se inicia con una historia muy sencilla, eres el pr\u00edncipe o princesa y tomas el control de un reino, el cual podr\u00e1s escoger entre 8 disponibles para hacerlo crecer y prosperar. En ti se encuentra la decisi\u00f3n de hacerlo con mano dura o con cari\u00f1o y felicidad para tus fablings, mediante la diplomacia o la guerra (a\u00fan no est\u00e1 disponible) con los reinos vecinos.\n\nUna vez que tomes el control de tu reino deber\u00e1s gestionarlo desde cero en un mundo de fantas\u00eda con cerdos alados, \u00e1rboles que hablan, h\u00e9roes m\u00edticos que luchar\u00e1n por ti, y varias misiones primarias y secundarias que te ir\u00e1n guiando mientras se suceden los cap\u00edtulos de este cuento. El hecho de guiar la jugabilidad con una historia contada como un cuento es algo que me ha parecido original y que le da una buena base a la estrategia del t\u00edtulo. Todo un acierto.\n\n[h1]\u00bfQu\u00e9 encontramos en Fabledom?[/h1]\n\nEntremos en harina (nunca mejor dicho) con las mec\u00e1nicas de Fabledom. Este t\u00edtulo de estrategia me ha recordado desde el primer momento a The Settlers, franquicia exitosa y de la que disfrut\u00e9 mucho, tanto en el aspecto de los personajes como en el sistema de gesti\u00f3n de recursos. Nuestro objetivo ser\u00e1 alimentar a nuestros fablings (aldeanos), mantenerlos calientes, con agua, limpios,\u2026 vamos, cubrir sus necesidades m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas y algo de ocio. Para ello tenemos que recoger y almacenar madera, piedra y metal y cosechar alimentos, crear carb\u00f3n, fabricar pan,\u2026 lo t\u00edpico. Es un sistema que no innova pero est\u00e1 muy bien implementado y es divertido.\n\nUna de las mec\u00e1nicas que le aportan diversi\u00f3n a Fabledom es el sistema de estaciones, y es que nuestro asentamiento ir\u00e1 pasando cada 30 d\u00edas de estaci\u00f3n. De la primavera al caluroso verano, luego al oto\u00f1o y finalmente al temido invierno, \u00e9poca en que las cosechas se parar\u00e1n y el fr\u00edo asolar\u00e1 a tus aldeanos. As\u00ed que ser\u00e1 importante que hagas acopio de v\u00edveres y carb\u00f3n para hacer frente al crudo invierno o alguno de tus fablings puede llegar a morir. Adem\u00e1s, existen eventos sorpresa como vecinos que te mandan regalos en caso de apuros o brujas que hechizan a tus aldeanos y que pueden arruinar tu planificaci\u00f3n o salvar tu econom\u00eda en un momento de apuro.\n\nCon todo esto deberemos administrar nuestra econom\u00eda a base de impuestos para poder ganar monedas con las que poder evolucionar nuestro asentamiento construyendo nuevos edificios de producci\u00f3n y ocio, y viviendas que nos permitir\u00e1n aceptar nuevos colonos y aumentar la poblaci\u00f3n y el rango de nuestro reino. Las monedas tambi\u00e9n nos servir\u00e1n para ampliar el terreno y descubrir nuevos recursos o eventos.\n\nEl \u00faltimo punto a resaltar es el sistema de diplomacia con los dirigentes de otros reinos, con los cuales podremos contactar mediante un mensajero e ir mejorando la relaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de misiones y regalos hasta incluso conquistar su coraz\u00f3n o llegar a las armas (esta parte a\u00fan no est\u00e1 disponible pero tiene buena pinta). De momento solo hay dos reinos disponibles pero llegar\u00e1n m\u00e1s para llenar de contenido Fabledom un juego que sin estar completo me ha parecido muy divertido de jugar.\n\n[h1]Una ambientaci\u00f3n y tem\u00e1tica que invita a la relajaci\u00f3n y el disfrute[/h1]\n\nVisualmente tiene un estilo que entra por los ojos, el dise\u00f1o caricaturesco de los personajes, edificios y paisajes es entra\u00f1able y divertido, y te da sensaci\u00f3n de paz y tranquilidad. Es muy bonito de ver, simplemente ver a los fablings trabajando con todo lujo de detalles denota el gran trabajo que hay detr\u00e1s. Por otro lado, las texturas todav\u00eda se ven con margen de mejora, ya que parecen poco pulidas, pero no restan belleza al apartado gr\u00e1fico.\n\nSonoramente quiz\u00e1s es la parte que m\u00e1s trabajo les quede, la m\u00fasica suena bien y va a la perfecci\u00f3n con el juego, pero con las horas puede hacerse repetitiva. Un poco de variedad en este aspecto sumar\u00eda mucho a la experiencia.\n\n[h1]Impresiones[/h1]\n\nQuiz\u00e1s sea pronto para sacar conclusiones, pero tras probar Fabledom en fase de acceso anticipado y sabiendo que les queda mucho contenido por a\u00f1adir, me atrevo a recomendarlo y deciros que lo tiene todo para ser un \u00e9xito para los amantes de la estrategia de construcci\u00f3n de ciudades.\n\nEntre sus puntos m\u00e1s fuertes tenemos por un lado el estilo tipo cartoon de los dise\u00f1os que es atractivo y va en consonancia con la ambientaci\u00f3n relajada del juego, por otro lado la diversi\u00f3n basada en un buen dise\u00f1o de la gesti\u00f3n de recursos y todas las mec\u00e1nicas estrat\u00e9gicas originales como los romances y la diplomacia entre reinos, los eventos sorpresa,\u2026 y lo que est\u00e1 por venir. \u00a1Larga vida a Fabledom!\n\nVer an\u00e1lisis completo: [url]https://errekgamer.com/2023/04/27/fabledom-primeras-impresiones/[/url]\nM\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis en nuestra mentor\u00eda: [url]https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38736533/[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1683691391, "timestamp_updated": 1683691506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138072990": {"recommendationid": "138072990", "author": {"steamid": "76561199502524032", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1064, "last_played": 1698009372}, "language": "english", "review": "I only have abt 17 hrs rn but Im obsessed with this game ! its super fun but and stressful but in a good way.

For example, when you employ your hero, there are at most 2-3 points of interest within reach that your hero can explore. Otherwise, he just stands outside his tent, vacant.\n\nWhen it comes to building and progress, they both are tied to how much money you have, and you never have enough unless you spend time to wait and collect more, and more, and more, and... nope, still not enough. I suggest the devs introduce more ways to make money early in the game, such as trade, increase monetary gain from tasks etc.\n\nApart from the necessity expansion of the content, the game features really good and cute graphics, a good variety of things to do in the game, some sort of a story, replayability and a very nice and relaxing soundtrack.\n\nOverall, this is NOT your typical medieval city builder sim; the focus is more on diplomacy, courting a noble from another faction, interaction with the surroundings and generally having a good time.\nI give it a thumbs-up and recommend the game if you're looking for a relaxing and simple building sim. I invested in the EA build and have not regrettet it since.\n\nLooking forward to 1.0 version.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1683532495, "timestamp_updated": 1683532495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137980483": {"recommendationid": "137980483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198455277366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1698376507}, "language": "english", "review": "cute art style, and loving the game play so far! :)", "timestamp_created": 1683513181, "timestamp_updated": 1683513181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137979773": {"recommendationid": "137979773", "author": {"steamid": "76561199186796962", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 314, "last_played": 1697747300}, "language": "english", "review": "fun and engaging, but also quite relaxing", "timestamp_created": 1683511797, "timestamp_updated": 1683511797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137971286": {"recommendationid": "137971286", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198075953", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "playtime_at_review": 779, "last_played": 1700094164}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game that I did not realize I NEEDED!!

The price vs benefit ration is very low compared to almost every other game I've ever played.

There's a lot more content and nothing has broken since my second pass through the game. All the positive qualities I previously wrote are still present.

So I set up a Steam account, learned the PC keys, and even learned to use Discord so I could see the progression of the game and join the community.\n\nIn short, I came for the flying piglets and stayed for Giovanni. \n\nHaving only played a few games on console, I found it easy enough to navigate the game on PC. The tutorial is clear and not overbearing. There is so much to learn about the game, and 22 hours in, I am having so much fun! Yes, there are a few bugs at times in these early stages, but it is very clear that the developers are working hard to fix them all efficiently. At this stage, it took me a good 6 hours to finish the early access content, and then I started a new realm to practice all the things I had learned from my own mistakes and from other players' advice. Everything in game is absolutely adorable, there are so many cute details to look out for, I am loving the humour, and the music makes it all so relaxing and immersive. The game can be played from a bird's eye view to make it easier to organise everything, but I also love getting all zoomed in and even following my Fablings to see them waddle about their day. \n\nI am not sure how to describe the performance because I don't understand video games and PCs all that much. But I am happy. Using an RTX 2070 laptop with 8th gen i7, 16GB RAM (whatever that means).\n\nI am beyond excited to see where the story goes: will I forever tie my realm to Giovanni's? Will Agnes steal my heart away? There will be love, maybe war, but mostly cosy farming and a gentle expansion of my little Fabling community.\n\nPS. My boyfriend wants to thank the developers. Now that I am playing on PC, he can justify buying himself a new one so I can get his old one...", "timestamp_created": 1683053753, "timestamp_updated": 1683053753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714751243591308594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137689884": {"recommendationid": "137689884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111143724", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1698780896}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es t\u00edpico juego cl\u00e1sico de gesti\u00f3n y administraci\u00f3n de ciudades. pero en comparaci\u00f3n a otros juego de la misma categor\u00eda es menos fren\u00e9tico y m\u00e1s tranquilo, te permite avanzar a tu ritmo y no te presiona para estar constantemente evolucionando.

I've played through all the early access story content thus far and the creative mode content as well. Here's what I think so far:\n\nNot only is this game SUPER cute, the artwork is really well done and the continuity in style as your city grows is great. I find that in some city builders that the jump from one type of smaller town to the upgraded bigger town buildings is sometimes jarring in style, and your city tends to look disjointed because of that. \n\nEvery time you start a new story a new map seed is created, which keeps the orientation of the lands fresh and new for each playthrough. I love the layouts I've seen so far, but I do wish I could find a way to get up the hills with roads. Because of that I've strayed away from lands with too many of them. I'm not sure if that's a future feature or not, but it was a pain point for my first town as I had to build everything around them, and I found it a huge waste of space.\n\nThe UI is easy to navigate and pretty intuitive. It controls much like other city building games. I haven't had any issues so far with this at all.\n\nThe narrator is funny. You hear him mostly in the very beginning as you're first starting out, and less so as the game progresses, though he still pops up from time to time. I do appreciate that you're reminded he's still there without him chatting all the time as some games do. It keeps his witty comments fresh without wearing him out and making him annoying. I hope this continues into full release.\n\nAlso eager to see more world events than just the witch turning my villagers into skeletons (which, by the way, while super annoying and tears through my food stores, I love how the ambiance of the game changes and turns all spooky). \n\nNow, something I don't like - I'm not a fan of the merchant prince. And this is fine, as I'm pretty sure we'll be introduced to more than him and the harvest princess (who I do like). I just don't like his overall character and demeanor. \n\nI also wish my hero had a bit more to do, though I understand that there will be as time goes on.

I love that there are so many different buildings and structures to choose from, each with its unique characteristics and benefits. Since it is still early access, not everything's available but the bones that are there are good ones!\n\nOne thing I appreciate about Fabledom is the attention to detail. The game developers have clearly put a lot of effort into creating a world that feels alive, with a bustling population of citizens who go about their daily lives, and plenty of mini-games  that actually make sense to keep you moving forward in your game.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Fabledom to anyone who enjoys city-building games.

The game is extremely cute, easy to understand, and accessible for casual gamers. Due to the nature of it being in early development, it does lack content and has a couple bugs.

This rich and beautiful art style that carries through all annual seasons and the detailed animations of working, building, waiting...its fun to just watch what you've built run for awhile every so often.\n\nBut what about getting started?  So for a game created by just two guys, I'm STUNNED at how well done it is and this is brought across early when, aside from adopting standard controls, getting them communicated is so well done.  \n\nSo let's talk about gameplay.  Like many city builders, you know you're going to need resources, housing, farming, etc...and this is all present in Fabledom, but you also must maintain relationships with other kingdoms.  I have found there might be a balance or AI issue in that I am not getting enough focus on the most critical needs (wood, stone, building), and to that end it would be nice to see a few QOL changes like letting us know how each day is passing.  We don't get a clue as to if we're in Hour 1 or Hour 20 of any day.  And if you're waiting for taxes to arrive, that makes it difficult.\n\nAnother QOL would be I'd like to know if someone left or died.  I've seen my kingdom go from a max population to missing several citizens with no word to me that they're gone or why.  But hey, its Early Access.  All of this is to be expected.\n\nSo to summary, I absolutely LOVE this game!

Most of the mechanics have been done a hundred times before in other civ games.

But it is completely playable, I encountered no bugs, and you can play for a good few hours before you complete it to the point where the developers are still working. \n\nSome gripes I have about the current iteration of the game:\n1) Inability to mass-delete or upgrade roads makes it really tedious to get cobblestone down the line\n2) Unless you already know the size of the buildings you're going to get, its difficult to perfectly place a town layout\n3) The Condominium/Town layout is odd. Why have a big courtyard area if all the houses and shops face the street anyway? They should face inwards with the Archway as the Entrance/Exit. \n4) The pacing of the game is pretty slow. New buildings are gated behind your town level, which is gated behind your population level. You get 2 peasants every 10 days. So no matter how experienced you may become with this game, or even if you cheat, its still going to take just as long to complete. It would be much better if you could simply fill to your population limit every 10 days instead.\n\nHopefully the developer stays on the roadmap and this becomes a fully completed game.", "timestamp_created": 1681790880, "timestamp_updated": 1681790967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136890117": {"recommendationid": "136890117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214032825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1694592193}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty enjoyable so far.

Cute, relaxing, though sometimes perplexing game at this stage. Lacks content, but it's clearly in the works. Balancing resources, people, money, and employment can be a challenge at times. \n\nI thought peasants would leave if they were homeless for too long since that's what the writing implied, but they just straight up starved to death without a home and dropped dead at the 'plaza.' So I unintentionally euthanized a third of my people when trying to replace peasants with common folk from lack of space. Then my common folk also began starving too- I'm wondering if \"They're more demanding\" means they consume more food? I got confused there.\n\nAnyhow, after mass murdering dozens of people I made a new save and it's going great...\n\nCoal makers feel highly inefficient with little employment, slow production, low desirability, and high upkeep after so many of them- only for the game to not even react if my people don't have coal to heat their homes in the winter. So I opted to just let them freeze since it's easy to ignore with no consequence. Coal makers are definitely my least favorite building in the game.\n\nI hope the next neighboring ruler is a guy who looks... a touch more handsome than Giovanni... his character design is creative, funny, and unique- but I'm -not- that desperate. Oh dear.\n\nI'd love a preview of what royalty/nobility points could unlock for me in the future. For now, I didn't care too much- though the pop up quests not having an option to decline without penalty (especially early on in the game) stressed me out. It felt like time was rolling the dice as to whether I was punished or punished less harshly, especially when struggling with money and food already. Hell, an option to turn those off for a more relaxing experience would be great too. It reminded me of sim city's random destruction events.\n\nMy least important peeve was the cake-like fog around the border edge of the map. Kinda kills my immersion when I view a map and the visual horizon from my camera doesn't match up, but I also have no idea how this could be fixed and I can see why the developers picked such a solution for now at least.\n\nThis game is cute and fun though, I'd probably play it again alongside Dorfromantik whenever I want something less intense than the usual.", "timestamp_created": 1681679379, "timestamp_updated": 1681679379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136827117": {"recommendationid": "136827117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109829540", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1682050513}, "language": "english", "review": "All it's missing is [spoiler] Shrek [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1681679315, "timestamp_updated": 1681679315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136825764": {"recommendationid": "136825764", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974263538", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1697562070}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything you ever wanted and wished from new release of \"The Settlers\" (and you never got).

Open up trading between countries that bring in (money, food, Resources) at a regular interval.

Give the devs a chance. It is early access and you can tell a bit. Yet it is still the game I've spent the most time on lately (other than Dredge).\n\nSummary: This is what the original Serf City / The Settlers franchise should have become.\n\nInitial Thoughts:\n* CUTE AS CRAP! It's fun, challenging, and cozy at the same time. Unless 1/2 your people die from starvation while the granaries are full. I just love how it looks.\n* While a lot of content hasn't been released yet, I still spent SEVEN HOURS playing it the first time. Wow. Didn't even realize it. I was so engaged.\n* It's easy to learn and play. Yet as the mid-game starts really happening it can be challenging not having some of the future building.\n* Once you hit a good spot (a few hours in) you can let it \"ant farm\" and run on its own and just see what happens. I love that. Will probably stream that happening.\n* Mechanics are similar to other games in the genre, yet seem to really flow much better than others games I've played recently.\n* Some events, like The W---- (don't want to spoil anything), just seem super random and nothing you can do about it. I get having random events, but I hope long term that mean more or make more sense than just to cripple you for a time.\n* I LOVE the simplicity and actual functionality of the Overview Menu. I do so much in there when my area gets big and has lots of Fablings. Other games have either too little or too much information. I don't want to play Excel. This game really does it nicely.\n\nLittle Annoyances (There are a few annoying things I'd love to see the devs adjust. And I did send feedback on these. Keep in mind this is early access... just some ideas.):\n* The blue road placement icons look exactly like their water indicator. For HOURS I thought that's what they were. Please make them distinctive.\n* I'd love to see the road placement indicators AFTER buildings are built too. Like when you click on them. It can help with planning and adjusting as your village evolves.\n* Fablings can go up hills, but you can't put roads on hills. Seems odd. Would like that to change.\n* Hoping that in the future they can get water from other sources than wells (rivers, springs).\n* The UI is big. I'd love being able to adjust the UI elements (like the tool bars and such) as other games in the genre let you. And option to hide it for recording (I LOVE just watching the Fablings). I have an ultra-wide giant monitor and it is still super annoying in the long game.\n* A few times zoom got stuck for me. I'd zoom out and it would just zoom all the way in. I'd have to restart it to get it to stop.\n\nOverall, this game is great already. I just can't wait to see what it is a year from now.

Aunque hay que decir que [b]ha sido lanzado en acceso anticipado - EA-[/b] y este an\u00e1lisis est\u00e1 basado en dicha versi\u00f3n por lo que puede que var\u00ede pr\u00f3ximamente.[/code] \n\n[h1]\u00a1Erase una vez\u2026 un reino![/h1] \n\n\u200aFabledom arranca como si un cuento de hadas se tratara, gran parte de este encanto lo encontramos gracias a un narrador omnisciente que nos acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 desde el comienzo de nuestra aventura como principe/princesa de un id\u00edlico reino en construcci\u00f3n. Por ello lo primero ser\u00e1 seleccionar g\u00e9nero y gustos, podemos elegir la carne, el pescado o incluso ambos. Tras esta peque\u00f1a selecci\u00f3n comenzaremos nuestra aventura en nuestro reino,  pudiendo elegir entre 8 ubicaciones donde podremos ver la fertilidad de las tierras o incluso el tama\u00f1o m\u00e1ximo del reino. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963151217\n\n\u200aAdem\u00e1s decir que hay dos formas de jugar: \n\n[b]Modo est\u00e1ndar[/b]: donde debemos progresar haciendo crecer nuestro reino - el cl\u00e1sico sistema de eras que encontramos vigentes en muchos t\u00edtulos como el querido Sid Meiers Civilizations. \n\n[b]Modo Creativo[/b]: donde tendremos todo desbloqueado desde el primer momento para dar pie a nuestra imaginaci\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]\u00a1Nuestro cometido es la ley![/h1]\n\nComo monarca de nuestro reino, deberemos ir construyendo el reino a nuestro antojo, que decir que no sepamos de un city building/colony sim. Debemos coger a nuestro aldeanos y darles oficios para hacer crecer nuestra peque\u00f1a comunidad. Comenzaremos con un set de edificios y profesiones muy limitados.\n\nLo m\u00e1s importante ser\u00e1 darle cobijo a todo aquel que quiera unirse a nuestro querido reino, por ello todo habitante debe tener casa y un oficio con el que progresar. Desde el principio el avance es lento, podemos crear granjas de cultivos, una serrer\u00eda para crear tablones o una cantera para coger roca. Todo edificio necesita alguien que lo administre. Hasta el almac\u00e9n. Me ha gustado mucho que hayan decidido a\u00f1adir que los almacenes sean customizables, pudiendo elegir desde un primer momento los materiales a almacenar en dicho lugar. Lo mismo ocurre con los molinos donde se ir\u00e1n almacenando alimentos. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963172991\n\nEl videojuego, no trata de ser un colony sim complejo. No aceptar nuevos miembros no nos penalizar\u00e1 en exceso, de hecho nuestra moral no bajar\u00e1 por ello. Aunque esto tiene un problema nuestro objetivo es hacer crecer nuestra peque\u00f1a aldea y convertirla en un gran reino - Acoger a todo quisqui -. Desde un inicio nuestra expansi\u00f3n estar\u00e1 bloqueada, por suerte, nuestros aldeanos religiosamente pagan su diezmo y generan ganancias para nuestro reino. Con estas podremos ir agrandando nuestro territorio. El coste siempre va creciendo a medida que avancemos y entre otras cosas podemos encontrar ruinas de antiguos asentamientos, aqu\u00ed es donde han decidido innovar ya que una funci\u00f3n importante de Fabledom la encontramos en el cuartel de h\u00e9roes, estos tendr\u00e1n personalizaci\u00f3n y podr\u00e1n guerrear, espiar y visitar ruinas, donde generalmente encontramos decoraciones para nuestro reino. Digo podr\u00e1n porque a pesar de ser una mec\u00e1nica fundamental ahora mismo no est\u00e1 implementada y \u00fanicamente sirven para visitar ru\u00ednas, quedando bastante limitados a d\u00eda de hoy. \n\nFabledom trata de ser la historia de pr\u00edncipe enamorado, por lo que en ocasiones encontraremos eventos de otros monarcas que quieren hacer tratos con nosotros, otra funci\u00f3n importante es la posibilidad de cortejar, Agnes por ejemplo, la princesa de la cosecha, nos pedir\u00e1 trigo a modo de pagar\u00e9. Cortejar ahora mismo ocurre como con los h\u00e9roes y solo nos dar\u00e1 nuevas decoraciones, Cada principe/sa pide algo diferente. \n\n[h1]Apartado t\u00e9cnico[/h1]\n\nLa interfaz de Fabledom es simple e intuitiva, un bot\u00f3n para avanzar el tiempo hasta x2 y un sistema de clima que va bastante bien. Superar el invierno no ser\u00e1 tarea dif\u00edcil, pero aun as\u00ed deberemos guardar algo de alimentos, pues nuestras granjas no generar\u00e1n. El t\u00edtulo tambi\u00e9n cuenta con un sistema de gesti\u00f3n sencillo que nos permitir\u00e1 ver si tenemos alg\u00fan fabling sin empleo. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963172495\n\nEn cuanto al apartado audiovisual, encontramos un estilo art\u00edstico muy colorido con curiosas animaciones, podremos seguir a nuestros fablins adem\u00e1s con una vista en 3 persona que los seguir\u00e1 durante su rutina. Aunque este aspecto est\u00e1 poco pulido, es interesante observar c\u00f3mo trabajan o simplemente pasan su rato libre. Me ha recordado much\u00edsimo a Overcooked en el estilo art\u00edstico. \n\nSonoramente que decir, el t\u00edtulo decide alardear de una buena melod\u00eda ambiental que nos acompa\u00f1ar\u00e1 pero nos permitir\u00e1 centrarnos de lleno en la gesti\u00f3n de nuestro reino. \n\n[h1]\u00a1Color\u00edn Colorado, este cuento\u2026![/h1]\n\nEn definitiva, Fabledom se trata de un buen city building/ colony sim descafeinado, su agradable aspecto art\u00edstico, hace que sea un t\u00edtulo para todos los p\u00fablicos, muy recomendable. Aunque a pesar de ser un juego en acceso anticipado, hay algo que he echado en falta desde un primer momento, y ha sido la inclusi\u00f3n de logros. Por suerte el t\u00edtulo ha llegado subtitulado a nuestro idioma entre otros, y va a estar cargado de contenido.

I will keep it as short and easy to follow as possible\n\nSummary\nIn short, this game is in very early development and is still missing some important pieces in the early game, and has basically no mid or late game yet. If you are looking for experiencing a fulfillling story/charming and developed building experience, the game is not there yet. The designers are working fast and transparently, so I'd take a look in a few months and see if there is enough content for you then (I'd say after the 2nd roadmap patch it would be playable enough to enjoy more deeply). As for what the game offers now is an introduction and baseline to play around with and is engaging enough to keep me testing it.\n\nPros\n\n- Charming theme with a lot of character and style. There is potential to be fleshed out more in a way a fable-esque game should be\n- The main foundations of the game in terms of resources and UI are clean and easily understandable. As the game develops, I am hoping for more unique or rare/useful items with the intriguing heroes system.\n- There is a charming story and larger map you can interact with that I am hoping to speak on more as the game develops. Promise of trade, war and love with neighboring kingdoms is a very exciting concept to me in this game.\n- Haven't seen any game breaking bugs or issues which is a huge plus for a game so early in development\n\nCons\n\n- While there are fantasy elements, its missing the trolls, goblins, fairies and other fable creatures that would really elevate the game. I am expecting to see these creature included after the next patch as enemies to fight.\n- There are some vital management views and options that are missing. Adding in additional overlays to see happiness and routes would be beneficial. Also adding negative/positive seasonal or yearly forecast yields would be immensely beneficial for planning the city or a district.\n- Not a lot story or interactions happening for a game based on stories. While it is early development, I'd love to see cutscenes of important benchmarks with the main story, and more importantly, interactions of fablings in the city. Seeing them attend street theatre, go to the inn, slack off at work, or interact with other fablings, buildings, and environments would be a huge boon to the theme of the game\n\nCritiques/Feedback\n\nWhile I listed out some of the more pressing feedback in the cons above, there are some other pieces that could use a touch  mentioned below.\n\n- Give Fablings experience in their set jobs, the longer they work the same job the better they are\n- Have different aged fablings, maybe even kids in the city who can't work or take up household spaces but hang around the city or at home to give more life to a city.\n- Give buildings upgrades, give storage workers a wagon to move more resources around the city faster. As the main source of resource transportation at the moment, they seem a bit slow\n\n\nIn conclusion the game looks great and feels great. I am giving a positive review as the game development is good and the designers are very active. I am hoping as the game reaches completion I can come back and remove all my cons!

It took me roughly 6 hours to get to small kingdom so it doesn't take very long to max everything. So lets do an early pros and cons list:\nPros\n-Unique world setting (unlike foundation, settlement survival, and banished which are more medieval realism it's take a more fantasy oriented rout with magic\"not available yet\" and heros \"limited gameplay\")\n-The art style is eye-caching and stimulating and can be very beautiful\n-Not the most hardcore survival city-builder, allowing time to plan relax and just have fun\n-Build and overview UI wasn't confusing\n-The relationship system it has with other neighbouring kingdoms is quirky and fun\n-Every Seasons has effect to the overworld ( not just green for spring/summer/fall and white for winter)\n\nCons\n-NPC AI is dumb (farms and resources gathering are full and no one brings them to the storehouse/granaries or to the homes. Once your city take up half the map people starve even when you have alot of food everywhere)\n-Very early access (not alot to do past small city stage)\n-Certain core resources are limited (like stone) after you run out that's it you cant build anymore\n- NPC AI is REALLY DUMB, I know I said this before but it really breaks this game\n- Can only make money from taxes every 6 days. Wish the Inns or store would give you alittle passive income\n\nOverall I had a great time playing this game, even though it was still very limited.

There's lots of potential here (hopefully it delivers)\n\nCon's - pacing is tacky - to put it mildly  the concept is there for food and gold etc. which are kinda basic , but the timing and cost of it encourages a super slow play style which might not be for everyone.\n\nDesirability - buildings have upkeep and certain heavier industries give or reduce desirability/beauty of a certain spot. Having high desirability increases happiness of the housing in the area- leading to a faster immigration rate i think at least) but really don't affect anything besides that so far.\n\nCost- The cost of buildings lends to its slow play style , buildings are pricey at the start and taxes are fixed, ie the initial farm of vegetables cost you 225 gold for the max of 40 fields, a single homestead for 3 peasants (2 workers) costs about 55 gold , with a ratio of 2-3 peasant houses giving enough cash to reach double digits + support the upkeep of one building that needs it.\n\n\nFood- It aint fully there yet, (fish comes in the future updates it says) + each food type gives its own number of food needs fulfilled . I.e wheat requires 2 processes to become bread - but has about double the food fulfillment compared to vegetables which don't need any processes to be used. The main problem is the ratio of the wheat products - you need 2 or 3 wheat units for one unit of flour, but 4 flour for 1 unit of bread, or just 4 units of wheat for pork (requiring a herd), this means essentially a super high scaling cost of a 1000 or more to get it to a stable supply for the next tier of citizens .\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1681564683, "timestamp_updated": 1681564683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136739974": {"recommendationid": "136739974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364373740", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1685531333}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful games i've played, the artwork is amazing! runs smooth also, thanks!", "timestamp_created": 1681564524, "timestamp_updated": 1681564524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136739618": {"recommendationid": "136739618", "author": {"steamid": "76561199195203838", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 407, "last_played": 1689793056}, "language": "english", "review": "So I was looking for a new city sim kind of game, you know something to pass a little time and loose myself in.

I just found myself becoming bored, very quickly, because I have done all of this before in games of the same genre. The few mechanics which are unique, such as the world map, are not well-developed (yet). The diplomacy is shallow and adds very little. The resource management is generic. The \"hero\" feels like something out of clash of clans or a cheap mobile game.\n\nThe game is well executed but just uninteresting.

The game certainly has a learning curve regarding how to strategically set up storage etc. I will place a bunch of buildings differently in my next playthrough.\n\nHowever, since the game is in early access, a bunch of features aren't available yet. After finishing the \"early game\" and moving on into the town era, the pacing felt very off in my opinion. The hero character also currently feels fairly arbitrary. Obviously the game has just been released and isn't fully developed, so I hope some balancing changes will be  made. (I was just watching youtube while waiting to accumulate more money, having built lots of homesteads and having neither the territory nor the money to build town housing.) In addition to balancing, a feature I would enjoy is to control my supply of wood and stone versus what gets turned into other building materials. I really dislike not having any stone because it all got used up... This being said, this is all criticism on a very high level.\n\nOverall, this Fabledom is a wonderful game.

This game is special. And a dev specifically asked for this as a favor in their Discord, so, ya' gotta do it!\n\nJust to make it easy - great music, fun city builder, a great voice actor/narrator, and a wonderful combination of silly/cartoony and realistic as an art style. And at $15 or $20? Nah, go for it! Give it a try. \n\nA bit more in-depth - this game is made by a two-man dev team. Which is as mind-blowing as learning Manor Lords is a one-man dev team. With Fabledom, you feel the love they put into their project. There's a story here that will be fleshed out along with the game's development - delivered by game mechanics and a fantastic, sort of nostalgic narrator. The art style is very well crafted, allowing an indie team to seem like they're competing with PIXAR. The game has hints of Banished, Manor Lords, and in some sense, ANNO 1800. The game is calm and easy-going. I saw one comment that was pretty on point - Fabledom feels like how the new Settlers game should have felt.\n\nAnd my top compliment - this game allows for travelling the map, and does a great mix of cute, cartoony city-building, with later-on added elements of combat. You can eventually build a castle and the surrounding walls, with both footmen and archers. \n\nOverall, support the game, support their art. Give it a try!\n\nTo note though - two negatives. One, as with most city-builders, the game is too easy. Again with other city builders, I doubt there's an End screen. The focus is of course actually building, designing, and decorating a city. But it needs far greater challenges and true game-ending events, if the player isn't focused or strategic. This might be mitigated slightly when combat is introduced soon.\n\nTwo - so far, nothing is really new here. You can tell there's love from the devs from this project. It feels like a game from the 90's or early 2000's when devs really, really were trying. I'm reminded of Halo...... But anyway, the game's great and it's fun to play.
