\nDoes Narcissu have a great narrative? Not really. Does it even have great dialogue? No. Are the cgs or characters great? Nope.\n\nWhat Narcissu does offer, however, is a highly realistic portrayal of two clinically-ill patients who are very rapidly succumbing to their illness; both psychically and mentally. And, in their newly founded philosophical abyss, impulsively decide to futilely fight against their environment and fate. Following that, we see both the characters on a road trip where, metaphysically, they create their own life and undergo introspection and self-discovery together. Some important questions get raised: is it the destination or the journey that matters? When faced with the prospect of death within weeks; do you surrender or precede in meaningless defiance? Is there any inherent purpose or meaning to our fleeting lives? Yadda yadda. \n\nNow, Narcissu does have good writing and a decent plot. But, what it does not have is good pacing, transitions, or story length. \nThe pacing in this novel is far too fast--about as fleeting as Seimitsu's life. And, on top of that, the transitions and abrupt chapter endings are not only jarring, but take you out of the atmosphere. Now, the story length itself leaves very little room for your feelings to mature, and, as for the the two main characters, it's a similar story. Not only are the characters particuarly uninteresting; the dialogue itself tends to be very boring oftentimes. But, when it does hit--it hits. And, in the same vein, probably a bit more realistic all things considered.  As for the ending, it's prdictable but impactful. Yet, gets completely eroded by the sudden, jarring credits scene that info dumps/rehashes the story and the main character while cheerful music plays in the background. That, singlehandedly, almost ruined the entire experience for me. \nAside from that, the minimalist soundtrack and CGs work greatly with the game's hallow, bittersweet, and unnerving atmosphere. \n\nIs it worth the 5 hours of playtime, I'd say so. And, in my opinion, Narcissu is better than the majority of short VNs, such as Planetarian. \n\n6/10", "timestamp_created": 1685522298, "timestamp_updated": 1685892050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695728123188018799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139298177": {"recommendationid": "139298177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046602411", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 333, "last_played": 1685580598}, "language": "english", "review": "As with many \"deep\" VN stories I've read, the \"deep\" personalities of each character seem to boil down to just saying \"I don't know\" and \"does it matter\" and \"I am too afraid to make decisions or choices in life\". I find this extremely annoying about japanese culture in general. I don't find indecisiveness to be realistic. Most people don't have any trouble making decisions, since weighing positives and negatives of a choice is a very straightforward and basic thought process. I feel like Japanese culture values this lack of straightforwardness in conversation as some sort of thing to be praised due to some preconception of politeness. But to me it seems like people never actually talk, they just try to tell each other as little as possible and avoid real communication out of fear of seeming too blunt. Surely this will lead to good relationships. I can see why the characters in this game would be suicidal when no one actually talks to them, instead saying \"betsuni\" 24/7. A good \"f*** off\" would fix that I think. But not really in VN vernacular to be so honest. Anyway I'll talk about the actual game.\n\nThis game doesn't have enough visuals. A lot of the time on screen there is just a grey square and text. I could count like 2-3 pictures of the female character in the first part, and those show for about 1% of the dialogue. This is really bare bones. It would be better off being a book with a soundtrack you could play while reading it.\n\nIf I had to describe the writing in this VN, it would be \"thoughtful and empathetic, but strangely childish\". It sets out to point out that terminally ill people feel abandoned by society, as if this is some sort of revelation people did not know about. By considering such an illness for a little bit one could divine the mental state someone having one would end up in. So this game's story doesn't really reveal something that unique regarding its central topic. But it does tell it with a lot of care so it is enjoyable to read in a way.\n\nThe second part of the story is a bit more lighthearted for a large portion of it and overall longer. It's a bit refreshing in that way, but many of the chapters amount to nothing. Chapter 5: Setsumi and Himeko eat ice cream. Setsumi learns Himeko likes cars. (we already knew that though) Chapter 6: Setsumi and Himeko plant a bulb in the garden and eat croquettes. Setsumi sees flowers and Himeko tells her they are Narcissus WOW JUST LIKE THE ONES IN THE FIRST PART OF THE GAME...is a whole chapter necessary for this? Chapter 7: They eat croquettes again. Himeko says the reason she thinks she has an illness is because she is being punished for not going to church enough as a catholic. (Yes this is all that matters to the story in the entire chapter.)\n\nThere's also a lot of \"*stares at sky* ah, how lonesome it's beautiful and blue\", \"once again, the cicadas are singing\", we don't need this every single day in the game. We understand by a sound effect or two if it's clear weather or raining etc.\n\nStory: Solid, if overly marred by indecisive, distant communication between characters and pointless interactions\nVisuals: Not good, barely any to speak of\nMusic: Great, probably the best aspect of the game\n\nI don't recommend it because there are many many VNs with sad endings that you should consider before this one, which is very basic and probably not worth your time despite being free. Yuki Gotou is in it though, so maybe play just the second part to hear her if you like her voice acting. The \"Opening video\" for Narcissu 2nd (actually about 1 hour into the story though) has Riya as a vocalist too, which sounds really nice.\n\nThe 2nd game also tried to have some sort of deep comment on christianity (not to make it seem bad or good necessarily though) but it seems like the writer didn't understand the concept of afterlife. If you are going to die, you don't expect god to let you live suddenly by praying. You pray and follow the teachings of christianity to be saved in the afterlife. In the game the characters are getting fed up with their prayers because god doesn't magically cure their diseases.

But this one stands out of the bunch. When it comes to how emotional masterpieces are created they take one of two forms. The first one is having the main focus about being a tearjerker and is there to make you cry. The other one is to teach the person reading/watching abotu something. This message can then dig so deep into your heart that you end up crying anyways. I have always found the latter one to be more impactful on my life but Narcissu stood out to me. \n\nNarcissu is a VN that does not have the main focus about being a tearjerker and neither does it have a specific message. The thing that makes this one special is that it does not teach you anything new but rather makes you think hard about something you already know which is about life and death. Already at a young age our bodies surpress these deep thoughts about life and death unconsciously. This is because its too deep of a topic and will bring a great deal of mental stress when thought about. This VN however forces you to think about those things which can have a drastic change on how you view your own life. That is why this VN is so powerful. \n\nThrough this VN you will yourself be able to find your own view on life, the value of it, how you want to live your own life. Not to mention that this VN is entirely free and was made to be free. The whole purpose of this VN was for people to get a grasp on what life truly means in their own way. There is no right or wrong when it comes to this question, just how you yourself feel.\n\nEven though the Artstyle is old and it does not seem to be of high quality at first glance every single one of these things are intentional so that you have the opportunity to dive deep into your inner thoughts. There will never be a VN quite like this one and there will never be a VN that can have this big of an impact on your life. I will say it once more. This VN is the best VN of all time when it comes to changing the person reading it. And it will probably remain that way for a very long time. \n\nIf you ever feel like you need a change of view over your life do not hesitate to read this VN. It is totally worth it\n\nfinal score 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1683466012, "timestamp_updated": 1695329841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137740693": {"recommendationid": "137740693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149901743", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 172, "last_played": 1651636760}, "language": "english", "review": "this definitely cured my depression and has a super happy ending", "timestamp_created": 1683134952, "timestamp_updated": 1683134952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137463328": {"recommendationid": "137463328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316203376", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1682746393}, "language": "english", "review": "5 minutes to get all achievements.\n\n100% Achievement Guide\n\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\n\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\u2193\nFinished Narcissu 1st (voiced)\nVery simple, all you need to do is press start, select the first title, any translation and make sure that you select voiced.

I've had no idea what I picked up (it was free on Steam, so I thought I'll give it a try). It is probably the saddest story among visual novels, I have read. Basically, it all starts in a hospice care. So, you know...there's no such a thing as good, happy ending here...\nI wasn't prepared for that, as it reminded me of my close friend, who passed away, suffering from cancer few years back. Narcissu brought all the memories. Honestly, it is well written story with believable main character. Himeko (I will always call her \"\u59eb\") acted, just like my friend...\nIt's a heartbreaking story in two parts. You will cry in both of them. Just don't forget to check epilogue, upon finishing Narcissu 2nd. It's short, but it will squeeze even more tears from you.\nTomo Kataoka made a truly unforgettable experience. Even with its predictable and sad ending, story forced me to think again about my own life and how precious it is. And if you have something to tell to your friend, family member or a lover - it's best not to wait until the last minute, because it might be too late at the end...\n\nFrom technical point of view - it's nothing special, mind you - it's a novel from 2005, so resolution is low. However - it is voiced vn and soundtrack is amazing. Plus, it's completely FREE and it is one of the best titles in the genre.\nDepend on your reading speed, story is around 7 hours long.\n\n[b]Overall, if you want to read something that will get you emotional, I strongly recommend this title. Despite its technical flaws, I'm giving it 9/10 score. It's beautiful and unique.

The game is a story about a young man named Setsumi, who is hospitalized with terminal cancer, and a girl named Himeko, who is also a patient at the hospital. The game tells the story of their relationship and their experiences with illness, death, and the meaning of life.\n\nThe game's art and music are both excellent, with beautiful backgrounds and a moving soundtrack that effectively sets the tone of the story. The writing is also well-done, with a poignant and emotional narrative that explores themes of love, loss, and hope. The characters are well-developed, and the player becomes deeply invested in their stories.\n\nOne of the game's strengths is its ability to address serious and heavy themes in a way that is both sensitive and thought-provoking. It manages to be both poignant and uplifting, while avoiding being maudlin or sentimental. The game's ending is also particularly well-done, offering a satisfying conclusion to the story while also leaving room for interpretation.\n\nOverall, Narcissu 1st and 2nd is a powerful and moving visual novel that tells a beautiful and emotionally resonant story.

The story of the both parts of the game gives you the chance to think about your view of life and really puts you in the shoes of the characters. \n\nLastly, don't expect different routes or story line for Narcissu. This game is a non-interactive visual novel means there are no routes. It's basically reading a book with voice acting and a nice BGM \n\nWith that said, I recommend this game for people who are starting or just new with the visual novel genre of games. It gives you a peek for what to expect in visual novels, specially with genre staples for the VN category. \n\nP.S - They really should've put a trigger warning, this game might not be healthy for everybody.

And to some extent it is crazy that the story is placed there by an absolutely stranger, but does not lose its closeness to you because of this.\nBut how does this happen? Why can absolutely anyone influence you with their own legend, what should the latter be? And everything is very simple and difficult at the same time: you need to be sincere and invest a part of yourself.\nStage-nana is the most ordinary and \"everyday\" developers who released an ordinary, at first glance, kinetic novel in 2007.\nThey operated with a soundtrack, a small amount of text and a very regressive picture at that time, but they, unlike many other developers, actually managed to give me an abyss of pleasant memories, a swarm of thoughts and a great many tender feelings. Hence my perception is clouded, and the hand draws only a positive picture of the world of this game.\nBut I'll try to be objective.\n\nThe plot in Narcissus tells about two sick people, a girl and a guy, who dutifully await their inevitable death, as a result of a disappointing diagnosis, on the white and sterile expanses of a special, 7th floor. But something is happening and the situation is changing dramatically.\n\nThe graphic component, as I wrote above, is at a really average level. However, this does not prevent the game from looking atmospheric and very original, especially against the background of modern novels. The same planetarium from the studio \"Key\" is made in a similar style and both works are iconic.\n\nThe most important part of the game is the soundtrack . Extremely subtle, dramatic and comprehensive, it literally permeates you with the most diverse emotions, making you worry, rejoice, laugh, as if you were the main character of the novel.\n\nThere is a lot of text in the game and it is written well, I did not notice any errors in the English version of the game.\n\n\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d:\n\nNarcissu is a diamond among visual novels. With its budget, the difficulties of development in this segment and other difficulties at the time of the creation of the game, Stage-nana managed to immerse us in a wonderful story that can give you a whole life full of bitterness and joy in just one evening.\n\n\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20:\ud835\udfff /\ud835\udff7\ud835\udff6.\n\n\ud835\udcd8\ud835\udcd5 \ud835\udce8\ud835\udcde\ud835\udce4 \ud835\udcdb\ud835\udcd8\ud835\udcda\ud835\udcd4\ud835\udcd3 \ud835\udcdc\ud835\udce8 \ud835\udce1\ud835\udcd4\ud835\udce5\ud835\udcd8\ud835\udcd4\ud835\udce6 , \ud835\udce8\ud835\udcde\ud835\udce4 \ud835\udcd2\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udcdd \ud835\udce3\ud835\udcd7\ud835\udce1\ud835\udcde\ud835\udce6 \ud835\udcd0 \ud835\udcdf\ud835\udce1\ud835\udcde\ud835\udcd5\ud835\udcd8\ud835\udcdb\ud835\udcd4 \ud835\udcd0\ud835\udce6\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udce1\ud835\udcd3 , \ud835\udcd8 \ud835\udce6\ud835\udcd8\ud835\udcdb\ud835\udcdb \ud835\udcd1\ud835\udcd4 \ud835\udcd6\ud835\udce1\ud835\udcd0\ud835\udce3\ud835\udcd4\ud835\udcd5\ud835\udce4\ud835\udcdb !", "timestamp_created": 1661276730, "timestamp_updated": 1661276730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583754539489746094", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121087459": {"recommendationid": "121087459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335689515", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1661215058}, "language": "english", "review": "Masterpiece.

I didn't like the lack of focus on Yuka and to a lesser extent Chihiro. I also found the pacing to be a bit too scattered and disconnected. \n\nHowever, after those flashbacks began and especially when they started to become dark, the game just absolutely blew apart my expectations and then blew them apart again. How everything just came together thematically and emotionally was just unbelievable. The thematic handling of loss of faith and the complicated feelings of grief and suicide could not have been handled better. I was completely speechless. And the music particularly \"For Whose Sake\" and \"Route 1\" complimented these strong emotions masterfully. The conclusion was just outstanding.\n\nUltimately, it wasn't even just how the game handled grief and existentialism and loss of faith but instead how it tackled faith itself and how it connects with the human condition.

And while it does have voice acting, the developer suggested to play the game unvoiced for your first playthrough. Combined with the soundtrack that sings the songs of calm and sorrow, despite how it may look like the thought that the game feels cheap never comes to mind. The minimalist look gives the game a melancholic feeling and for the kind of story that Narcissu tells its readers, this aesthetic feels just right. \n\nThe approach of minimalism doesn\u2019t stop with the visual or the sounds. While Narcissu used novel-style writing that is known for being verbose, the story intentionally leaves a lot of room for our interpretation, their emotions and thought process, their ideology, and nuance. Giving the readers the full picture is not something that the game is interested in. That\u2019s not to say that the story is cryptic, far from it. Narcissu still gives the reader just enough specifics to have an idea of what the story is all about, its messages, and the philosophy behind the ideas. But they don\u2019t give you all the puzzle pieces for the whole picture, the readers have to form their puzzle pieces and fit them in by themselves if getting the full picture is something that they desired. This approach makes the lack of a branching path feel irrelevant because each player might view the game in different ways in different playthroughs. An idea that they toned down for the second game as it gives a lot more info about the characters with an emphasis on details which gives a lot of context to the events of the first game, playing the 2nd game first is recommended.\n\nThe story revolves around the idea of living with death in mind, that you will never be like everyone else, living their life as they please, that even if they succeed or fail, at least they still have a future to look forward to. It\u2019s a simple thing, but it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t have. The main characters of the games are patients on the 7th floor of a nameless Christian hospital, the hospice floor with windows that don't open more than 15 cm, waiting for their death. Each with their point of view of what their situation means for them. The fear of leaving the left behind with burdens, the desire to live life to the fullest, questioning your faith in God, is it better to just give up? The game delved into ideas that feel natural to come to mind if one is faced with such a situation. With the premise, it is easy to label it as a crying game, but the game doesn't want you to just cry, the game wants you to view it as a whole package with the hope that the messages might stick with you. The game tries its best for the reader to not be too sympathetic to the characters, they want you to be sympathetic to their ideas in a way that makes you go \u201cAh, I think I get why.\u201d In a way, this way of telling the stories might leave the characters feeling a little bit bland, but I found it to be beautiful.\n\nEven though terminal disease and death is the prominent theme of the game, Narcissu is a story about living, the script has some typos and the minimalism might not be for everyone, but if the story that it told is the type of story that touches your heart, Narcissu is almost one of a kind. And with the free price tag that it comes with, I\u2019d recommend you to check it out.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1640314555, "timestamp_updated": 1642544621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2,

I would recommend it if you would like to read something very heavy and very long. Do note that it actually is even less of a game than most Visual Novels; this \"game\" is more like a book as you don't get any choices, and the art is very minimal. You don't do anything apart from read, so it doesn't hurt to just turn on the auto-dialogue option and read it like a book. Although it might sound boring, drab, and un-interactive, the stories are written well-enough that it sucks you in and maintains your interest throughout the runtime, even though the characters fall kinda flat from time to time and there are some unresolved issues, [spoiler] such as how the hell did the guy steal his dad's car, take another hospice patient with him, and not cause a massive shitstorm?

It doesn't do a good job of telling which character is talking, and if what is written in the dialogue box is actual dialogue or a way for the game to describe a scene or the thought of a character. The VA does alleviate some of the problems, as they only talk in actual dialogues, but there are lines that looks to be actual dialogue but have no dubbing, and the dubbing is mostly relegated to Narcissu 2, and even then, sometimes its incredibly hard to tell who is actually talking because they sound way too similar, especially Yuka and Himeko.", "timestamp_created": 1634987174, "timestamp_updated": 1634987502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101453147": {"recommendationid": "101453147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051364586", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1638749980}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and short little utsuge kinetic novel.

I figured his taste was trustworthy, so I sought out Narcissus and gave it a go, and I'm so glad I did!\n\nFirst off, I want to mention that the experience is best done by reading the novels in reverse release order; Narcissu 1st was the original VN, and then Narcissu 2nd, despite being released afterwards, is actually a prequel that sets up the events of the first game.  You get SO MUCH MORE emotional meaning if you read the prequel first - otherwise the weight of the events isn't anywhere near as hard hitting.  So I'd recommend reading 2nd before 1st.\n\nAs you may have seen from the description, the story centres around people who are in a hospice and already know that they're not going to survive their illnesses - their imminent deaths are not the be all and end all of their lives.  It's how they choose to approach those deaths, and how they live in the moments between, that tell this story.  Narcissus is a really good portrayal of that kind of scenario.  It has relatable moments, feels very real, and is a pretty accurate depiction of mindsets that people tend to have when they're in dire circumstances.  It also manages to portray this without being super depressing, or by relying on trying to throw massive emotional moments at you every five minutes - it's kinda just real.  The emotion comes through in the little things, and the characters are also written well enough that you feel for them as people, so those little things really count.\n\nSince this is quite an old game, the visuals are a little lacking; it's not like a typical VN in that there are plush backgrounds with moving sprites overlaid, and fancy text boxes - it's very basic.  Despite this, the story was good enough that I found myself not minding this at all, and to be honest, it made the moments you actually did see characters on screen so much more compelling, because they were hardly present.  What keeps you in the moment is the great voicing, as well as the story itself.  The soundtrack, although not very large, is actually pretty effective and makes you get attached to the pieces in a positive way, cancelling out much of the potential monotony of a small roster of pieces.  I also like that there are multiple vocal tracks.\n\nA little drawback is that, since there is no typical VN textbox/GUI, you can't see how to do certain things, like switching auto on, which is a big problem for some people.  If you want auto mode on, press A.  The game doesn't tell you this, which is a bit crappy - I read it in the reviews before playing, luckily, so I'll keep passing it on.  Oh god, I'm passing the rules on...  (play the VN to know why that's so noteworthy)\n\nOverall, Narcissus is a relatively short experience (about 10-11 hours legit playtime for me), and though the graphics and soundtrack are somewhat limited, and it's a kinetic novel with no choices to be made, I really enjoyed it.  It really makes you think about life, and might even make you well up a little bit, but among all the sadness, it might just make you smile too.", "timestamp_created": 1630706236, "timestamp_updated":

"review": "I am rewriting my review, since a plot summary is not what a review is supposed to be. Enjoy a slightly better review.\n\nThis was one of my first visual novels, and what a great one to start my journey with. These stories will break your heart in the best ways imaginable. With a premise so depressing, like being a terminal patient in a hospice and escaping said hospice, or meeting someone weeks from their death, and forming the tightest of bonds before they die-- these two brazenly sad stories are some of the best stories I have read. Even now, after 10 VNs on my record (and especially then, when this was my second,) this game hold a very special place in my heart.\n\nThis game deals with death, depression, suicide, illness, and choosing between dying in a hospital, or surrounded by your family. It is heavy stuff. But that's why it's so good. They handled these topics near-flawlessly, with just words and simple pictures. Even through silence, you can feel emotion between every character. There is no romance to be found; just companions who want to help each other through their limited time. This game shows you that even in the darkest of times, joy can be found, catharsis is achievable, and the good vastly outweighs the bad, if you simply let it. \n\nThe order I played these two stories greatly affected how they felt. I played the second story -- the one with the unnamed MC, first, meaning the money envelope was a mystery. Then I played the first one. At the end, I was crying for two reasons: because the envelope made sense now, [spoiler]and, of course, the death of Satsukis best friend.[/spoiler] I prefer the Second story, personally, but the first one had me good. I still get chocked up about the envelope, [spoiler] Satsukis and her friend's death, and MCs final \"speech\" about Satsuki.[/spoiler]\n\nI do want to talk about one scene in particular, and how it was reprised at the end. Spoilers for the end, of course.\nDuring MC and Satsukis road trip, they would stop by a beach, for Satsuki to stare off into it. One of these times, MC walks up to her, confused as to why she does this. She says something along the lines of \"If I were to walk out into the ocean to die... would you stop me?\" To which, he responds \"I don't know... we'll just have to see what happens.\" Then, they both return to the car. I still think that would be the LAST thing you should say to someone who is fucking suicidal, but that's not my point here. At the end, MC and Satsuki do a bit of a photo shoot with a disposable camera, showing Satsuki in a swimsuit; the only recorded moment of her being happy. After which, she takes of her white wristband (meaning she's a resident of the hospice,) and begins toward the ocean. MC calls out to her to ask her one last thing: \"Do you want me to stop you? Or, perhaps, you want me to give you a little push?\" Satsuki smiles at him, replying \"I'm not sure.\" and walks backwards, into the ocean, disappearing from sight. MC takes the wristband and developed photo, and drives off. I cannot remember exactly what his monologue at the end pertains, but all I know is that is was a strong ending to a Melancholy and Depressing story. The flawless callback to a small yet important scene makes the ending feel so much more impactful, and like a real climax to a sad story. And, the fact that who said what was switched; HE asked, and SHE didn't have an answer. Simply remarkable.\n\nThis game has a couple grammar errors, and I really wish the CGs existed, but I feel like they didn't want any colour in their story, unless it was important.

It is such as heartbreaking and beautiful game, and I'm so glad I got to play it.\n\nNarcissu is split into two stories: Narcissu 1st and Narcissu 2nd. Narcissu 1st is about a man who is admitted to 7F, the seventh floor of the hospital, due to his terminal illness. There he meets Setsumi, a woman who is also terminally ill. The man finds out that 7F is the hospice, where the terminally ill come to be treated until they die. Additionally, he finds out that other than terminal illness, he and Setsumi have something else in common: both would rather die elsewhere other than in 7F or at home. Thus, they leave the hospital and set off on a journey, the final journey of their lives.\n\nNarcissu 2nd takes place years before Narcissu 1st and follows a younger Setsumi, before her admission into 7F. Setsumi meets Himeko, a terminally ill patient, and the two strike up a friendship. From Himeko, Setsumi learns about cars, maps, and adventure, and in spite of her illness, Himeko's spirit seemingly never waned. Himeko's backstory is also revealed, in which she used to help other patients in 7F before her diagnosis of terminal illness. In similarity to Narcissu 1st, Himeko wants to take one final journey, and thus she and Setsumi set off to do so.\n\nBoth stories deal with the effects of terminal illness and loss. It is not easy to deal with the fact that someone close has a terminal illness. The entire livelihood of the one diagnosed with the illness is changed, and he/she will have to experience a slow but eventual death. The person's family and friends have to deal with knowing that loss will come in the near future, for there is nothing they can do to prevent death and raise the person's spirits to the fullest potential. The man, Setsumi, and Himeko realize these facts all too well. 7F should not be the place to die, where they're surrounded by medical staff and equipment in a setting that is all too familiar and painful. Home also should not be the place to die, where they're surrounded by family and friends who can only watch them fade away, who then must face the pains of loss right in front of them. There must be a better option.\n\nWhen I read the game description, I was reminded of a famous line in William Shakespeare's [i]Romeo and Juliet[/i]: \"A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life.\" Shakespeare literally tells his audience in the intro of his famous play that Romeo and Juliet will inevitably take their lives. The game description does the same: \"This is the story of a girl whose heart was standing still and a boy whose breath was being stolen away, both of whom die.\" Now that sounds depressing, but despite the fact that death is inevitable, why does this game exist; why does [i]Romeo and Juliet[/i] exist? Then I remembered: a story is never just about the resolution, and an adventure is never just about the destination. They are about everything in between: the preparation, the journey, the setbacks, the miracles, the seemingly little things that culminate into something memorable. During their road trip, the man and Setsumi bought clothes, had their picture taken, and slept under a roof that was neither a hospital's or a home's, before finally reaching flowers, beaches, and open water. Before their last goodbyes, Setsumi and Himeko had food and drinks together, read maps, and climbed a mountain to reach out to open skies. Yes, death is inevitable, especially under the circumstances of terminal illness, but it is the time spent beforehand that truly matters.\n\nIn the end, the interactions and development of these characters, followed by their drive to truly live before they die and their subsequent journeys away from familiarity culminate into an absolutely sweet, heartbreaking, and above all, beautiful game. It is true that we will inevitably say our goodbyes sometime later, but it is important to live in the now. Time is precious, so make the most of it, and life will become that much sweeter.", "timestamp_created": 1607673653, "timestamp_updated": 1607673653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637987792491912842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81830166": {"recommendationid": "81830166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437509458", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1609394255}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even know what to say.

This was a roller coaster of emotions packed into a stunning visual novel. I cried. A lot. More than what I was expecting.\n\nShort kinetic visual novel Narcissu has two stories that each deal with a terminal illness. All I can say is that you will experience strong gut-punches from emotions as you read this novel. Playing this and hoping to disappear into a fantasy world is not going to happen. The story of this visual novel is unadulterated, unfiltered, and stays true to the difficult, painful truth it explores.\n\nIf you want to read through this exquisitely written visual novel, there are a few things you should take into account. The narrative is divided into two stories. Although the second story takes place quite before the first story chronologically, reading the stories in either order won't significantly alter the reading experience. In addition, it is important to note that some of the content may bore some readers. This vn is rife with slow storytelling, a lack of character growth, and character CG. Narcissu might not be for you if you prefer watching the characters interact throughout the entire narrative and don't want to be stuck staring at still images of clouds, hospital rooms, and all the other background CG used.\n\nPersonal thoughts:\nI really liked this visual novel, so I wasn't bothered by the slow pacing at all. I think of it as the reader taking on the role of the storyteller and gradually feeling the suffering that the characters we follow are experiencing, as well as the slow, monotonous life that they are forced to lead by the circumstances of their lives. I really liked how little character-specific computer-generated imagery was used. I felt lonely and depressed as a result of it. It fit in well with the way Narcissu is attempting to tell its story. That is, at least, how I see it.\n\nAs a final note, sadness with a large portion of crying and heartache is all you'll know when you finish this visual novel\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1602592360, "timestamp_updated": 1664696019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76915661": {"recommendationid": "76915661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046787644", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1601592652}, "language": "english", "review": "Easiest 100% run I've ever done", "timestamp_created": 1601650829, "timestamp_updated": 1601650829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76835998": {"recommendationid": "76835998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036278026", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 185, "last_played": 1601508909}, "language": "english", "review": "just read it", "timestamp_created": 1601508931, "timestamp_updated": 1601508931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195110321044922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76422444": {"recommendationid": "76422444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378429993", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 156, "last_played": 1498464630}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very nice game/ visual novel.

It has two parts and I'll talk about both of them.\n\nNarcissu 1st follows Yuu Atou, a man who, due to his worsening condition, is sent to be taken care of on the 7th floor of the hospital. This is where he meets Setsumi Sakura, a girl who also has a terminal illness, and discovers that the 7th floor (referred to as \"7F\") is where patients with illnesses like theirs are sent to die with no hope of ever getting better. In an effort to find some meaning and closure in their lives, Yuu and Setsumi set off on a road trip, determined not to die on 7F.\n\nNarcissu 2nd is the prequel to Narcissu 1st and follows a younger Setsumi, before she is admitted to 7F. She meets a young woman named Himeko Shinohara in a hospital, who has been admitted to the 7th floor. Himeko is a rambunctious young woman despite her illness, loves cars, maps, and adventure, while Setsumi is quiet, stoic, and reserved. Despite this, they become friends and share a commonality due to their illness.\n\nBoth parts deal with a common theme that most people can relate to, which is loss. It's handled very well, so well I cried near the end of both of them because the imagery, writing (besides some spelling errors), and soundtrack is so good that it hits just the right notes to replicate the feeling of loss. It's what a good story does \u2015 it develops the characters and makes them real enough for you, the reader, to care about them, and this is what Narcissu does very well.\n\nIt took me around 8 hours to finish Narcissu (which is quite long for a free VN), but it depends on how fast you read and whether you have voice mode on and you're just listening to the story rather than reading it.

I forgot exactly how he articulates the idea but it more or less expressed how much changes when one is confronted with the specter of illness and mortality. What truly matters and what can anyone outside understand about lives developed in the face of death, year after year?\n\nI can\u2019t help but think the same whenever I read Narcissu. At its core, it is extremely minimalistic and short, having few of the accoutrements of most other VNs. A cast of two, few backgrounds and CGs, and an anemic playtime for anyone used to the marathon lengths of the likes of Fate/Stay Night or Muv Luv. But in many regards, this allows for a concise focus on the simple but poignant center of the VN, two terminally ill patients and what it is that matters, that anything matters alone on the precipice of death. \n\nThe narrative itself is simple, two patients steal a car on their way to a place away from the hospital or home, a death away from the hospital or home. We are succinctly told that\n\n[i]This is a story of so many things.[/i]\n[i]But most of all ...[/i]\n[i]This is the story[/i]\n[i]of a girl whose heart was standing still[/i]\n[i]and a boy whose breath was being stolen away,[/i]\n[i]both of whom die.[/i]\n\nThere is only one inexorable conclusion. But knowing the events themselves says nothing about the VN, it is how it conveys the gravitas of death. Mortality and illness rob the two of any normal life, it makes even the smallest, trivial actions a bare struggle during their journey. But there is no melodramatic self-pity, no (excessive) soliloquys, no convenient surrender, it may not be boldly defying fate but it stands upright in its resignation. For a VN so occupied with death, it expresses the greatest appreciation for the smallest, most insignificant moments that make up life.\nPerhaps not for everyone, but certainly worth the small time commitment for anyone with a remote interest.", "timestamp_created": 1599673993, "timestamp_updated": 1601024428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687847554683685303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75320124": {"recommendationid": "75320124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096226349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1599044634}, "language": "english", "review": "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZYYYYYYYYYYYYY GAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1599044674, "timestamp_updated": 1599044674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75320118": {"recommendationid": "75320118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839661818", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1599044286}, "language": "english", "review": "EZPZ", "timestamp_created": 1599044661, "timestamp_updated": 1599044661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "75074187": {"recommendationid": "75074187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296651598", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10, "last_played": 1598646495}, "language": "english", "review": "100% Achieved.", "timestamp_created": 1598646510, "timestamp_updated": 1598646510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509972631931304932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74832617": {"recommendationid": "74832617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325572446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 905, "last_played": 1598263346}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Beautiful art and story\n- Amazing soundtrack\n- Great voice acting\n\nCons\n- English text has so many typos and errors that really ruin the game.

With their strong stories, writing, & characterization being matched well by bittersweet OSTs, both Narcissu & Narcissu Side 2nd are more than worth the read, although my preference is definitely for the shorter, more focused story of Narcissu.\n\nNarcissu: A short 2-2.5 hour reading time is all it takes for this bittersweet read to fulfill its purpose, but that's not to say the writing is devoid of poetic flair & exposition. I'd say that, even if you're perhaps unsure about the setting & maybe even the medium as a whole, Narcissu's short length & well told story are enough to justify seeing it through to its conclusion..\n\nNarcissu Side 2nd: About twice the length of \"Narcissu\" thanks to a more fleshed out cast & (slightly) bigger scope. If you enjoyed Narcissu, then Side 2nd is a no brainer, offering further development & insight to the residents of Floor 7F. Again, a strong OST & improved art help bring the world to life, but it's the writing that really sets it apart from other free reads.\n\nOverall, an absolutely solid recommendation - especially as you've nothing to lose besides perhaps a few hours of your time. As far as first VNs go, you could do a hell of a lot worse than Narcissu, but please don't think that it's all the medium has to offer if you do wind up not enjoying it, as it's one of the most varied

I wouldnt even call this a game, its just a Visual Novel with no player input.

Ive finished 1st game in 95 minutes and i would urge you to play this game in one session, it truly is a unique experience. \n\nThis \"game\" is a masterpiece. Music is beautiful, art is very fitting. Its just so great to find something like this. Most VNs offer huge storylines with complex twists - they usually require a lot of hours to fully explore them. This one managed to present excellent story, atmosphere and realism and feelings in just 95 minutes. It has many sad, melancholic moments. It has warm moments that will put a smile on your face (i know they put a smile on mine). \n\nTheres one more thing Narcissu did - i dont think there is any game that comes even close - It managed to show us, desribe to us true feelings of sick people - what comes through their head, what do they do, what are they thinking about, all of this just in 95 minutes of your time.\n\nThere are 2 lines that stuck with me:\n\n\"Purpose has been born, so was the fear of losing that purpose.\"\n\"We had a map, we had our meds, we had a car but we had no time. We had no future.\"\n\n\nI know i will be remembering this game for a long time.\n If you have an hour and a half to spare, please try this piece of a game, it is truly amazing.\n\nReview of Narcissu 2nd:\n\nDidnt play yet, will play tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1579905125, "timestamp_updated": 1579905125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62143556": {"recommendationid": "62143556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246834666", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 1885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1341, "last_played": 1599637650}, "language": "english", "review": "this story was something we should all experience, no matter what place you're in life.", "timestamp_created": 1579539223, "timestamp_updated": 1579539223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62109053": {"recommendationid": "62109053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125928371", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1564389981}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is a book not a game.

This will be true even more so if you enjoy books and visual novels in general; those only interested in gameplay and have no intention to immerse themselves in a story will not find Narcissu to be enjoyable, it takes patience and a willingness to open up to the narrative. Narcissu's 'fading' artwork, dialogue, and minimalist UI are artistic choices that also add to the mood and tone of the very tragic story which I believe fit the game almost too well. These decisions add to a style that makes you wish you knew more about the characters in the game, adding to the narrative and adding a bittersweet feeling to the larger conversation taking place in the game itself.\n\nThe story of Narcissu 1st and 2nd was some of the most eye opening work I've ever experienced, to understand and empathize with the people stuck in the metaphorical \"waiting room\". While we all bear the burden of a fleeting life and inevitable death, Narcissu manages to convey the struggle of knowing that without a doubt, on any given day, you can die. This connects to the sad and inevitable fate of a youth(s) having to confront this unbearable burden so early in life; the topic is beyond depressing, but it really does show the silver lining of life and makes you question many commonly brushed off questions like, \"Is there a circumstance in which breaking the law is acceptable?\". Understanding how meaningful that a last experience is to somebody is very difficult and illustrates just how beautiful life is, despite the existential crisis we all face and that even a little bit of joy can make our lives worth living.\n\nThank you for reading through this, I hope more people will receive the blessing of experiencing Narcissu; make sure to bring some tissues for the feels train!", "timestamp_created": 1566786936, "timestamp_updated": 1566787228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523850858211517334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54641658": {"recommendationid": "54641658", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236354274", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 615, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 35, "last_played": 1565935983}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cool.", "timestamp_created": 1565935957, "timestamp_updated": 1565935957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54494000": {"recommendationid": "54494000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254983136", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 377, "last_played": 1564531126}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

As you might expect from this concept, it's a pretty sad story but it's definitely worth experiencing at least once. The game has 2 different stories, 1st focuses on an unnamed male character as the protagonist and a quiet woman named Setsumi. 2nd is a prequel that features Setsumi as the protagonist, but it focuses more on a former christian named Himeko. I thought it was really cool how 2nd links back to 1st and explains a lot of small details about Setsumi.\n\nThe presentation of the game was pretty good, there aren't too many CGs but they do show up at key points in the story and I really dig the art style, you can get a feel for it on the store screenshots. The voice acting is pretty nice, some minor characters with only a few lines of dialogue aren't voiced which isn't really a huge issue, and the soundtrack is excellent. Lots of nice piano tracks and a few vocal songs. If the concept interests you, try it out!

And yeah, I know, I'm probably gonna get some quite heavy criticism if not outright getting my account banned for daring to say so, to give voice to my opinion. But ya know what? That's exactly 'why' I'm gonna give my perspective, as the fear of speaking out against what's popular is not a correct line of thinking. But with that said, I shall simply do my standard review format; Pros, cons, closing statement, and final verdict.\n\nPROS: \n\n + Beautiful music. I loved the piano melodies; they were so calm and serene. Then again, I am a bit of a piano nut, so..yeah. ^~^\"\n\n + No hassle. This can just be downloaded and read, no problem, no configuration, no nothin'.\n\n + Voices are optional. There's voiced and unvoiced mode. I really, really like that. Granted, volume controls are fairly normal, but...yeah. It's nice to just have an unvoiced mode.\n\n + Most important part; it's free.\n\nCONS: \n\n- Boring, uninteresting characters. It makes sense, but I literally cannot feel attached to either of them.\n\n- Repitition. In some cases it's good for recapping, but in several moments the MC said the same exact thing twice in a row, back to back.\n\n- Awkward writing. I'm gonna blame it on translation for this one, but yeah....it's not only hard to tell who is speaking when, but also a few instances of typos, albeit forgiveable, are still noticeable. \n\n- Dull plotline. We get it. They don't have much of a future. let's move on. Seriously. That seems like the whole premise of the entire story, is just driving in a more or less straight line across irrelevant places to do nobody-cares-what, not even the characters temselves really care about what's going on.\n\n- So little is said, for how many words are there.\n\n- No auto-mode. Sure, there's a skip mode, but not auto. \n\n- Choppy dialogue; literally everything happens and/or is said one singular sentance at a time. Which not only causes a few things to get rather disjointed at times, but also makes it so that you have to press the next button (in my case either enter key or space bar, though some people prefer clicking mouse 1) a LOT. Hence why an auto feature would be nice.\n\n- Limited artwork. Granted, it's incredibly hard to make good-looking art for the full screen to enjoy, especially in an FTP book, buuuuuuuuut all the illustrations are made using just a single thin strip across the middle of the screen in mandatory windowed mode. I personally prefer windowed mode in visual novels, BUT the option between the two is nice.\n\nUltimately, it's nice that there are free Ebooks like this around, to give poorer readers and readers on a budget something to enjoy, but being free doesn't excuse it from it's mistakes. And it's flaws, while seemingly small, outnumber it's perks. Ultimately, this is a good story to read if you're bored out of your mind but can't afford a better VN, or if you've already read all the good ones and just wanna somehow read all the visual novels steam has to offer; maybe a collector or something, I dunno. But all in all, it wasn't a TERRIBLE story either. But if you thought you were bored before reading this visual novel, then your previous boredom would seem vibrant and lively compared to the boredom afterwards.\n\n3 out of 10; below average score.", "timestamp_created": 1546420362, "timestamp_updated": 1546420362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487925559282302856", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "47709709": {"recommendationid": "47709709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830574934", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1525151360}, "language": "english", "review": "The most depressing thing i have ever read.

I believe that it uses the visual novel style well. It is simplistic but I find it quite elegant and portrays the heavy emotions of the story well. \nMy problems come from the 2nd side/story. I found it exceedingly bland and boring, lacking the power and interest the original story had. The relationships between characters were minute and many but it did not carry the same strength as the single relationship shown in the first game. I honestly didn't read the whole thing and just skipped through it to get all the achievements.\nThat being said, this being a free game, read the 1st story at least. It is fabulous and moving.

It's such a sad and melancholy story, that makes you value your life and the lives of those around you so much more. It's packed with emotion and sadness, but has a very valuable story among all the feels it brings.\n\nI really enjoyed this visual novel. There are no choices, just a sit back and listen story split into two parts. (I recommend B side, or the second story first, as it takes place [i]before[/i] A side or the first story.) It deals with the topic of death, regrets, religion and suicide so if these are sensitive topics for you, I would avoid this novel. Otherwise, this is a very good story from the perspective of people who should have no hope left, and what they do with their situations when the world has not been kind to them.\n\nNarcissu is a very \"real\" game. Everything that takes place in the story is something that could very well happen in real life. It's a slice of life novel, for when your slice of life isn't what you always hoped it would be. It's a heartwarming and beautifully told story, just as long as you can hold your tears back for the endings.\n\nLike most small project visual novels, the translation is a bit off. You can still make sense of the story, but some things may be a bit confusing to understand in an English-speaking audience. The soundtrack is beautifully done, as is the artwork. It was strange to me that only a small sliver of art was shown with the dialog, but it grows on you and isn't too big of an issue unless you highly prefer that the art takes up the entire screen.\n\nI really enjoyed this novel, and if you did too you should look into their second version of this game, the 10th Anniversary Project.

I'm not sure if this was intentional or if it was included for the reader to understand the beliefs being a Catholic (Himeko has Catholic upbringing) brings towards a serious topic like this. \nThe translation of the 2 Narcissu VNs differs between Agilis and Haeleth, for me Agilis' translations were more direct yet emotional though Haeleth's versions added more depth to the story and seemed to have additional 'conversations' and came across as a more academic work wanting to include every detail just as a student would aim for in their thesis. \nIn my view both translations are worth reading because it helps give a 'complete' visual experience of the novel and, after all, isn't that the purpose with VNs?\n\nNarcissu 1st is a few chapters shorter than Side 2nd and delves straight into Yuu Atou (the Male protagonist) being diagnosed with lung cancer & upon entering 7th floor encounters Setsumi who now becomes a role similar to Himeko's in Side 2nd except Setsumi is much more reserved in personality. Yuu discovers Setsumi's desire to not finish up at home or at 7th floor so the two go off on an adventure that really captures the Reader as Yuu & Setsumi experience decisions that are both thrilling for them but also opens up a side to Setsumi that maybe she craved the whole time she was at 7th floor and that is - would someone care enough to want to stop her decision or would they respect it and honour it?\n\nBetween the 2 VNs the 'journeys' were similar yet from different perspectives in that Himeko was facing the same choices that Setsumi did in the 1st yet they were also shaped for Setsumi by Himeko. The music is exceptionally good and whether you do Voiced or Unvoiced the experiences would be lessened greatly without the music, that's not to say the art didn't play it's part because it did help add to the Visual side and complimented the story & the music. \n\nOverall, this is Free (that was a request made by the Author Tomo Kataoka) and, even though it covers a topic that is depressing because of the finality of it, the writing is a beautiful insight into cancer that is rarely explored from the mindset, beliefs and thoughts of the cancer victim especially as their time draws to an end. The question then becomes do they Live and seek out their wishes one final time or do they wait for the end without any freedom of choice?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nLiked what you see?

It is recommended (by the author) to read the 2nd first, but I didn't catch that until after I read the first one.  Either way works... I thought the 2nd was better than the first, if that matters somehow.\nNot that I care too much about it, but the art could be seen as lacking.\nThe music seemed to fit in pretty well. \nAnd then we get to the story and characters... This will be tough.\n\nThe characters are... not that interesting.  They are bland, to me anyway.  And this usually would be a criticism, but when you go through the story, it makes sense why they are that way.  So, I don't know how to... review this part.  I thought they were boring, and the interactions for the first 90% of the (1st) game are almost cringe-worthy... but I understand why it's that way.  I know this may not make much sense, but take it as you will.  The 2nd story is better with this: some of those characters are pretty interesting (interactions are still a bit weak).\n\nThe story is a big 'feels trip,' if you can put yourself in the situations described and imagine it, you will feel strongly about the story, and this is what pretty much makes up for.... everything.  A lot of people praise this, and it certainly made me feel more empathetic at times.  Also, the game is free, so you can give it a few hours of trying it out if you'd like and make a decision as you play.  The story was definitely worth the read.\n\nI, personally, have some issues with the story, but that is of a personal nature: for my review, I'll recommend trying it out and just read above for my 'neutral' take on this.  The rest of what follows is just my personal thoughts/feelings on this.\n\nI felt... that this story 'glorified' or 'romanticized' something that should not be glorified at all.  I know it's a story, and it's expanding one's way of thinking and just a take on things... but I still don't like that at all.  If you read the story, you'll probably guess it rather quickly.\n\nThis story also goes into religion somewhat, and presents what I feel is a... one-sided view on things?  I think that's the best way to describe it.  I completely understand why it's included, I know why people feel this way, and I'm sure it's a popular view.  It makes sense with the story.  But it sucks that nothing was really presented to show a different way, a different view to balance this.  So I will post that view here, if you wish to read (spoiler alert though):\n\n[spoiler]\nGod loves you and cares.  I know it's difficult to understand sometimes, I know it's difficult to see, I know sometimes it does NOT feel that way, and things happen that don't make sense.  It's fine to be mad sometimes.  But He does care, so don't give up on Him.  Or yourself, for that matter.\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1497407887, "timestamp_updated": 1497407887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32396952": {"recommendationid": "32396952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027180717", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 201, "playtime_forever": 194662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1690685621}, "language": "english", "review": "ill give you a good reccomndation even though id didnt work for me :)\n\n\n\nGood Luck", "timestamp_created": 1497384521, "timestamp_updated": 1497384521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466702431440353394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "32313010": {"recommendationid": "32313010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097996432", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1497085272}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not really into visual novels, but this one, even don't having choices or interaction, it's, imo., a very meaningful piece of art.\n\nYou might think [i]\"what's the point of playing a book?\"[/i] But this visual novel uses everything to turn the simple read into a great experience, the passing, music and visual choices (like the choose for less, but more significant, area of illustration) are all great in setting the theme and touching the emotional of the reader, in a way that neither a book, audio-book or a pack of illustrations could do by their own.

However, there are some games I enjoy very much which are often referred to as visual novels. [i]Ace Attorney[/i]. [i]Danganronpa[/i]. To an extent, [i]The Walking Dead[/i], though it is more commonly referred to as something along the lines of an \"interactive movie\". Even some rpgmaker games, such as the line of games: [i]To The Moon[/i], [i]A Bird Story[/i], and, I assume, the coming sequel [i]Finding Paradise[/i]. \n\nBut the thing is... these \"visual novels\" normally come with some kind of interactivity. Moving around, examing objects, quick-time events, dialogue options, even some mini-games. They gain the title of \"visual novel\" from the intense focus on story and that, at times, all you can do to advance the story is to continuously press the button to move to the next line. But they have other features. [i]Narcissu[/i], on the other hand, does not.\n\nThat is what surprised me about [i]Narcissu[/i]... That there was literally no gameplay and you just clicked your way through all portions of the story. I'm not going to hold this against the game. It was clearly tagged as such under \"visual novel\". I'm simply used to, I guess, games that are in the same realm as visual novels, but not quite. So I had a hard time maintaining interest. That, however, does not mean I regret reading through the story. \n\n[i]Narcissu 1st[/i] I found exceptionally compelling. The thoughts of life and death are rather similar to my own. The tedium from inaction at the thought of wasting away in a hospital, terminally ill. The unbreakable spirit in doing what you want in life and dying on your own terms. Every person's right to die when they want or feel they need to die. I found myself to be rather fond of Setsumi's perspective. [i]Narcissu 2nd[/i] wasn't a bad expansion upon the characters, but it is longer and I didn't feel as interested. However, the epilogue ties things up nicely. \n\nI kind of liked this story, and I loved the sentiment behind it. As long as you know ahead of time that this is a true Visual Novel, then there would be no reason not to enjoy it.

The latter is because there is no sprite that shows up on the screen when someone is talking like in typical VNs. After finishing the game (about 4 hours total play time), those complaints are still there, but I was drawn in by the story. I think it is an interesting take on the philosophy of mortality. Just one of those games where you can think about it afterwards and decide whether it makes sense for you or not.\n\nIf you are into VNs I think it is worth a couple hours, especially since it is free. \n\nTip: When you start a game, it will let you choose between launch screens. It is not obvious that you are actually picking between 1st or 2nd since there is no labeling. You should be playing 1st before 2nd for proper story continuity.

Some people mentioned that it's really dated, and I do agree, but it's not a bad thing. The simple graphics and artwork make you appreciate the story more, and leaves everything more to your imagination. The soundrack so far has been amazing, and ties very well with the very melancholy/gloomy mood that 1st is set in. I have a feeling that the majority of my gameplay time will be just listening to the OST. The story was drawn out, but I think that was for the better as well. It allowed you time to connect and sympathize with Setsumi and the Protagonist. I knew what to expect with the ending, as it's typical with Japanese stories and VNs in particular, but man, that ending hit me hard. Tears weren't really shed, but the feels did hit me once I realized what happened. \n\nA very thought-provoking story, and I highly recommend it. Even if you aren't into the VNs, each story takes only a few hours to complete (Narcissu 1st can be completed in one sitting). Definitely worth the download.

"last_played": 1469417195}, "language": "english", "review": "(This review is only about Narcissu 1st, as I have not played the second one yet)\n\nI went into this game with very low expectations, I believe because I stumbled upon a bunch of negative reviews that sounded really reasonable.\n\nMy criticisms are basically only about the presentation. Contrary to what you'd read in other reviews, it's not because it's too minimalistic: I respect a conscious decision by a developer, and some people (me included) might even like the approach. My problem is that whoever made this VN has contradicted themselves with weird design choices: judging by the in-game commentary, it seems that the intent of the game was to leave most things up to the player's imagination, and they couldn't decide wether the game had to have voice acting or not, so they gave you the option to choose.\n\nThis would have been absolutely the right choice, if it weren't for the fact that the game has the actual characters appear, even if just once or twice throughout the whole VN, which to me completely negates the whole \"I want you to imagine it\" experimental book approach. It's either contradictory, or I didn't get what the author meant, or he was just referring to imagining the characters voices?\n\nAnyway, all of that is nothing more than a minor complaint: especially for a free game, the story dealt with such a heavy theme in a way that would result \"boring\" only to people who failed to read between the lines, and truth be told the story and character development is not even that subtle (including having some occasional moe-y tropes, but rare and well placed, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like that kind of thing), yet in its \"light\" approach it manages not to neglect the serious theme that is being used. In a way, the premise itself is what makes you see such a sequence of seemingly mundane events in an entirely different way. ...actually, that's probably pretty much the whole point of the VN and I'm just stating the obvious because I'm dumb.\n\nDifficult to say why I liked it so much. I suppose the theme of what to do when going towards certian death has always fascinated me (in fact, I tried this VN to study how other authors approached this theme, since I am writing something with that theme myself), and that kept me in a constant state of... not tension, but something like that? Another term that right now I can't find, something that has more to do with dread and bittersweetness.\n\nIt's a small game dealing with a big theme and it definitely surpassed my expectations: definitely struck a chord with someone like me who is usually not very emotional, so I'd say give it a try. Best experienced when in the right mood.\n\nAnother minor criticism: the ending (when the male character speaks for the last time, not the \"other character's ending\" before that) was a bit clich\u00e8 if not even cheesy, but at the very least still came off as emotionally touching as the rest of the game due to its context.", "timestamp_created": 1470262725, "timestamp_updated": 1480476128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "24676243": {"recommendationid": "24676243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256518647", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 308, "last_played": 1470167017}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a REALLY sad game!

I never bothered to review it the first time though, because I wasn't sure how to put into words what I experienced. I still don't think I am.\n\nOddly, there's not a lot to say. This novel is profoundly beautiful in its minimalistic presentation, the way the characters (of which there's only really one) are conveyed is surprisingly simplistic, yet that's where a lot of the emotional impact comes from. \n\nIt's strange, but your character themselves is more of a passive proxy for describing the futility and beauty of the last few days of someone's life. There isn't a major amount of dialog, but what little is there really serves to illustrate the feeling this someone experiences in their last few days alive; to die on 7F or at home. A last act of defiance.\n\nMusic is fantastic, very fitting with the rest of the novel in that it's melancholic, passive yet still powerful enough to pull you into the scene and hope for the best. Not a ton of scenes, but they aren't the focal point anyway; they don't even take up that much of the screen. Text is also presented well in a nice, minimalistic fashion, yet still descriptive enough to paint some really great imagery.\n\nIt's a really unique experience, but probably not something you want to read before going to a party or something. It's a beautiful short story. I wouldn't recommend this one if you're depressed though.

The young character(s) you are \"playing\" this visual novel as is/are diagnosed with a terminal illness, so they are sent to the \"Seventh floor\" where they receive palliative, non-curative treatment as there is no treatment for their illnesses (in the first, the second part's hero is a young girl who is a frequent patient at a local hospital). From there on you get to experience how they deal with their condition, see their more interesting days, take note of sparks of possible hope for the characters.\n\nStories like these really have a tendency to break your heart and force a tear out of you.\n\nHowever, on the other side, there is a bit of a problem with how the developer(s) described the palliative, non-curative treatment floor (remember, the Seventh floor). It felt almost like a lifeless area where nurses and doctors didn't seem even interested on making sure their patients are doing fine, while in reality, palliative treatment teams are always keen on making sure their patient experiences the best they can before their final hour's arrival.\n\nStill, the tragic stories in these visual novels are solid.

I didn't expect much, ya know? But boy, was I plesantly surprised. Though, I use plesant in a weird way: I had a great time wiping away my tears, I guess.\n\nThere were issues, yes. The panel changing was a little odd sometimes. There were spelling errors drizzled about. I even had two clicks that were just odd symbols for who knows why. But there are easly looked over if you just skim like I did.\n\nNarcissu 1st was definitly the odd ball for me. There were questionable actions taken by the characters and some things I felt were not well explained, but the ending was so worth the journey there and most everything that was confusing was explained in the 2nd part. But as I said in the very beginning, if you start with the 2nd it should make more sense.\n\nI don't have much else to say, other than the fact that you /need/ to play this game if you like visual novels.

More than that, it's been a long time since I've felt compelled to write a review at all. But shortly after starting the second part I started to feel the urge to write this.\n\nI've feel bored, confused and aimless with this game. I've played a lot of visual and kinetic novels, including some [spoiler]sad[/spoiler] ones, so no blame on the playability aspects is put. It's about the content and \"art direction\".\n\nMaybe it's because of my personal beliefs on the matter of [spoiler]suicide[/spoiler] that I couldn't connect at all with the characters. The lack of character art, descriptions, context... aggravated that. In fact, I probably enjoyed the best the second part prologue, which is the part with [spoiler]no drama[/spoiler] in it. I guess that the styling of the message didn't favour the content of the message at all. Of course, this may be different for you (YMMV).\n\nI failed to see the message of the work too. Often I found myself wondering \"What should I be feeling or asking myself?\". Even after reading the game notes I'm not sure of the purpose of the work. And I think that's at least partially a fault of the design decisions.\n\nAs an example of this, I didn't like the voices, nor the art. The voices would have suited best some half-hearted commedy than this story ambitioning to be as deep as possible without being less broad and remaining evocative to the reader. More than support the story, the voices broadened the gap between story and reader. And I'm a player that as often as possible relies on text-to-speech synthesis to voice unvoiced games. The most interesting game reflection is the one I'm having while writing the review. The author asks himself, as you can read in the game notes, whether the game's assets must be kept minimalistic to not impose a particular view. Probably the neutral TTS voices I usually listen to do the trick of increasing my enjoyment of games without being intrussive.\n\nClosing, finally. Many people seemed to enjoy this game.

Though the characters are distant at first, there is an intimacy between the them that develops which was touching and the soundtrack and voice track simply enhance the experience. For a doujin work, the artwork is quite well done and the minimalistic approach of presenting the setting and characters allowed me to have a more personalized experience with the story. The rare moments when I actually got to see the Setsumi's face actually felt precious. I really liked this approach. However, I did notice some inconsistencies with some of the art, but it was not terribly noticeable.\nIt's a touching story about two terminally ill patients who are unhappy with their situation, who go on a search for a place that they can die peacefully.

(Art is debatable)\n\nWhere to start....\nI had played the first game a while ago, back when steam wasn't famous and the visual novel genre wasn't really famous, it was my second Visual Novel ever, Tsukihime being the first.\nI replayed Tsukihime not so long ago and with a greater capability for analysis I found it even more enjoyable and noticed some stuff I didn't notice the first time. Not so long ago I told myself \"Hey, why not? Narcissu is now available on steam, let's replay it.\"\n\nJust as with Tsukihime, I enjoyed it even more this time, and it was way more painful. They present a sad reality and execute it really well, the inner conflicts of someone who knows they will die soon without a specified date. The OST just fits perfectly for each scene and makes you feel even closer to the character during their conversations, even cheerful conversations can feel painful at times because of the tone the characters speak with(The VAs do a pretty great job with this, I was amazed). You notice the pain they are carrying inside and you feel for them.\n\nAnd then comes side 2nd, which expands into this topic by presenting you another part of the conflict: Those who are left behind. The trouble close relatives go through when someone they hold dear  is close to dying, and how they try their hardest to support them despite their pain. And not  only that, but they develop further the main character from the first game and it makes you realize how she turned out that way. Every little detail mattered in the development of her character. \n\nIn the end, just like first, you go through a feelings roller coaster, the conversations tug heavily at your heart and the more you advance the more you know about the 7th floor and its patients.

I played this long before it came out on steam)\nA very sad story set in the 7th floor of an hospital. This floor is where terminal ill patients are sent for them to stay for their last moments and our main characters are the inhabitants of this floor. \nFrom this you can already imagine that this is not going to be an happy story (despite the 22 yo lolita)\nYou will cry. And a lot. The entire visual novel is a story about life and death, which puts in contrast the behaviour of Setsumi, whose hope is long gone, and Yuu, who just arrived and has yet to understand Setrumi true feelings.\nThis game comes with the second game of the series, that is a prequel, which explains some plot holes about the first one.\nWhile the first part earns points for the originality of the story, the second one looks a bit like a repetition of the previous one so not everyone may like it: we again have a terminally ill protagonist, older than our previous character, who is going through the same that Setsumi  will have to face in the future. The second one is \"lighter\" than the previous one, and sometimes a bit easy to predict\n BUT\nWhat you should notice is the completely different kind of ending (which I won't spoil) that they have, making the first one even more sad when compared. \nTL;DR\nIt's free, it's 2 in 1, it's beautifully sad. Read it\nP.S. Since a lot of people don't seem to know... This is a KINETIC NOVEL, which means that there won't be any choices.\nYes, there are visual novel that are read-only.

The story is incredibly depressing there are very few feelgood moments and the dialouge is stiff and blunt most of the time. The writing makes it hard to follow sometimes as without any names above the words you may not know whos saying what until you piece it together. this had a hard time getting me involved with the characters as the main character you never even find out his name or what he's sick from. nothing from what he likes to what his life before he got sick is revieled leaving you fairly in the dark about anything other than what happens after getting sick. The story is rewarding to finish however it is far from something id run to my friends to tell them about. the music is good and fitting most tmes however none of it is memorible either. overall I give this a thumbs up to play but only for those really really wanting to play another VN after exausting all other options. if you have not played a VN before look elsewhere there are better done ones elsewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1437780675, "timestamp_updated": 1437780675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17208763": {"recommendationid": "17208763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114373947", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 22, "last_played": 1437764190}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes you cry.\n10/10 would not play again due to feels.\nStill great.", "timestamp_created": 1437764602, "timestamp_updated": 1437764602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "17205520": {"recommendationid": "17205520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047220260", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 563, "last_played": 1558125409}, "language": "english", "review": "This visual novel made me think about my life.

Sometimes it's not just about depression or self-blame. Rather, it can be about feeling objectified and out of control, coupled with a deeply profound view on the long-term effects interactions will have on anyone involved in the health/well-being process. \n\nFocusing on how people in these positions can and will think about how to execute the \"end-game\" was extremely welcoming and refreshing to see explored, When the body fails and is beyond personal control, most people don't know the internal struggle that ensues in trying to be resolve the situation and re-align the bodyand mind in the most peaceful way possible.\n\nI unintentionally played the game 1st and 2nd, without knowing the developer wanted it to be played in reverse. However, I enjoyed the juxtaposition of the stories, and the conclusions that can be drawn by revisiting the first part after completing the second are very eye-opeing. I was happy that the subject of religion and morality was brought up in the 2nd, because it is a deep and frustrating struggle that people really wrestle with in the medical world (and will continue to do so).\n\nOverall, highly recommended, especially if you or someone you know is going through a similar fight.", "timestamp_created": 1436012448, "timestamp_updated": 1436012448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550561785697937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16854954": {"recommendationid": "16854954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199505427", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1476067747}, "language": "english", "review": "Narcissu 1st & 2nd is not just simply a good visual novel, but rather an unique lesson and even a simulation of life and death.

The soundtrack contains - at least, as I guess, after playing for almost 3 hours - probably only two songs, but I didn't recognized this as a problem, yet it worked out really well, since you got to know whether that scene was sad or just glumly just by recognizing the right song. The sound effects also were fine, even if I got somehow scared, hearing - the first sound of a human, not a car or the waves - a girl crying and sobbing. \nComing next to the pictures, I'm somehow unimpressed. I got the impression, that there are too less pictures. Plus pictures barely showed humans, making it very unlively. Also more than a few pictures were used too often. The effect, the soundtrack, containing only a few songs, had, reaches here for the opposite. It formerly tells you \"yes, in the car again, nothing new, nothing exciting at all\" and you may come to think it's really boring, not worth going on with reading. That somehow got to be my case, but there are also a few other points according to that.\nThe text itself is written from a to the protagonist limited narrator, containing very much dialogs. \n[i] And here comes the reason why I wrote \"unvoiced\" in bold in the first line:[/i]\nIt's unbelievable hard to follow who is saying what. When it was almost over, you could tell from the way the characters speak, who just said that, but in the beginning, it's a real pain and it confuses and makes the story incredibly boring.\nHonestly, I was close to quitting the game mid-way. \nWell, I continued till the end, always thinking \"no matter how sad it is going to be, since I was so confused in the first part, I won't be affected that badly (meaning I won't show any emotion like setsumi)\". But I have to say, I was at least a bit wrong. It didn't got me that hard, but it [i]was[/i] somehow sad.\n\n[spoiler] There is another problem, I had with the story: WHY THE HELL IS THE PROTAGONIST A GUY??! Either I missed that part, in the first few sentences or it was supposed to be like that. But now, I have a different view on everything what happened. It confuses me even incredibly more. I somehow dislike the protagonist being a guy, I would prefer that story, I already imagined all the time, dealing with two girls. [/spoiler]\n\nIf you wanna give it a try, being interested in this visual novel, please, for your own sake, play the voiced version.\nI started the second season just yet, this time voiced, and until now, nobody except the protagonist - [i]a girl[/i] - was dubbed. I have no idea, if that's the same case in the first season, I won't try. I also won't go on reading the second season, because I don't think it's worth anymore, confusion being the cause.\n\nI hope I did help you, deciding whether you should give this novel a try, since it's for free.", "timestamp_created": 1432675365, "timestamp_updated": 1435601401, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463001370429992676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16012071": {"recommendationid": "16012071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113610511", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1420567759}, "language": "english", "review": "Narcissu in a nutshell: an [b] emotional rollercoaster [/b] of a visual novel that will surely leave an emotional mark for hours after finishing it.

As its intention was evoking emotions, it did the job.\n\nLet's get down to business (I will keep this spoiler-free). Narcissu visual novels (VN) are not strictly games: they have no interactive parts whatsoever. You can just click away and the story continues linearly with no choices. Even the achievements are just reading the novels to their ends.\n\nNarcissu (both of them) is a story about people [i]living with[/i] a terminal disease. Note the emphasis. It's a highly emotional and tragic story, with death being a constant theme. Nevertheless, the characters lives are what's important.\n\nCuriously, the type of the disease is left unrevealed in all cases, emphasising the life of the person instead of the sickness. At all times the story follows one of the protagonists from their perspective, revealing what goes through their head. (Most) Protagonists and some important characters have voice-overs for their dialogue. Scenes are covered by nice, melodical piano songs and occasional other instruments.\n\nApart from many other visual novels, the visuals are very simple: usually there's just a serene scene that depicts the place where the events take place e.g. a kitchen or a countryside. There are very few scenes with people. The style didn't appeal to me strongly. However, I think that at important (i.e. dramatic) times the scenes were well done.\n\nA couple of things about 1st and 2nd novels separately. In my opinion Narcissu 1st begins slowly, with the protagonist being admitted to a hospital and angsting away there. In Chapter 1 it seems like nothing is happening and frankly I was bored while reading it. Fortunately, in half-way through Chapter 2 it finally begins happening, so be sure to endure until that time. Narcissu 2nd is better in this respect as it has a branching story line from the beginning with several characters.\n\nWhile both VNs are originally Japanese, there are fortunately two English translations of Narcissu 1st. The Agilis translation (the one I read thoroughly) has rather lot of typos and in some small parts it is left unfinished. To me it felt rather clunky. Only afterwards I briefly checked the gp32 translation and it turns out gp32 is a more polished and \"proper\" translation to English than Agilis. Narcissu 2nd has only Agilis translation to English that was fortunately a lot better and more polished than the one in Narcissu 1st.\n\nFor me, Narcissu 1st was 3-hour read and 2nd a 5-hour one. While it's possible to skip through the story by pressing CTRL for achievements, I can recommend reading through the story: it's an emotional and even revealing experience to issues and thoughts of people suffering from difficult diseases. As such, it provokes one to think about life perhaps from a new perspective.

I tried to avoid them as much as possible.          The game is self is split in to two parts, the first and second side. I made the mistake of playing them in the oposite order so that might affect my general rating of it. If you come into it expecting gameplay you will get none, are no choices to be made of enviroments to explore. Its entirely on rails. However as someone who just got into Visual Novels this didn't really bug me. The real meat, or should I say only meat is in the story. \n\nThe first part is what I consider to be the strongest part of the game. You are immediately thrown into a hospice with no other explination. The rest of part one is the adventure the two main protaganists go on. The game did a very good job of pushing the story along. Although I did find it hard to relate with Setsumi, girl that goes along. Other than that Part one gets a strong recomendation from me. Most of the issues I have with the game apear in the second half\n\nThe \"2nd side\" more of a preqel if anything helping explain some of what happened in the 1st half. The 2nd side started really good, but ended on a poor note. They introduce my favorite charactor in the game Himeko who is an energetic car enthusiast. She shares and unlikely friendship with Yuka a girly girl who wears frilly clothing. The interactions between the two of them were quite charming leading to ocasional comidic banter. However in the second half she gets replaced by Setsumi, who is far less interesting in almost every way. There could have been an oppertunity to include her again later on however that doesnt really happen. The biggest problem that I have with the 2nd side, is the pointless shoehorning of religion. The ending had far less of an impact on me than it should have because of the constant reminder of the Catholic Church and praying. The whole thing felt like it was being wote by a Catholic, but I checked the notes and the author doesn't consider them selves \"among the faithful\". In the end however the story was good. even with the ocassional church sceen.\n\nUltimately I would recomend the whole thing. If you are a Catholic you will probably enjoy it twice as much as I did. Just understand that it's a visual novel and there is  no gameplay.

A bit too depressing for my tastes, but it does seem to capture the essence of what it would be like to live with such a condition.

It was a warm May afternoon, and I got  a 2 hours off after the swimming class and before after-class curriculum. I had only a mobile phone, no homework, no friends around, and nothing to do but waiting for the curriculum. So I found myself so bored that I have to seek something interesting - except playing games on my phone that  I had cracked for several times. I checked google play store, with the keyword that I've  forgotten, and my focus was caught by an app with a cover of white background and a smiling girl. Its  name was \u201c\u6c34\u4ed9\u201d (shuixian, means narcissus in Chinese). I downloaded it, thinking it was some kind of Life simulation bishojo game, which was a perfect way of wasting time. That's how I found Narcissu, the Chinese translated version. \n\nHowever, it's Narcissu. The result of playing this \"Life simulation bishojo game\" was that I had totally forgotten what was around me for the next 2 hours, because all my focus was on this novel. No matter how loud guys were when the class was over, no matter how warm the sunshine was, what I  could only feel was a kind of regretting, for something that I could not express at that time. That's Narcissu. I did not cry, but my heart was somehow hollowed at the time I finished it.

It's a theme which requires more love from modern literature and media emphasis. Sharing more consistency with Narcissu is John Green's novel, [i]The Fault in Our Stars[/i] (there is also a film) so that may give you an idea of the amount of heartache and satisfaction Narcissu may offer as a sad but worthwhile read.\n\n[h1]Reminiscent of the best 90s Japanese romance mangas but thankfully reads minus the drama overdrive[/h1]\n    Closer to the likes of previously noted, popular modern young adult novels, Narcissu is oddly empowering as many stories like it are even for mature adults. You are a young girl without much time to live but still plenty of life left in you. It is down-to-earth and focuses on realism despite its medical inconsistencies so no character is perfect and there is no right or wrong on the perception of life, death and [spoiler]suicide[/spoiler]. Even the religious slant in Narcissu 2 refreshingly had no bias or distortion. I recently played [i]The Cat Lady[/i], which is a beloved game on Steam also deeply based on death and [spoiler]suicide[/spoiler]. But it had several points where equality disintegrated in a beaker full of acid-ridden negativity (you'll see the logic behind this if you play the game). On the other spectrum, Narcissu, like its title, is honed to a emphatically personal experience in a much more positive way without losing force. \n\n[h1]The idea of freedom and choice within a world that lacks it[/h1]\n    Loss and pain through the death of a loved one is excruciating as well as highly disorientating. Looking back on several personal experiences, it feels distinctly like falling through limbo. It is the most earth shattering and realistic inevitability that could ever happen to any living soul. So it is my belief that many people understandably dislike any variation of such a storyline which hints death and desolation with no escape or way to \"win\", especially due to the likely sense of powerlessness it makes the player/reader undergo. [u][b]But this is about your death.[/b][/u] One of the main protagonists, you, are a terminally ill character dealing with the side effects of knowing you are dying and your physical being broken down. For those inclined to avoid dealing with thoughts of death, this is a basic and comfortable visual novel to imagine the decisions you may fall upon in the face of death and urge you to grow up from being afraid of thinking onwards to that deep, impending dark hole you're walking towards.\n\n[h1]The absence of interaction in-game, does not detract from the interactivity out of game [/h1]\n    Every time I come across a documentary feature or visual novel, I weigh the chances I will find it boring. It's the expected outcome of short films, documentaries, software and visual novels currently available on Steam due only due to the superficially stark contrast they display from the average fully interactive game. Time and time again, I am proved wrong to have ever fretted as sitting in front of a computer screen and clicking through a story is just as culture-driven within its own universe as any game can be and offers the reader a multitude of emotions from which most will benefit from as entertainment. The graphics may be uninspired, the art cute but barely existent, and the translations could have been better (fantastic for F2P) yet you can tell it\u2019s brilliant writing. With any type of reading, nothing beats a smashing story. That very story and the telling of it is what Narcissu excels at. I ended up interacting more deeply with other people who have played this game more than I have through other veritable games. [b]Narcissu is lightly philosophical and a fantastic excuse for a soul-searching expedition.[/b]\n\n[h1] TL;DR & Basic details[/h1]\n    [b]TL;DR[/b] - Narcissu 1st & 2nd both bring light to saying goodbye to your life prematurely, on an extremely personal level in the form of a visual novel that lacks visuality/aesthetics and is more towards a breezy but splendid read.\n\n    [b]Basic details[/b] - Depending on a person's reading proficiency, this will take you approximately 5-6 hours to read through 1, 2 and the epilogue once. There are two versions of translations available for the first instalment but only one for the second. I personally found the first translator smoother (especially as it has both 1 and 2, but I read the second translator's version as well) but try both for a few pages to find your own preference. There are also voiced (Japanese) and unvoiced versions. Narcissu 2 has much more voice acting than 1 which only has the bare minimum. Decide which heightens immersion for you. Just as it is with audio books, some will dislike the voice acting (well done and professional). Having studied Japanese for a while and understanding a portion of what is said made reading much swifter. Narcissu 1 is a favourite for many so if you'd just like to read one, that's what I'd recommend. I can only imagine how wonderful it would be to read the original Japanese text as the descriptive writing is first-rate.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n    Ultimately, our protagonists are fighting the fight just like the rest of us. Our instincts to live, and the restrictions we are faced with (death, illness, suffering and loss), ends in discovering choices within those boundaries and our insignificant existences with bound limbs, to instead jump towards the metaphysical freedom and something much more dazzling than any other sign of human existence.\n\n\n[i]Edited for typing error.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1430454513, "timestamp_updated": 1430454597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827414989471435547", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15632124": {"recommendationid": "15632124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090680079", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 63, "last_played": 1431043794}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is so sad but so incredibly beautiful.

The translations were proffesional and screams words that are used to their maximum potential. Agilis really used every word in the dictionary he can find to suit the scene. I like the way he used words like \"scrap\" rather than \"retro\". \n\nIf you possess a broad vocubulary, I suggest using Agilis' translation, as his employs some but not all of the scenes, deep words not know to the everyday joe. If you dont mind the technicality of the words and want just easy to understand scenes, then you go for gp3^2.\n\nBut when in doubt, go for Agilis. \n\nI also like the music they put into account in the vn. Really powerful music pieces makes the vn's more motionally deppressing. \n\nOne last thing, ALWAYS and ALWAYS play the voiced version. Just like above, dont make the mistake like what I did. I did N1 on unvoiced version. Didn't cry tho, just deppresed by the story. And I felt the urge to do N2 on voiced. And It was significantly better.\n\nEven if you dont understand what they say, the voice acting also compliments the disheartening story through varying tones of their voices. Voice acting is really good. Just play the voiced version, it will save you time. You will know this when you finished the game. ;)\n\n\n>>>>    TL;DR     <<<<\n=================================================================\n\nOverall, I really like the game.

Only after finishing the first part did i burst in outrage of how the ending is completely unfair and doesnt suit the game at all in any way.But...after finishing what is left of this visual novel, i came to the realization of how blinded i was by my own sense of justice. Yes the game may seem a bit brutal at times but that just comes to show the reality of our lives.It just isnt fair sometimes, but  during those dark periods of our lives even a small spark of light in the darkness can make you even show a....smile. That is exactly what happenned here. With Setsumi experiencing extreme loneliness during most of her life, feeling betrayed by her former friends who just became strangers later on, there was that one person that was able to show her some good parts of life even knowing herself that her life is coming to an end. Himeko.....she was the one who was able to shed the light inside her soul and become a close friend of hers. Despite Hiemko experiencing some of her own mental breakdowns in the past and thus becoming a former Catholic, she still wanted to help Setsumi out because she knew that she was going to live longer than her only because she was 15 years old. Fast forward 5-6 years later after Himekos death, Setsumi was left with an envelope which contained a hefty amount of money and a lot of maps entrusted to her by Himeko herself who wished for Setsumi to travel and experience the world, to \"live her life\" before it was too late. Even after travelling around and experiencing some parts of Japan with the other protagonist who was unfortunately diagnosed with a simillar type of disease, there was still missing inside of her that the male protagonist just couldnt understand. And finally after arriving to their final destination where they wanted to see the narcissu bloom on the island,which Setsumi learned about from Himeko during the prequel, there finally came the moment when Setsumi just couldnt handle it anymore and started crying after being asked by the male protagonist why she doesnt want to go anywhere anymore with him. By explaining to him that she cant handle hopes getting crushed and wishes not getting granted, that she just decided to give up from the very beginning and tell herself that it is all usseles, he couldnt say anything and stood silent. The day after their conversation he asked Setsumi if she wanted to maybe go around the beach for a bit and had the idea to hand over the bikini she had with her. That was the moment when Setsumi realized that she always wanted to wear thatt bikini but never got the chance to do it. After putting it on, the protagonist wanted to take her picture but....with a smile on her face. There it was when she realized that maybe some wishes can come true and that was one of them...to smile. After posing for a couple of shots and fooling around the beach for a bit she couldnt believe that for the first time she was having...fun. That was it. Later after saying her goodbyes to the male protagonist and being entrusted with his drivers license, she started walking towards to sea to end it all. But before she did that he stopped her to ask her if she wants to be stopped or pushed faster to the water. There it was when she herself wasnt sure bu then she started shedding tears and let out a genuine smile directly aimed at him. That smile itself was the answer to his question. And that is how her life came to an end. That type of ending just shows that Setsumi was confident with her choice because he showed her that some wishes even during those dark times can actualy come true which means that Himeko's prayed has been answered. For Setsumi to smile. Setsumi realized that and knew that her work is done and that she could rest in peace now knowing that her wish did come true in the end. It just comes to show that this one of those endings which tells us that having faith always is a high priority. To know that there is always even a spark of light at the end of the tunnel. From Nello's , Himeko's and Chihiro's prayer being answered, Setsumi finally realized that after all of her suffering , right before the very end of her life, she finally smiled and felt happy for a moment. That was all it took for her to say right before she walked into the sea that it was worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1430251972, "timestamp_updated": 1430864169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15598516": {"recommendationid": "15598516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094696907", "num_games_owned": 1794, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1430351314}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story.

I did consider the developer used a young teenager for the role, and had done an expert job of replicating their moderate language skills. Soon however she reveals her age to be 20 years.\n\nThere is very little to do in the game, other than advance the text and it's lucky the developer provided a save feature. The story is tedious and extremely boring and the images add very little depth.\n\nI'm not against visual novels because I thought Depression Quest was very well done and had some very interesting dialogues and user-participation.

There are two parts to the VN, Narcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd. They are complementary to each other and I highly recommend reading both in order. If you don't read it in order... well it will probably be confusing.\nIt's very short taking about 3 hours or so, depending on how fast you read and whether you want to listen to all the voice acting.\n\nVisuals:\nArt is very minimalistic, and the backgrounds only cover about 1/3 of the screen\nKinda disappointing, but being a free game I can hardly complain.\nWhile there aren't too many backgrounds and CG, the game is fairly short and takes place in only a few places.\nSo it completely makes sense. There are very very few character CGs and when do appear, it is just at the right time, and at the right moments to complement the story. Super minimialistic, yet effective in it's own way. \nSome say silence is an important part to music, and certainly applies here as well.\n\nSound:\nVoice acting is good. Nothing outstanding but each voice fits the character. There aren't too many characters in the first place, but the voice actresses do a good job. \nOn the Soundtrack, it is quite beautiful. All the tracks greatly add to the ambience; although a bit depressing to listen to alone. For such a short game, there are lots of different tracks. I've seen longer VN with only half the tracks that this game has. 12 songs for the first part, and 14 for the second for a grand total of 26. \nIt even incudes a few vocal tracks! \nOne complaint I have is the abrupt cuts in music during scene change, or at the end of a scene. I wish it had some sort of fade. The sudden stop to the music kinda kills the mood the game has. \n\nStory:\nThere are two parts to the story, Narcissus  and Narcissus Side 2nd\nThe first part is sort of like an introduction, but the 2nd is what completes the story as a whole.\nWhile it is possible to only play the first part, you owe it to yourself to complete the second. Trust me, you'll feel a lot less depressed :(\nThe second part definitely wraps up the story and leaves with a glimmer of hope.\nThe plot is definetly not the main focus here. It is more about the life of each character and their emotions. Struggling with death and hopelessness. Again, going with minimalistic art, I'd say the story is very minimalistic as well. A lot of things are unsaid, giving a lot of freedom of interpretation for the readers. I quite liked this style, and allowed for some thought provoking dialogue. \n\nBeautifully written, and thought provoking, it makes you wonder what I would do in that situation. Could I have the power or courage to be hopeful in despair? \n\nIf you enjoy Visual Novels, then go ahead and try it out!\nIt's free and there is nothing to lose~", "timestamp_created": 1429692689, "timestamp_updated": 1429693180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15441135": {"recommendationid": "15441135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127280019", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 206, "last_played": 1503636198}, "language": "english", "review": "Heart Breaking . must play if you love slice of life anime", "timestamp_created": 1429408240, "timestamp_updated": 1429408240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661121845245361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "15406571": {"recommendationid": "15406571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089942250", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1648724859}, "language": "english", "review": "It is the best AVG game I've ever played!

To start, the translation options are cryptic, so the best option for your language is unknown when you start the game.  I chose Insani because it was the only one I thought was legible as far as its logo goes.  It turned out to be an English translation, but the voice was still in the original language, which meant the voice meant nothing to me.  This is an overly glorified e-book, so I hate the empty, wasted space and the very tiny window.  It seems unnecessary to confine the user/player/reader to a game window when they could be reading the book more comfortably from a full-screen e-reader app.  Oh, yeah, you can't full-screen this 'game'!  Hell, it would be better if I could skip to a specific portion of the story since there's no save option or any kind of actual gameplay (no choices).\n\nFinally, the pictures are generic and have very little to do with the text.  You will see the same images more than once and not really understand why they're shown to you at all.  It's ridiculously lazy storytelling in my opinion.  I expected more relevant imagery from a visual novel.  In the past, I used to watch visual novels like this one which were amazing, but this one just isn't worth my time.

The plot of both revolve around characters that have been admitted to a hospital level called the \"7th Floor.\" This hospital floor is not your typical floor in a hospital (if that makes any sense). It's a \"hospice,\" a place where people who suffer from incurable diseases and will eventually die go to live out the rest of their days. Each story is different from the other, and play out different from each other. However, they are both connected and intertwine with one another. \n\nNarcissu Side 2nd is the prequel to Narcissu. Narcissu Side 2nd tells the story of the relationship between two girls and basically how they spend the summer together. However, they both suffer from the same or similar disease that has no cure and will eventually kill them. This story is about Setsumi (who is a main character in the original Narcissu) and Himeko (Setsumi's new, cheery \"deathrow\" friend). The story is told primarily from the perspective of Setsumi, but at times switches to Himeko as she explains events in her past. At different points in the story, we learn alittle about the two. We learn about Setsumi's family, Himeko's family, Himeko's past, etc. There's alot more I could mention, but I don't want to give away too much. Just know that, like the original, this is a beautiful, sad, and whimsical quote-on-quote \"game.\" This story also has the same beautiful and heart-felt music from Narcissu, as well as some new pieces which are just as good. Art style is also the same, although it seems there are more images in this version and they are of better quality. Dialogue is well written just like in the original. And as with Narcissu, I did almost cry towards the end of this story. More so on the verge of tears than Narcissu. The story, overall, I feel is BETTER than the original. There's a lot more depth and substance added to this story than the first Narcissu. However, this comes at the cost of greatly increasing the amount of chapters to read. While in the first Narcissu there were 7-8 chapters (including prologue), Narcissu Side 2nd has a whopping 20 chapters (including prologue)! So, a downside to this story is it's a lot longer than the original. Another potnetial downside to this story, which mostly pertains to how \"sensitive\" you are towards religion, is there's a fair amount of talk about God and Catholicism. I only bring this up because some people may hate the constant mention of God (i.e. if you are a nonworshiper of God or just hate talk of religion in general), and/or may hate how Catholics can be portrayed in this story (there are times in the story where a character tries to disown their Catholic past or ways; there are also times when characters describe Catholicism in a somewhat negative light). This aspect didn't bother me, but it is worth mentioning for others as a warning. Still, a great prequel to a great, original visual novel game.\n\nNarcissu is the orginal story, or at least the one that was released first. This story follows the journey of two 7th Floor patients to a special destination. What is this \"special place\" and why are they going there? Well, you'll have to read the story to find out. The two patients are an unamed male patient and Setsumi. The story is told mostly from the perspective of the male patient, but a few times Setsumi narrates some of her life's story. This story is essentially that of a road trip story, but still good none the less. The music in this game is well-composed. Each track is beautiful and compelling. The art style is good. Slightly low budget looking, but still good to look at. The dialogue is well-written, and provokes many philosophical questions from the reader. While I said in my analysis of Narcissu Side 2nd it had less substance, the story of Narcissu is still a great story. I literally almost cried at the end. The characters were portrayed well and were very interesting. Overall, a good story and a good starting point for many other good stories within this universe to come.\n\nAll in all, this series is great. Two beautiful, yet sad stories in one beautiful, yet sad universe. The only problems I have with both of the stories is there is some heavy repetition (which can be annoying at times) and reading both stories back-to-back makes for one long reading experience (at least for me it did). I'm very inexperienced when it comes to visual novel games, and didn't expect to spend around 15 hours just reading both of these stories! I thought this series of stories would've been significantly shorter, but boy was I wrong!lol Still, I reccomend you \"trudge\" through those long hours to uncover a beautiful, intertwining story. As far as which one you should play first depends on your personal preference. The author of both stories reccomends you read the prequel then the original. However, I reccomend you read the original then the prequel. In my opinion, reading the prequel after the first game is a better way to experience the story. The prequel, essentially, fills in all the holes and makes many references to the first game. Seeing how the author wove all these intricate details from the first game into the story and showing how they made their appearance in the original Narcissu is very interesting. This particular analysis can only be done by reading the original first. Not only that, but I feel coming from the prequel to the original may dissapoint a few people. Like I said, Narcissu lacks substance in comparison to Narcissu Side 2nd. So, people may be let down when the original has a lot less story depth than the prequel. It may just feel kinda empty to them. Narcissu was, essentially, the foundation of the Narcissu \"universe.\" So, it's understandable why that story felt alittle more bare bones. The prequel simply took all the good things from Narcissu and built upon them, making the story all the more better. But, still, the ultimate decision of in what order you read is left up to you. Me, I probably WOULD have read the prequel first then the original if I had known Side 2nd was a prequel. But I'm still ok with the order in which I read both. Anyhow, this is a visual novel game that I HIGHLY recommend. A lot of thought, love, and care was put into both of these games and it shows. And the best part of this game/games is...they're free! So, definitely check them out. You'll more than likely love them.:)\n\nP.S.

There are no carefully detailed character portraits or meticulously crafted scenes. There are no branching paths or any choosing of one's waifus. The minimal-ness is even outright stated by the creator (in the Notes) to be intentional, so as to encourage the reader to visualize for themselves the scenes as they play out. Don't go in expecting this to be something it isn't. \n\nThe presentation seeks to evoke the atmosphere of a movie and does so effectively with its use of its (somewhat small) soundtrack, transitions, and screen layout. I recommend just turning on auto-play and watch (or, more accurately, read) the events of the story unfold, just as you would a movie.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said that the main characters of these stories, Setsumi and Himeko for Narcissu 1st and 2nd respectfully, will die. There are no miracles or magic cures, no cheap ways out of their respective predicaments. It is with this in mind that the story really is at its most impactful; two people whose lives have been cut short, due to no fault of their own, and what they do with the precious few moments they have left. There is no angst here, no tantrums or curses or moping or complaining, as the two have long since come to terms with their soon-coming deaths. Instead the focus is on their actions and passing on what little they can to those they will soon be leaving behind. Narcissu 1st focuses more on the person who is dying, their experiences and choices as their death slowly approaches, while Narcissu 2nd focuses on the people around that person, those who will be invariably left behind. The two stories never felt like they were meant to be tear-jerky and never made any cheap stabs at my 'feels'-glands, all tears shed were well-earned by the writer (and translators!).\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the game itself works fine, if at times a bit wonky. I had a problem where holding down 'ctrl' caused the game to skip forward to the end of a chapter and leave me stuck at the chapter select. Also, I remember seeing a couple of typos here and there.\n\nIf you made it this far and like what you've read I cannot recommend this game any more highly, I liked it enough to the point of writing this long-ass review as soon as I completed it.

All of them residents of the 7th floor, the floor for one to await for their turn... to die.\n\nFirst, its probably better to explain what is Narcissu 2nd, while it's the second game, in reality it functions as a prequel to the first story. While both stories have different points of views, the person connceting them, and the main pillar, is Setsumi, a 22 year old girl (15 on the prequel).\n\nOn Narcissu 1st, the story is about a boy (Yuu Atou, although his name is never revealed on both games) who meets Setsumi, a girl who doesn't wants to die neither at home or on the 7th floor.\nNarcissu 2nd is about the encounter between Setsumi and Himeko, a woman on her twenties, cheerful and full of energy, who is currently residing on the 7th floor.\n\nWhile the autor says that in his opinion the playing order should start with the 2nd, I started with the 1st (hadn't noticed that before completing the first game), and with that, I can say that playing the 1st first, and then the 2nd, gives the feeling of \"so that's how it happened\", and it helps to see better some connections between both games. If one decides to start with the 2nd, in my opinion I think it will give a better connection with Setsumi and probably more emotional impact (although it still gives you one whatever game you decide to start first).\n\nIt's surprising that a free visual novel is so well built, the first game isn't fully voiced (and on an important note, both games HAVE NO CHOICE, which isn't very frequent in visual novels), the second one is fully (or 99%) voiced, and has better art.

You don't have to navigate, survive, move, do anything at all. Consider it a Visual Novel with no decisions points at all. Think of it as listening to a story. \n\nOne playtime of N1 is about 3-4 hours, and N2 approximately double of that. (Notwithstanding the time spent crying) Although the game allows you to save, I suggest taking a Saturday afternoon to finish your first playthrough in one sitting. I wouldn't finish N1 and N2 in a single day though, as both are very emotionally draining. \n\nThe music is powerful. It complements the game really well, and is a good setting for the mood. The theme musical piece of N2 is just beautiful, although very painful if you understand the meaning of the lyrics. This is especially more so when you consider Himiko's background. There are only about 10+ song tracks per game though, and each song track is not perticularly long, so you may observe that the music gets repetative after a few hours. The VN offers a choice of voiced and unvoiced version, in Japanese. I love the voice acting. The tone was well done, and you can feel the personality and emotions of the characters through their voices. It was actually painful for me to listen to it, as though someone who was really hurting was there, right in front of me. \n\nThe graphics isn't bad, but neither is it great. There's no animation throughout the entire game, it is just a series of largely nondescript scenery artwork. It probably would have been rather weird without the art, though. \n\nThere's nothing much I can say of the story without being too spoilerish, so really, just try it out for yourself. Narcissu is a very though provoking piece centering on the topic of death, mainly on the process of dying. I'll not touch on the points raised, leaving the story open to your own interpretation. The writing transported me into their world, made me internalized their emotions as though I was the one actually going through everything. This is a real tear-jerker, although I'm glad its not because it wants to be a tear-jerker. That is to say, the storyline is not written such that it becomes a sad story, rather, the message behind the story generally evokes sad feelings in people. \n\nI've came across people who complained that the story behind N1 was too linear. (I must admit, I was an idiot for missing the blatently smoking Chekov's gun at the beginning) This is not a detective mystery novel, and to put an unexpected twist ending would go against the point of the game. N2 is significantly longer than N1, but touches on more topics as well. It is the prologue of N1, giving more details of unexaplined things which happened in N1, and giving more depth to Setsumi. Even so, it is a distinctly seperate story from N1.\n\nAfter finishing N2, don't close the game just yet. Go back to the main page, as you've unlocked a short Epilogue/Acknowledgements. It is concluding section from the author, giving us what the ending after N1 would turn out to be. \n\nIt would be good to read the game notes too, especially the part about translator's disambiguation of the two translation versions and the choice of voiced or unvoiced versions on which to choose for your first time. For my first playthrough I used a voiced version of Agilis' translation and did it in the order N1 followed by N2. Although the author  suggested playing it in the chronological order (N2 before N1), I recommend going through N1 first. There were limited information about the main character Setsumi, and her backgrounds in N1; I felt this actually helped to focus the story onto the important points.

Plus, hey, it's free, so it's hard not to recommend.\n\n[h1]The nitty gritty[/h1]\nNarcissu is a kinetic novel released by the doujin circle Stage-Nana in Japan and published here on Steam by Sekai Project. The story rotates around young people from the 7th Floor (the hospice ward). That is, people whose death has been decided. Without saying much as to the plot, I feel like the novel eloquently covers some heavy subjects: What are the things one has to do before dying? Faced with an unavoidable demise, how might people react to take back independence lost and march vibrantly toward their final act? How does one smile at the end, and how do those left behind smile after?\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[i]For people who have experience with visual/kinetic novels, this section is probably unnecessary, but for the unintiated:[/i]\nA visual novel generally works like a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' book with graphics, music, and sometimes voices. The \"player\", usually in the guise of the protagonist, makes choices throughout the story that affect the plot. However, Narcissu 1st & 2nd are Kinetic Novels, so they have no choices and very little player interaction aside from a click or press of the enter key to advance the text (though autoplay is actually the default setting for Narcissu Side 2nd, and the author mentions in the notes that he himself sees it more like a movie). Personally, I'd describe it as a long minimalist cutscene with save, load, and backlog options. The game itself is much closer to a novel or a reading experience than a game, and this, no doubt will be what turns a lot of people off from Narcissu, if not the genre as a whole.\n\n[h1]Answering common questions[/h1]\n[b]Length?[/b]\nNarcissu was about a 3 to 4 hour read for me. Narcissu Side 2nd (the included prequel) was 5 to 6 hours. Understandably, it might be a lot of reading for some, but both games are neatly divided into chapters, and the save feature works like a bookmark that you can use at any time.\n\n[b]Order?[/b]\nNarcissu was released in 2005, and Narcissu Side 2nd was released in 2007, both are included in this release, and I read them in the release order. However, Narcissu Side 2nd is actually a prequel to the events of the original Narcissu, and in the notes for Narcissu Side 2nd, the author suggests reading them in chronological order.\n\n[b]Replay Value?[/b]\nThat probably depends on the player. The original Narcissu was kind of an experiment in minimalist storytelling for Stage-Nana, so it was released in both voiced and unvoiced versions, as the author wanted to see how the voices changed people's impression of the work, and subsequently Narcissu Side 2nd is presented similarly. An interesting mirror of that for this release is that two different translations are included: one made with the intent to localize the novel smoothly into English, and one made with the intent to replicate the phrasing of the original as faithfully as possible and paint a mental picture close to what the original author intended. Though I'm writing this review after just one reading, I can see how this approach would add replay value, and I intend to revisit Narcissu after it stews on me a bit.\n\n[b]Why is this free?[/b]\nNarcissu is a doujin (or fanmade/amatuer) work and was released for free in Japan. When Sekai-Project announced this Steam release, they said that in the spirit of the original release, Narcissu on Steam would be \"As free as Steam would let it be,\" so here we are. With that said, don't take the lack of a price as a reflection of quality, because, quite frankly, there's no rule stating that professionals can't do doujin works. The music and voices are especially standout in this release, and a few of the voice actresses have both anime and game roles to their credit.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1] [i](finally)[/i]\nWell, I put it at the top for a reason...\n\nThis is an excellent release that feels like a labor of love on the part of the author. To me, it stands as a great experiment in minimalist storytelling (especially in the original Narcissu, where I found myself endeared to the characters even with next to no background given about them). Though the novel (and the genre) may not be for everyone, if this feels like your kind of thing, and you have the time to give to reading a great story, I can't not recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1417376545, "timestamp_updated": 1418066278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862230539321899414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "13160195": {"recommendationid": "13160195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069172338", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 114, "last_played": 1412860420}, "language": "english", "review": "A short and impactful free visual novel that's definitely worth the hour or so of normal gameplay.

There are only two main characters, no supporting charactor and few minor characters. Setsumi, the female protagonist is quite quiet character while your character doesn't have a name or visible face. The game recommends you to play in unvoiced version as it has some lines modified but I played in voiced instead. Sometimes the game is kind of boring as a result of this\n\nNarcissu 2nd side explores the backstory of Setsumi and put answers in several questions you might pose during reading of the first game. 2nd also has unvoiced version but this time it doesn't make much changes. The presentation is more cheerish and production quality is a lot higher than the 1st yet the sad ambience is still persistent.\n\nNarcissu 1st & 2nd are not the games that will going to make you cry, and are designed that way to conveys the message behind this game more clearly. It will, however, make you feel sad, very sad for almost all of the running time.\n\nThe game together lasts for 8 hours for me using autoplay, which is kind of long in my standard but should be short for visual novels.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1416149547, "timestamp_updated": 1416149547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12963914": {"recommendationid": "12963914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160607197", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16, "last_played": 1421649012}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing visual novel, but I kinda wish it was a bit more interactive in the sense of choice of dialogue.

Perhaps more the opposite - like comparing a hand-made product to a mass produced one. The story holds up quite well and the background music is solid work that adds to the immersion. I would have liked a bit more depression to it for that extra impact. But that's just my personal love for depressing stories. The ending was quite satisfying. \n\nBy all means, give it a go when you are bored or feel like trying out some non-interactive visual novel. It's a free title.

When I first started reading it I was surprised by the complete lack of choices, since most other visual novels are a 'choose your own adventure' variant. This isn't necessarily bad, but I like to be in control of the main character, even if it's slight. This, naturally also leaves only one route to follow, and one possible ending. This makes replayability.... slim, as well as shorten the novels length. However, the story you do get is pretty interesting, and toys with your emotions pretty well, regardless of the fact that the first novel has no character development, and the protagonist just kind of does things. Setsumi, the protagonists 'friend', is dull and boring. She is overly intelligent with no explanations as to how she knows anything considering she's spent most of her time in the hospital. Side 2nd goes into some detail as to why she knows these things, and is in my opinion the better of the 2 novels. We learn more about Setsumi, and her past, as the story is told primarily from her point of view. Side 2nd was longer, and had a more satisfying end, and there was some character development with the main characters. The soundtrack is.... decent, it does the job, but there weren't any notable tracks that I particularly liked, and it didn't transition very well between scenes. It's nothing special. The voice acting was pretty good for the most part, particularly for setsumis character in the first novel. The same voice actor is in side 2nd as setsumi, but she sounded just as depressed as she is in the first novel, which doesn't make sense considering she still had some hope at this point in the timeline. The other female protagonist in side 2nd is great, she sounds very cheerful, and knew how to be fun, and serious when necessary. None of the other voice actors stood out, as they had few lines.

going to cry alot trust me. ^^\n\n This is actually a Free-To-Play,when i first think about it,I thought the author and developer are not going to give their best on this game but they actually did a perfect job writing the story and drawing it.They even did put some sound affects.\n\nOnce again I am very sorry writing a review (not recommend) for this game early,this is actually one of the best game.\n\n5/5 Recommended for People who want some tears shed.", "timestamp_created": 1413645092, "timestamp_updated": 1414252615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0,

I was expecting your standard tragic VN, but this one took quite a different approach.\n\nThe story is absolutely amazing, and yet immensly sad, reminding us to value our time, and that nothing lasts forever.\nYou basically step into the shoes of the \"Protagonist\", an unnamed young man who has been determined terminally ill, and is therefore sent to the 7th floor of the local Hospital, during his stay at the 7th floor he meets a girl and an unexpected friendship starts to take place.\n\nI'll give the story a 10/10, simply amazing.\n\nThe Art is pretty good, but the decision to almost never show the girl during the scenes was definetly the right one for this VN, same with never showing the \"Protagonist\".\n\nSo, art is a solid 8/10\n\nThe music is very touching and fits extremely well, seriously ramping up the feels.\n\nMusic is a 10/10\n\nAnd finally I'll leave this right here: If you want a feeltrip, I implore you to finish Narcissu, it's so strong a piece that I started crying.",

female character.\n\nStory 8/10\n\nThe story behind this game is about a girl named setsumi  has an illness they never put a name on  she lived normal her entier life still she was in middle school then she is hospitalized and her friend come to her every day at the hospital  and give her good wish cards , untill she keeps getting hospitalized that she becomes a fragment in everyones mind. Those people she called friends are now just strangers  to her she keeps doing the same  cycle over and over  < Hospital < Stay for Weeks < Clinic < Hospital > And it goes on and on. \n\nProtaginist (Nameless Male )\n\nThis Male you meet in the first chapter of the first game tells you that he has the same illness as the setsumi  and  is in the same cycle  as her and then he ends up on the 7th floor  with this girl setsumi  on his second  day there he sees her in the longue starring blankly  at the TV nothing interesting playing.\n\n\n\nSound Track 9/10\n\nThe sound track for this VN is just beautiful and has lots of  sad piano notes that add to the emotional break down to the characters that they have later in the story , like the first sound track you hear is  quite sadistic sounds but also kind of soothing to your ears cause of the fluid sound going with the piano it adds lots of emotion to the game as the characters are pretty dull cause of they're sad looking and bery depressed looking and sounds ( If you do voice over ) and then when they leave they kinda brighten not that much but it makes the story a littleless sad until , you get farther in the story and do the second game but the sound track gets better and worse has it's ups and downs everywhere.\n\n\nMy Verdict\n\nMy verdict in total  is a  9.1 as the sound track and story went together   so well in my opinion the characters  never had many dull points just a  few drops here or there that didn't make much  of a difference to me , the story/plot was amazing to my taste of story as i  have an attraction to sad and depression stories and situations , as well as games of sadness and All those kind of things. I recommend playing this VN it opens a lot of ideas up to simple minded people aswell as some amazing ideas for sad stories of death or relationships or something of that matter.\n\n\n9/11 is my ACTUAL final verdict Hue Hue Hue", "timestamp_created": 1413567523, "timestamp_updated": 1413567523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497277230024337769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12507031": {"recommendationid": "12507031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034906178", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1405636965}, "language": "english", "review": "Reall good story, and music.

Truly amazing with it's beautiful story and emotional plot.\n\nIt is one of the best works stage-nana had to offer so far in my opinion. The Ending will leave you in mixed emotions, sad, happy, relief and etc. You bet your ass you will have connections with the characters, the characters were pretty good and the main character was believable but there are barely any characters in this novel since it's focused between 2 characters so don't think this is a harem where you will bang every single girl nope instead you will have romance with this emotionless girl, not really love but you will see their mutual likings and views towards life and the situation they are in. I Highly reccommend this to anyone who loves beautiful things although this game was lacking in eye candy since only few pictures were given here to aid your visual needs so you'll have to use your imagination most of the time AND you can never miss out the soundtrack! The Soundtrack really fits the atmosphere and gives you an intense feeling! Kudos to the people in charge of the soundtrack, truly Amazing.\n\nNow for the 2nd installment for this game, Man.... *Sniff* In my opinion this was the most powerful, it was the prequel for the whole story focused on Setsumi Sakura and Himeko Shinohara, it was truly amazing and beautiful and really really Unforgettable. Himeko Shinohara is a very likeable character that becomes ill after a bit and the climax to this was really memorable left me thinking for days. You should witness and experience it for yourself because there are literally no words for me to describe it.\n\nOverall this was a good Visual novel, I repeat \"Visual Novel\" There is no gaming in this only interaction in browsing the different sections of the scripts most of the strength is given in the story.\n\n9 / 10 Story\n6 / 10 Art\n9 / 10 Soundtrack\n\nRECCOMENDED SO HARD THAT YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME, IT'S FREE SO GOOOOOOO It's worth your time :D", "timestamp_created": 1412701303, "timestamp_updated": 1412701303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654740035533905029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12400898": {"recommendationid": "12400898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094196196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 410, "last_played": 1428867941}, "language": "english", "review": "the feels ! the feels ! .. release anime plox", "timestamp_created": 1412697976, "timestamp_updated": 1412697976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489962995052337646", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12397730": {"recommendationid": "12397730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049141281", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 540, "last_played": 1553197176}, "language": "english", "review": "This has gotten me in so many levels of Feels.\nI'm already done reading this precious Visual Novel..\n\nFeel Percentage: 101%\nThis visual novel is really well made, \n\nIt's also Heart Warming & Sad..\nJust get it & Understand the story..\n\n\nThanks for bringing Tears for once in my life.\nPlease make more of these,  I want to feel the feeling of joy & sadness.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm going back into this visual novel again very soon, \ni will re-read everything, and i'm definitely supporting Sekai Project, on their second visual novel.\n\nStay tuned for a fresh visual novel reading video, i really hope theres enough support with this as i love this novel to death, going back to reading this will bring me in tears again.. i can't wait.", "timestamp_created": 1412674757, "timestamp_updated": 1442990818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482573747634887695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12394597": {"recommendationid": "12394597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023592390", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7, "last_played": 1412641849}, "language": "english", "review": "From reading most of the other comments, I must be emotionally retarded.  \n\nThis isn't a game.

Art is very minimal, but used to excellent effect, with Japanese voice acting also included during key parts of the story.\n\nIt should be noted that there is absolutely [b]no interaction[/b] beyond clicking to navigate menus and proceed forwards and backwards through the text. The story is completely linear. You simply read through from start to finish, with no choices to be made to affect the final outcome.\n\nWhat was most notable to me about Narcissu 1st & 2nd was the depth of thought and feeling that went into its storytelling. It made me want all the best for the characters in the story. It made me, on more than one occasion, hope that a certain character would succeed in doing something illegal, if only so that they could help someone else or that some suffering could be alleviated, even if the result of their success would only be temporary. It truly made me feel for the plight of the characters, and I'm not ashamed to say that I cried on numerous occasions throughout both sides 1 and 2 of Narcissu.\n\nThe music in this title is mostly instrumental, with the piano making a common appearance in most tracks. There is the general feeling of hopelessness and sadness, but not in a downcast, depressive way (this may have been influenced by my reading of the story). It's more a feeling of acceptance, whether you like it or not, and just trying your best to smile and say goodbye.\n\nThis version of Narcissu comes with two English translations by different people, as well as the original Japanese text. Although there is an option to read through the story with or without the voice acting (which only comes in Japanese), there is no option to turn the music off (though I see this as a good thing, since the music adds so much to the atmosphere and feeling of the narrative and dialogue). It is apparent that much effort has been placed into preserving the accuracy of the original Japanese text. Included are also many notes left behind by people who worked on Narcissu, including Tomo Kataoka who is the writer.\n\nThe story also raises a lot of questions and gives the reader many things to think about, though I'll leave prospective readers/players to discover these for themselves.\n\n[u]Read this visual novel if:[/u]\n- You like deep, thoughtful narrative with a melancholy setting.\n- You have an interest in philosophy.\n- You have a soft spot for 'tear-jerkers', or want a story that will [b]really make you feel something[/b].\n\n[u]Don't read this visual novel if:[/u]\n- You have an aversion to sad things and stories.\n- You are uncomfortable with the idea or theme of death.\n- You want a visual novel with multiple endings and choices that you can make.\n\n---\n\nIt's rare to find a title of this high quality. From what I could see, spelling and grammar errors in the English text were few and far between. The music, art, and writing all meld together so perfectly that I can hardly find anything to complain about. The only possible complaint I might have is that there is no end-game gallery to view all the art upon total completion of both sides 1 and 2.\n\nOtherwise, I more than recommend [i]Narcissu 1st & 2nd[/i] to anyone who has an interest in visual novels, or a sad, yet beautifully told story. Personally, I would rate it among one of the best visual novels I've ever read, and can easily give it a 10/10. Stage-Nana and Tomo Kataoka have produced an utterly unforgettable title and have even given it to us all for free.\n\nGo and download it now. Just make sure you have a box of tissues handy.

disfrutarla no esta al alcance de cualquiera, quiz\u00e1s mas adelante se haga un parche para traducirla pero hasta entonces depende de los lectores aficionados al manga y anime, sin embargo he de decir que es un cambio agradable que contradice la elevada cantidad de clich\u00e9s de que los videojuegos solo deben ser violentos o competitivos.\nA mi parecer este juego es interesante, los personajes son complejos y te atraen de manera que es f\u00e1cil sumergirse en una historia profunda llena de sentimentalismos, la banda sonora es la adecuada en cada momento, solo con o\u00edrla ya puedes so\u00f1ar y desear no dar click para poder o\u00edrla mas tiempo.

I was extremely moved by the story in the base game, and cannot recommend it more, especially considering it's free.

However this game shows me another spirit, I feel very sad when I knew the girl's death but after that I still thinking. The girl isn't happy when she alive and the only thing she want in this hopeless world is just a scene of flowers.When she really came to there, I think she has already gain the value of her life though it is a very short and painful life. At last she committed suicide but I think she must do this with a bright smile. So this is a wonderful meaning game. If you like a story with the meaning of life, if you are a painful and hopeless patient like the girl, or if you want to commit suicide, I strongly recommend you to play this game. This game will help you find the meaning of your life and help you to gain your own value of your life.

ES UNA NOVELA VISUAL, Y SI NO TE GUSTAN LAS NOVELAS VISUALES, NO S\u00c9 QUE HACES AQU\u00cd.\n\nAhora que hemos dejado claro esto pasemos a la review.\n\nNo solo cuenta con la primera parte de la historia, llamada Narcissu, sino que tambi\u00e9n cuenta con su segunda edici\u00f3n, (casualmente es una precuela de lo que sucedi\u00f3 en la primera historia.)\nYa he terminado la primera parte y ahora estoy terminando la segunda. Y la verdad es que tengo que decir algunas cosas al respecto.\n\n\n1- Narcissu 1, hasta el momento me ha parecido mucho m\u00e1s dram\u00e1tico, interesante y con una historia m\u00e1s profunda. (Si bien yo jugu\u00e9 la versi\u00f3n mal traducida al espa\u00f1ol que hizo la experiencia de juego mucho peor, la versi\u00f3n en ingl\u00e9s si que es pasable.)\n2- No esper\u00e9is un eroge ni nada por el estilo. Es ambas historias se narra la vida de j\u00f3venes enfermos, que pasan su tiempo en la s\u00e9ptima planta de un hospital, esperando a que en alg\u00fan momento les llegue la hora, pero a ninguno de ellos les interesa morir en un lugar tan t\u00e9trico o en su propia casa, (la historia parte desde este punto, obviamente.)\n3- La narraci\u00f3n es correcta en todo momento y en muy pocas ocasiones se hace cargada.\n4- Una banda sonora tan simple como magistral. Perfecta en cada momento y que por mucho que se lleguen a repetir algunos soundtrakcs nunca me cansar\u00e9 de o\u00edr.\nConclusi\u00f3n:\n\nA los pocos que est\u00e1n dispuestos a jugar en ingl\u00e9s a una novela visual sin interacci\u00f3n. (Gente que hable espa\u00f1ol debe haber muy poca interesada); pues le dir\u00eda que jugara solo la primera parte. Ya que es la m\u00e1s interesante, dram\u00e1tica y buena de las dos. Si se le da una oportunidad seguro que no decepciona.\n\nSi quer\u00e9is que califique esto como un juego, obviamente le pondr\u00eda un 0, pero como no lo es, no puedo hacerlo.\n\nComo novela visual, tal y como es, le pondr\u00eda un 8.5/10\n(Ojo, a la primera parte, a la segunda un 6.5/10, ya que el argumento decae de manera notable.)\n\nEn fin, he intentado ser lo m\u00e1s objetivo posible sin tener en cuenta de que se trata de mi novela visual favorita.\n\nNota:\n\nNo he visto ni un s\u00f3lo an\u00e1lisis negativo que muestre verdaderas razones del porqu\u00e9 es mala esta novela visual.

Some might say this lack of any gameplay mechanics is a bad thing, but in my opinion it allows you to stay focused, if not immerged, in the story.\n\nThe only things I might complain about would be the few mistakes in the text, the sometimes confusing syntax (though I understand the goal of the translators, as described in the translators' notes), and the rather small pictures and text-box.\n\nAll in all, Narcissu and Narcissu Side 2nd are really worth the time reading in my opinion, even more so considering they are free.

It's the only way it could ever happen. But this isn't enough. What I always wanted to say is, Setsumi wouldn't have it another way. She would travel with someone to a place where there are Narcissus and she would kill herself, drowning in the sea.\n\nBut this isn't (only) because she wanted so. She knew every escape route, she had saved money, she specifically stated she didn't want to die neither at home nor at the hospital. What's the protagonist's role, then, since he's but a witness in all this process?\n\nThis is what I couldn't decipher. True, Setsumi can't drive, but as aforementioned, she could very well take the train. She knew where she wanted to go, she knew how she wanted to die. Yet, the story was written in such a way that you just had to be there.\n\nBoth you and the protagonist know or at least have a clue that she's coaxing you into taking her to her desired place with all her \"not particularly...\" catch phrase instances. There's a dissonance here too, between you and the protagonist. You are presented to her circumstances before you are presented to his. Both had possessions, albeit not particularly important ones, stripped away from them - he had the license, she had (or was going to have) the swimsuit. So when she says she doesn't particularly want a swimsuit, you know exactly what it means to her. It's a moment of joy, to see her playing in the water. A moment of closure.\n\n...But closure of what, really?\n\nSee, we never get to know which condition Setsumi really bears. Her symptoms were specifically described as not to give away what she suffers from so that we have no idea when she is going to die. She's in a stasis. There's no story happening, but there is her desire for a story, for this specific story to happen. To sum it up, her existence is floating, adrift. Waiting for a current to take her to the fate she wants to fulfill, but can't. Or, rather, it's that she isn't capable of swimming.

Told in 2 parts, Narcissu 1st and Narcissu 2nd (which actually narrates the events that occurred before Narcissu 1st) both bring out the feels in you.  You will not only come to feel that you are just someone who is filled with anguis, pain, and hopelessness after being diagnosed with life-ending disease but worse than that is experiencing the loss of the love and acknowledgement of your very existence as a homo-sapien by the people who are very close to you or those that share a special bond with you.  \n\nYou may choose from many translations and having the characters be either voiced or unvoiced which is very nice.  The art style is very minimalistic but is quite effective in portraying the setting and conveying the concurrent mood to the reader.  The audio tracks are also excellent and noticeably alters the ambient setting in a dynamic fashion to which later events may be foreshadowed when combined with powerful imagery.  Both novels are broken up into chapters which also make it very easy to locate and resume from the last checkpoint; and not mentioning a save function that allows continuation from any point in a chapter.  The cream of the crop in terms of enriching user experience, in this review at least, is having the ability to auto-advance text with no manual mouse-clicking necessary.\n\nAll-in-all you can be sure to possibly shed a few tears along the way--so prepare some cleanex before you dive in. Even if you arent easily perturbed, emotionally-wise, you can still be surprised by how the novel project its powerful elements upon you to a resounding degree which easily invoke feelings of sentiment for the character.  it is, in essence, very touching text-wrapped journey that recounts the tale of a girl who is passionate about cars and her tireless endeavours in seeking true freedom and the gift of life.", "timestamp_created": 1403334145, "timestamp_updated": 1403365420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569134354591369629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10596250": {"recommendationid": "10596250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102368140", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 701, "last_played": 1403626155}, "language": "english", "review": "READ IT!!\n\nyou must be greateful for life that you have", "timestamp_created": 1403325305, "timestamp_updated": 1403325305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10590554": {"recommendationid": "10590554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065869922", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1405228773}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Right in the feels.

She is given a very fancy room on a new floor sh hasnt been on before; she gets the room to herself (as opposed to regular rooms in Japanese hospitals which have 5-8 people in them), it has a nice lounge, big open ceilings... th windows dont open... the nurses don't walk through... oh my lord. They are leaving her to die :'(... and thats where I will stop telling you.\n\nSo far, and I havent gotten all the way through the story, its an 11/10. Absolute masterpeice of story telling.

The story has more meaning behind it than just tear-jerking/FEELS, and the minimalistic art makes you feel like your a bystander listening in instead of looking at talking heads for hours. After playing both Narcissu 1 and 2, I feel that 1 has a better story and has a stronger experience behind it, but 2 is better produced and has a sadder story. Narcissu 2nd definitely makes you feel for Setsumi more in part 1, and gives you some insight into how she feels.\n\n      I think I should mention that the author states in the notes he would like people to play 2nd before 1st because it's the chronological order. I personally played 1st before 2nd as I played 1st when it was first translated by insani a few years ago. But it definitely would probably be a more powerful experience if you played 2nd before 1st, knowing what happens kind of gave me a weird feeling, it's hard to explain, but I think it would make the 1st game an even greater experience if you had the build up of 2nd still in your mind.", "timestamp_created": 1401196391, "timestamp_updated": 1479926668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533428430557250977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "10249730": {"recommendationid": "10249730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071742795", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 220, "last_played": 1405929933}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and unique story accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack.

What I like about this visual novel is it's story is feels almost in touch with reality and not something that is far-fetched. One might think otherwise but it has a natural feel about it. The OST used was also rather smooth and it did great enhancing the mood and atmosphere of the story as it progress. I don't know how well the translations were but Tomo Kataoka did a good job. I hope the translators who translate this don't pull down the quality. It's simply a masterpiece, something not many visual novels could achieve. I for one, recommend this visual novel for visual novel readers. Unless you dislike nakige and utsuge, this visual novel should be a very good read. It isn't very long either so it should be picked up even if one doesn't have loads of spare time as this visual novel is considerably shorter than other visual novels.\n\nI don't want to post any spoilers so I shan't say much about how the story is but I truly recommend this visual novel.

Once you finish once, that's all you need to do.

I'm surprised they didn't charge a dime for this on Steam.\n\nThe only purchasable DLC here is OSTs. While I don't own the DLC myself, it's been said that the quality of the OSTs are FLAC, pretty much what we expect nowadays (who likes lossy MP3s now?). Even so, I can vet for the quality of the OSTs in-game, it's very memorable and deep, perfectly blend into the story and I can fully recommend this set for your listening pleasure.\n\nAll in all, it's a free stuff with great presentation and story that you can finish in one sitting (at least for each part).

I then sat down and beat the 1st 'side'; and decided to write my review (also apologies if it is vague, I wanted to avoid spoilers, and this is my first in depth review I wrote). \n\nThis visual novel is quite amazing in my opinion; it really brought emotion out of me, something most movies, games, and books cannot do (although there have been one or two games and books, and a handful of movies).\n\nThere aren't too many images used, but what images are used are amazing looking, and are very beautiful. The dialog is very descriptive, and it is translated amazingly. \n\nThe music score/soundtrack to this game is just as amazing as the rest of this visual novel; it fits in perfectly, and both sets and amplifies the mood, making the scenes much more powerful. (The soundtrack is available for purchase, and i recomend picking it up if you have the money)\n\nThe impact this game left on me is strong, I even cried at the end [I know; I\u2019m a dork ha-ha] because of its depressing... but strangely satisfying and even somewhat happy ending (I know this seems like a contradicting statement; but it will make sense when you beat it).  \n\nI whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoys visual novels, great stories, or emotionally charged entertainment; best of all is that this amazing experience is free.

I'm as close to an expert as one can be on this subject and still be living.  I survived a nearly fatal heart issue at age 18 and had two open heart surgeries.  I also volunteered in the child life department (duties very similar to the \"helper\" in this story -- basically being a supportive friend) for several years at a children's hospital on the acute care floor, the hem/onc floor and the NICU.\n\nThat said, I was really intrigued by this and hoping to find something that spoke to the experiences I have shared with children who I have worked with who are terminally ill and the friends I have made in support groups who have struggled with giant chest scars in their teens, coping with confronting death while your college friends are out partying, learning to change your IV bags while your bff is talking about her favorite clothes, and generally losing your supposed best years of your life.\n\nI was ideally hoping for something I could pass on to my friends who have dealt with these same issues or my family who truly cannot fathom what that kind of life experience does to an 18-23 year old.  Unfortunately, I can't say that this really deals with many of the issues we face.  I believe that there are some really important points it manages to pick up on briefly that healthy individuals may not have ever considered: the families that abandon children in hospitals because it's too much to bear, the isolation of the young in a landscape of the dying elderly, the alienation one feels from her own body -- particularly because of scarring or the presentation of what is considered acceptable by the fashion industry.  \n\nHowever, I did think this could have used some editing and likely some research into specific illnesses as well.  Portraying nebulous illnesses, sternotomy scars and \"medications\" didn't really impact me when that kind of stuff becomes your daily bag in reality.  I also thought some of the character switches were clumsy at times, though the pay-offs at times when things came full circle was cute.  All in all, though, I was left feeling like this did not ring true to the experiences I knew of we young folk trapped in hospitals -- though it was a valiant attempt and some people might enjoy it.  I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or families to learn more about our experiences, and I wouldn't recommend it to my peers as an introspective dip into our pasts.\n\nI think my largest problem was the complete absence of the illness, its accoutrements and its physical impacts from these characters despite their being apparently near death.  I get that this isn't a documentary, but truly, being half machine, rooted semi-permanently to various tubes, plugs and massive IVs, and being sliced and diced is such a huge part of what one has to process and your identity while your best friends are just like, \"Man.  Essays suck.\"  The fact that the characters only deal with half of dying is a hard thing for me to let go of, especially when the characters just generally seem to be withering away from a general 19th c malaise.\n\nBarely recommended as a fair attempt to portray a complex subject on which the authors did not have a clear grasp.

Iv'e only just read the first one and I can say as a visual novel fan I fell in love with this story. Griping, paced well and told with some good voice acting the musical scores really helped set the tone for this story. From the start it captivates you, bringing you along for the feels train. If I had to rate this out of a 10 I'd give it a 8; however, I think it may have been better as just a novel albeit myself enjoying the voice of Setsuna and the wonderful music. For a visual novel it lacked the art  expected of it and at times left me wanting more, as an example where you'd expect a stunning image of Setsuna giving her \"bashful sour expression\" you often weren't rewarded it. Yet, this does not take away from the beauty of this VN, nor should it deter you. If you are a fan of this type of genre, enjoy reading or simply want to play something to pass time its well it. With a fantasitcly saddening story, moving musical selection and spot on voice acting Its a gem in the visual novel bin.\n\n(PLACE HOLDER FOR PART 2)", "timestamp_created": 1398587569, "timestamp_updated": 1398587694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514884352684020996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9949055": {"recommendationid": "9949055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131746095", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 525, "last_played": 1398657301}, "language": "english", "review": "its great to see or read and understands it and ill wait for more", "timestamp_created": 1398586374, "timestamp_updated": 1398586374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49936637282371521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9948626": {"recommendationid": "9948626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105976848", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1411214127}, "language": "english", "review": "best of best visual novel for all starter, and seem to be awesome for who is looking for a very emotion moment\na sad story, but all the time you enjoy it is beautiful time ^~^", "timestamp_created": 1398582681, "timestamp_updated": 1398582681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49936637282371521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9948484": {"recommendationid": "9948484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044091995", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1398581263}, "language": "english", "review": "so far its about death and how cold people are so its ok so far for me", "timestamp_created": 1398581398, "timestamp_updated": 1398581422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49936637282371521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9948446": {"recommendationid": "9948446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049510164", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1398596826}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest Visual Novels ever created has finally made it's way on to Steam.\n\nIt's sweet.

This VN tells the story about the residence of [i]7th floor[/i] Setsumi Sakura and her experience during the last moment of her life.\n\nThis game includes both the Narcissu 1st & Narcissu 2nd. 2nd being the prequel and 1st is the main story of Setsumi. \nThe 2nd tells the story of Himeko Sunohara as her life take a 180 degree turn when she was diagnosed with a diseased that can't be cured, thus she's moved to the 7th floor. Himeko used to work as helper in 7th floor so she kinda used to the situation, but then it all changes when she met Setsumi.\n\nNarcissu 1st set appx. 6-7 years after 2nd. The story is focused on the anonymous Protagonist (just think of him as us) who is terminally ill & Setsumi as both of them realizes their feeling of not wanting to die in the hospital or at home with their respective families. The two of them begin a long journey accross Japan until they find that place...\n[b] NARCISSU [/b]\n\nI have completed the game 2 years ago and when I found this game on Steam Greenlight, I immediately vote it up as I think this [u] COULD BE[/u] first step of introducing the Visual Novel medium to the West. Currently the game is in Early Access but don't let that bother you because the story itself is completed & translated. I'm also part of the Closed Beta tester and I could say that Sekai Project did a good job of making the game engine compatible with Steamwork.\n\nDefinitely a must have if you are an avid VN player or you are interested in this medium, even after 2 years of finishing this, I still get [i] dem feels [/i] moment :') a Masterpiece indeed!", "timestamp_created": 1398453028, "timestamp_updated": 1398455725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 515, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920328438282012939", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9931781": {"recommendationid": "9931781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025427955", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 14, "last_played": 1398453320}, "language": "english", "review": "Narcissu is a short, heart-wrenching, and unforgettable experience unlike almost any other. \n\nPlay it now.", "timestamp_created": 1398452629, "timestamp_updated": 1398453619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 131, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643763482570648193", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1874, "total_negative": 117, "total_reviews": 1991}, "cursors": {"AoJ44LWRzcUCdcDxJQ==": "Thu Nov 23 15:06:02 2023"}}
