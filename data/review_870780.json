If you didn't know that, it's fine, I won't judge you to your face or anything. Control is a game by Remedy. Remedy have a pretty good reputation. They've made Max payne 1 and 2, which are easily in my top twenty games of all time. MAx Payne would be along the first ten and max payne two would be in the teens. One game that wouldn't show up on that list though is Quantum Break, which just lacked all of that Remedy Magic in favor of big actors and ''inter media ambitions''. Which really meant there were multiple 30 minute long, live action cutscenes that often had literally nothing to do with the main plot.\n\nControl, on the other hand remembers to be weird, to have fun with its cast and visuals in a way that only remedy could pull off. Yet, I can't help not to be set ablaze by Control. Something about its level desing, something about the combat, something about the plot just bores me. I'm sad to say that Control might have the weakest story in a Remedy game. It doesn't have the brilliant, mysterious, perfectly structured tale of Alan Wake 1 and 2. Even Quantum Break had more going on.\n\nBut, I haven't even explained the who or what of everything, so let's back up. You play as Jesse? I don't remember her name, I think it's Jesse... Jesse is a lady with a secret imaginary friend who stumbles into the federal bureau of control. A place where everything paranormal is kept and where the building itself is a paranormal entity. So you go in and quickly you'll find the place deserted, except for Ahti the Janitor and the director who spends most of his waking moments filling paperwork and shooting himself in the brain.\n\nBut then you pick up his gun, everything goes white and you're taken into the tutorial-verse where tutorials happen. From these tutorials, you'll learn to fly, trow rocks, shield yourself like a pussy and dodge. You know I keep starting these reviews, I have like five scripts that I've begun, and none of this shit goes anywhere. I just want to play control, but instead I'm forcing myself into writing this crap.\n\nI convince myself that I have stuff to say about a game, just because I happen to have strange feelings for it. But, when it comes time to communicate those feelings I can't bring myself to swear enough to get my message accross. I find control to be a bit underwhelming story wise. It definitely has more interesting lore than it does a main plot. For example, I'm replaying the game right now and, let me describe what's going on in the story. Jesse has to reactivate the big generator to get the elevator running... That's it. That's the plot of an entire level of Control.\n\nCompare that with Alan Wake or even Quantum Break where the ongoing plot is always mostly interesting and intricate. Control just has a lot of nothing going on and hopes to fill the void with memos and funny recordings of stuff. In other Remedy games, the side stuff like the tv shows and various bits of lore building would be the cherry on top. But control is just a whole pile of cherries. Where's the ice cream remedy? I WANT MY ICE CREAM REMEDY! What I mean is that, story wise, there's little in therms of an ongoing mystery or constant drama.\n\nEvery twist and turn is far more digestible. There's no real ha-ah moments narratively, in Control. Which, I guess is fine, not every story by remedy has to be structured like Alan Wake. Sometimes sitting back, enjoying a bit of good lore and shooting weird abominations in the face is all you need. Which would normally segwey into how much I love the combat, but for some reason, I don't.\n\nI find its monsters unappealing and its movement to lack weight or flow. I'm also not a fan of the mist effect when you kill an enemy. It has a tendency to obstruct your view and, while impressive, it ends up being more of an annoyance. aNOTHER WOULD BE COOL THING IS THE FACT THAT... Sorry I had caps lock on. Is the fact that the game gets rid of reloading... Sort of. You can't just fire to your heart's contempt, like the doom slayer. Instead, much like the original mass effect. Reloading works on a cooldown system.\n\nYou can fire your whole clip right away and suffer a long reload. Or you can wait a second or so and the bullet bar will refill on it's own. This halfway measure to reloading just isn't as satisfying as pressing a button. There's a reason why Mass Effect violently retconned the idea after one game.\n\nAnother thing I don't like is the lack of variety. None of the enemies stand out as introducing a clever twist on gameplay. The fanciest thing I saw was a black hole that healed the surrounding ennemies. And the environments, as beautiful as they may be, in their brutalist desing and their nearly perfect ray traced lighting. Running at a rock solid 60fps on a PC that struggled to maintain 20 fps in Alan Wake 2. In some way's it's impressive. But, it's all set in the same building and, as such, doesn't offer much variety. There's mines and more industrial environments. But all the desks and cubicles just blend togheter after a while.\n\nNot to say that you'll get lost. Level desing does manage to make every room look unique enough to give a proper sense of distinction going from around one corner to the next. Since I'm not sure that sentence made sense; What I mean is the opposite of what I previously said. The game is varied enough in its level desing to, at the very least, get a sense of where you are and where you need to go. So the basics are there. But, on a greater sense, it does all visually blends togheter a lot.\nHonestly, I don't know why I'm so harsh on Control. By comparison to other games like... You know, I tried coming up with a game analogous to Control that isn't made by remedy, and I can't. It's really unique. It's closest parallels would be super hero games. But, even then those don't tend to be shooters. I guess the closest comparison would be Doom. Against which the combat in almost every game doesn't stand a chance. One thing I can say is that I enjoy it a lot more than most games. So, in short, the combat is great. It's really fun and unique, the visuals are mindblowind and all that jazz.\n\nI guess my problem is I expected more out of remedy. Which is insane because control is such a huge package. It has fat loads of content sprayed over everything. The facial animations are great, and the writing is on point. It's just that the structure of the story is lacking and the environments aren't that interesting. I can see why people would like Control. The game is quite the spectacle after-all.\n\nBut, when you're in it for the story and the main plot is a whole lot of nothing. Control can get pretty tiresome.\nI feel like I'm starting to repeat myself a lot. So I'll cut this review short. If you like video games, you'll really like control. If you like remedy, you'll like control and if you're me, you'll also like control. Loving Control is less likely. I can't bring myself to love this game. \n\nPreviously, I gave Alan Wake 2 an 8 out of 10 for technical issues and for it running the way it did. But, after replaying it the other day, it seems a lot of those issues might have been adressed. Because I struggled to get a framerate bellow 60. Whereas, before, the same encounters would barely reach above 40 fps, and that's with frame generation. So, if issues on the game are gonna be fixed that quickly, I feel like I have to update my score to a 9.\n\nControl though, I'm not sure. My gut tells me it's an 8 out of 10 experience. But my gut doesn't have neurons. So I shouldn't listen to it. Let's put it on a scale. Let's do some math. For starters, I'd put control bellow Max Payne 2, which I would give an honest 87 out of 100. But, then I'd put it above Quantum Break, which I would give an 81%.

After playing it for a short while I can say that this game is fantastic. Control has a stylized form to it's narrative telling it through a mix David Lynch-esque atmosphere, and a blend of multimedia content. The story is about a lady named Jessie who is in search of her brother and finds herself inside of a secret governmental research facility known as the FCB (It's basically the SCP foundation, I mean it literally is, there's weird anomalous objects and shit with procedures on how to contain them, pretty cool stuff.). The gameplay is an RPG blended together with 3rd person shooting, well, shooting and some badass telekinesis powers, but I won't say anymore on that front. There is a good deal of mystery to the items that give you powers, and the story of the facility itself. The facility is fun to explore and pretty eerie at times. \n\nMy one main gripe, and it's kind of a big one. my 1 main gripe... They have a graphical texture problem I really suggest looking into before purchasing it. Everything looks low poly. I am talking straight up PS1 graphics... THERE ARE PUZZLES I CAN'T EVEN SEE BECAUSE THE GAME IS RENDERING THE PUZZLES AT ONE 120 X 344 POTATOES! For whatever reason, the developers had the game render so there is only like 1gb of information on your screen at any given time, so Jessie ends up looking like a roblox character... DEVS, FIX THIS GAME! \n\nTLDR: Great game with an interesting story and fast paced telekinetic 3rd person shooting, but a major graphical glitch holds it back for me from giving it a recommendation to other people.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1700610461, "timestamp_updated": 1700610461, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150739778": {"recommendationid": "150739778", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972139156", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 695, "playtime_at_review": 1437, "last_played": 1700789615}, "language": "english", "review": "As an Alan Wake acolyte, this really expands the universe that game lives in and isn't afraid to go deeply, perfectly strange", "timestamp_created": 1700608157, "timestamp_updated": 1700608157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513513505458831787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150704475": {"recommendationid": "150704475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073338956", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 909, "last_played": 1666635348}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll hit the facts on the table, if we don't get a sequel then sheets gonna rattle.\nPerkele.", "timestamp_created": 1700603236, "timestamp_updated": 1700603236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150701204": {"recommendationid": "150701204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974920040", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "playtime_at_review": 2105, "last_played": 1700602529}, "language": "english", "review": "I CONTROL!", "timestamp_created": 1700602842, "timestamp_updated": 1700602842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150690537": {"recommendationid": "150690537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208345961", "num_games_owned": 562, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 440, "playtime_at_review": 811, "last_played": 1700621833}, "language": "english", "review": "great fantastic game! the graphical glitches make me weary to recommend it.

And combine that with horrible difficulty and this is why I gave up couple of years ago. More than lack of duck, cover and some basic shooter maneuvers your weapons are horrible, so much that you wont get any semblance to any shooter game you ever played, and coming from people that made Max Payne this was really disappointing. Since then, I went back couple of weeks ago and I said, okay, we will just turn on assists and I wanna hear the story. However, that is when other problems began. Now I havent changed my 3070 since this game came out, and I remember I could have played this game on most setting with stable framerate, but the dips in fps are horrible now. It is one thing when you experience them in mid cutscene, but when you fps goes from 60 to 20 in high pace shooting area, you can understand why I got frustrated.\n\nOther than technical issues, game severely lacks in story cohesion. I understand the theme is that you learn more the more you discover and are interested, but I was reading docs, watching videos, Dr Darling and everything, and you know what I got? I got that someone had a nice idea, but then he threw a bunch of concepts in just as a filler, and it stuck like crap on the wall. Not very good, not very polished.\n\nIf anything I love that Courtney had fun doing this. I really liked her in Quantum Break and I wanted to see more of the same in this game. However devs thought it would be good enough that she is in promos and voice materials, and didnt do a single cutscene with her in live action. \n\nWhich brings me to next and final point. This game was taste of things to come. And if you played this one, you knew that Alan Wake 2 would not be good. Somehow in 70s setting you get a female protagonist, female sidekick (Pope), female kickass (Marshall). All men are bumbling idiots if they are friendly and creeps and evil if they are hostile. Even Jesses brother is displayed as someone who has 0 remorse toward what his sister survived and gave himself willingly to Hiss. I mean, come on. That is not how humans behave.\n\nAll in all, I'll stop rambling.

The best part of this game. Almost everything can be destroyed. And it's fun.\n\n- [b]UI[/b]. I like it, although some parts of it suck. Like the mod's description text size is so small it's hard to quickly see what your current mod and the new one do.\n\n[b]Negatives: [/b]\n\n- [b]Save system[/b]. It's just awful. The game would make saves every goddamn second whenever you do something, but if you die it teleports you to the nearest control point. There's no way to easily load any saves manually (like in many other games). Maybe console folks are used to it but as a PC enjoyer that just sucks.\n\n- [b]Discouraging exploration[/b]. Usually, before jumping into the main story, I like to do some side quests or fck around to immerse myself into the world of a game. But this game makes it almost impossible to enjoy any exploration. First of all, this game is quite hard at times and there's no option to choose difficulty level. That would've been okay if not for the spawn system. Every fcking time you go anywhere the game would spawn enemies there. It doesn't matter if you cleansed it or not. The further you are the stronger the enemies (and their quantity). It's just so frustrating. If the game had an option to adjust the difficulty level, I could lower it for the exploration and raise it back once I'm done. \n\n- [b]Upgrades[/b]. It's just numbers. Weapon upgrades as well as your personal mods. Rare item has 19% of whatever and your existing uncommon one has 15%. You swap it and there's almost no difference because you will just get more enemies to shoot at. And for me, there's no point in creating those mods because you just find them everywhere.\n\n- [b]Shooting all the time[/b]. This point follows from the previous ones. I get it, this game is all about shooting things. But OMG there's so much shooting. It becomes tedious. You trying to do some side quests and it's even more shooting. In the end, you're not even that excited about it.\n\n- [b]Atmosphere[/b]. This one is subjective. I saw many people liked the atmosphere in this game, but for me, it just feels empty. I can't really immerse myself in it.\n\n- [b]Story[/b]. For me, there's nothing catchy about it. The whole reason why Jesse comes to the Bureau is to find her brother.

I play Steam, fuck the epic store!\n\nAnyway Control bears no continuity to Alan Wake from what I can tell just that it is set within the world Alan Wake is set in. \nControl feels like a modern 3rd person shooter with a unique way of battling adversaries using a service gun that shapeshifts to become one of the (5) weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Machine Gun, Sniper and Grenade Launcher.\nThe combat is smooth as a button, you tell Jesse to go she goes you tell her to stop and she does just that, none of that tanky movement where the player will come to a slow stop, it's instant, it's perfect!\nThe enemy types I think there's quite a few varieties tbf and you come across a couple different orders quite often to throw a wrench in the works to make the fights a tad more difficult.\nSpeaking of Difficult I haven't found a difficulty setting throughout my playthrough which can be a bit frustrating at times given you don't regen health overtime and enemies have ofc perfect aims almost all the time and fuck me the damage they can do. A swarm of maybe 3 enemies can overrun you in this game easily if you are not careful, the AI are very clever and they use everything to kill you. \nThe physics are also a welcome addition in Control, almost like i'm playing a battlefield game when you hide behind cover the enemies will make sure to blow it up, you hide behind a pillar, you can be sure the enemies are going to blow it up and if not them using the launch ability to pick up rocks and boulders and pretty much everything in this game you can pull them from the stone and tear away the cover to fuck the enemies over...so diverse I love it!\nThe health regen is a pretty sadistic feature within control having your only form of healing generate by harming enemy hiss to make them drop shards? or health and then having to run for your life to go collect it only to die and be sent back to the last checkpoint OR survive and run back to cover now with less health than you began with...I had to mod this out and put health regen into the game. It just made no sense that this isn't a permanent feature.\nWeapon control was another feature I didn't understand, swapping between weapons should have been 1-5 on the keys but it wasn't the Devs decided to lock it to F so you swap between just the two guns that you choose within your loadout...this also made no sense given the gun is made of some dimensional shit and just becomes a gun so I modded in 1-5 weapon changes to enable free-switching to the gun I desired rather than pulling the loadout up all the time over and over.\nWeapon upgrades are another strange one, like you can upgrade using rare resources and your shards but it's so fucking expensive and the results hardly seem worthy, I upped my pistol and G launcher to LV3 asap and the pistol is still garbage and the G launcher is amazing and does tons of AOE dmg aswell as armor break, can't say much for the other 3 weapons though.\nStoryline objective and mission markers - these are absolutely useless and there is no way to fix it, has no one had this issue or is it just me...I couldn't find the Jukebox without a YT video.\nOverall Control is a fantastic game, it makes literally no sense if you pay no attention but it's a good game none the less, everything about it feels modern and upto date besides the aforementioned mods for QoL changes. \nCame across one black screen throughout my playthrough down in the medical wing, apparently it's due to DirectX12 (I was using 11) and Ray Tracing ( I never have RT on as it's such a pointless feature) but alas it still gave me a black screen, this is the only bug I came across.\n\n9/10 so much to do, difficult fights, lots to do, just feels like a good ass game!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1700158425, "timestamp_updated": 1700159142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150229004": {"recommendationid": "150229004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094801208", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 675, "playtime_at_review": 2559, "last_played": 1700078236}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game, as long as you can adapt to how it plays.\n\nIf you like the SCP foundation, you will love the story of this game, \n\nIf you like throwing forklifts at people, without having having forklift certification, you'll live this game.\n\nOverall its a solid 9/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1700150644, "timestamp_updated": 1700150644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150222562": {"recommendationid": "150222562", "author": {"steamid": "76561199047471330", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1114, "playtime_at_review": 1843, "last_played": 1700141698}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy buen juego,pero estoy cabreado por que tengo la ultimate edition y ni rastro de los dlc...", "timestamp_created": 1700142203, "timestamp_updated": 1700142203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150221563": {"recommendationid": "150221563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970928279", "num_games_owned": 1042, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1519, "playtime_at_review": 404, "last_played": 1700784221}, "language": "english", "review": "usually, it's a walk in the park...\nevery 20 minutes later.. how did I die?", "timestamp_created": 1700140781, "timestamp_updated": 1700140781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150220492": {"recommendationid": "150220492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000988614", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3083, "playtime_at_review": 4624, "last_played": 1700261823}, "language": "english", "review": "this game kicks so much ass it's insane. aesthetically perfect in every conceivable way, engaging and satisfying combat, good baseline difficulty level, and absolutely incredible worldbuilding & plot", "timestamp_created": 1700139336, "timestamp_updated": 1700139336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150213621": {"recommendationid": "150213621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272470366", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1500, "playtime_at_review": 2504, "last_played": 1700126553}, "language": "english", "review": "Whether you're a fan of Remedy and its connected universe or a newcomer Control is a must play and it deserved to be nominated for GOTY in 2019.

It's not just a game; it's a journey that pulls you into a world of dimension-shifting battles, captivating characters, and a gripping mystery that kept me hooked from start to finish.\n\nI liked the new protagonist (Jesse Faden) and stepping into the Federal Bureau of Control, with its many (many) twists and turns are nothing short of mind-blowing. The game skillfully blends power like telekinesis and material manipulation into a combat system that's nothing short of phenomenal, which reminds me a bit of one of their previous games, Quantum Break.\n\nVisually, Control is a feast for the eyes, especially if you're lucky enough to experience it on a mid-to-high-end system that can handle a bit of ray tracing. The decision to open up the Remedy Connected Universe is evident in the DLC (AWE) and the game pays homage to the studio's past while hinting at a broader narrative that left me eager for more. I keep coming back to just run around this open sandbox for the endless side missions, however repetitive they can sometimes be.\n\nControl is the start of a new era the studio behind it.

It\u2019s kind of a mix of Max Payne and F.E.A.R. with sick looking stylish gunplay but with paranormal/horror setting, the only thing missing in this game is the bullet time. Still, even without it, I had a lot of fun with this one. Also, the plot is quite entertaining, if you like stuff like SCP Foundation, you will probably like the plot in this one, as it is set on a living building where secret government officials keep all kinds of dangerous and paranormal things locked away.\nThe only negatives that I have are that sometimes level design can be a bit obtuse, a couple enemies can have some really annoying attacks that can hit you from places you won\u2019t see and last is that the loot system is really crappy. But even with those, everything else is quite the experience and also, the DLC is pretty good, so you have quite a lot of content to go through.\nThis one is an easy 9/10 for me, highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1699932301, "timestamp_updated": 1699932379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150094613": {"recommendationid": "150094613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007845342", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 318, "playtime_forever": 3984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1424, "playtime_at_review": 3984, "last_played": 1699812855}, "language": "english", "review": "Control is a Masterpiece.\nOne of the best games ever created.\n\nThey basically took the \"SCP Foundation\" and built their headquarters inside Kane Pixels' liminal \"The Backrooms\"!\nHow could anything possibly go wrong?\nIf you loved shows like \"Stranger Things\", \"Fringe\" or \"The X-Files\", then CONTROL is perfect for you.\n\nExcellent world-building and a superb gaming experience.\nFrom solid graphics that will age well to the extremely well done sound design and art direction,\nCONTROL is exactly what we want form a Triple AAA title.\n\nThe Oldest House is a unique setting with brutalist architecture but the standout is the Ashtray Maze.\nThe Ashtray Maze sequence is by far the greatest moment of CONTROL and an instant classic.\nJust for that reason alone, check it out.\n\nIn no other game have I experienced such a perfect representation of Telekinesis,\nwhere you can actually feel the very impact of the power.\nThe realistic physics and destructible environment greatly add to the authenticity of Telekinesis.\nThe power to levitate is also very unique. It is not real flying like in other games but keeping yourself afloat and the amazing physics of the game support it.\n\nAs Raycevick said, one of \"Remedy Entertainment\" strengths is: \"Integrating slick cinematic style within core gameplay, rather than scripted sequences.\"\nMy PC ran the game on ultra graphics and didn't even make a sound! The game feels and looks good with smooth animations.\n\n\nCONTROL is not a true FPS game, don't expect that genre here.\nGuns are weaker than telekineticaly launching rocks but that is logical as throwing a concrete block at mach 10 speed is more devastating than a little bullet shot at regular gun velocity...\nGuns serve the only purpose of giving you a tool to  protect yourself in the downtime periods, while your Energy regenerates.\nLaunch, Shield, Dash and Mind Control use from the same energy pool, you got to weigh your options carefully in combat.\n\n\nThis game is mysterious but also very deep.\nAfter reading every file in the game and paying great attention, I am still on a lore/theory binge to fully understand the world of CONTROL and I ain't stopping anytime soon!",

Remedy knows how to blend great storytelling with addictive combat in a way that so few studios seem to get right anymore. With every other developer out there seemingly laser focused on building online, live service titles, Remedy flies in the face of that by creating some of the best moment to moment action games we've seen in years.\n\nControl is a third-person shooter with a strong focus on action and the spectacle of combat. You learn about all the weird things going on in The Oldest House along with Jessie as she tries to save her brother and stop an extra-dimensional invasion.\n\nWhen I started Control for the first time, I didn't really know what to expect. Within the first 5 minutes I realized that I was in for something weird and special. Just in that first encounter with Ahti, I could tell that Remedy was setting up something incredibly weird and fantastical. I was hooked.\n\nControl is a wacky ride. It's really unlike anything that you've seen before. It's a clever mix of action and suspense, with a hint of horror for flavor. It's not a scary game per se, but it does carry some genuinely creepy moments at times. It doesn't reduce itself to relying on jump scares. It's more in the oppressive architecture of The Oldest House, the otherworldly behavior of some of the Hiss enemy types, as well as some of the characters you'll meet along the way. It's never horror, for horror's sake.\n\nRemedy really hit their mark with Control's combat. The inclusion of the telekinetic powers added that extra bit of flavor that most shooters need in order to stand out from the heard. Not only does Control stand out, it's one of the smoothest and best feeling combat systems I've seen in quite a while. The chuckle I get every time I throw a forklift at someone or something never goes away. Floating while yanking a section of wall out to send careening towards an advancing squad of Hiss is just 100% joy inducing.\n\nFor fans of action games with high production values, this is a must play. If you're not a fan of the horror genre, go into this one with the understanding that more often that not you're the most dangerous thing in the room. You'll find that you despite the horrific theme of Control, you have the means to absolutely devastate enemies and crush anything that comes at you.\n\nOverall: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1699726204, "timestamp_updated": 1699726204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149947772": {"recommendationid": "149947772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007317463", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "playtime_at_review": 1393, "last_played": 1699723606}, "language": "english", "review": "decided to finally check this out years after planning on doing so (thanks alan wake 2 hype train!) i played through all main and side content for the game (including foundation + AWE) and had a blast.\n\ncontrol just oozes style, the vibes are immaculate, and the action gameplay is super fun. guns are satisfying to shoot and i don't think i could ever get tired of hurling handcarts and tables at enemies.\n\nmy only negatives are that the map is not the best and i got pretty exhausted with all of the backtracking and constant spawning of enemies. hopefully these things can be improved upon in the sequel, though the respawning enemies is clearly a design decision so i'm not holding my breath on changes there.", "timestamp_created": 1699724340, "timestamp_updated": 1699724340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149945059": {"recommendationid": "149945059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148217553", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 180, "playtime_at_review": 1676, "last_played": 1699721534}, "language": "english", "review": "Remedy's best game", "timestamp_created": 1699721557, "timestamp_updated": 1699721557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149940927": {"recommendationid": "149940927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023251478", "num_games_owned": 1146, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "playtime_at_review": 235, "last_played": 1699716725}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing for 3 hours and so far i'm loving it.

I have never been a fan of games that I would consider \"Experimental\" As usually they end up being so far up their own ass that I can't fully enjoy them. But this is certainly a bit of an experimental game, that still knows how to have fun, and not take itself too seriously like a lot of experimental games end up doing. \n\nIf I had to say one issue I had with the game, it would be the main story, while the world building and the lore featured in the game in top notch, the story itself is pretty lackluster and ends on a bit of a wet fart. I have not finished the DLC yet, so maybe they wrap up some things in the DLC missions. Even if they do, this doesn't change the main story being pretty mid.

Players looking for an engaging, thought-provoking gaming experience will find \"Control\" to be a game that challenges the norms and delivers on multiple fronts.\n\nThe game\u2019s narrative is deeply enigmatic, revolving around the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), a secretive government agency dealing with paranormal phenomena. Players step into the shoes of Jesse Faden, who arrives at the FBC's shifting headquarters, The Oldest House, in search of her missing brother. The story unfolds in a manner reminiscent of a David Lynch film, with layers of mystery peeling back to reveal a rich, otherworldly lore that is both compelling and mystifying.\n\nThe core gameplay mechanic of \"Control\" is Jesse\u2019s telekinetic abilities, which allow her to manipulate the environment and combat enemies in creative ways. This psychokinetic prowess isn't just a gimmick; it's integral to both the combat and the exploration, adding depth to puzzle-solving and navigation through the ever-changing architecture of The Oldest House.\n\nThe game\u2019s design is visually arresting, with brutalist architecture providing a stark, imposing backdrop to the supernatural chaos. The dynamic destructibility of the environment is not only visually impressive but also plays into the game\u2019s combat strategy, as players can use parts of the environment as weapons or shields.\n\nFurthermore, the game's use of lighting and particle effects creates an atmosphere that is both beautiful and disconcerting, enhancing the surreal quality of the game's setting. \"Control\" also features an adaptive soundtrack that reacts to the gameplay, amplifying the tension in combat and the sense of wonder during exploration.\n\n\"Control\" also boasts a robust progression system. As players delve deeper into The Oldest House, they unlock new abilities and upgrades, allowing for a high degree of customization in how they approach the game's challenges. This progression feels rewarding and keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging throughout the experience.\n\nThe game is not without its narrative-driven side missions, which are just as intriguing as the main story. These optional quests delve into the histories of the FBC and its agents, enriching the game's world and often rewarding players with new abilities or items.\n\n\"Control\" does not shy away from challenging the player with its cryptic puzzles and formidable enemies, ensuring that the action remains as mentally stimulating as it is viscerally exciting. This difficulty curve is well-calibrated, pushing players to experiment with their powers and strategies without feeling unfair.\n\nIn summary, \"Control\" is an exemplary title that offers an intoxicating mix of compelling storytelling, innovative gameplay, and awe-inspiring visual design.

Remedy Entertainment has outdone themselves with this paranormal thriller, delivering an experience that is both visually stunning and intellectually stimulating.\n\nFirst and foremost, Control's narrative is an intricate tapestry of mystery, intrigue, and psychological exploration. You play as Jesse Faden, who finds herself in the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) while searching for her missing brother. The story unfolds in a non-linear fashion, leaving you constantly questioning the nature of reality and the true motives of the FBC. It's a narrative that will keep you guessing until the very end, and it's a testament to the game's unique storytelling.\n\nThe setting, the Oldest House, is a character in itself. This brutalist skyscraper is a labyrinthine masterpiece, constantly shifting and defying the laws of physics. It's a place where nothing is as it seems, and exploring its nooks and crannies is an adventure in itself. The attention to detail and world-building is extraordinary, immersing you in a world that feels both real and surreal simultaneously.\n\nControl's gameplay is where it truly shines. Jesse's supernatural abilities are a joy to wield, and the combat is a perfect blend of telekinetic powers and gunplay. The flexibility in combat scenarios keeps things fresh, and the progression system allows for customization of abilities to suit your playstyle. It's a power trip like no other, and taking on the otherworldly enemies of the Hiss is immensely satisfying.\n\nThe audio and visual design of Control is nothing short of breathtaking. The brutalist architecture, the eerie lighting, and the ambient sounds create an atmosphere that is both haunting and beautiful. Jesse's internal monologues and the way the story is delivered through documents and recordings add depth to the experience. The game's use of brutalist architecture is a bold choice and adds a unique and unforgettable dimension to the gameplay.\n\nControl is not just a game; it's a work of art. Its impeccable fusion of narrative, gameplay, and atmosphere makes it a standout title in the world of gaming. It's a journey that challenges your mind, immerses you in a captivating world, and leaves you pondering its mysteries long after the credits roll.

I do recommend it, as I think it's well made overall.\nBut on the other hand it kind of lost me a lot of times...\n\nThe graphics are phenomenal, no complaints there.\nIt ran quite smoothly even on my GTX 1060 - sometimes the environment would look muddy\nand low detail, but I am pretty sure this is because of my old graphics-card.\n\nThe gameplay felt nice, moving around, shooting, using abilities.\n\nThe artistic value of some of the scenes in the game is incredible.\n\nAnd maybe I went in with the wrong expectations, but this game, to me, felt way\ntoo much like a very \"videogamey\" 3rd Person Action shooter.\nI was honestly expecting a much more story intensive and lore-rich game.\n\nI wanted to immerse myself in this world, see all the absurd things that might be going on in the \"oldest house\",\nand learn about the bureau and the characters in it, but while all of it was there, kind of, none of it was really fleshed out.\nMaybe it's because of the setting - that they just bit off more than they could chew - that all these characters and micro storys about powerful mysterious objects were too much for any of them to get enough detail... But I don't know honestly.\n\nThe graphics and sounddesign really pulled me in, but then I found myself opening lootbox-like upgrade containers everywhere, and applying 5% damage boosts to my gun... my inventory got full with these upgrades all the time, so i had to throw them out on a regular basis. That really dragged my immersion down.\n\nThe battles were quite epic in terms of setting, world destruction etc, but then the game just started throwing more and more enemies at me while i just wanted to explore, and the more upgrades i found, the higher the level of the enemies got, so in the end, I didn't really feel like I was getting stronger, I just got more options on how to approach a situation.\nWhenever I backtracked to a location, to see if there was something I had missed, I was always worried that I would have to defeat a bunch of randomly spawning enemies until I could really take my time and look around.\nThey felt more like an artificial obstacle to occupy you for some minutes, and not like a truely fun experience.\n\nWhile I thought this game would offer up a variety of different weird threats, it also just seemed to throw enemies of the same faction at you all the time, with a bunch of variations of it. In the end, the threat was basically red glowing corrupted humans, which works for a while - but I would have wished for some more variety. Abstract geometrical shapes are also not really my thing for enemy design... I am more of a creature horror guy.\n\nObjects of power were also just regular props, a fridge, a clock, a party balloon, and while I know thats what its like in a lot of scp stories, that was honestly also a little bit disappointing. (except for the fridge maybe).\nA lot of it is just you seeing these things through a glass pane in containment rooms, but they dont do anything, you can just read up short reports about them. And these reports really just represent one vague snippet of what an object does or did, and thats all the backstory you get for it. Many words in lore collectibles are also blacked out - on one hand this may be to let the player imagine what they actually say, on the other hand it just felt like they didn't have the time to think of the details and just left those passages blank.\n\nThe main story was also.. messy.. Jesse, the main character, was never really introduced and you had to piece her goals together over time, leading to me not having any clue on what she was really looking for and why. She also seemed to have an inner monologue 90% of the time, when she coud just say stuff out loud and actually communicate. The bureau employees just offer some exposition and thats basically it. The story wrapped up quite abruptly and with no real logical resolve.\n\n\nAll in all... beautiful looking game, fun abilities, interesting concepts.\n\nBut after a while, it can be a little dull, when the wow-effect of the graphics has faded,\nand the redacted lore files feel more like short bits of something that doesn't really have much meaning.\nIn general, a lot of things didn't make sense to me at all - and while a good story always leaves blanks\nto be filled with your own imagination, this story just had many holes in it.\n\nBonus points for the janitor and the music labyrinth sequence.\n\nMaybe it was just the wrong time and mood for me to play this.\nNot bad, not incredible.

Must be one of if not the most visually striking games I have ever played. Both the pure graphical quality, but especially the astonishing art direction, mostly inspired by brutalism with splashes of vibrant colors. The sound design here is also some of the best I have heard. Where I would have wanted more though is in the music. It is not bad, but a bit underwhelming, which is a feeling that persists through many aspects of this game.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun, but not that varied. I love launch alot, one of the most satisfying abilities in any game (especially the sound that plays when grabbing objects, superb). Super nice feedback and dynamic due to the physics system. But that was what I used throughout. That and two variants of the pistol through the whole game. Sure they are all satisfying, but it can get a bit repetitive. Same with the enemies. There are quite alot of different enemies, which I appreciate, but you dispatch them in the exact same ways, or at least I did. But the satisfying nature of your combat abilities managed to not get old at least. Also I am not that big of a fan of the different \"upgrade parts\" you get. It is just the same old +10% damage etc. stuff that I find a bit bland. At least the numbers get somewhat high so that you actually feel some sort of progression.  \n\nI love exploring the oldest house as well. It is basically a metroidvania and takes some surprising inspirations from Dark Souls of all games. The different side quests and stuff you can find around are just super fun and varied. I reeeeally love interacting and reading about the different objects of power. I actually loved reading about anything I could find in the game, which is not something I usually do. Very few games have managed to make me want to search out collectible documents, and this is one of them.\n\nThe story is where I am most split. I really like what the narrative is about, beyond the main characters goals, but due to what it is about it feels like it will always be inherently unsatisfying. I found it super engaging throughout though, with great characters and a super cool setting. It just did not stick the landing for me. There are a lot of super cool and weird stuff in this game, mostly due to its inspiration SCP, but there are barely any answers for anything, or at least a satisfying amount of information about this stuff. I get that it is what they are going for, and I do like that, but I feel they could have given us just a little bit more sometimes. Or maybe I really just want a more satisfying story for the main character, as it ends super abruptly and I did not really care about her story unfortunately. \n\nI really love the vibe, style and so much about this game, but I do feel a bit unsatisfied in the end due to these different things I brought up. But wow does it do the good things well.

Clearly inspired by American mid-century offices, the setting for the Bureau is cold, not lived in, but worked in. I can't think of another game that has a setting like this and for it to expand vertically, instead of laterally, is what makes this setting truly unique. Story-wise and setting wise, the idea of such a solid space being filled with secrets tucked away by concrete and keycards makes every new room more intriguing -- you really feel that you're not suppose to be there, but the entire premise boils down to \"well, its all your problem and jurisdiction now\", which is appropriately nonsense in-tandem with the nonsensical dialogue. But this game is dense in all directions; nothing is dense and unfounded, nonsense all becomes sense with time. Control does an amazing job with visually storytelling, but it's also filled to the brim with wittily written collectables that add so much. I think it does detract from he experience to not read them, as it provides context unfounded otherwise to a lot of mysteries, but it's intimidating. I mean, there has to be thousands of collectables, right? It's pretty thoughtful in it's rewarding of exploration, with both tangible items for gameplay and a little something else to flesh out the hollow hallways otherwise. This game is reminiscent of the Souls formula at times, with it's \"if you thinks theres something, there probably is\" approach to exploration, but thats not the only allegory. I mean, I assume the Bonfire-esque checkpoints and respawning enemies and losing of resources upon death(though theres no pickup) are at least tangentially related to the Souls influence of gaming. Control is very much its own game though, one that doesnt have to be so good for such an obscure story. With this being a very vague sequel to Alan Wake, to then something more direct in the DLC, you can just image this as a survival horror instead and I wouldnt be surprised if it started as one. Instead it's the jedi game you've always wanted -- why?? I dont know why they took it in this direction, but it's fantastic. The gameplay is great and inventive for no necessary reason other than to be fun and I'm assuming also for Jesse to continue to be a domineering force in this new Alan-connected universe they've created, as opposed to Alans inherent power being locked in this metaphysical body of his, which is still ripe to being killed. Alan wouldn't survive Control, that's for sure. So really, it enables this game to be a lot more grandiose, sometimes feeling limitless with your abilities and the setpieces it allows you to traverse. There's something truly unique about the perspective you can take on these realised locations and that goes down to the rendering of materials and their destructability. The material breaking in this game is unbelievable -- seriously,  how the hell does this even run with such insane rendering techniques already? These solid materials are confining, familiar and Jesse's ability to tear them apart with such ease is another great analogy for her tearing down the walls and getting answers for whats going on, and why it has to be her to do it. This is all wrapped together with some of the most interesting explanation for things, for questions that didnt even really need to be answered to. Back to the gameplay, my only real criticism is that even though it's so fun, this is ostensibly a long art film, where theres a point where I just wanna walk around, look at things and find out whats going on. The challenge also ranges significantly; the combat and puzzles really only becomes difficult in the fantastic DCLS's. I assuming Remedy didnt want to assume too much, but they learned in the DLC's where there's a couple pretty annoying combat encounters and at least one puzzle so absurdly obtuse I had to look up the answer to where I found out, yeah, nearly nobody was able to figure this out. The DLC also introduces some pretty incredible new powers, environment and a diversity between the two that are yet again vertical explorations, one focusing on the monolithic and the other the dark -- it's worth not looking more into it before playing.\n\nI'm so happy this game exists and what's setup in it already, as well as the DLC's makes me even more excited for Control 2 and Alan wake 2, to see how this universe continues to evolve. Never though after playing Alan Wake 13 years ago that we'd get something like this preceding it.", "timestamp_created": 1698957889, "timestamp_updated": 1698957889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149398454": {"recommendationid": "149398454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411590156", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1699287894}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.", "timestamp_created": 1698957740, "timestamp_updated": 1698957740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149394815": {"recommendationid": "149394815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296091446", "num_games_owned": 1013, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 793, "last_played": 1692732940}, "language": "english", "review": "Beyond the shadow you settle for, there is a miracle illuminated.\n", "timestamp_created": 1698953981, "timestamp_updated": 1698953981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149394621": {"recommendationid": "149394621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807057799", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1694838072}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my top favorite games of all time!

Jesse Faden moves incredibly fluidly from the get go, and within 5 minutes of playing this game, I was at home with moving around the battlefield. As the game progresses and you get more movement options as well as more weapons, it only gets better.

The story starts with you and Jesse both confused with what exactly in the blue-hell is going on, but the story slowly starts getting you in on the more supernatural (parautilitarian friendly) aspects of the happenings around you and you start to get sucked into the intrigue.

Not at all. >Is it made for everyone? Absolutely not.\n>Did the developers put their love while making it? I believe so.\n\nThe most important thing in a game, is its pacing. If a game is good-paced, then its considered as a good or even a great game for most people.\nThe problem with Control is exactly this. It's more similar to Souls-Like games rather than regular action-adventures.\nEven 50% of Souls-Like enjoyers are gonna enjoy this one, 'Cause it's different than them.\nIt's a special kind that all the plot, characters, and gameplay might be confusing for the majority of people.\nYou'll start off in an office, more like a company. but the way Jesse (Protagonist) talks, you feel like you've missed something. something that she knows and you don't.\nIt's like her first time visiting that place. which resembles the player, too.\nYou roam around a little further and you realize no one is there. pretty annoying, huh? a lot of indie horror games are like that: roaming around a dead environment.\nThen, you get to know about notes. the most vital and important part of the game.\nYou wanna enjoy the gameplay and Its action? you should understand the story besides it.\nYou wanna play it for the story? you should collect and read notes. How to do that? By playing, grinding and backtracking the same locations that you've seen before.\nAnd each time enemies respawn, too.\nBut you CAN defend yourself. or \"Counter-Measure\" as the game names it. you've got a pistol with an infinite amount of ammo that can be turned into a shotgun, minigun and a rocket launcher.\nNot to mention your abilities. which will expand the more you proceed.\nSome tasks may be repetitive, but the story isn't. It gets deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole and expands its plot which in the end, combines itself to other Remedy games.\nThe gameplay is pretty smooth and floaty. you can't find anyone who dislikes that. The graphics are beautiful and gorgeous but Like I said, that *Almost* dead environment may ruin it a little bit.\nPlus it's long enough to keep you engaged if you have the time.

Could have been an 8, 9, or better if they fixed a few things. The story is a complete scramble of nonsense. I'm 20 hours in and still have no idea why I'm here or what I'm doing. Just going to the next area cause that's what the map says to do. Combat is decent, a bit too hectic for my taste. I prefer a bit of strategy, this games very go, go, go. Don't bother with crouching to trying to get cover, you'll just get hit more. Just sprint around and kill everything asap. Max out the health upgrade first. Your character dies if someone sneezes near her. My biggest problem is navigating the game and maneuvering the character. You get a new mission and spend 25 to 30 mins trying to navigate a poorly designed map, running through previously cleared areas, clearing out previously defeated enemies, to dodge too far or not far enough, miss a landing, fall off a ledge, or whatever and die. Then respawn at the start of the mission and spend another 30 mins navigating back. Puzzles and navigation challenges have a game testing level of design. literally a big empty black room with no environment, just platforms and blocks you have to jump to. Pick up this block, put it in that hole kind of simple. They take 10% of your total upgrade points as a consequence for dying so upgrading becomes a grind fast. You lose hours of your life running and all level up points you got fighting everything in your way to get back to the obstacle to try and land a jump right. The last two or three times I've played I've spent half an hour navigating, died, then shut it down for another month. It's quick to remind me why I stopped playing in the first place. I don't have hours to waste running in circles. There's better games, with better stories, better combat, that stay exciting, and aren't a chore to progress.

The blend of supernatural and tech this game's setting is based on is exactly my jam, scratching the same itch that for example LOST (the TV show) did so many years ago.

The game was challenging (I think now some difficulty/assist settings have been added?) but never felt unfair \u2013 except maybe for a certain, optional boss fight. Personally I was so intrigued by the mystery that I actually enjoyed exploring for the various collectible bits and pieces that gave more information and added to the lore.\n\nSome achievements, especially in the DLCs, were a wee bit too grindy, but not at all to the point where I didn't still enjoy getting to spend some more time with Jesse.

Should you play it?  Absolutely.  Will it piss you off?  Absolutely.  \n\nI walked in basically blind -- knowing only that it was a well-regarded first person shooter set in something very much like the SCP Foundation -- and I highly recommend you do too.  Because the one thing this game does best is the journey from a player and character both walking in blind to a creepy government building, into an overwhelmed young woman with a pistol struggling for any foothold in a reality gone insane, and then slowly --  as you master both your skills and the setting itself -- into a superhero literally levitating around the map and using supernatural powers to mow down hordes of enemies.\n\nThe game's setting, The Oldest House, is by itself worth the price of admission.  The geometry, the piece-by-piece lore dumps, and the environment's endless interactibility and deformability (*everything*, including a surprising number of walls, is breakable and gets trashed as you fight, and once you get your first psychic ability, you begin using the environment itself as your primary weapon) -- this is a setting you fall in love with and want to spend time in, which always feels real.  That's a huge deal, considering all the ways the game is constantly bending and breaking reality around you.  There's only five levels to the game -- seven counting the DLC -- but that adds to the intimacy of it; you're constantly going back through areas you've already seen, but with new powers or new access cards which unfold the levels further, and it always feels fresh despite its intimate size.  You get to know the Oldest House viscerally.  It's a fantastic layer to the experience.\n\nCombat, too, feels satisfying.  Which is saying a lot, because one of the major problems is the game's ridiculous lack of balance.  There are difficulty spikes everywhere.  Many enemies are cakewalks, but your health is so low and some attacks do so much damage, that you can die repeatedly even to generic mobs if they come at you with the wrong combination of enemies or corner you in an area where you can't avoid damage.  The mod system is basically useless; there's only a tiny handful of mods which make any difference (mostly damage boosters and a few rare generic energy recovery boosters), with the vast majority being so situational and underwhelming there's no point in equipping them.  Pointless inventory limits will have you juggling mods repeatedly, and since you can only equip two guns at a time, there's little point in changing your kit once you get an optimal loadout. I used the sniper rifle and shotgun for 90% of the game once I had them; I tried equipping some of the later weapons, but the rocket launcher had too much of a tendency to hit you in the backblast due to clipping debris and exploding early, and by the time I got the sticky grenade launcher,  it wasn't worth it to adjust my play style to make use of it.\n\nMassive difficulty spikes plus insanely long loading times were the game's biggest sin.  It's very forgiving in some ways -- everything you pick up and level elements you complete are permanent immediately; but when you die, you lose 10% of your money and are returned to the latest control point you interacted with. This means there are some bosses where you have to go through a long hike and re-watch the intro sequence every time you die in their fight.  Pointlessly maddening.\n\nAnd despite having two endings -- three counting the DLC -- you get absolutely zero closure from completing any of them.  There's thirty seconds of cutscene and then it dumps you right back into endgame free-play, which lets you go complete hanging quests, but leaves all your setting questions unanswered and drops all the plot arcs like a hot potato.  I had to watch some videos to make certain there wasn't a secret 100% ending I was supposed to be working toward.  Nope.  Barely a \"thank you for playing\" and then the experience just runs out.\n\nDespite that, this is an utterly unique experience.  The game is fresh and surprising throughout.  Everything is memorable.  If you do make it to the end of the game, the Ashtray Maze sequence is one of the most awesome 10 minutes I have played this decade.  Advancing through the game never wasted my time -- but when you stall out and are repeatedly dying and staring at loading screens or re-navigating empty hallways for 2/3 of your playtime, it felt all the more awful for how smooth and engaging the rest of it was. \n\nI told a friend this is a B+ game with A+ material held back by some D elements.  Despite that, I would not call it merely \"good\".  It breaks the scale.  Simultaneously amazing and awful, and never in the wishy-washy middle.

Those people are wrong. \"Control\" is [i]clearly[/i] based on the hit TV show \"Warehouse 13\" that aired on Syfy.\n\nRemember that show? No? Oh come on! It was good! *sigh*\n\nJokes aside, \"Control\" is a REALLY good game. Remedy Entertainment, the developers, have an almost Gaiman-esque gift for writing high-level cosmic metaphysics in a way that compels a narrative. There is a STRONG supernatural element here, and I don't just mean pervasive. I mean everything in the setting and story revolve around its central conceit in a way that works together perfectly.\n\nThe action gameplay is enjoyable, though it does get a bit old after a while. Not for a lack of trying to add new tools to your kit. \"Control\" has a progression system... just not a terribly interesting one. Had they stripped out the upgrade mechanics entirely it wouldn't have mattered all that much. But for what it is the combat is fast-paced and handles beautifully. You'll still die to flying enemies that spawn behind you, though.\n\nExploration of the setting is extremely fun. There's secret areas scattered throughout and TONS of lore to uncover. If you don't like stopping to read or listen to stuff you're going to miss out in this game. \"Control\" rewards the patient with an incredible depth of history, philosophy, and paranatural metaphysics. This game's lore is so deep it's not even contained to this particular game! See report [spoiler]Alan Wake[/spoiler] for details.\n\nHonestly, my biggest complaints about \"Control\" are that I don't feel like it sticks the landing with its endings. None of the three - main story, 'Foundation' DLC, an 'AWE' DLC - feel like they have really satisfying conclusions. For the main story, it kinda feels like it ends without a real decisive victory. With 'Foundation' there is a victory, but the boss battle actually feels bad to win. Probably by design. Finally 'AWE' feels like it'd work better in a different game (for reasons that'll be obvious once you've played it) and ends up not feeling right because it's a horror story told AFTER you're a completely overpowered parautilitarian force of nature who is rightfully no longer afraid of anything.\n\nBy contrast, the biggest praise I can heap onto \"Control\" is that it's a game full of great and profound ideas that'll stick with me LONG after I've put it down. There's not a lot of games that I can say that about. And for this alone I STRONGLY recommend that you should play it if you have any interest at all in it.", "timestamp_created": 1697741105, "timestamp_updated": 1697741105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148482478": {"recommendationid": "148482478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062455233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "playtime_at_review": 1071, "last_played": 1700652345}, "language": "english", "review": "Unbelievably intriguing game. \nIf you think Quantum break was difficult - this is 5x worse. \nImpressive indoor-open world.

It's hard to really convey how much I love this game. \n\nAnd as an added bonus, if you watch the videos and worry the combat might be too hard the game lets you turn on invincibility without any negative affects. No condescending messages or achievement loss. Just enjoy the game.

of Art. Those complaining about the story are probably just upset that they had to actually use their brainpower to follow the characters story and how it fits into the world and the fact that there isn't someone directly telling you what to feel means \"uhhh story was meh\" apparently. No one looks at the shining and says \"Um okay? So what hes dead and they get away? How boring\" Stop being so dense about actually unique and interesting games people.\n\nThis game has touches of lovecraftian stuff, in the style of true detective, if it took place in an SCP-lite world.\nAnd SCP-lite is not a negative statement, in fact i think more things should be SCP-lite. Modern SCP stuff is so self serious or completely fandomized that this is a humongous breath of fresh air. While unfair to compare this to all SCP articles ever writtin, i still believe this games worldbuilding clears a majority of more popular story collections. Characters in the SCP foundation could only be characterized in a few sentences or paragraphs and through cross-community writing only. This game allows for consistency throughout the characters and allows you to read the motion capture to get a clearer picture of who they are. The game gives you room to explain things for yourself and figure it out at your own pace. it is the Antithesis of those Ending Explained videos. For example, Ahti the janitor, is never properly explained (I havent done the cleaning quests). But this does not bother you, because you learn that he has a very specific connection to the oldest house and begs the question, is he a part of the board? Or another entity that can only be explained by his role as The Janitor, and whats the furnace? is the furnace the real Ahti? Is he the Astral Plane equivalent of a Vulture? It is far more interesting for it to be unexplained. \n\nIm going to retread here, i genuinely cannot understand the \"boring\" argument. Im certain the writers go out of their way to avoid rescue movie tropes and action adventure tropes and i think its unpredictability got to people in the wrong way.\n\nAlso if youre docking a solid 1 to 2 points because of the ending, you like to be fed slop and have a full belly of it and your mother does too.

Controls are pretty standard and familiar, with WASD movement, mouse guiding the camera, left/right clicks for weapon usage and aiming, and action buttons for powers which Jesse acquires at various points, which include launching objects at foes, levitating, and a lightning-fast dash to evade attacks.\n\nTaking place in entirely in the \"Old House,\" the FBC's headquarters, Control shares a universe with the game Alan Wake, and the stories loosely tie together later in the game, which is kinda cool. The Old House is loaded with lore about altered objects, paranormal incidents, and mundane office goings on. All of it provides a great background and backdrop for the game. The game's story develops in ten mission chapters, with various side missions. The player can upgrade Jesse's abilities, health, and energy pools, with ability points or looted ability-enhancing upgrades that can be slotted (same for weapons). \n\nThe FBC has been invaded by an enemy known as the Hiss, named for its whispering screams. The Hiss possesses FBC agents and soldiers and sends them after Jesse, sometimes warping them in as the player enters a room. I'll just say the combat here, for all its repetitive nature, can be intense and dangerous. Even fully upgraded, Jesse is something of a glass cannon. Bosses and powerful named enemies can do high damage or one-hit the player. Even grunt soldiers will do significant damage up close. Absolutely do not stand still. Use cover, sprint and evade to get out of the line of fire, and save a sliver of energy to throw up an emergency shield.\n\nFortunately, Jesse is no slouch. Picking up (with her mind) objects and launching at enemies is incredibly damaging. The player can easily clear a non-boss fight with that power alone, and upgraded, it's even more potent. Some enemies can do the same and their thrown objects hurt just as much as yours, so stay on your toes. Other enemies fire rockets or chuck grenades, which can be dangerous. Grabbing those with the launch ability and hurling them back at the one who threw it is very gratifying.\n\nBut you probably will die a lot. The game isn't easy and even minor mistakes can quickly snowball out of control. Death costs you a little resources and sends you back to the latest checkpoint save. The real downside to dying is my only major complaint with the game, which are the long, punishing load times. This only adds to the irritation of a difficult fight when you die several times in a row and have to wait to get back into it each time. Very annoying.\n\nIf you're finding things too tough, the Ultimate Edition features an \"assist mode,\" where the player can turn up/down the amount of damage received and dealt, activate the ability to one-shot enemies, or even make Jesse immortal. I was able to complete the game without activating Assist Mode but no shade if you do; the game is obnoxiously difficult in places and the whole point is to have fun, not get frustrated, so do what you need to.\n\nThis version of Control comes with two DLCs, AWE and The Foundation. The former has a distinct horror survival vibe and shows the FBC's involvement with the Alan Wake incident. It's creepy and tense. The Foundation delves into the roots of the Old House and the fates of certain characters. It has a 3D-platformer feel but is fun content as well. Both AWE and Foundation feature difficult damage-sponge boss fights, but up to those battles, I enjoyed both campaigns. \n\nThe visuals and sounds are both pretty decent, and I didn't notice any clipping or stuttering. The voice actress for Jesse (who I believe also did the motion-capture for the character's animation) does a pretty good job. I did run into bugs with some of the Foundation DLC quests, such as key foes falling disappearing halfway through a fight, forcing me to restart the mission. Fortunately, this only happened twice.\n\nAll of the Steam achievements are reachable and none can be missed, as the player can continue rampaging through the Old House for as long as they want after finishing the stories and DLCs. Reaching one-hundred percent will take quite a bit of grinding and exploring.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this one. It's challenging, interesting, and most of all, fun. Would recommend to any fans of third-person shooters or paranormal thrillers.\n\nPros\n- Challenging combat\n- Immersive lore and story\n- Good DLC content\n\nCons\n- Infuriating load times\n- Difficulty will frustrate some players\n\nFinal Score: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1696858770, "timestamp_updated": 1696858770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629130542278289795", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147923876": {"recommendationid": "147923876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172738925", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "playtime_at_review": 2696, "last_played": 1700335676}, "language": "english", "review": "This game surpasses Quantum Break as my favorite played Remedy game, mainly because of all the additional sidequesting one can do post-end game. But there are other reasons that I love this game to smithereens. \n\nI always found the concept of SCP to be fascinating, but could never find myself getting into those games because they focused more on the horror and not so much the story or combat. With Control, however, I felt connected to the story and became very invested in learning more about the Objects of Power and the AWEs that often involve them. I even love how they tie the OoP's to Jesse gaining more abilities, which felt like a natural progression and not something that comes on suddenly (ie. suddenly she can do more powers!, but instead, she has to go through a trial to gain the skill, which often involved 'cleansing' the object from its corruption). \n\nMy only gripe with the upgrades is that some are built into the story line (the TV as an example, the one that lets you levitate) while the other ones (the safe and the X-ray machine) are not. This can make it confusing for a player who isn't actively aware that cleansing those objects will grant upgrades, and without them, it can make it harder to progress in the game. \n\nI find myself still theorizing about certain aspects of the game even after completion of base game and the two DLCs. I admire the connection to Alan Wake (in base game too, not just the DLC), but I wish Quantum Break got some love within the game too, especially knowing that all three Remedy games are in the same universe. I'm excited to see where Control 2 will take us, specifically concerning Dylan's future as he is in a coma at the end of the game, and given that they've already demonstrated that they can add more areas to the Oldest House beyond just the standard floors.

However, there are two major issues I have with the game; controls and saving.\n\n[h2] Controls [/h2]\nI purchased this game quite a few years after it's release and the control feeling is, in my opinion, similar to Resident Evil 4 Remake. Character movement is portrayed very realistically but this is detrimental to the controls. I think it's more of an issue with Control as there is no difficulty selection. For some elaboration, the main character has \"momentum\" when they move so when you're running and then stop, you don't come to a dead stop, you slow down, then stop. Same with weapon handling; the weapon is raised and then fired. After some idle time, the character drops the weapon. What makes this frustrating is there's some weapons that do not fire repeatedly such as the rocket gun. For some reason, after firing a shot from the rocket gun, the character won't fire again until after the character goes into the idle weapon animation. The rocket gun shoots slow already but not being able to at least maintain the shooting animation for the gun is down right ridiculous. The same issue is present for the shotgun.\n\nUnfortunately, with games like Control and RE4R, the realistic animations and character movements severely hinder the game to the point where it makes it down right frustrating. As I previously mentioned, it's not so much a problem on RE4R as there are different difficulty levels. With Control, it's a major issue as there is no difficulty selection. I'm at the part of the game where you use levitation to get to an area where you fight an anomaly that shoots clocks and this was honestly the part of the game where I'm losing interest. The weapon handling makes this fight extremely frustrating and the controls don't help, either. The previous boss fight with the security leader to get levitation was also frustrating due to the issues mentioned. It's really unfortunate because I've enjoyed the game (mostly) up to this point. \n\n[h2] Saving [/h2]\nNo checkpoints and no ability to manually save is a bad decision in this type of game. It kinda makes sense in Elden Ring but makes absolutely no sense in Control. The only way the game saves, as far as I can tell, is when you get to a marked location (game also mentions this is the way it saves). Terrible decision on the developer's part. I've lost 30 minute progress a couple times and it's not fun re-doing areas.

Some scenes were terrific (the maze one especially), art style and atmosphere were perfect. As you can see, graphics were also good. However, there are a lot of things that I did not like. First of all, the story, it wasn\u2019t great, it did not answer any of the questions and there were overwhelming about of collectibles which did not add much to the story. The characters weren\u2019t really that strong, also, only Ahti was an interesting character. Still, the story isn\u2019t that bad; if you like the SCP stories, it could be interesting for you but these kinds of stories give me a sour taste for the most part. The real problem was the gameplay. It was a bit unbalanced, you can only select two weapons at the same time, most of the weapon upgrades are useless and there are a lot that you can find, enemy variety wasn\u2019t great, soul system and constant respawns were annoying while repeatable quests were unnecessary, at the end I had a lot of souls which I cannot even use, there were no chance for me to buy the materials (mold ones were near impossible, after the related quest). By the way, I am the director, why do I need to find a keycard to access some areas? Just get the highest one from an employee.\nFoundations DLC was pretty much same with the main game. It adds a couple hours of playtime, a new area, it felt like a teaser for second game. It was a huge negative for me to not being able to use the new skills at other places, ally rangers\u2019 AI and Jesse not even commenting about her fight with Former before. Other than that, new weapon upgrades were worse than the original ones and enemies felt like bullet sponges. The second expansion is similar to the first one for its features, except there is a boss which is a bit annoying at the end. Of course, except three certain upgrades, weapon upgrades are much worse and enemies have much more health. At least it adds one new enemy type and a new weapon mode.\n", "timestamp_created": 1696646367, "timestamp_updated": 1696646367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147775818": {"recommendationid": "147775818", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965257831", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1196, "last_played": 1697235033}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fun.

The environments the game puts you in are spectacular\n+ Bass boosted sound design, powers and special effect sound crunchy as hell\n+ Soundtrack is pretty good. It's a lot of atmospheric stuff, mixed with some rock/metal\n+ Realistic facial expressions during cutscenes. Bethesda should take notes\n+ Fleshed out lore. All the good parts of SCP and none of the cringe\n+ Deep narrative, though admittedly thin on character development\n+ Character customization in three forms, mods, weapon loadout, skill trees\n+ Visual customization, outfits to unlock in-game\n+ Puzzles littered throughout the quests and the exploration within the Bureau are challenging yet solvable\n+ Fun boss fights, not too hard which is good for a general audience\n+ Combat is engaging, and at times pretty challenging\n+ Controls are very intuitive. Despite how many powers you have, it's pretty easy to remember all of them\n+ Numerous build options to match your playstyle\n+ Tons of secrets, collectibles and hidden locations to uncover\n+ Decent amount of replayable content post-main story\n+ No microtransactions\n\n[h1]Nitpicks:[/h1]\n- It's a little annoying that so much luck is involved in the gearing process, especially for a single-player game\n- Enemies respawning in the Oldest House is a bit too random. It makes running countermeasures tedious at times\n- There are quite a number of garbage mods in the loot table. Who on earth is gonna equip \"Gain energy when hit by Hiss Charged\" (ONE of the many enemy types), when you can just equip \"Energy regeneration +55%\"\n- Low diversity in enemies. There are indeed a number of enemies the game throws at you, but it reuses them in the most overt ways. Most minibosses are just regular enemies with higher stats, and no special moves\n- Some things are just weirdly designed. For example, I've finished the game and can craft Tier 6 weapon mods (Infinite) as well as Tier 4 (Prime), but not Tier 5 (Absolute). Why? I can craft Tier 4-6 personal mods but for some reason Tier 5 weapon is missing no matter how many times I reroll the options. Forums seems to agree that this isn't a bug, so I'm lost here\n- Build diversity is alright, but balance is kinda bad. Shatter/Surge are ridiculously weak compared to the alternatives, and for most of the game nothing beats Launch\n- The map is oftentimes quite confusing. A lot of these environments are pretty vertical, and the map doesn't distinguish between floors very well\n- It's very possible to run into a situation where you can't unlock level 3 of your chosen weapon, because the unlock is tied to gaining a specific crafting material at a specific time. This is a somewhat odd system, though I personally did not run into this problem myself\n\n[h1]Overall: 9/10[/h1]\nAs always, my nitpicks don't carry much weight here. The game does so much well, that it's easy to overlook the stuff it does badly.

I played with all the ray-trace options turned on, and frankly those were not that impressive. Seeing your reflection on glasses didn\u2019t add much to the game, and especially in the Alan Wake DLC light handling wasn\u2019t that much superior compared to games before the ray-tracing era. While I wasn\u2019t impressed by the ray-tracing, the morphing environment was clearly the highlight of the game for me. Few games do such things at this level, I can remember only DMC Devil May Cry having a similarly playful approach to reality distortion.\n\nThe voice acting of the game was top-notch. There will be a lot of spoken parts. Some will have only fragments played in the game environment, for the full media you will have to watch through the media files unlocked in parallel. Two-three segments will have their own action music, but quite a lot there will be instead a \u201cchanting\u201d in the background. During generic fights there will be a fight theme playing, with slower pace when you get more distant from the spawned enemies. When that theme stops, the fight waves are over, and you can explore the environment safely. However, random encounters might (re)spawn eventually even in cleared zones.\n\nThe map system is different from most games in the sense that the global map is there only to give some broad sense of direction, like based on your current location you should head broadly northward. To actually navigate the labyrinthine building, you will have to read the markings on the walls and follow them. At some more obscure cases the path to continue is marked with yellow carpets, and then usually flying will be required. Navigating the building would be a nightmare on foot, the fast travel between unlocked nodes will help a lot, like when you have to return from one extreme of the building to the executives (roughly the main base). Not just because the labyrinthine system, but because enemies are respawning randomly in already visited places too, and fighting through them was just an unnecessary time waste for me.\n\nThe enemy encounters are hard, mostly because of the huge number of enemies to deal with. It doesn\u2019t help that even some common enemies can practically one-hit kill you. After experiencing the difficulty early on, I just switched on invulnerability, and played the whole game with it. Virtually any enemy engagement resulted in me \u201cdying\u201d, that is reaching 0 health and having a prominently red tinted window. Replaying those encounters again and again just to get through them would have been very annoying, as the base game has a heavy \u201cgit gud\u201d attitude. Instead relying on invulnerability as a crutch, an easy mode with a noticeably reduced enemy count would have made the game more enjoyable for me, as the dragging on and on enemy encounters detracted a lot from enjoyment. With no incentive to figure out effective ways to deal with different enemies, I just ineptly brute forced my way through harder the fighting parts.\n\nThe inventory system is very bad. There are only a limited amount of storage for weapon and personal mods. If it gets full, you will have to erase an item before a new one can picked up. With the DLCs there will be easily more variety of weapon mods than storage available. I had to delete even tier V items to make room for the random new drops. This incessant micro management was a bad design, there should have been enough room for at least 2 for each mod types. Always able to preserve the two best of a type, with 2-3 spare slots would have been a nice addition.\n\nThere is an upgrade system for weapons and for personal mods. Don\u2019t make the mistake I made, focusing on upgrading first the personal mods. That was meant for endgame grind content, and I think will use up rare materials, locking you out from the weapon unlocks/upgrades. I certainly missed out on some weapon upgrades. Just focus on unlocking all weapons, and upgrading them, since upgrading will increase their meager damage \u2013 a bit. The talent tree can be unlocked with skill points. As far as I have seen, only mission completion will grant skill points, so you should do as many main and side missions as possible. Not sure if the repeatable missions yield skill points, as I just tended to ignore those. Finishing the game with most side missions and both DLCs allowed me to fully unlock 4 branches out of 7 (roughly in the order of energy, launch, shield, health), with 0 investment in the rest.\n\nDuring combat you can use paranormal skills and weapons. Fully upgraded launch was much more powerful than any of my weapons. Even fully upgraded those weapons will deal quite a low damage compared to weapons in other games. For a long time I ignored shatter (the shotgun one), but later found out that it is quite good even at mid-range, and great against nearby floating enemies.\n\nThe Alan Wake DLC will start automatically after mission 7. If you decide to enter it, a new section of the house will open up for exploration. This set has a new mechanism based on darkness, and fighting it off with light sources. The enemies will still be standard hiss entities, only the boss will be subject to this new mechanism. But several static corruption will have to be cleaned by shining light on them, in order to navigate through the zone. Also there will be several places mostly in darkness, where you can use lamps to navigate the environment.\n\nThe Foundation DLC will be unlocked after finishing the base game. Finishing the game will put you back in the Bureau, to grind freely the content. The Foundation starting mission will appear at that moment in your mission list. A choice will be eventually presented, to unlock a new ability for your weapon out of two possibilities. It will matter only inside the DLC. Neither one is explained, I chose the right side one, and was happy with the destruction approach. Eventually the other one is received too. Out of the two DLCs I enjoyed this much more than the Alan Wake one. It feels like a nice reward level after finishing the main game.\n\nThere are a few challenge mini-games to play. One is the jukebox, where 4 segments have to be finished in a given time. Another one is the Shum arcades. One is for a wave attack survival, the other one is for boss encounters. Speaking of boss encounters, I finished the game and still missed out on several encounters, clearly shown by my missing achievements for them. I have seen unexplored areas on the map, but no amount of exploring around them revealed the entrance to them. Eventually I just gave up on entering them.\n\nThe game mostly relies on autosaves. If you see a save icon in the lower right corner, you can assume that after exiting the game it will be continued from there. But I liked to rely more on the explicit save triggered by me. If you interact with a control point, the game will be saved there. If possible, I chose to exit after interacting with a save point. Sometimes when I progressed without reaching a control point, and with no intention/possibility for tracking back to a previous control point, I just exited hoping for the best.\n\nThe game can be played with keyboard & mouse or with a controller. Since there was aiming in this game, I chose to play it through with keyboard & mouse.\n\nI played the game with 2 mods. One removed most of the intro movies, the other one replaced most LUTs with the neutral one. Only one comparison picture was available on nexusmods, but that convinced me to use the neutral LUTs.\n\nI liked Alan Wake and Quantum break, but in the near future there is only Alan Wake 2 to look for from Remedy \u2013 if /when it will be available on Steam.\n\nThe game was stable, it didn\u2019t crash on me.", "timestamp_created": 1696268823, "timestamp_updated": 1696268823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "147490522": {"recommendationid": "147490522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893483535", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 691, "last_played": 1696234069}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game primarily because I thought it looked cool visually, and I must say it more than delivers on that end.

Actually, it's a good third-person action adventure game with a map that encourages you to explore as you gain new abilities and keys. If you're on board to really explore this game's world and take in the lore then this game might be for you.\n\n[h2]The Game[/h2]\nI held on to the hope that Control would introduce new mechanics, abilities, and enemies that would force me to learn how to mix psychic powers with fps gameplay. You get the ability early on to take any object in the room, levitate it with your mind, and launch it into an enemy with an auto-aim crosshair. This option is busted for the beginning hours of the game, but its power comes not only from pure damage but also from enemies being helpless to counter your launch projectiles. I'd normally let something like this slide for a few hours and give a game some time to build up toward offering a challenge.\n\nI wasn't convinced that the game wasn't going to stop pulling its punches. The variety of enemy encounters in this game is weak, and the enemy AI is similar to setting a regular fps to easy or normal difficulty. Enemies will stare at you and occasionally let out an attack that might hit you if you're standing still. Some time needed to be spent re-examining the design of the combat in this game.\n\n[h2]Everything else[/h2]\nI'm making the game sound worse than how it feels to play. I have to commend the game for being slick and having excellent control. Everything is smooth, seamless, and paced very well. I'm not even going to get into how gorgeous the game is, but there's a lot to appreciate in all of the cutscenes and scenery. All in all- I'd have an awesome time with all of this fast-paced action if the combat just had more decision-making and strategy behind it.", "timestamp_created": 1695578252, "timestamp_updated": 1695578252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146947759": {"recommendationid": "146947759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355454204", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1134, "last_played": 1696784415}, "language": "english", "review": "CONTROL", "timestamp_created": 1695575178, "timestamp_updated": 1696344738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146945545": {"recommendationid": "146945545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037433877", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1655, "last_played": 1697428694}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome graphics and gameplay.

James McCaffrey's Max Payne-esque monologues (Hotlines)\n\nGameplay \n1. Pacing is much more laid back so you have time to explore or sight-see\n2. Much more manageable special skills\n3. Controls are much simpler and responsive (my biggest gripe with QB)\n4. No more taking away controls of the player's movements (with unnecessary animations or sudden change of pace)\n5. Timings between waves of enemies are well spaced-out to avoid feeling overwhelmed and rage quitting\n6. Collectibles are much more succinct and enjoyable to read, and no longer break the pacing of the game should you decide to read them on the spot\n\nMisc\n1. Runs smoother on PC compared to QB\n2. More replayability due to side missions, random (timed) Bureau Alerts, and DLCs\n3. Download size is quite reasonable\n4.

I got it from the Humble Choice March 2021 bundle, and the publisher decided to only grant standard edition as a hidden depot id 870782 (see steamdb.info) despite the player facing name saying \"Ultimate Edition\".  Publisher also took $10 million to make it an Epic exclusive for the first year on PC.\nSo why should I still recommend it?\nI personally enjoyed it just as much or more than Quantum Break because it took abilities, environmental destruction, and SCP-like sci-fi to a new level.  It also has more replayability because of optional side missions, additional challenges, and exploration.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys SCP-like sci-fi with horror elements and can appreciate third person action that happens along the way.  I would say that documents throughout the game tell just as much or a bit more of the story as different character interactions or dialog.  Hardcore fans of third person action may think the action gets somewhat repetitive in the late game, though the game does try to mix it up with the many different powers & weapons that the player character receives & builds (respectively) over time.  Download the game's unofficial patch from pcgamingwiki in order to get various enhancements & fixes including the most recent version of DLSS compatable with the game.\nHere is what else you should know about the game:\n+There are a decent number of main missions and side quests, where the latter sometimes reveal during main missions and revealing others require exploration first.\n+Good soundtrack, spoken dialog, and general audio, though sounds from creatures & guns could be more varied.\n+Environmetal destruction & weaponization was incredible, along with great player abilities to unlock, though...\n-Gun play can seem repetitive in mid to late game. By then you should be using just as many or more abilities than guns though, given the damage buffs available for throwing stuff.\n?Some of the floating head dialog or visions from two main characters could've been visualized better.\n?Some of the different resources for building gun types & upgrades tend to come from different areas, but you have to figure that out or look it up on a wiki. Naturally playing through the game resulted in me building half or most of the gun upgrades, and all but one gun type.\n?The map overlay is mostly helpful, though there are some mapped areas that are more obtuse when multiple levels are at play in the same area.

A lot of the concepts has a one-to-one correlation with concepts in the SCP universe: The Federal Bureau of Control is the SCP Foundation, Objects Of Power are SCPs, etc. The writers have put in a lot of effort to make the universe seem much wider than the claustrophobic corridors of the building you spend the entire game in. I found the game to be much more enjoyable if you read any notes you come across.\n\nThe game also takes a lot of inspiration from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, though Alan Wake was the first game from Remedy to take influence from it. Themes of alternate dimensions, warped realities and enigmatic characters give credence to this fact. The game also ties the Alan Wake universe to itself with references to the events of Alan Wake in some notes in the base game plus one whole DLC dedicated to the events in Bright Falls.\n\nGameplaywise, the game has the usual, run and shoot mechanics, but also allows you to use various powers to aid in combat. You can lift and throw objects while waiting for your weapon to reload, or levitate high up in the air or dash to avoid attacks. However, this game is not quite as casual since some of the more challenging boss fights will test your skill in using all of your available powers.\n\nThe game is chock full of content with the base game taking upwards of 20 hours (if you also explore for notes and collectables) doing the main missions and side quests. Plus there are two story DLCs that take around 20 hours more to complete for a patient gamer.\n\nTech wise, I played with ray tracing on on a Radeon 6800xt and found that the framerate hovers between 50-70 FPS on average, with framerates dropping to the 30s in some areas. Using FSR (on Linux with Proton), I was able to get 60-100 FPS easily, though I never found the frame drops to be a hindrance at any point in the game.\n\nOverall, the game was a pretty enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1694339349, "timestamp_updated": 1694339349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513241052627563477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146036613": {"recommendationid": "146036613", "author": {"steamid": "76561199016357740", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1449, "last_played": 1694310775}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]What happens if David Lynch & Stanley Kubrick made a video game 9/10 [/h1]\n\nI very wish I played this sooner\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n-Art Direction\n-Interesting storytelling?\n-setting/lore\n-chaotic gameplay and it's really fun\n-Metroidvania style maps\n-replay value\n-[spoiler]Alan Wake and Control are connected in the same universe[/spoiler]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n-when you find audio recordings you have stay near by the tape recorder to listen or go back in the menu and listen again (Remedy should've copy what Bioshock did, let the player keep moving and playing the game while listening)\n-there is mini mission like \"kill 10 hiss/enemies with _____\" while in combat you'll get annoying progress boxes or text while you're in a firefight (just wish the boxes/text were smaller or more transparent)", "timestamp_created": 1694330648, "timestamp_updated": 1694330648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145997609": {"recommendationid": "145997609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348571620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 859, "last_played": 1694547182}, "language": "english", "review": "GREAT", "timestamp_created": 1694280806, "timestamp_updated": 1694280806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145987038": {"recommendationid": "145987038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065678159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1665, "last_played": 1694210200}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games!", "timestamp_created": 1694270726, "timestamp_updated": 1694270726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145983723": {"recommendationid": "145983723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012023582", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 184, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 734, "last_played": 1694216941}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring, soulless, cringe", "timestamp_created": 1694267659, "timestamp_updated": 1694267659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381163924932479858", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145979106": {"recommendationid": "145979106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972456508", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1782, "last_played": 1694263078}, "language": "english", "review": "yep", "timestamp_created": 1694263143, "timestamp_updated": 1694263143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145972481": {"recommendationid": "145972481", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967418232", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1636844475}, "language": "english", "review": "It is visually intriguing, good for making screenshots and... that`s it for me.

Now FINALLY I completed it and unfortunately won't play it again.\n\nLove especially for Ahti the Janitor and the Twin Peaks vibes, but action-gameplay just ruins it for me.\n\nSolid 7/10 still, but would not recommend it.....", "timestamp_created": 1693937533, "timestamp_updated": 1693937533, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531214654445648193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145713905": {"recommendationid": "145713905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027288602", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1154, "last_played": 1693935208}, "language": "english", "review": "it's cool, ends a little abruptly and leaves some things dangling but it's a neat setting and the combat and puzzles are just meaty enough not to get too boring too quickly.", "timestamp_created": 1693927701, "timestamp_updated": 1693927701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145706540": {"recommendationid": "145706540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042583414", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 275, "playtime_at_review": 2370, "last_played": 1699805809}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is good", "timestamp_created": 1693918472, "timestamp_updated": 1693918472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145687017": {"recommendationid": "145687017", "author": {"steamid": "76561199237589434", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2446, "last_played": 1695578281}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1693879488, "timestamp_updated": 1693879488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145685854": {"recommendationid": "145685854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051819874", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1697092939}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1693877495, "timestamp_updated": 1693877495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145685315": {"recommendationid": "145685315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115563627", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3396, "last_played": 1693265569}, "language": "english", "review": "So, a couple of days ago, I've finished the game. I have a couple of things to say about the game, so, here we go.\n\n[h1] Sound design [/h1]\n\nSimply beautiful, good sound design. The soundtrack is a bit lacking, but it can be good in certain parts of the game. Still, the sound design of Hiss will be the most memorable thing about this game.\n\n[h1] Graphical and art design [/h1]\n\nEven tho the game is a couple of years old, it still looks really good. The graphics themselves are really great even on minimal settings, and the game is optimized in such a great way that this game looks and plays really great even on a trash PC like mine. \nAs for the art design, that is also really great, and it really makes you feel sort of unsettled, but also wondering about what's going to be around the corner.\n\n[h1] Level design [/h1]\n\nLevel design is great, there are lots of nooks and crannies and secret hallways and places you can discover. The level design facilitates exploration, but also allows for a seamless indoors open world. Well, sort of.\nThe problem with the level design is that it is still, very linear, even for a semi-open world game. This is most noticeable in the Alan Wake expansion, where it's pretty much just three long hallways with a boss fight at the end of each one, followed by the final boss fight. SPEAKING OF WHICH-\n\n[h1] Guns, fighting, enemies, bosses [/h1]\n\nThis is probably one of, if not the best weapon system I've ever had the pleasure to interact with. Your \"mag\" automatically recovers ammo if you stop shooting, however, you can \"run out of bullets\" if you don't take a break from shooting.\nThe fighting itself happens on two fronts- with your gun, and with your abilities. Which is good, you can mix and match to find out your personal favorite weapon modes and perks for different situations.\nThe enemies are sort of stereotypical, but most of them feel original. They are all fun to fight, BESIDES THE ONES THAT RUN UP TO YOU TO EXPLODE, THEY FUCKING SUCK DICK. \nAs for the bossfights, this is the most fun I've had with bossfights in the last couple of years. Imaginative, comprehensible, little to no trial and error, straightforward, \n\n[h1] XP system, perks, weapon mods [/h1]\n\nI'm gonna be straight to the point here- it fucking sucks. It's terrible. Yeah, you can mix and match, but you will constantly have to remove the mods and perks because the game is more than generous with them. The biggest problem is that they are literally fucking everywhere, and only a couple of them are really viable, so you're going to spend about an hour of your total gameplay by just deleting the items. And if you want the best perks, you will have to constantly go out of your way to delete the stuff you don't want.\n\n[h1] Bonus content and DLCs [/h1]\nI've mentioned AWE DLC already, but here I go again. AWE was a good piece of content. \nThe Foundation was also really good, but it ended on a cliffhanger so massive that Mount Everest looks like a speedbump in comparison.\nToo many documents with too much stuff that has little to no significance. Read only what's necessary or tied to the story, and move on. You're not missing out on much. Trust me, I've spent like three or four fucking hours just reading in this game.\nExpeditions? Meh, I didn't care a single bit. Played it like twice, and never tried it again. For me, it's a boring horde mode.\n\n[h1] Lore and story [/h1]\n\nLet me be clear, this game just outright stole from SCP. Let's not pretend like it was an original idea- The Board is a direct copy of O5 Council, Darling is a copy of Dr. Gears, The Oldest House is a ripoff of Site-19, and so on. They made it sort of original, but, there were also other influences. Still, SCP was the most notable one, and we should thank God, because if SCP was copyrighted, this would be a part of a gigantic copyright lawsuit.\n\nThe story itself is short. Like, just about six hours short. I legit spent 50 hours on just the side content and DLCs, and just 6 hours on the base game. I guess that's the reason why you can only buy Ultimate Edition, because it really adds a lot.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the story is the inability of the writers to finish any storyline properly. Everything, AND I MEAN EVERYTHING, ends on a cliffhanger. Yeah, they were setting up for a sequel, BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CLIFFHANGER, A SETUP FOR ANOTHER GAME, AND STRAIGHT UP NOT FINISHING YOUR FUCKING STORY. Let's hope Alan Wake 2 and the next Control game solve these issues, as they take place in the same universe.\n\n[h1] Navigation [/h1]\n\nThe level design might be great, but nothing will change the fact THAT THE MINIMAP IS NOT EVEN FUCKING FUNCTIONAL. HOLY FUCKING SHIT AND JESUS ON A FUCKING POGO STICK HOPPING ON TOP OF A GIMP'S BALLSACK, THEY NEVER FUCKING TESTED THAT SHIT. No hallway corresponds with the minimap, so sometimes when you get lost, YOU GET LOST BECAUSE THE MAP IS ABSOLUTE TRASH.\n\nAnother thing this game sucks at more than a pornstar during her oral exams in school is TELLING YOU WHERE THE FUCK YOU SHOULD GO, OR WHAT TO DO. The navigation in this game comes down to: \"Go to this sector and figure out how to do this by yourself, asshole.\". IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I ACTUALLY HAD SOME FUCKING ENVIRONMENTAL LEADS, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. Half Life 2 and L4D2 excell in this area- you have lights and level design telegraph to you where you should go and what you should do. This game does neither. It's FUCKING TERRIBLE, and whoever approved or worked on any of this should be legally prohibited from talking to any game devs and from entering a game dev studio. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay loop can get a bit annoying, you will be bombarded by notifications about invasions or raids or Hiss nodes or whatever the fuck, you will keep getting ambushed by Hiss behind every corner, and there will be a lot of stuff in your inventory you will never touch. There are too many documents to read, no environmental storytelling, and all stories end like premature ejaculation- it ends before it can start properly. The map is dogshit, and the game sucks at even giving you the slightest idea of where you should go next. The soundtrack is really non-existent, or really forgettable.\n \nHowever, you WILL enjoy this game, even with it's many flaws. The exploration is the most rewarding thing about this game, and disregarding the mission objective is the best idea you can have in this game. The movement and the gunplay rocks, the fights are great, the game controls well, and the optimization is really good. \n\n[h1] FINAL CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nIt's like dragging your balls through a mile of glass shards and salt just to be able to spend a no holds barred weekend with Sasha Grey. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1693876613, "timestamp_updated": 1693876613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145674060": {"recommendationid": "145674060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309033794", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1736, "last_played": 1689619671}, "language": "english", "review": "In my opinion, a must-play title.

Add on top of that extraterrestrial locations and enemy designs and you get the game you will nerver forget at least in terms of visuals. \n\nGameplay was good as well. You get 6 weapons forms (which are essentially are just weapon archetypes we all know just in one gun) and a few paranatural abilities. Arsenal may sounds low in quantity but it is plenty considering the run time of the game. Not gonna lie, closer to 50 hours mark I began to avoid fights as I was bored with repeating nature of them. Sure there are many different weapon and personal upgrade mods, but not all of them made sense, some were extremely situational and a few of them I used pretty much during whole my playthrough. Also just 3 slots for upgrade mods felt limited as at the same time you could only invest in empowering either in one (fully) or two (60/40) abilities. For example you either dump all 3 mods improving shield parameters thus build your gameplay purely around using shield as much as possible, or you invest in one HP related mod and sparing rest 2 for another paranatural ability and same schematic goes for weapon upgrades as well. Once I found combinations comfortable for me i pretty much didnt change my tactics during whole game and why would I? You face the same enemies over and over again + the first Foundation dlc introduces new enemy type but you don't fight these new enemies in other areas.\n\nBut the biggest gripe for me was story and EXTREMELY HUGE amount of readable notes and audiologs. For a game with around 30-40 hours of runtime (including both DLCs) Control has a density of collectable notes and audilogs per square inch I have never seen in any other game before. One note doesnt even fully tell whole story it begins with, almost every note ends with sentence like \"Refer to yadayada page number bla bla to learn more information\" and I honestly didn't like it. Like I get it, game takes place in a bureau and in typical bureau fashion there are tons of paperwork which have connections to each other but I don't think it was this necessary to transfer this fashion into the game. Another negative point of these notes and logs are you NEED them if you want to understand the main plot even better and expand your knowledge beyond that game tells you when completing main missions BUT at the same time even AFTER you read all notes and listen to all logs you will still many unanswered questions. After completing the game I went to net to do some research as I thought it was my dumb brain which didn't see whole story and guess what I saw? Theories, theories and again, theories. Game has many loose ends, dialogues that leave more shade that answer questions and so on and I HATE movies/games with open endings gosh darn it. I really hope Remedy will release Control 2 at some point and finish the plotlines that left open and give answers to majority of question players may have after completing the game.\n\nDespite all of negative stuff I wrote, Control gets solid recommendation as main plot is interesting, makes you want more and you always can simply ignore ingame notes and read everything in right order in the net. Also a plus for me is that in the world where every second game must feature an open world structure with hundreads of required hours for full completion Control shines as a game that respects your time by not taking much of it and uses each minute it has to throw as much content as it can on you.

The story intrigues from the very beginning and the lore seems to be quite vast. \n\nThe visuals are simply stunning even though the game is 3 years old at this point. The visuals definitely help with the atmosphere which is mysterious and even creepy at times. Somehow even with all the progression of the character (which by the way is pretty well made), you don't feel safe at all exploring the bureau. What adds up to this feeling is the sound effects which are truly amazing provided you have a good headset. As for OST, it's not bad, but aside from the \"maze\" song, there's nothing outstanding.\n\nBut the two best aspects of the game are the gameplay and the bureau itself. The gameplay is easy to understand, but at the same time is pretty deep and fun. As for exploring the bureau, instead of just telling you that it's something very mysterious it just shows you. Every location and item evokes questions and feels unique and intriguing. \n\nThe only downside I see are DLCs.

For these very reasons I really like it. It's very engaging in this regard, because you're constantly asking yourself \"what the fuck is going on?\".  Without spoiling, initially Control tells the story of Jesse Faden who apparently is looking for her brother. Inside the \"Oldest House\" (an Object of Power itself) she quickly gets involved in all kinds of paranormal and weird shit, the Hiss. She becomes in fact the new director of the FBC (the Federal Bureau of Control) in the \"Oldest House\" and as such is tasked with all kinds of requests of the people she meets inside the FBC. Some of these characters are pretty interesting, especially Emily, Langston (his quest Fridge Duty is pretty funny) and Darling (though the latter mostly through video's). Voice acting is great, although I found the voice of the character Underhill very poor. Sounded undelivered most of the time with a fake British accent (like those Americans who try to sound British in bad sitcoms). Gameplay is an huge improvement over a game like Alan Wake. Although the storytelling of Alan Wake is perhaps a bit more focused, gameplay in Alan Wake is very simplistic and grows very stale during the game. Gameplay in Control is much more engaging. In a sense it can be a bit traditional, you have weapons like a pistol, shotgun, sniper weapon etc., however you also have psychic powers like Levitate (which lets you hover and move in the air for a couple of seconds) or Launch (as the name suggests, lets you throw things). Not the most original gameplay, but combining these elements is very fun. The destruction physics in this game are also pretty impressive, mostly when throwing things around. The DLC (The Foundation and AWE) is pretty good, albeit short. Foundation lets you continue the story after finishing the main game, underneath the \"Oldest House\". It gives a very satisfactory, according to some people better, end to the story overall. AWE (which stands for Altered World Event) makes story wise a connection with Alan Wake. For fans of Alan Wake this DLC is a must. Length and quest wise however, I found AWE a bit lacking compared to The Foundation. Still good, but could have been so much more! \n\nI'm not quite finished with the game on this moment of writing, but I did finish the console version of the Ultimate Edition on the Xbox Series X earlier this year. Obviously performance wise the PC version is better, the game runs consistently well. If your hardware allows it, I highly recommend playing the game with Ray Tracing on. Especially in 4K on a big screen, the experience is a night and day difference with playing the game without RT. I almost go as far to say that RT makes a much bigger difference than playing with or without HDR. Although I played with HDR on the Xbox, this was not native HDR, but auto-HDR. Auto-HDR works great in most games, but admittedly the effect can be rather crude in comparison to native HDR. Luckily for the PC version someone from Remedy took the time to make a HDR mod. This mod is for a couple of reasons better than using auto-HDR in Windows 11. Not only makes it HDR native to Control, but it also improves the quality of DLSS (which for most people is still required when using RT) and improves upon the already existing RT. For me the latter two make the biggest improvement in enjoying Control on PC. Reading this article of DF is highly recommended (or watching the video on YT): [url]https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-a-stealth-upgrade-for-control-on-pc-dramatically-improves-its-graphics[/url].   \n\nA couple of nitpicks, there is no new game plus. It would have been fun to replay the game with powers kept on a higher difficulty. Lack of a new game plus mode is even more annoying in my opinion, when considering the fact that some of the outfits you unlock during the game are unlocked nearing the end. Finishing the main story awards you with the outfit Director's Suit. What's the point? Although the DLC gives reason to continue playing (The Foundation can in fact only be started when the main story is finished), both expansions are not particularly long. It's of course nice to have expansions in the first place, but both dlc just add a couple of hours each. \n\nSpecs:\nGigabyte X670 GAMING X AX\nAMD Ryzen 7 7700X (4,5 Ghz - 5,4 Ghz)\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 16GB SUPRIM X\nCorsair Vengeance RGB 32GB DDR5-6000", "timestamp_created": 1693488049, "timestamp_updated": 1694980890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145370884": {"recommendationid": "145370884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009177506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3195, "last_played": 1694675175}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, I originally bought this just cause I knew it had ray tracing and I wanted to test my new machine out.

Go to room, enemies spawn, throw everything including the kitchen sink at them. Alan Wake, Quantum Brake and Max Payne all have the same DNA. But not every game needs to be a Ultrakill/Doom Eternal experience to be fun so I don't really know what the argument here is. \nGranted, I can see how it can get boring to people who want have a faster pace shoot at stuff experience, and find out that the game doesn't offer anything of that nature, but instead a more slow and methodical burn. \n2. This being the first game in the Remedy-verse to use RPG mechanics and upgrades for your gun that are based on RNG and what the level of your Astral Constructs is for better mods to drop. I think resource management in a game like this doesn't fit very well. It gives somewhat a Rogue-like/lite feel without the actual ballache of having to redo a level again because high level enemies gatekeep a part of the map. If game too hard just use Telekinesis.\n3. If you don't do the side missions and the DLC's its a short game even with all the backtracking. Totally not missing the beautifully crafted world and all the cool lore stuff. \n\nPRO's\n1. THE STORY IS THE REAL MEAT HERE, I would recommend taking your time with it and enjoying the ride. \nThink SCP but more tame and all the SCP's are household appliances that need the devil beaten outta them.\n2. Graphics are great, tho I don't really care much for them. I will admit that there is a certain itch being scratched when looking at beautifully ray traced liminal spaces.\n3. The music is fantastic, they did this game right.\n4. The gameplay ain't too bad even tho I went on about it getting boring and repetitive. its solid and there ain't any jank. \nHope you like exploring, because there is a lot of that, every part of the map has something hiding in it. Sometimes good sometimes bad stuff but that's the charm of an adventure, be mindful of the vending machines tho... they do bite! \n\n[b]In summery:[/b]\nIf you like great atmosphere, with a blend of mystery and horror and a thick story with the added bonus of living out your dream of trashing an extra dimensional office complex full of monsters by introduce them to the concept of brain damage from blunt force trauma, then I would say welcome to New York and pick this game up.", "timestamp_created": 1693439469, "timestamp_updated": 1693439469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145346556": {"recommendationid": "145346556", "author": {"steamid": "76561199117671242", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 139, "last_played": 1694199246}, "language": "english", "review": "100%'d it on PS4, ready for round 2 on PC, one of the best games i've ever played in regards to visuals and concept.

Unfortunately, it lacks the mark of a truly good videogame: Good gameplay.\n\nThere is nothing worth upgrading other than telekinesis, except your energy pool (for more telekinesis). Every boss-and I mean EVERY boss-can be defeated by some combination of running/flying in circles, hiding behind cover until your everything finishes recharging and shooting/launching wildly in their general direction. Dealing with every boss-and again, I do mean EVERY boss-in melee is also tantamount to suicide,  as is the case with many enemies. Whether you want to focus on aerial slams,  shield charging or melee attacks-any time spent not constantly moving and making distance is time putting you at serious risk of being ganked by some random Hiss mook sneaking up on you. \n\nAnd frankly, telekinesis is just...better than all the other attack options.  I screwed up my gun upgrades and barely noticed for one simple reason: Telekinesis mogs shields (which many enemies have) and the gun doesn't. Telekinesis is also much, much easier to upgrade direct damage for whereas you need both the right materials plus a decent amount of luck to both find and equip damage for the gun (with a few high end exceptions, there is NOTHING that offers the gun more than direct damage boosts). Also, if you're looking for a test of pure combat reflexes prepare to be frustrated by a cavalcade of puzzles demanding abstract reasoning/looking up game guides.

Remedy Entertainment's magnum opus is a triumphant convergence of storytelling, innovation, and game-play, culminating in an experience that defies the boundaries of traditional gaming norms.\n\nThe visual artistry in \"Control Ultimate Edition\" is a canvas that blurs the lines between reality and the surreal. The Oldest House, a brutalist skyscraper housing the Federal Bureau of Control, is an architectural masterpiece that adapts and morphs, twisting into new forms and configurations that keep you perpetually in awe. The meticulous attention to detail in the environment design, from the intricate patterns on the walls to the hauntingly beautiful shifting dimensions, is nothing short of breathtaking. Each frame is a testament to the developers' dedication to their craft, inviting players to lose themselves in a world that constantly challenges their perceptions.\n\n\"Control Ultimate Edition's\" narrative is an enigmatic tapestry woven with threads of intrigue, mystery, and the uncanny. Stepping into the shoes of Jesse Faden, the newly appointed Director of the Bureau, players are thrust into a story that's part government conspiracy, part cosmic horror. The narrative unfolds like a gripping psychological thriller, laced with metaphysical enigmas that keep you engaged, questioning, and eagerly yearning for more. The voice acting is impeccable, with Courtney Hope's portrayal of Jesse Faden injecting the character with depth and authenticity that makes her journey even more relatable.\n\nIn the realm of game-play, \"Control Ultimate Edition\" dances on the precipice of ingenuity. The telekinetic abilities at Jesse's disposal are not just tools; they are instruments of exhilarating chaos. The combat system ingeniously melds traditional gun-play with supernatural abilities, allowing you to manipulate objects, fling debris, and shield yourself using telekinesis. This seamless integration makes each encounter an orchestration of destruction and creativity. Whether it's conjuring shields out of thin air to repel enemy attacks or launching projectiles with a flick of the wrist, every moment of combat feels like a symphony, and you're the conductor.\n\n\"Control Ultimate Edition\" doesn't just captivate you with its combat; it beguiles your intellect with its intricate puzzles and non-linear exploration. The Oldest House is a labyrinth of secrets waiting to be unearthed, and as you delve deeper, you'll encounter puzzles that test your logic, spatial awareness, and lateral thinking. These challenges seamlessly blend into the narrative, enhancing the feeling of immersion and reinforcing the idea that you're navigating a world where nothing is as it seems.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Edition's\" inclusion of the base game and its expansions provides an even more comprehensive journey. The AWE and The Foundation expansions offer additional layers to the already multifaceted narrative, expanding the lore and introducing new mysteries to unravel. This edition isn't just an opportunity to experience Control; it's a chance to immerse yourself fully in the universe, to lose yourself in the ever-shifting corridors of the Bureau.\n\nOverall, \"Control Ultimate Edition\" is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its medium. It's not just a game; it's an experience, an odyssey through the realms of the mind and the uncharted territories of possibility. With its captivating visuals, mind-bending narrative, and game-play that empowers your every whim, \"Control Ultimate Edition\" is a testament to the power of creativity in gaming. Remedy Entertainment has crafted a symphony of the extraordinary, and players fortunate enough to undertake this journey will find themselves forever changed by the brilliance of Control's boundless imagination.", "timestamp_created": 1693176481, "timestamp_updated": 1693176481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145161629": {"recommendationid": "145161629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389044991", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 2492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1047, "last_played": 1693774388}, "language": "english", "review": "It's really cool!\ngetting lost in the Bureau reminds me of the backrooms meme with the endless empty office space.

I could go on and on about the minutia of this game; however, to make this short and sweet: The entire atmosphere of this game is for lack of a better word, INCREDIBLE. The way the story is driven not only through direct narrative and dialogue, but through world building and atmosphere is just masterful. Graphically Control is a beautiful thing, effects and level design are strong. My one gripe (if you can call it one) is that the game play can get stale at times but that just usually means you are not using everything you are given to mix up the way you play. If you love single player story driven games you need to play this. If you're a seasoned PC player you'll have a blast, if you're new to PC gaming; Control will make you better at it.

Think again, trapped inside an ever-shifting building you navigate through twisted corridors, tilted offices, upside down walls, all the while dodging super-powered enemy zombies as you slowly uncover the mysteries of the place you're trapped in.\nThe gameplay is fast paced and keeps you on your toes for most of the time and the level design allows for a fun experience with loads of movable objects that interact and react during combat. The hidden secrets are so well hidden that for once, it feels rewarding to find them on your own and unashamed to look up the ones that you couldn't get.\nThe graphics are great and ray tracing enhances the visuals greatly. that being said there are still a few bugs related to the graphics which fortunately are not game breaking. however, if your tectures won't load correctly, i definitely recommend switching up your in-game graphics settings till all the details are visible in-game. This is critical to the immersion of the game and can be important for certain missions as well.\nThe side quests do not feel out of place at all and instead provide a more immersive experience into the game's lore.\n\nThe atmosphere, the visuals, the plot, the gameplay and the level design are some of the best selling points for this game.\nThe character writing could have been better but I find it average at the moment. It isn't bad and some characters definitely do a better job at delivering the lines than others. \n\nThe DLCs were also a fun experience with the Foundations DLC expanding on the base game lore a lot and the AWE DLC adding a new exploration and puzzle mechanic of sorts to the game. The DLCs are definitely worth trying out, especially for the fans of the Alan Wake game series.\n\nOverall this game is not too long clocking in at around 50 hrs for the base game with all the unlockable stuff at max.\n\n[b]I'd rate this game a solid 8.8/10[/b] using no logical rating scale and instead a more instinct based rating.

It's so g0d d@mn dark. I tried to adjust multiple settings and you can't see any better in many many locations. If you adjust the brightness, it just puts a white haze over the screen. It doesn't adjust the brightness in the actual surroundings. I have no flashlight for dark areas? Wow...My eyes don't adjust to dark areas as you enter them? \nYour aim is REALLY bad in this. I turned on the aim assist and then just used a wemod trainer for infinite health and better aiming because it was just no fun to play. Enemies hit you REALLY easily no matter how much you zig zag. \nNo point in crouching down and sneaking. The enemies see you no matter what you do once you get anywhere near them (even if you're behind walls, desks etc). \nMost of the items it tells you to pick up using the \"F\" key are useless info like some stupid bill from a travel claim? What does that have to do with the plot? So every single time you pick ANYTHING up, you have to press 'G\" to go to the inventory and look at what you picked up. Did you know there are games that let you read things as soon as you pick them up (they appear on the screen) and you decide if you want to keep them in your inventory or in a journal? Those games let YOU decide if it's important and you can just drop it or leave it? No? Maybe the devs should try playing games that DO so you see how it's done. \nI was told to go to the communications dept to find that red phone. Guess what? It's not accessible. It's literally sealed off. As I approached, there was no dialogue like, \"Maybe I should go through this other area and find an alt route\". You have no map telling you that you can go around. You have to just look for the only open area and get led along that way. It's 100% guess work where to go. The protagonist is supposed to KNOW this building. There are pictures of her on office walls like she's a employee of the year or something. But she doesn't have a arrow pointing her where to go or a map (in her mind) to use? Example: She could have dialogue where she says, \"The dept I need is down this hallway and up the stairs\". Nothing like this happens. You have to literally find signs pointing the way like you've never been there before. \nI really don't have much nice to say about it. In the past, games that incorporate live actors to shoot cut scenes don't do that great. They have their own following but don't get liked by a larger audience. I want fantasy, not reality in a video game. I guess it's cheaper to hire a unknown actor to shoot a scene than to pay a voice actor to voice a computer generated character who is more charismatic and enjoyable. (shrugs)\nI'll do an edited review after more playing. I don't foresee it getting better. \nIt's supposed to be an Ultimate edition but there are REALLY pixilated graphics in areas and unclear logos on the floor, walls etc. Like they spent way too much detail on the main character and not on the surrounding environment.

I went in not expecting much as the whole spooky/supernatural zombie/survival genre is not my thing, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how solid the story and characters felt. The plot and lore are very well designed and the collectibles therefore feel worth exploring for. The gunplay, overall controls (hehe) and mechanics were super crisp and smooth. The base game as well as the dlcs have a TON of well hidden secrets and areas and what not that work well conceptually and feel satisfying to find. Do NOT skip the side missions, they are a delightful experience, and in some cases quite important for getting access to certain abilities. Visually this game is a treat for the eyes, and uses ray-tracing really well, while performing without issue, except for maybe a minor glitch or two. However, a couple things definitely could have been implemented better, such as the map and inventory space. Due to the verticality and intricate environments, it was difficult to navigate using the map as it gives you a flat top down image and does not account for the multiple floors and areas. Inventory space is perfectly sufficient for the base game, but the DLCs bombard you with new unique mods, which forced me to clean out my inventory after almost every battle or two to keep space. As for the DLCs themselves, I enjoyed Foundation a lot more than AWE, as it delves more into the lore of the game, whereas in AWE, the \"plot\" was pretty non-existent, although it would be a lot more interesting for Alan Wake fans probably.

More like a reluctant compromise to acknowledge the amount of work that went in this game.\nObviously, I don\u2019t love it, so I\u2019ll just go through the aspects of the game, sharing pros and cons as I see them. \n\n1. Gameplay. Overall it\u2019s a third person shooter with very little platforming and a sprinkle of puzzles.\n\u2022 Pros: It\u2019s simple, flashy and doesn\u2019t go dull. The DLC\u2019s try to give you something new, they are inventive. Plenty of side-quests with good rewards.\n\u2022 Cons: There\u2019s not a lot of variety, and the balance is really poor. If you like to play effectively - you\u2019ll be forced to used same two weapons and two skills. Those that want to juggle weapons and skills, will be forced to play handicapped. Puzzles are elementary, and side-quests, with the exception of those from DLC\u2019s are boring and repetitive.\n\n2. Story. Not much to say about it - there's a plot (which isn't really insteresting), and there's background lore, which is better, but kind of silly.\n\u2022 Pros: Tons of lore, a lot of documents with detailed descriptions, with over 50 years of written history. If you\u2019re into that. Secondary characters aren\u2019t cardboard cutouts, there\u2019s very few of them, but most have strong personalities, and one even has a lot of real-life videos about him. This character is very charismatic and was perfectly casted for the role, I really loved all the bits with him.\n\u2022 Cons: Tons of lore and good support characters are usually the meat on the bones of a good story and charisma of protagonist and antagonist. A-a-and there\u2019s nothing like that. The plot had a big reveal at the end that changes nothing, and both protagonist and antagonist are bland and underdeveloped. There\u2019s a big mystery and the beginning, with payoff that isn\u2019t worth it. \n\n3. Visuals. The game looks great overall, with a slightly repetitive level design.\n\u2022 Pros: Plenty of destructible items, love the looks of protagonist, she was obviously 3D scanned from an actual actress, who has unique and beautiful face. Overall the game is very pleasant to look at as long as long as you have good PC.\n\u2022 Cons: most levels are monotonous office levels that get old really fast. There are enough unique areas from time to time, some of which has awesome design, but everything in between is boring. \n\n4. Performance. On a powerful PC with a modern GPU, FPS isn\u2019t a problem. I did, however, had a couple of crashes in Foundation DLC.\n\u2022 Pros: Even with a lot of object physics being calculated real-time, my FPS was always ~60, which is great. The textures are high-rez, and a lot of items has detailed, multi-stage destruction models.\n\u2022 Cons: I tried running it on powerful gaming laptop, and found that almost all textures take A LOT of time to fully load, making you play in a blurred ugly environment. Tweaking the settings did nothing.\n\nOverall the game is alright. It\u2019s a pretty mediocre and simple metroidvania, with a lot of polish and work put into it. Without this polish, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this game, but there\u2019s enough of it to leave a pleasant impression.", "timestamp_created": 1692389096, "timestamp_updated": 1692797429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442028999328613281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144496208": {"recommendationid": "144496208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096589697", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1428, "last_played": 1692372591}, "language": "english", "review": "Talking about subverting expectations", "timestamp_created": 1692373527, "timestamp_updated": 1692373527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144477951": {"recommendationid": "144477951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274896587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1215, "last_played": 1673669167}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting environments and I loved the Ashtray bit.

You can count them on one hand.\n- Some of the animations are goofy as fuck. Main character runs like she sh1t her pants.\n- The main character is the most mind-numbingly boring person in a video game I have experienced for a long time. To add insult to injury, the facial expressions are non-existant (the main character especially, her face is literally \ud83d\uddff at all times). \n- Some of the tutorial stages literally make no sense. I don't know if it's a bug or what, but the one with the hotline where they had invincible enemies simply said \"you can use the hotline to communicate with otherdimensional beings\" or some shit like that basically implying you can use the hotline as a way to get past the enemies, but apparently that's not the case. What was the point of the enemies? How do you use the hotline? Why would you use it?\n- Stupid af AI. So I just got the \"launch\" ability that allows you to take an object and throw it using some kind of telekinesis. After this I had to kill the first boss, but you literally can't use the launch ability to hit him as he dodges it instantly. What was the point of giving me the launch ability *before* the boss (who uses it himself)? Why not give it *after*?\n- Lacks small QoL features such as instantly opening up documents that have been picked up. You have to go into the menu and select the fucking thing every single time.\n- There is a Finnish person in the game.\n- I've had it crash once, but hopefully won't happen again.\n\n\nI know some of these things might seem minor to you and to be fair I haven't played that much, but everyone is looking for something different in a game as well as having different criteria for what makes a good game. For me the story can be 10/10, but if the gameplay is not good then it ruins the experience. It's a shame. \n\n\nI might finish the game but for now I can't recommend it.

The other half is there in the actual game but it can be fairly confusing to follow and lot also draws from the Alan Wake series so honestly I kind of gave up trying to understand it. \n\nAs far as gameplay goes, that's where a lot of fun comes from. You have this supernatural gun that shifts into different forms (shotgun, pistol, machine gun, etc) and can have only two forms equipped at a time. Where the real fun comes from is implementing these basic third person shooter mechanics with the supernatural powers you slowly gather. You can use telekinesis to throw things and form a shield, mind control, and even fly amongst other things. The way it all just flows together can make for an incredibly engaging experience.\n\nControl really is something unique and I am ultimately glad I found it on sale at some point because I vaguely remember this game even coming out.

Once you finally complete enough of these apprentice janitor tasks the Finish man goes on vacation and leaves you in charge.   Also there is a fun side plot to the cleaning where you become the leader of the Secret Government Group also know as the {insert word I can spell here} of Control because you found some dead guy who was the old leader and decided to steal his Smith n' Wesson. Also there is a red fog coming in from that family home video that you and your brother watched which is actually a portal to the Hazbin Hotel Dimension. You then discover {Character Name Here} is actually taken by the fog, and then he kills you. So you put him in a coma after you learn that even death does not stop the IRS and you still need to pay taxes.

I found it to be clean, consistent, and worthy of exploration.\n\nThe highlight of my experience was the Ashtray Maze sequence.  Really well designed and fun to play.\nThe game mechanics are also commendable.  I loved the simplicity of only offering half a dozen highly effective hand guns combined with the heavy impact of telekinetic powers.  I would like to see these same mechanics and ballistics used with different themes. \n\nHowever, with most games I start at a middle difficulty and will replay on increasing difficulty ultimately working towards mastery.  With Control, it simply wasn't compelling enough to want to master combat techniques.  I found myself decreasing difficulty just to see what's next. The enemies were annoying and repetitive to the point that a 1-shot auto kill was all the effort I cared to put forth.  I simply don't like random spawning enemies.  They should come from a location.  In fact, there's no enemy tracking at all. This is an element that also enhances stealth play, something that Control lacks.

The only thing that drags this game into the gutter, is the map. No custom way points. When given these \"time limits\" of 20 minutes to complete certain objectives, you will spend the first 15 minutes just trying to find a way to get where you need to go, making the map completely pointless. I'm not here to memorise the EXACT route to take from one point to another to make it \"in time\". Certain sections have badly placed fast travel markers and some sections don't have enough at all - they call it Fast Travel.....more like fast travel from one pointless area to another pointless area. As for the dust when enemies throw the multitude of both rockets and grenades at the same time, makes it a game of dodge the clouds of smoke/dust. Might as well play in a tornado. Game has some interesting ideas for puzzles. Facial animations needs some tweaking (sometimes it was like watching Gollum (Lord of the Rings) and both his eyes ready to burst. Dialog felt constrained and forced (like it was being read from cue-cards). Music was lacking in allot of places.....almost like the developers remembered at the last second to include some music. Jump and Levitate are loaded on the same keyboard button. Really?,,,,,want to jump?......you'll probably end up levitating instead and visa versa. As for Launch, I don't understand the difference between launching huge chucks of rock versus NOT being able to launch a single small tossed grenade. I need to actually implement an upgrade to my character for this purpose? Seize is only being used for the sheer fact of an achievement - this is how much its going to be used.......somewhat useless for the groups of enemies you will face. In simplicity, the game is about a 6.5 of 10.....get the game on sale and play to fill in the time.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nSo after completing the 2 DLC's, I would adjust the game to a 7.5 of 10, the DLC's are what the main game should have been from the start. The one thing that made me finish the entire game, were the collectables. Allot to be found and read.

Solid.\n\nFor the most part voice acting is good, not groundbreaking other than that, dialogues with entities is so weird and uncanny that every time we finish talking to them we end up with more questions than answers, such a unique aspect of the game that makes at least 50% of the experience.\n\n[h1]<%&&$ The Bad #$%$>[/h1]\n\nControl is not perfect, as much I love the concept and atmosphere, some or maybe all main characters feel as cold and distant as the Oldest Building, they are very one-dimensional, present only to offer information and ask for minor favors, other than that they are just there, giving the same repetitive sentence over and over once the dialogue options are spent, they don't offer much and remain at one place for the rest of the campaign. \n\nThere are real times events that involve fighting at certain parts of the building, you can ignore them if you wish, they offer mod drops and are somehow fun, the problem is that sometimes they are far away from your current position, going there is just a chore and it can get repetitive quickly, also the map doesn't have the best design, getting tangled over where you have to go following its directions is not fun, running around getting lost is quite easy, this is because the Oldest Building looks the same in many many areas. \n\nControl is so deep with lore that we can easily find ourselves swimming in a sea of information, there are dozens and dozens of files scattered all over the place that not many would read that you can miss lots of information regarding pretty much anything, secrets, the astral plane, powers, abilities, characters, astralnauts, creatures, you name it.\n\n[h1]<&%$$ Conclusion #$#%>[/h1]\n\nControl is an outstanding game, flawed but great nonetheless, its atmosphere, concept, its ties to Alan Wake and Quantum Break possibly adds to this universe of the unknown, the astral plane is such a brilliant concept to explore that offers limitless options, weird creatures with their own agendas, experiments with unforseen consequences, an atmosphere so thick you will constantly feel oppressed and watched, a must play.", "timestamp_created": 1691630266, "timestamp_updated": 1691630266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143729937": {"recommendationid": "143729937", "author": {"steamid": "76561199387205222", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1690827797}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0641\u0644\u0648\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0631\u062c\u0639", "timestamp_created": 1691601977, "timestamp_updated": 1691601977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439706861972808838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143697712": {"recommendationid": "143697712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108850287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1141, "last_played": 1692566112}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with cool powers, that's it.", "timestamp_created": 1691558357, "timestamp_updated": 1691558357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143696925": {"recommendationid": "143696925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992765202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3973, "last_played": 1691556483}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story and worldbuilding; the location design is interesting, well done, and it feels \"big.\"  I like how the game has you go back through earlier locations to discover new things; it keeps you curious.

I d give it a 7/10. Only recommend it on sale.\n\nStory is mysterious and intriguing, combat is fluent but other mechanics are not impressive.\n\nCombat feels good at first, but become a chore after some time when enemies are more or less the same. For unexplored area, the feeling of exploration can be fun but for established zones, there is simply no reason other than farming to fight these guys. Fighting feels kinda monotone after first part. \n\nEnemy spawn feels unpredictable. Sometime I would expect enemies in explored zone but no and other times they spawn constantly.\n\nTelekinesis needs more control. Half of the times I die without knowing what hit me with a very sudden onset. Another half of the times it is because I drag an explosive with telekinesis and it either got hit or hit a wall and exploded. The object that are pulled are not anywhere near my aim if I am not really aiming down sight. Most of the time it is from behind me or somewhere I cannot see. It got even worse after I upgraded the ability where She would just pull stone from the ground ignoring the heavy object in front of her.\n\nGathering crafting material is not easy when there the enemies are the same but dropping various things on different location. Some essential gameplay experience like various version of the service weapon should be easier to obtain without the need of sacrificing the opportunity to craft other things like mods and upgrades.\n\nBack tracking is annoying and somewhat unrewarding. Those clearance level locked rooms are a joke with no real rewards in there. Some can even get in without the clearance by breaking the glass make me wonder do the devs want to put rewards in them or not.\n\nSame applies to the side notes and documents. There are an excessive amount of reading material and most of them are simply garbage. They are either trivial or made trivial by erasing the key content on it with black rectangle. I cannot image working in an agency where all internal documents, inside the controlled area, with no imminent security crisis, have certain keywords on the document erased. Literally all or most of them because I did not finish the game. Just show the whole damn content and lock those key or valuable reading material in those useless clearance locked rooms!!!\n\nAbility points are not easy to get. As a casual player, I feels like it is only from the mission, which makes your progress tie to the story progression and it can be limiting.\n\nThose sudden onset, time-limiting alert mission are a nuisance and it does not fit the game. This is a story-driven game, why the mmo-rpg type event? It often drags me back when I want to explore a new area or not near a control point. Even worse is death ends the mission immediately and now you have wasted your time, your progress and with zero rewards. This is bad.\n\nAll in all, not a bad game but need more polish. I would need to see another game in the series, a franchise even.

I\u2019m barely marking as recommended with a very very heavy wait for sale warning and also you might despise it before it gets fun. Its not really that the game is mid, its more that its one of extremes. The good bits are extremely good, but it\u2019s marred by bad bits that made me want to uninstall on multiple occasions.\n\n[b]Art Style/Design:[/b]\nThis game looks incredible, both in graphics and brutalist art deco. Each area feels distinctly handcrafted, the world is vast, and it does a great job of hiding secrets within each of these spaces. If there\u2019s an instance where you think \u201cI wonder if I can fly up to that balcony 10 floors up\u201d, chances are you can.\n\nWhich is a shame because you\u2019ll be utterly lost. Despite how vertical the area is, they decided to go with a barebones top-down map that makes it impossible to distinguish which floor an exit is on and whether or not the route you\u2019re taking is blocked off. This is exacerbated by some really bad fast travel placement. Just figuring out where to go became so infuriating that I had to Youtube directions to the next quest multiple times and would still wind up lost in the final hours of the game for areas I had been through multiple times. This game needed a layered 3D map in the menu.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nThe combat loop starts out shaky until you start to get extra gun forms and especially the main abilities. Once you have these things improve enormously as you go from relying on cover to sheer agility and mixing up your abilities. Now, take this excellent baseline, then add some of the most nonsensical design adjustments imaginable.\n\nImagine you\u2019re playing Half Life, you can carry all weapons and cycle through them. Control is like that, except you can only hotkey between 2 weapons. You have like 5, they could be mapped to the number keys to switch on the fly like Half Life, but instead you have to go into your inventory in combat and select which 2 you want to switch between. It\u2019s such a stupid design choice, and I just found out there\u2019s actually a mod that adds precisely this option into the game I wish I\u2019d seen before.\n\nAdd to that an RPG style weapon & character mods system that is probably my least favourite part of the game. Almost every enemy drops a mod of some form. Most are useless, e.g. \u201c+5% damage\u201d, \u201cget energy from being hit\u201d, so on so forth scaling up over time but very rarely giving actual decent stuff. You will spend an absurd amount of time doing inventory management because you can only carry ~20 at once and will get ~5 per fight, when this stuff could have been a weapon tree upgrade at checkpoints.\n\nOh, also just to note, I\u2019ve completed the entire game & DLC\u2019s, and have not once used shield. It is the most useless ability in the whole game despite being one of the first few you get.\n\n[b]Story/Lore:[/b]\nThe game starts out pretty ominous, but honestly, I feel like the lore and story gave way to aesthetic. The main quest is pretty dull for most of the game, there\u2019s not much in the way of character engagement, and then when you get into the later stages of the main story things all of a sudden ramp up in quality, and just as you\u2019re getting engaged for it to build to the final act it just suddenly ends in an anti-climax. Honestly thinking back on it very little actually happens the whole game.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m unfairly comparing to SCP, but the lore feels incredibly shallow by comparison. None of the items are as interesting as those of SCP, the overwhelming majority of them are just random object + random effect and that\u2019s it. There's none like SCP-7122 that make you go \u201choly fuck that\u2019s so well thought out but so messed up\u201d, its all just kind of samey.\n\nThe DLC is equally as mid, nothing really outstanding about either of them. Oh, and side quests range from forgettable to utterly fucking awful, like seriously some of the worst I\u2019ve ever played.\n\nDon\u2019t bother with Expeditions. You unlock them mid-game, but even the easiest one is borderline impossible without maxing out all stats, getting some of the rarest mods, and selecting really specific builds. Its probably great for people that like the gameplay but by the time I got to the point I could feasibly do these I was pretty much burned out with the other crap in this game.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b]\nBest art style and world space in a game for ages, core combat loop is insanely fun after early game, but both are undermined by terrible map directions and RPG mechanics.

It tends more to the worse side than the good, so I am going to give it a negative review, sadly.\n\nFirstly, it has a shit ton of production value. The engine is gorgeous and utilized greatly, graphics and physics both. The mystery, world building itself and the place you are in are fantastic. That is about it though.\n\nThey tried to copy the Dark Souls formula but then forgot important aspects of it. Like:\n\n-Customization\n-Resource Management\n-Playstyles that aren't just the same all the way through\n-Interesting boss and enemy patterns\n-Locations that aren't just to pass or backtrack through\n-Loot that is interesting\n\nTo elaborate on this:\n\nThe combat is neat for the first hour, then it very very quickly gets boring because you just go pewpew with your gun. Enemies start getting progressively more bullet spongey but you can't really help but fall behind. They even got level indicators. Yet you have no levels. What you get is a loot system from a game like Destiny or Warframe with marginal \"5% more damage in this situation\" increases. That wouldn't be so bad if you had more slots to put these in though, as they could stack a lot then. But no, you can unlock a MAXIMUM of 3 personal slots for slight general buffs (that you really are forced to take up for health too, since the enemies in this game can 100 to 0 you at points) and then 3 more per weapon. You are always going to use the same weapon, then the telekinesis blast, which does way more damage. Then use gun until energy recharged, repeat over and over.\n\nAs said, they tried to copy the Dark Souls formula of difficulty but with more superpowers but forgot almost all that made it good. They use a checkpoint system like bonfires here but NO HEALING ITEMS. I put special emphasis on this because it is endlessly frustrating to have an enemy 100 to 0 you (with maximum health upgrades mind you), then the only way you can heal yourself back up is scrounging for little health pickups that enemies dropped. In my run I had moments were I went from full health to near 0, meanwhile I had all my personal slots full with the highest tier \"increase health recovery in pick-up\" and one highest tier max health upgrade. I went to pick them up, got near full again. Then got near 0 again even while frantically dodging because that is just how this goes. Then scrounge for health pick-ups again. Whoever thought it was a good design decision to have enemies drop health and then you have to travel to that place in melee, then walk over it did not have an understanding of how difficult games work. Really, it is the most insulting thing here.\n\nThis game tries to be this superpowered fun ride with high difficulty but it gives you almost no options on how to play, and the little it gives are worthless. There is no consumables or damn healing items. That means no thinking on when to use what. You run into a room with the same enemies you thought the past 100 areas (they also respawn rather quickly). Then just dump ammo, launch objects at them, repeat until one resource refills while using the other. Such a waste of an awesome and unique premise. But there just is no agency in anything.\n\nAnd just to quickly touch on it, the writing in this game can be interesting but often comes down to being very pretentious and screaming of a freshman artschool student (not that I have anything against artschool students, they do important work in their own way) who just has some raw ideas and spits them on the screen. That is neat and all but then you have a main character that is very unlikeable, not because of her actions but her \"I am the bossgirl, you are annoying me\" attitude in every conversation and during missions in her head.  The first and 10th time you get the \"cryptic dialogue during glitchy screens\" animations it's sort of fun. Then the 50th time they go on for like 3 minutes at once, with you basically only seeing a glitchy screen. This is not mystery, this is annoying and pretentious.\n\nOverall it had massive potential and did almost nothing with it that wasn't purely graphical or physics based. And that is mostly thanks to the engines capabilities. All in all, this is a game I wouldn't even recommend on sale because you are better off with other games or in general spending your time doing something else.", "timestamp_created": 1690626789, "timestamp_updated": 1690626789, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143008279": {"recommendationid": "143008279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044322616", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1690579865}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2611 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2611 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10", "timestamp_created": 1690622273, "timestamp_updated": 1690622273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143006957": {"recommendationid": "143006957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219928403", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1806, "last_played": 1690825776}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game nice lore", "timestamp_created": 1690620374, "timestamp_updated": 1690620510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "143004096": {"recommendationid": "143004096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400431677", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 147, "playtime_forever": 1577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1577, "last_played": 1690441849}, "language": "english", "review": "You are the Assistant Janitor/Director!\nYour job is to clean/kill the dirts/threats in the building!\nYou are blessed with tools/weapons and abilities/powers to cleanse/slaughter the Moss/Hiss!\nAhti/Board appreciates your dedication on the job!\nThe Federal Bureau of Control welcomes you as part of the team!\n\nJokes aside, the story is either too weird or my brain not smooth enough to understand most of them.\nSo far I only know that Jesse looking for the FBOC for Dylan and then get dragged to become the new leader to defend against the Hiss and eventually managed to free Dylan and cleanse most of the Hiss in the building, something like that.\n\nWell, all in all, the gameplays pretty awesome.\nThe levitate didn't cost you energy, so you technically can shoot and throw stuffs while hovering around the place, but yes it makes you like a very easy target up there, so beware.

Its not scary but puts you in this spooky, humdrum government atmosphere where conspiracy theorist would have a field day. The story is mostly linear with side missions to fill the seemingly alive building that the protagonist Jesse Faden continues to unravel. After the story there are two story expanding DLCs that invite you back into the world of the Federal Bureau of Control along with challenge mode that allows you to put all the upgrades and skills you have to test  [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td] Should you get it?[/td]\n\t[td] Yes (he said with a chuckle). I see why this game had so many nods back during its award season. Control tells a unique world building story that makes you want to see not only more from Jesse but the weird, alternate, paranormal world she inhabits. Remembering that this is a spawn from the mind of Sam Lake (creator of the Max Payne and Alan Wake series) we may get that in the future. If we do I, I\u2019m instantly onboard [/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td] Overall Verdict [/td]\n\t[td] 9/10. After looking past the lackluster bosses (a majority I\u2019d say) and weird enemy scaling (adjustable by a suite of accessibility options) Control builds a well fleshed out world paranormal entities right under our noses and the perceived dull government entity that keeps it in check\u2026but you\u2019ll be thrilled to know its far from dull. [/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n[b] Setting & Writing: [/b]\nIn Control you play as Jesse Faden, a young woman looking for her brother years after an anomaly affected her hometown of Ordinary. The strange events resulted in the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) covering up what happened and taking Jesse\u2019s brother Dylan. Jesse finds the FBC, which is a feat because one needs to be tuned in to even recognize the existence of its location. Once Jesse arrives at the FBC she is greeted by an odd janitor ordering her to go to the director\u2019s office. What Jesse finds is that she just became the new director of the FBC and must clean up the mess the previous director left for her. Control has a captivating story, akin to watching shows like X-files and Twilight Zone. The writing builds a spooky, but not necessarily scary atmosphere. What comes off as just another day in the office is steeped in suspicious activity. The FBC deals with the paranormal. Their office building, also known as The Oldest House, feels like an infinitely large building. The building houses numerous divisions dedicated to the study of multiple paranormal entities. Jesse is tasked to cleanse the building of an entity known as \u201cThe Hiss\u201d. The Hiss have been running amok within the Oldest House, but they\u2019ve been plotting for quite some time. Throughout the story you learn of Jesse\u2019s special quirk which makes her immune to the Hiss, their connection to the Oldest House and how this all involves her long-lost brother. \n\n[b] Gameplay system & Bosses: [/b]\nControl is a technical powerhouse in destruction-based graphics. Jesse will gain new powers that allow her to combat the Hiss and upgrades to her \u201cliving\u201d gun. The game is designed for you to keep moving. If you stop moving, you\u2019re liable to get hit hard by the opposition. Combining Jesse\u2019s powers between weapon reloads results in a constant dance of damage and office furniture being flung everywhere. Enemy design to me was bland BUT varied. Each section of the game introduces more enemy types that force you to think of different ways to quickly dispose of them. Flying enemies are good at evading telekinetically thrown objects, therefore you might want to snipe them before trying to hurl an object at them again. Similar challenges are presented throughout the game. Bosses were not much of a challenge though. Bosses felt like high health enemy types. I personally cannot remember any designs of the main story bosses. That is to say that there are some optional bosses that are neat but not tough.\n\n[b] Quest, Mini-games & Challenges: [/b] \nThe Oldest House is split up into floors. In the beginning each floor is essentially a new level/objective in the game. You\u2019ll visit old locations later in the game once you have high level clearance to let you through. This makes Control almost a metroidvania-lite. There are plenty of side quests to do that not only reward you with upgrades and materials, but genuine good world building. There are side quests that go into the origin of some of the strange objects you read about in documents. The most interesting ones gave extra exposition on what the Oldest House truly is, or at least what the scientist think it is. Side missions in this game did a good job of further detailing the world these characters live in and the dangers that their job puts them through day in and day out. Later in the game DLC is introduced that offers horde-mode type challenges that reward you with extra cosmetic outfits for Jesse.  \n\n[b] Miscellaneous (art, music, etc.): [/b]\nShades more than color liter the world of control. I believe this to be purposeful in conveying the atmosphere that it is trying to establish. The FBC is a government division that adheres strictly to their dress codes, rules and regulations, and rituals. This builds a bland but detailed building that purposely bores you as you walk its non-distorted halls. Soon into the game you learn about astral planes which are pockets outside our dimensions yet still bland in color. Its only purpose is to train the new director, Jesse, in her newly acquired positional powers. Again, I feel as though this is done on purpose to frame a juxtaposition of incredibly extraordinary things happening to ordinary people who treats the happenings in this situation like another day on the job. The art that truly shines is graphical fidelity (granted you have a rig that takes advantage of it). This game is beautifully optimized and takes full advantage of NVIDIAs DLSS technology. In the beginning I opted out of using it just to see how my rig fared (80-100FPS on high settings). Once I turned on DLSS not only was I able to take advantage of the ray tracing, but the sampling also improved the graphical fidelity of the game without making it all look too smooth. Control\u2019s art direction may have been bland, but it was intentional to convey the story told and its beauty shines through on the technological front giving the user a fluid and pretty experience.", "timestamp_created": 1690578647, "timestamp_updated": 1690578725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142979863": {"recommendationid": "142979863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083943024", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1465, "last_played": 1690575801}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game but very big heebie jeebies the entire time", "timestamp_created": 1690578262, "timestamp_updated": 1690578262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142967319": {"recommendationid": "142967319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095137467", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 4298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2885, "last_played": 1691091575}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, graphics, story, musik, all great !

The biggest probably being that the game could've benefited from a handful more enemy types, this wasn't a deal breaker but definitely would've freshened up the latter half of the game. Secondly, the weapon mods felt underutilized. Each weapon setup(except one) has at least one mod that is straight up the best option, and then there's a universal mod you can find that's a percentage damage boost, and those two end up taking 2/3 of all weapon mod slots, basically making them an afterthought. If you could even just use 4 instead of 3 the variation in options would open up drastically without sacrificing the strictly best options. \n\nOverall I'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in mysterious SCP style world building, or dark and trippy third person shooters.", "timestamp_created": 1690439041, "timestamp_updated": 1690439041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142872752": {"recommendationid": "142872752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010360313", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1696390706}, "language": "english", "review": "fun shooter adventure", "timestamp_created": 1690429838, "timestamp_updated": 1690429838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142860180": {"recommendationid": "142860180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997958857", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4292, "last_played": 1691521400}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this in 2020, now having another play through, loved it then and love it now, great story, highly recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1690410097, "timestamp_updated": 1690410097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142850155": {"recommendationid": "142850155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318768288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1440, "last_played": 1692912385}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, I like the story, it's basically exploring a secret gov agency building similar to the SCP foundation.

There is also a lot of hidden areas to find as well, most of which near the middle of the game when you learn to fly.. There are also 'Control' points that act as hubs to level up and fast travel like a lot of metroidvanias.\n\nThere are also two DLCs, and there is lore in the game linking this game to Remedy Studios other popular game, Alan Wake, setting them in the same universe.

The story revolves around an institution that takes care of supernatural anomalies, very much like the SCP Foundation if you will. The story as a whole is great, very engaging, and with multiple side plots. If you focus only on what's presented to you directly through cinematics and discussions, you'll still have a great understanding of it and will enjoy it very much. However, there are also lots and lots of collectibles, to listen to, watch, and especially read through, and all of these expand the story and the universe a lot more and give context to many of the things you'll find. \nIt is a part of the Alan Wake universe and it really feels like it. There are quite a few references to the events that take place in the game and even some little stories that expand on Alan Wake's story. Any fan of Wake's games will be really pleased with finding these bits. \n\nGraphicly, it is what you'd expect from a fairly recent game. It looks great and the lightning is very well made in my opinion, although some opinions may differ here. There is one issue with texture loading for close objects sometimes, they load a little bit slow, and for a brief moment, they are low rez. It really isn't a big issue, however, some people may be taken out by this, and if that's the case, the issue can be solved pretty easily with a dev. approved mod. Make sure to check on the game's guides for this and also a way to easily get the content that was console exclusive. It's just a really simple change to the hex code. \n\nGameplay-wise, this game is magnificent. Has some really nice mechanics that feel amazing to use, levitation is fun and very well made, and all the other powers the protagonist unlocks are easy to use and actually very useful compared to some other games where you'll use one thing once and then never again. \nThe weapons feel good and impactful, although I couldn't give much expertise on this since I was too big of a fan of the basic pistol and I almost entirely used that, it's just a matter of preference really. \nThe navigation through the levels may seem really confusing at first, and sometimes it really is, but as soon as you figure it out, it becomes way easier. The main thing to keep in mind is to make use of signs. You'll see signs that point toward specific places scattered everywhere, and these make it way easier for you to figure out what's where and how to get to it. \n\nAnd for any completionists out there, the game is fairly easy to 100%, it just depends on how much you enjoy doing it. Most achievements are pretty straightforward, and for the few that are more ambiguous, the guides are decent at explaining them. The achievements for The Foundation DLC are a bit more tedious, but nothing too bad. There are no difficulty achievements since there are no multiple difficulty options.", "timestamp_created": 1690314348, "timestamp_updated": 1690314348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556166887283325195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142779538": {"recommendationid": "142779538", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241491759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 904, "last_played": 1698444556}, "language": "english", "review": "What a Kool story and the game play is great.

The delivery of most-everything in the game is very solemn. But the content is at times very silly. Like how the Janitor is possibly one of the more powerful entities that you encounter or how one of the lines from this super creepy mantra you hear constantly simply says \"orange peel\" (Seriously, never imagined 'orange peel' was gonna creep me out some day but here we are). The world - despite being very dada-ist at times - is not afraid to take itself seriously and it lends to the overall fidelity excellently. Also, despite how whimsical it feels at times it's a very uneasy environment. The game definitely doesn't let you feel comfortable anywhere really.\n\nThe story itself is super-interesting. Pseudo-meta but not bad. I'll leave it at interesting to avoid spoiling anything. I spent more time reading and theory-crafting on this game than in Dead Space.\n\nAs for the difficulty, I see people calling it a souls-like. But really it's as close to Dark Souls as it is to Devil May Cry. You can do all kinds of wild stuff when you know the mechanics and have your build, but then you can also still die to silly mistakes. Not many damage sponge enemies. More like rock, paper, scissors. Combat is a lot of fun too. I don't know what game to compare it to, but it's definitely in the shoot 'em up category. It's not an easy game, but it's not hard either. Really good balance.

Maybe I don't need to.\"[/h1]\n\nI want to preface this review by saying I am not a fan of Remedy Entertainment. I tried [i]Quantum Break[/i] not long after it's release and then tried it again on PC a few months ago. It didn't compel me whatsoever and was a glorified cutscene most of the time. It felt like a failed experiment. But [i]Control[/i], despite a few flaws, feels like the real deal. \n\nThe game story is a cascading endless sea of what can only be described as, complete and utter bullshit. It almost makes zero sense, only barely being strung together by the occasional grounded element. It relies heavily on suspension of disbelief because it revels in it's sci-fi supernatural roots, maybe takes them a tad too far. But despite all this, it did compel me, where the aforementioned title didn't. It is blaring take on the mystery genre. It's moody, because of its outstanding visual components. It's haunting and unsettling because of its labyrinthian map design, hallways and offices all indistinguishable from one another.  And fascinating because the character dialogue exists in mostly incomprehensible riddles, constantly citing ingame lore that none of us really understand. It is, shockingly good. \n\nCombat is where I feel it really shines though. All the abilities feel incredible to use, so do all weapon forms, each being formidable with their own particular strengths. Gunplay feels responsive, all the elements tie in to create punchy, impactful enemy encounters. I do feel as if there is a question to be had about balancing, in regards to the launch ability sort of being the go to for biggest damage output. You can cover, wait for launch, bomb 5 enemies and then wait again. It's not a fun way to engage with the combat systems but it's almost undoubtedly the easiest way to play and you end up being funnelled into it as a consequence. Skill tree is good, basic, effective, all the upgrades matter and translate into gameplay clearly. The game is lighter on those \"RPG elements\", thank god. You will find yourself dying quite a lot, because enemies do a lot of damage if you let them, but it places importance on constant movement and maneuvering which is an absolute must. You learn that early in the game. \n\nMission structure is a strange one, because the main ones are straight to it, barebones, sometimes just there to pull you along through the rest of the map. They're multi staged, filled with simple enemy encounters or weird exposition trips. But they're completely acceptable, and honestly I can't feel very positive on them because these missions have zero encounters comparable to a good old [b]boss battle.[/b] Which, at the end of the game, felt sorely missed. It just... ends. No big climax, no culmination of all you've done, just a few enemy waves and hold X. Maybe I've been brainwashed by Playstation dev teams into thinking every encounter absolutely [u]needs[/u] to end with one, but it felt odd, really very odd. Whats funny about this is that, from the few side missions I played, it seems almost every boss has been thrown into optional content. I fought a worm and mold creature that felt stronger than anything in the main game. But this is good really, as I have a problem with side content there for the sake of it rather than to create equally interesting moments. \n\nAnd quickly too I wanted to mention just how bloody good this game is in the visual department. I have never seen effects work this good, or lighting that creates such deep contrast and colour gradation.The way the deep reds of alarms or hiss encounter spray out onto the surroundings is simply beautiful. There is enough bloom and abrupt shifts in environment colour to blind a man temporarily and I am all there for it. It is a technical showcase to the highest degree, despite one crash I had from spinning Jesse's gun too much, it was  a seamless experience. \n\nSo yeah, its a rough outline sort of review, to be spoiler free. But to any human being reading this, Remedy's [I]Control[/I] is an extremely unique adventure game I feel everyone should try atleast once. \n\n[b]9/10[/b]\n\n[i](Played on a R5 3600/RTX 4070 combo at 1440p Highest settings with RT set to Medium and DLSS Quality enabled, using an Xbox Series Controller.)[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1690244537, "timestamp_updated": 1690244537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142728586": {"recommendationid": "142728586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056993910", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 889, "last_played": 1690821996}, "language": "english", "review": "You are a worm through time.\nThe thunder song distorts you.\nHappiness comes.\nWhite pearls, but yellow and red in the eye.\nThrough a mirror, inverted is made right.\nLeave your insides by the door.\nPush the fingers through the surface into the wet.\nYou\u2019ve always been the new you.\nYou want this to be true.\nWe stand around you while you dream.\nYou can almost hear our words but you forget.\nThis happens more and more now.\nYou gave us the permission in your regulations.\nWe wait in the stains.\nThe word that describes this is redacted.\nRepeat the word.\nThe name of the sound.\nIt resonates in your house.\nAfter the song, time for applause.\nWe build you till nothing remains.\nThe egg cracks and the truth will emerge out of you.\nYou are home.\nYou remind us of home.\nYou\u2019ve taken your boss with your boss with you.\nAll hair must be eaten.\nUnder the conceptual reality behind this reality you must want these waves to drag you away.\nAfter the song, time for applause.\nThis clich\u00e9 is death out of time, breaking the first the second the third the fourth wall, the fifth wall, floor; no floor: you fall!\nHow do you say \u201cinsane\u201d?\nHurts to be happy.\nAn earworm is a tune you can\u2019t stop humming in a dream: \u201cbaby baby baby yeah\u201d.\nJust plastic.\nSo, safe and nothing to worry about.\nHa ha, funny.\nThe last egg breaks now.\nThe hole in your room is a hole in you.\nYou came and we let you in through the hole in you.\nYou have always been here, the only child.\nA copy of a copy of a copy.\nOrange peel.\nThe picture is you holding the picture.\nWhen you hear this you will know you\u2019re in new you.\nYou want to listen.\nYou want to dream.\nYou want to smile.\nYou want to hurt.\nYou don\u2019t want to be.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1690237226, "timestamp_updated": 1690237226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142721135": {"recommendationid": "142721135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114290841", "num_games_owned": 940, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3022, "last_played": 1691771073}, "language": "english", "review": "Visually stunning, fun gameplay.\nAlso that Ashtray labyrinth mission was so cool, like OMG.\nReally recomended", "timestamp_created": 1690227428, "timestamp_updated": 1690227428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142713607": {"recommendationid": "142713607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168753912", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 926, "last_played": 1690218209}, "language": "english", "review": "Both DLC's and the main campaign were amazing.

This would be a prime candidate for a neutral review, if Steam had the option.\n\nVisually, the game is peerless. The aesthetic and art direction is gorgeous, and the highly-destructible environments are a blast to fight in. I think I spent like 30 minutes just destroyed the office section when I got the telekenisis power. Watching everything flawlessly chip, shatter and splinter into thousands particles is truly cathartic. \n\nI like that the game doesn't give you mission markers and you need to use the environmental hints to navigate. A double edged sword, since sometimes navigating in the backrooms-esque environments can be difficult, but it's still a rare and welcome decision.\n\nThe gameplay... is passable. While the chucking stuff at enemies is extremelly fun, it can't carry the whole game on by itself; Half life 2 knew that well. It doesn't exactly evolve past the initial presentation. You walk into a room, it gets locked and a few enemies spawn (out of a selection of like major 5 types), you kill them by throwing stuff, rinse and repeat. Most of them aren't very threatening, and the variety is sorely lacking. The gunplay is also mediocre, with a relatively small selection and a quite-unfun regenerating ammo mechanic, where you can only fire in tiny bursts before you have to resort to your equally small energy reserves to toss stuff at enemies. The worst offender is the fact that the game seems to be chock-full of filler. Between the crafting/upgrade system, the frequent fetch-quests and the bizarre 'kill x enemies' repeatable missions, all of it starts reeking like they wanted to make this a live service game, but decided against midway through.\n\nSpecial mention to the voice acting. Most of it is overperformed to a, frankly, grating degree. which especially noticeable when your main character has fallen victim to it too.

But if you're tired of the same take on modern horror and paranormal stories (vampires, again?), this will feel fresh and imaginative. \n\nStill, you have to know, straight off the bus, the game launches in \"hardcore\" mode by default. Meaning, you'd better tweak with the settings called \"assistance\" if you're the kind of adult who knows playing is about having fun, not constantly checking if your d*** did'nt fall off... \nNow, having played the whole game, I understand there's a method to this madness: to truly make the player feel the shift from \"scared and hepless\" to \"powerful and in control\". Smart and commandable considering the story, but the highway to Pandemonium was paved with good intentions...\n\nWhich brings us to storyteling concerns. \nAfter Action & Horror in \"Alan Wake\", Remedy decided to venture into Horror & Superhero territory. A bold move, considering both genres are spiritual opposites: horror thrives on helplessness, superheroes thrive on powerfulness. \nIt could have worked! If the writers had not missed an important point: if Horror can take a jig-saw narrative (as \"Alan Wake\" brilliantly showed) because Horror thrives on making its audience feel uncomfortable, such is really not the case with superheroes. Superhero stories need to hit clear milestones in the right order to work properly. In this case:\n- the \"ashtray maze\", the biggest \"hero moment\", happens too soon, in the second act, before the all-is-lost moment. \n- the mandatory comeback from the \"all-is-lost moment\" is downplayed too much\n- the final confrontation feels meaningless in regard to the hero's growth\n- there's no formal 'retrun to the initial world, changed'\nThis all contributes to making the ending of \"Control\" particularly unsatisfying. It feels rushed and dragged on a the same time, without delivering the proper \"epic vibe\" that all the previous build-up required by this point. Too bad.\n\nThat said, \"Control\" will still take you along a wonderful ride, full of suprises, clever ideas, mind-bending suggestions, unsettling discoveries, and bombastic moves. Plus, once you've completed the main story, the \"Alan Wake\" DLC is a real treat that unexpectedly manages to quench some of the 'superhero thirst' the main ending left you with!\n\nSo, no, \"Control\" isn't perfect, but it still so much better than a crushing majority of games that feel like carbon-copies of the same cash-cow.

Instead of downvoting, I usually let people form their own opinion but not this time.\n\nTl;dr this is an 8 hour game, with 5 hours of bloated combat and audio logs and 4-5 hours of okay DLC.\n\nSo, they smashed Infamous 2 and SCP together in an interesting world with tight gameplay, and still dogged the whole thing up. The art, audio, and gameplay mechanics all feel top notch. Who screwed up the rest of the game?\n\nI always crank up difficulty in games. This is the first time I wanted to crank it down- simply because the combat is so incredibly boring. I hope you enjoyed the first hour of combat gameplay because that's what you get. There's like 4 enemies and half of the spawn are the self-destruct types, and there's always 2-3x the amount of enemies there needs to be. In Metroid, enemies serve a purpose and eventually you can avoid them. In Borderlands, enemies are abundant but go down fast and don't hamper gameplay. In this, they're clunky, obnoxious, and slow everything down.\n\nThe reload mechanic and inventory limits are pointless clutter. Reload slows combat for no reason, inventory means you have to empty junk constantly.\n\nYou can finish the game entirely missing 2 powers, and their presence in combat gameplay is so minimal that you won't even care if you ignore them.\n\nThe game can't decide if wants to be dark & serious or goofy and insane, but not in a charming way- in a completely disconnected way. The best part of the entire game was a butt-rock, live-playing-a-music-video section that lasted 2-3 minutes. The whole game should've just committed to that energy.\n\nThe MC would be great if they weren't inconsistent. The whole first couple hours they're insistent on being called by their first name then immediately disrespect someone who asked the same thing of her... What?\n\nThere's a whole weapon/body mods page that I basically ignored. Like 40% of the mechanics in the game don't serve much purpose. They should've just focused on a better game instead of half-hashed mechanics.\n\nOh but at least you get to PLAY AN ALAN WAKE ADVERTISEMENT. That's the future of gaming, kiddos.

After roughly 5 hours of playtime I finally realized that Control is not anything special.\n\nTrust me, you\u2019ve played this game before. Especially if you have 20+ years of gaming under your belt. It borrows various bits from other AAA titles and tries to merge them together. The result is frankly, a kind of boring game to be in\u2014one very large building. Endless variations of gray interior spaces inspired by 1960s Brutalist architecture.\n\nThe story seems impossible to keep up with and really doesn\u2019t make any sense. It's not engaging and quite confusing. The more questions you ask, the more you find fault. Suspending YOUR reality to enjoy the reality of this game is not possible. I view it as an \u2018accessible psychological thriller\u2019 for a very general audience. Even this descriptor is pushing it. \n\nCombat is \u201cokay\u201d. Weapons can be crafted. You shoot, run, jump, squat, melee, dash, etc. Objects can be harnessed and later thrown. Environment is destructible. Remember, we\u2019ve played this already.\n\nThis is yet another AAA game that requires a significant amount of time to complete. Players meet characters, get sent on quests, find keys, unlock doors, read letters, pick up upgrades, shoot bad guys, platform, die, re-spawn at checkpoints, wander around aimlessly, and then get lucky finding where you should be going. Level maps suck, and the game provides little direction or guidance.

However, while the game falls short in delivering a captivating story, it compensates with its intriguing lore and the AWE expansion, making the best of a disappointing narrative. With its innovative gameplay mechanics and compelling world-building, CONTROL deserves high praise and a solid four-star rating.\n\nThe gameplay in CONTROL is where the game truly shines. The combination of supernatural abilities, intense gunplay, and environmental destruction create a thrilling and satisfying combat experience. The game's physics-based mechanics, such as telekinesis and levitation, allow for creative approaches to battles, making each encounter feel dynamic and empowering. CONTROL's gameplay innovation sets a new bar for action-adventure games.\n\nHowever, despite the excellence in gameplay, the narrative in CONTROL is a letdown. The story, centered around the Federal Bureau of Control and the protagonist Jesse Faden, fails to fully captivate or deliver on its potential. The pacing feels disjointed, and key story elements are left unexplained or underdeveloped. This disappointment is particularly surprising considering Remedy Entertainment's previous successes in crafting engaging narratives.\n\nWhere CONTROL manages to redeem itself is through its rich and intriguing lore. The game's universe is filled with mysterious phenomena, paranormal entities, and hidden secrets that add depth to the world. Exploring the enigmatic Oldest House, the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, unveils a captivating backdrop that begs to be explored and understood. The game's collectibles, such as audio logs and documents, provide additional context and reward players for delving deeper into the lore.\n\nThe AWE expansion, which intertwines with Remedy's previous game, Alan Wake, adds a much-needed boost to the narrative experience of CONTROL. The expansion brings a sense of cohesiveness and expands upon the game's universe, tying together loose ends and providing a satisfying connection to Remedy's previous works. It showcases Remedy's storytelling prowess and delivers a thrilling narrative that feels more fulfilling than the base game.\n\nVisually, CONTROL is stunning, with its brutalist architecture, moody lighting, and visually striking effects. The game's presentation creates a distinct and atmospheric world that is visually engaging and memorable. The sound design, particularly the haunting score and sound effects, enhances the overall experience, immersing players further into the mysterious world of CONTROL.\n\nIn conclusion, CONTROL stands as a gameplay masterpiece, showcasing Remedy Entertainment's exceptional talent in crafting immersive and innovative gameplay experiences. However, the disappointment lies in the lackluster story, which fails to live up to the studio's previous successes. Nonetheless, the intriguing lore and the AWE expansion manage to salvage some of the narrative shortcomings. With its captivating world-building, stunning visuals, and exceptional gameplay mechanics, CONTROL still deserves a solid four-star rating.

Combina a la perfecci\u00f3n un historia llena de misterios e inc\u00f3gnitas que raramente se esclarecen a menos que pongan atenci\u00f3n a los detalles, unos personajes bien construidos, soundtrack escaso pero bien hecho y un gameplay terriblemente adictivo. Vayamos por partes.\n\nLa historia que ofrece es de las m\u00e1s complicadas que haya podido experimentar. Sin embargo no es por que la trama principal sea compleja ni mucho menos sino m\u00e1s bien debido a la manera en la que es contada. Se trata de una amalgama de trozos de historias, comentarios, documentos y pistas que una vez que el propio jugador va uniendo por si mismo todas las piezas que te da el t\u00edtulo de forma completamente ca\u00f3tica desvelando una historia que no pasa ni por pena ni gloria.\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n es maravillosa. Nos encontramos en un edificio llamado \"La casa Inmemorial  o The Bureau\" en el que se realizan investigaciones con todo tipo de objetos cotidianos que han adquiridos caracter\u00edsticas \"muy particulares\". Cada sala, diapositiva e incluso la posici\u00f3n de ciertos cad\u00e1veres parecen contar historias muy interesantes y atractivas que ayudan a formar una atm\u00f3sfera opresiva, tensa y oscura aunque sin llegar a recurrir al terror... como suele ocurrir, te asusta m\u00e1s lo que puede haber que lo que hay. A esto le sumamos que el t\u00edtulo ofrece un mapa realmente grande a la par que laber\u00edntico que te obligar\u00e1 a tener que interpretar el mapa m\u00e1s de una vez para saber por d\u00f3nde has de pasar o qu\u00e9 ascensor coger para poder llegar al siguiente punto. \n\nLas misiones secundarias son muy variadas y terriblemente entretenidas. Gran parte de estas son muy originales y bizarras que te har\u00e1n esbozar una sonrisa m\u00e1s de una vez de lo mucho que las disfrutar\u00e1s. Por un lado algunas te aportan poderes y , por el otro, te dar\u00e1n recompensas jugosas que te ayudar\u00e1n a mejorar a Jesse con la intenci\u00f3n de hacer los enfrentamientos m\u00e1s llevaderos y entretenidos. Es de los pocos t\u00edtulos que realmente recomiendo jugarse todas las misiones secundarias ya que son muy variadas y \u00fanicas. \n\nEl punto de los personajes me parece necesario tratarlo ya que me ha sorprendido en ambos sentidos: tanto para bien como para mal. Algunos personajes (sobre todo la protagonista) est\u00e1n bien construidos pero no llegas a conectar con ellos a menos que te lleves horas y horas jugando y teniendo contacto con ellos. Por el otro lado nos encontramos con personajes secundarios y terciarios que no aportan nada que no sea la t\u00edpica misi\u00f3n \"ve aqu\u00ed, enfr\u00e9ntate con estos enemigos, recoge un elemento o similar y vuelve al punto de partida\". \n\nEl soundtrack es pr\u00e1cticamente inexistente, t\u00edpico saoundtrack ambiental (sonido molestos en momentos de tensi\u00f3n o enfrentamientos y poco m\u00e1s). Sin embargo, los sonidos y efectos est\u00e1n perfectamente realizados es un verdadero goce para los o\u00eddos lo bien hechos que est\u00e1n todos los efectos sonidos en este t\u00edtulo. Puedo decir sin lugar a dudas que me he hecho adicto al sonido de hacer levitar objetos de lo satisfactorio que me resulta. \n\nEl gameplay es, con diferencia, el punto fuerte de este t\u00edtulo. Por un lado tienes la capacidad de atacar a los enemigos con un repertorio de armas que aunque no es muy variado, cada una se centra en distintos aspectos durante la lucha lo que le aporta mucha funcionalidad a cada una de las susodichas. Adem\u00e1s podemos encontrarnos con poderes que agilizan y, en ciertos momentos, le a\u00f1aden cierta complejidad al combate oblig\u00e1ndote a cuestionar qu\u00e9 te resulta m\u00e1s beneficioso seg\u00fan qu\u00e9 momento de la lucha. Y, por \u00faltimo pero no menos importe, la existencia de unos parches que potencian el rendimiento de las armas y le agregar\u00e1n ciertas ventajas referentes al ataque, defensa, salud o poderes de nuestra protagonista Jesse lo que le a\u00f1ade una complejidad a\u00fan mayor sobre todo en los momentos de mayor dificultad en los que un paso en falso puede suponer una muerte dolorosa y deshonrosa. Y, como buen juego de Remedy, hay un \u00e1rbol de habilidades que te ayudar\u00e1 a progresar en la historia de manera que sientas que te haces m\u00e1s poderoso al mismo tiempo que perfeccionas tu habilidad en combate. \n\nMe parece importante tratar los DLC que ofrece este t\u00edtulo: The Foundation y AWE. El primero es una pedazo expansi\u00f3n: mapa nuevo, poderes nuevos y enemigos nuevos. La historia que ofrece es simple para que puedas centrarte en disfrutar del combate y ayuda a esclarecer algunos puntos importantes directamente relacionados con la trama principal. Sin embargo, llegamos al segundo DLC: AWE. Este t\u00edtulo me ha encantado, ha sido una maravilla...una verdadera gozada. Todo el terror y horror que buscaba encontrarme en este t\u00edtulo pero que s\u00ed experiment\u00e9 en Alan Wake lo encontr\u00e9 en este DLC. Ofrece \"nuevas mec\u00e1nicas\" y una historia que estoy seguro de que para muchos que hemos jugado a Alan Wake y Quantum Break resultan bastante reveladores. \n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, \u00bfRecomendar\u00eda Control? Por supuesto, es una verdadera joya que, en mi opini\u00f3n, no ha recibido la fama y el apoyo que recibi\u00f3 Alan Wake en su momento. Su trama, a pesar de abusar de la t\u00e1ctica \"voy a dejar a los jugadores cientos de documentos repartidos por todo el mapa para que se los lean y as\u00ed puedan entender gran parte de las historias secundarias y parte de la principal por me me da pereza explicarlo directamente por medio de cinem\u00e1ticas o por que no hay suficiente presupuesto\" (se ve que Quantum Break se qued\u00f3 con todo el presupuesto con esas buenas cinem\u00e1ticas de cincuenta minutos o m\u00e1s), es interesante adem\u00e1s de contar con una premisa muy original. Los personajes son mejorables, he de admitir que no me he sentido muy unido a la protagonista debido a que me ha parecido un personaje muy plano (podemos decir que la raz\u00f3n por la que es tan inexpresiva es debido a las incontables situaciones traum\u00e1tica por las que se ha visto obligada a pasar de joven aunque sigo echando de menos poder interactuar con un personaje que exprese un poco m\u00e1s que no sea indiferencia o sarcasmo en todo momento). En cuanto al gameplay, es terriblemente adictivo, he perdido la cuenta de las veces que simplemente he estado recorriendo las mismas salas una y otra vez o realizando expediciones con tal de poder disfrutar del combate de este t\u00edtulo. A esto le sumas que los logros son desafiantes pero que con la suficiente habilidad y paciencia se pueden conseguir todos. Si en cualquier caso, terminas la historia principal, secundarias y DLC, el juego tambi\u00e9n ofrece otras actividades que pueden resultar un verdadero desaf\u00edo para que los que se crean capaces de exprimir al m\u00e1ximo las habilidades de Jesse. Si te has jugado Alan Wake, ten en cuenta que el gameplay es similar aunque mejorado hasta la saciedad dando lugar a una experiencia que no te ha hecho sentir que has perdido el tiempo sin embargo la historia no me pareci\u00f3 mejor o siquiera igual de buena.", "timestamp_created": 1689580665, "timestamp_updated": 1689580665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142248339": {"recommendationid": "142248339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990791711", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1146, "last_played": 1698731060}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS\nOne of the most visually impressive games ever. \nAn wondrous story which plays setup and payoff properly and is cohesive with game play.\nALL characters are very well acted.\nGameplay is exciting, not as exciting as DOOM but in a similar way.\nVery Spoopy\n\nCONS\nThird-Person shooter\nvery Spooky", "timestamp_created": 1689572091, "timestamp_updated": 1689572091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142242282": {"recommendationid": "142242282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989987952", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 471, "last_played": 1693107691}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is great except when it isn't.

Game tries to be a third person shooter and sucks at it in many ways but most importantly there is NO AIM ASSIST FOR CONTROLLER. If you try to be a souls-like game you set yourself that it will be played with a controller, and there is no aim assist. Yes there is aim assist for controllers option but it does nothing, further aim assist options are gated behind \"assist mode\" which hurts my feelings. There is a game that does aim assist perfectly, Metal Gear Solid V which i played for hours. Lore seemed intruiging but i won't play it for lore.

After Max Payne he fell off pretty hard. Similar to Alan Wake, the story in this game is an incomprehensive pretentious nonsense. It's just dumb.\n\nGameplay: the gameplay loop is a carbon copy of Alan Wake. Go from point A to B, kill waves of enemies, get back from point B to A, kill more waves of enemies. At least in this game there is a good variety of weapons and abilities; In Alan Wake it was just soul-crushingly dull.\n\nAnd they just added every clich\u00e9 in the modern video games. Of course the map is metroidvania-esque, of course there are bonfires instead of normal checkpoints, of course you lose resources upon dying, of course the main character is a brain-dead (so the target audience can relate) schizophrenic that never shuts up throughout the game, of course there are a hundred mundane chores of a side quest in the game, of course there is a several hours long crossover with another unrelated game to get people nostalgic and hyped-up for remasters and sequels, and much more.\n\nAnd something funny; Who are you in this game? The [b]\"director\"[/b] of a federal bureau of something. What do you do as a \"director\" there?

In the role of Jesse Feiden, you find yourself in a secret American agency called the Federal Bureau of Control in search of your brother, who was abducted by this agency several decades ago. However, the agency is empty and infected with some kind of psychic force. You find the dead director of the agency and automatically become the new director, taking his mental service weapon. And now you are faced with the task of using psychic abilities to rid the supernatural agency of the psychic force that has invaded it, while continuing to search for your own brother.\n\nThis particular initial situation is, in fact, very funny and fascinating. First of all, it offers the basis for an unusual and cool gameplay. Gradually, you unlock new psychic abilities and weapon modes to, for example, levitate or throw objects through the air. The gameplay is excellent and gives a lot of fun. Gradually, you work your way through various departments of power, learn more about them and about the supernatural-esoteric reality that the authorities are trying to hide from the public, and move the plot forward.\n\nThe extravagant nature of the story and the extravagant levels that follow from it are the best entertainment. Of course, if you like mundane literature, you should give preference to Control, but if you like fiction and mystery at least a little, you will get a whole truck of fun here. It is a pity, however, that much remains mysterious and unclear until the very end. But this in itself can be experienced.\n\nThe plot is more problematic. Not only does it have several holes, but, unfortunately, it remains extremely flat. This is facilitated by the extremely weak performance of the actors, and a poorly written script. The great catastrophe, the huge danger emanating from an alien force, all the victims to which it leads, as well as the supposedly very emotional search for a sibling are shown incredibly emotionless. The main character remains ultra-pale and seems untouched by all this horror. Unfortunately, this deprives the game of a huge amount of atmosphere, which in fact should make up a large part of the game.\n\nThere remains only an unusual gameplay. It's solid, and the controls are mostly very intuitive. However, in the second half of the game it loses its appeal because over time it seems extremely repetitive. As a result, even the unusual abilities of the main character lose their appeal at some point. There could be a lot more of them with a lot of variety. I think of a wild train chase with a movie camera at the ready. The game could have used more of these special moments. (And whoever is thinking now: what the hell did he mean by that?

The story as I remember it is OK, I used to realy dig in details and stuff, but maybe this is what got me so confused and purposeless in life. But it was first such game that I played or maybe even the first game, so that is why it realy impacted me, but now after playing Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal, I see from a different angle.

But for those interested in the details, here are the key points I wish to mention: \n\nPros:\n- Good aesthetic: The Oldest House and the Bureau have a consistent theme that meshes with the lore. The feel of the world combines well with the sound design.\n- Sound design: The atmosphere and music are all effective at creating a mood of an otherworldly place blended with the human influence of the Bureau. From the slight unease of exploring the offices and laboratories to the frenzied combat against the Hiss, you'll find yourself enjoying what's being presented.\n- Story: The story is generally good and the lore of the world, especially when considering the Foundation and AWE DLCs' contributions tickles my personal fancy greatly. One of the better stories I've experienced.\n- Doesn't Take Forever: Some games you return to for a number of different routes the story can take and the expansive world, but Control offers a solid alternative - It will give you a story and a world, then lets you proceed at them at your own pace, but also won't demand hundreds or thousands of hours of your commitment for you to get the most of Control.\n- Good price: Doesn't bleed your pockets dry, especially if bought during a sale.\n\nNeutrals:\n- Gameplay: It can be a mixed bag depending on the control setup and how you handle it, but the difficulty is generally good, though certain fights against a few bosses (optional and compulsory) can be incredibly rough due to Control's particular health management style where you might not get a chance to heal from certain enemies' aggressive damage output. Otherwise the gunplay and freedom of fighting that expands as you gain new abilities is highly enjoyable. Maneuvering around the environment and solving the odd puzzles are all generally enjoyable, though some puzzles can be somewhat obscure.\n- Random Documents and Audio Logs: The lore of Control is mainly presented via mix of documents and audio logs you pick up as you look around. Some are located in obscure locations and dark corners, but most are easy enough to find.\n\nCons:\n- Difficulty inconsistency: This is the major complaint I personally have. Certain enemy encounters, boss fights and side-missions suddenly spike up the difficulty to the point of you having to retry some encounters to the point of frustration. While you can somewhat adapt, it is not by much.\n- Resource management: The open-ish world structure of the Old House you explore over the game offers relative freedom, but also comes with the divisive presence of resources that you acquire randomly via defeating enemies and the odd resource cache that gives you 1-2 of a certain resource, which can make getting weapon upgrades somewhat tedious. Thankfully Control's resource grinding is far more lenient than some other games, but it might turn others off.\n- RNG: The RNG-reliant drop rates for resources and modifications for health, energy, weapon damage etc. are not overly complicated and there's enough variety to suit different playstyles, but having to sink time to acquire the right mods can be quite jarring, as you might end up with a slightly better or inferior duplicate of an already-owned modification for your trouble with no real control of the outcome. \n\nOverall\nGenerally speaking, Control Ultimate Edition is a very solid experience that doesn't overstay its welcome, its only major problem being an inconsistent difficulty curve. The trappings of resource gathering and RNG drops can be more of a problem to some than others, but generally the game offers an interesting story and setting that you get to explore with relative abandon.\n\n< Rating/Assessment/Grade positive/enjoyable/very cool.

Few complaints but nothing that wouldn't recommend picking it up and giving it a play through.\n\nFirst issue was around the enemies and how some of them spawn and how they deal damage. If an enemy can nearly one hit or take me down to a critical health level, it shouldn't be able to spawn right beside me and take out all my health. The number of times that happened pissed me off so much. Some of the enemies seemed to deal too much damage, or have too much evade too often. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the variety of enemy types but sometimes they just felt overpowered and no fun. These were imo so off putting that I'm taking away 2 points for them.\n\nThe next issue is around the fallout 4 style quest \"go defend this part of the map\". The first time I didn't realize it was a thing that continuously happens over and over. Really ruined my experience for a story focused game. I liked how the jukebox was there IF you wanted to do more content, but it was never required. These got in the way of missions, made travelling at times a pain. Not as upsetting as the enemy issue but still anothere -1 point.\n\nSo how do we get 8 if we take 3 off? Because the Ashtray maze level was so damn good I'm giving it a bonus point. It was a great length, beautifully designed. A ton of fun. Except for a time when one of the enemies spawned beside me and knocked me off my platform sending me back a few rooms (but I addressed that already).\n\nOverall this game was definitely worth the play through and I'd even consider replaying it in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1688605703, "timestamp_updated": 1688605703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141408858": {"recommendationid": "141408858", "author": {"steamid": "76561199497488633", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1693618815}, "language": "english", "review": "good\n", "timestamp_created": 1688600626, "timestamp_updated": 1688600626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141406532": {"recommendationid": "141406532", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987077975", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1695458906}, "language": "english", "review": "Said they patched the game so it would be playable offline.

One of the few times I actually wanted to know more and kept playing. The combat is crisp and is littered with eye candy, especially later in the game you feel badass. It does lack a bit of depth tho even at very end of the game. The story starts very vague but more stuff gets explained over time building a nice picture of whats going on. It is an interesting take on \"supernatural stuff happens\" and how the world tries to figure it out, explore its limits and of course gatekeep everything behind a government bureau. There are 10 main missions each lasting roughly an hour each. That is JUST the main story. I barely did side content cause I wanted to know more about the main story. Somehow this game has a \"skill tree\" with mostly passives and a very basic crafting and modifier system. Those do work okay but seem very very simple like \"+20% damage\" or \"+17% explosion radius\". To be honest these feel like an after thought. One more thing I really disliked, cause of the nature of being a huge bureau/indoor/office building, I often got lost for longer periods of time, the map is also very misleading and weird, I recommend not using the map ever and actually learning the layout and looking at signs around the map, this is what this was made for!\n\nThere is even some post-credit missions and other stuff and a challenge mode. \n\nIf you want to have a more story focused time, you can enable tons of \"cheats\" to make the combat just go over without any challenge like infinite HP or infinite damage, not my cup of tea but its nice for people that care about the story the most.\n\nTL;DR Good story, good graphics, okay combat, weird layout/getting lost often. 10h-ish gametime only playing main story.\n\n8/10 Pretty good, not a must play tho", "timestamp_created": 1688443289, "timestamp_updated": 1688477375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "141253534": {"recommendationid": "141253534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094439626", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 3542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3542, "last_played": 1688273260}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically SCP Containment Breach but with more focus on the company that contain those anomalies instead of focusing on the anomalies itself.

You will have to do this every time the nVidia driver updates (or until nVidia herelf disable it in the update).\n- If your screen goes black with just the outline of the object showing, just exit the game (not just the menu) and go back in. If this happen too often and your GPU is overclocked, try removing the OC (some people said it helped). My GPU is not overclocked and happened to me 4 times in my playthrough.\n- If your game keeps crashing in a particular level in the foundations DLC, disable e-cores in your bios. Re-enable them when you finish the game. I found out this too late and already uninstalled the game :( . Only one final boss missing, so not worth the time of installing again.\n\nMODS:\n-Better Character Illumination: because your character is 100% of the time in the middle of the screen and is very badly lighted. Just search for the mod on nexus, watch the screenshots and decide for yourself.\n- No other mods needed, the game is good.\n\nSHORT REVIEW (from someone with too little time for gaming)\nMy job allows me less then a couple of hours in the evening to play games, so keep that in mind.\nGame is short but good: my playtime counts for the main game, with all the good (I hope) side-missions and both DLCs.\nIf you don't plan to grind for upgrades (like me), you will have just 2/3 weapon maxed out by the end of the game (not counting DLCs).

It truly feels like an exploration mission. A player can decide how much they want to find and read those files, I do recommend you to aim to find and read everything! There are so many interesting things going on.\n\nThe characters are lovable too, from the Finnish janitor to some intriguing, slightly mentioned side characters and of course, our lovely main cast. Playing as Jesse felt really natural: she is a realistic character with realistic goals and attitudes. I hope we get to see more of her in Control 2!\n\nThe Ultimate Edition DLC also blends in really well, I did not even notice that I was playing DLC missions at some point of the game.

Some situations I just feel like I am made of tissue paper and will get torn to shreds while my bullets barely do damage even with powerful mods. I feel like I need to float around and run all over the place to avoid some base tier enemy's rain of fire. Seizing other enemies to make them your allies is cool and all but it seems like the second they are on your side their ai takes a nose dive and they never manage to contribute meaningfully to an encounter.

Late game get annoying as enemy telekinesis can two shot out of nowhere is the second to last battle. Coupled with far checkpoints can waste a lot of time if you keep dying.

Reminds me of SCP-Foundation, which the game is probably inspired by.\n\nThe game is a solid 9/10 for me, and the game gets on sale for like 10 euros with all expansions so pick it up if you're at all interested!", "timestamp_created": 1687911450, "timestamp_updated": 1687911450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140813703": {"recommendationid": "140813703", "author": {"steamid": "76561199290475754", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1034, "last_played": 1698501459}, "language": "spanish", "review": "didn\u00b4t know what to play and then I found this game", "timestamp_created": 1687900608, "timestamp_updated": 1687900608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493784517049789429", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140798410": {"recommendationid": "140798410", "author": {"steamid": "76561199085135756", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1531, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 326, "last_played": 1691562920}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the way this game messes with my perception of time and/or space. it kinda reminds me of the Inception movie in some ways.\n\nAlso, i'm only 5 hours in, but i really enjoyed the combat mechanics that i have unlocked thus far. i look forward to the next weapons/abilities that i'll unlock \ud83d\ude03", "timestamp_created": 1687882396, "timestamp_updated": 1687882396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140792718": {"recommendationid": "140792718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041251670", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1097, "last_played": 1687535565}, "language": "english", "review": "You have a gun which can turn into a whole bunch of different types of gun yet somehow picking up a few bins and hauling them at the bad guys is more powerful.

Do you enjoy weird horror mythos like the SCP Foundation wiki, the X-Files, or Twin Peaks? Do you enjoy games with a focus on theme and world-building over a character-driven storyline? Do you enjoy games that reward exploration with lore tidbits that help piece together what's going on in the world around your character?\n\nIf so, then [i]Control[/i] is absolutely a must-play game for you. Stop reading this review and go play it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you prefer linear games that put story and characters first, or stories that leave no question unanswered, then you may want to skip this one. Read on for more details.\n\n[i]Control[/i] is a game that does a few things phenomenally well. It maintains an atmosphere of mystery, a sense that every shadow hides some horrible monstrosity that strains the bounds of human comprehension, the entire way through the story, without ever breaking it even after the conclusion. As much as is revealed about the Oldest House, the various otherworldly items and beings that populate it, and the workings of both in the wider world, more is left unsaid. The game's conclusion won't leave you with all the answers, but it will leave you with enough implications to piece together some of them for yourself. And in a story like this one, that's a rare achievement that is deserving of emphasis.\n\nWhile the environments in [i]Control[/i] may seem intimidatingly labyrinthine at first, the abilities that allow the player to fully explore the game's world are front-loaded into the first half or so of the game's story, and the areas are interconnected in such a way that you really only ever need to backtrack if you want to explore for more lore, items, or side quests. Backtracking is made easy via the liberal placement of Control Points, which fill your health bar, act as save points, and allow for fast travel. It's a simple, functional system that invites exploration and rewards the player for indulging in it, without the monotony that plagues many other exploration-focused games of this type.\n\nFinally, the set pieces that Remedy is known for return here in spectacular fashion. If you're a fan of their previous titles, you'll get your fill of new music from Poets of the Fall, accompanying moments where everything clicks and you're fighting against the odds to overcome an exciting and memorable challenge. Nobody does these set pieces like Remedy, and they were some of my favorite parts of the entire game.\n\nWhich brings me to the parts of [i]Control[/i] that were a letdown. First and foremost, like many \"open-world\" titles of its time, this game is bloated. For some players, this won't be an issue, because the movement mechanics are solid and the environments are interesting and well-designed. But the sheer amount of areas to explore and hidden secrets to find works against the game in two major ways--its itemization and its main story.\n\nFirst, itemization. The weapon variations and upgrade system in [i]Control[/i] are serviceable, but its system of randomized add-ons that provide percentage-based stat boosts are an entirely unnecessary addition to the game. Most of them either stack on top of upgrade bonuses or are so niche in their effects as to be useless unless you are spamming one very specific sequence of attacks over and over. On top of that, there is a limit to the number you can carry, meaning you'll have to pause what you're doing relatively frequently throughout the game to clear them out. And when you realize that about half the hidden areas in the game only contain a couple of random add-ons or crafting materials, it becomes immediately apparent that cutting out this system entirely along with some of the superfluous secret areas would have made the game flow [i]much[/i] better.\n\nNow for the story and characters, which will be the final nail in the coffin for a large number of players who might be interested in [i]Control[/i]. While the premise, world-building, and atmosphere of this game are all top-notch, the main story is simply not very interesting apart from a couple of great set-pieces. The primary culprit here is the characters. A small handful of characters are simply fantastic, with incredible voice-acting and memorable personalities. The rest of them, including (unfortunately) the main protagonist Jesse Faden, are inexplicably void of all charisma, personality, or character flaws. Exacerbating this to a grating degree is the limited dialogue system, which punctuates boring infodumps with jarring and totally unnecessary glimpses into Jesse's internal monologue. And this is a shame, because anyone familiar with Remedy's previous games will know that character writing is absolutely one of their strong suits. I don't know what went wrong in the writing room here--maybe too much of a focus on the majority of female characters presenting a \"strong\", unfazed demeanor in spite of the weirdness around them?--but whatever it was, it hamstrung the main story of this game in a big way. This, more than anything else, is what will ruin the game for the majority of players that bounce off it.\n\nSo is [i]Control[/i] a game you should play? Let me give some context. Normally, I'm the type of person who enjoys a great story and smooth mechanics above all else in my games. I'm on the edge of being the type of player who would probably bounce off a game like [i]Control[/i]. But if there is one thing I can say for Remedy as developers, it is that they (usually) seem to have a very clear idea of what they want to create in their games, and once they have that idea, they go for it full-throttle. In this case, they went full-throttle towards creating their own take on a world of SCP-like extraplanar entities and shadowy government agencies, grounded by references to real-world events and conspiracy theories and tying their previous games together into a semi-cohesive world. And when it comes to that aspect of [i]Control[/i], they absolutely [i]nailed it[/i], and that's what won me over.\n\nSo if that aspect of the game sounds intriguing to you, or if you answered \"yes\" to the questions at the start of this review and for some reason didn't heed my suggestion to stop reading and go play the game, then yes, you should give [i]Control[/i] a shot. But if you feel that the flaws I've described are too much for you to look past, then I wouldn't recommend it for you.\n\n[b] IMPORTANT CAVEAT (minor spoilers ahead)[/b]:\n\nIf you are looking forward to [i]Alan Wake II[/i], and you think you can look past the shortcomings of [i]Control[/i], it may be worth playing through the game and its DLC for story-related reasons. Additionally, if you haven't played the original [i]Alan Wake[/i], I [i]strongly[/i] suggest you do so before playing [i]Control[/i]. It is the better game in a number of ways, and you owe it to yourself not to spoil it.\n\n[spoiler]The second DLC (AWE) ties [i]Control[/i] very strongly into the world of [i]Alan Wake[/i], and heavily implies that the Federal Bureau of Control and/or the Oldest House will have some role to play in the upcoming [i]Alan Wake II[/i]. This will likely be more than a couple of simple lore references, so while you probably won't [i]need[/i] to have played [i]Control[/i] to understand [i]Alan Wake II[/i], you will most likely miss some major story connections if you haven't played it.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1687738053, "timestamp_updated": 1687738053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470852047204971313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "140702031": {"recommendationid": "140702031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161225685", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2064, "last_played": 1688508806}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

No I can't be arsed installing mods and fucking about with config files. I expect the dev to do that for me.

At the end of the main story there are several forced consecutive and intense battles, I have to admit that's my least favorite part, fortunately, even if you die and reload the progress is partially saved, and they are not really that difficult.\n\nI saw many complains about the lack of navigation system or how confuse the 2D map is. For me that's a no issue, as when I played the game I quickly noticed there are signs are plates all over there. And after cleared the main story, I realized the map is very accurate, and there is really no magical rooms that used dimensional folding techniques, or anything such as an upward elevator leads to a lava poor, even though I wouldn't be surprised as they fits the theme well, and I was expecting something like a false map caused by the building shifts, but that didn't happened.\n\nMost of the puzzles can find their hints in the surround environment, some of the puzzles has very important hints in the dialogue, so if you skipped it or missed it could be very hard. Some of the side quests can be very toxic.\n\nWhat I like the most is the sound FX/music aspect of the game, the developers have definitely made lot of effort on the details, and they did too much on rendering the horrific emotion which effectively made the initial sequences of the game like a horror game to me.

The lighting is beautiful. Definitly worth playing with ray tracing. The way they use lighting to fill the atmosphere is unlike anything I have seen in a game. The areas are surprisingly diverse for an office building setting.\n\nCombat is pretty fun. Mostly using throwing powers and finishing with gun play. Dashes. This game has fun mechanics, but the main focus of the game seems to be story and mystery. The game isnt fight bad things in this room, then move to the next room and fight more. There are decent areas of exploration and story discovery mixed in. The pacing seems pretty good so far. I have hit a steep difficulty issue, where i might be under leveled. The difficulty spike was harsh and I am trying to do side quests to be more powerful. It is interesting that going back to other areas the mobs are easier now. The mobs are numbered with how hard they are and low number mobs are really easy now. After doing some side quests the difficulty corrected itself. By the time I beat the game and moved on to the expansion I was overpowered.\n\nThe story is very interesting. A mystery, similar to stranger things vibe. It goes deep, but also stays shallow. The lore is there if you want to dive into it, but you dont have to. It is a very mystery filled world. Even after beating the game, there are tons of questions left unanswered. I bet a lot of them would be answered if I read the lore. Overall very interesting story.\n\nI beat the main story at 21 hours. The difficulty level was pretty good throughout accepting the one part where i was under leveled. I dont really understand the story, but it was very interesting. I will just go to youtube for explanations. After beating the game it goes right into expansions which is pretty cool. I was still interested in playing the expansion, but by the time I finished the foundation expansion, I was ready to be done with the game. Over all I thought this was a really well done game with an interesting story and insanely good graphics.

There just should be more delved into with that, it's the most fun and interesting.  \nAnyway the game loves killing you but there is just way way way to much time spent backtracking through areas. My tolerance to dying early in a long fight and having to do it again is lower than average but not anything crazy--but this game saps any patience you have for redoing *anything*, it is constantly making you slog through something again.  Especially travel. I love exploration and these environments are fabulous but my god I have to go through this sub area *AGAIN*? I can only get back there through this route?  Its big but not open, so its painful to navigate. Even with the additional warp points added later on, its still not good enough. Places rarely if ever become relevant again they way you want, it does happen but it could have been more. \nHonestly the story and collectibles and exploration are by far the best part and you should play for that alone. The combat is the least interesting but the game is much more keyed into that, you can adjust the difficulty and there is some granular so that does respond to my criticisms but it becomes weird, like, it does change the game! They designed it to be hard and have you do things over many times. It is its nature. It can be frustrating in a way where you go \"why am I doing this?\" way too much.\nAnd inventory management is a chore to boot, a real pet peeve.\nAlso, what I thought was going to happen was more interesting than what did. What did happen was still interesting though.\nAlso, the game is TERRIFYING  in a very particular way. I mean that is a massive success on their part but if you have a wild imagination like I do you will turn some lights on when you go to bed after playing this game!!

One of the tags in his game is horror, and while the storyline is a bit creepy as you go through it, and the environment is a little spooky, I wouldn't come out and call this a horror game. You play as Jesse Faden in the search for her brother. In order to really appreciate this game you must read all of the lore pages scattered throughout the world and look through every nook to find all of the secrets. I personally feel that playing without doing this is a disservice as you miss a lot of great background information. For me personally, I am not a big fan of shooter games and this might have had more combat than I would particular like, especially through the DLC, I feel it is definitely worth it for the storyline alone.

At first glance it seems to be a gorgeous triple A title with smooth gameplay, then you look a little closer and realize that all those ray traced surfaces take 3 seconds to texture no matter what you try or hardware you use. Combat seems pretty interesting with a bunch of powers like telekinesis.. except.. it isn't. Psi-Ops did it better over a decade ago. The enemies are boring, repetitive, and either never a threat or ready to insta-kill you. You start to realize that CONTROL boasts something of an open world Metroid-vania, only to come to the conclusion that it's confusing as fuck and never really directs you where to go. This wouldn't be such an issue if everything didn't look like an office building no matter where you go. Finally you unlock flight so you can go back and get all those secrets you missed along the way.. except they don't matter because mods for your character and weapon are not subjective, they're either better or they're not, +10% damage or +20%, no trade off, and it isn't hard to get the best. Well at least I can unlock a cool skin for the player character to choose how I tackle the game visually.. except you can't. You only get an interesting skin once the campaign is over. One thing I will say for CONTROL is that the side quests are well thought out and interesting.

Finding the redacted files, the different effects that OoP and AI have, the hidden locations. Everything works. I found the story engaging enough, even when you play it a second time (this is my second run). The DLC's are pretty long and with added mechanics that makes the game not repetitive. I haven't played the Alan Wake games but i got the basis of the story enough to enjoy the AWE DLC. \n\nThe achievements are not hard at all, in fact with just a bit attention to surroundings and exploration, you probably will get most of them naturally. My only recommendation is that you do the Board Countermeasures as you play, since if you left it all until the end like me, you are gonna have a bad time. After finishing the main missions, both in the main story and the DLC's, the amount of enemies drops to nearly 0, so it becomes a bit of a hassle to do this.

What's the story like? Well, you play as Jesse Faden, a young woman who arrives in New York in search of her brother, believing he might be held in the Federal Bureau of Control. When they were kids, strange events happened in their hometown, and this is when Jesse's younger brother was captured by the FBC, while she managed to run away, helped by Polaris, a mysterious entity that accompanies our hero. Once inside the FBC, things seem to take a turn for the worse, as the entire facility is on lockdown, having been invaded by a mysterious entity, only known as \"the Hiss\", capable of controlling the minds of unprotected FBC employees. Honestly, I can't go into much more detail, as it'd both be spoiler heavy, and incredibly trippy for me to explain. Let me say this, though, if you enjoy stories about nebulous government organizations dealing with paranormal shit, this game might be right up your alley.\n\nNow, following on with the story, or rather the writing, I think it's one of the strongest aspects of the game. Maybe not necessarily because of the main story, that might depend on you. However, I loved all the background details you could learn about through collectibles, as it really humanizes the FBC personnel. Usually, when there's stories about mysterious organizations like the FBC, their employees are all super serious all the time. Not here, here you can see how these people were just like any other common worker; while there were some weirder characters, most of them were just people with their jobs and their regular lives, with the exception that their job consisted in protecting the public, and maybe reality itself, from threats beyond our wildest imaginations.\n\nGameplay wise... Well, I'll admit that after I got to the first boss, I went to the options menu and activated the \"invincibility\" cheat. You can still die from fall damage, it's just enemies can't kill you, and while it's true that I might've deprived myself from the challenge of combat, I still had a lot of fun with the combat, despite the lack of risks. For combat, you get a single weapon, the Service Weapon. However, it is what the game calls an \"Object of Power\", and it's capable of changing between different forms, although you can only have two forms equipped at the same time. Even then, you also get some cool telekinetic powers, like a melee blast, and the ability to launch random objects towards your enemies. There's a rather extensive skill tree with a lot of upgrades, and you can also upgrade all the Service Weapon forms; not to mention the \"mods\" you can get both for your weapon, and your character itself.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great, though I gotta say, by the time I got to the DLCs, after beating the main story, I started experiencing some semi-frequent crashes, which made finishing them rather annoying. Speaking of the DLCs, the game includes all of them. The Expeditions DLC is a relatively simple challenge mode of sorts, for getting extra resources and such. The story DLCs, on the other hand, are The Foundation, and AWE. The first one has you go to the depths of the Oldest House (the setting of the game), in order to deal with something that threatens not only the Oldest House itself, but maybe all of reality, while AWE... Well, those initials might as well stand for the Alan Wake Experience. That's right, while the main game has some references to Alan Wake, this DLC is a straight-up crossover, with some really interesting bits of lore added to the interconnected Remedy Universe.\n\nFinally, I was forgetting about sound design. For the most part, it's very good, though one minor annoyance I had is that the game uses your system language as default. In my case, it's Spanish, but I like playing games on English, and while you can change audio and text dialogue (I did), the Hiss' \"chant\" remains on the system language. Despite being my native language, I couldn't really understand what they were chanting until I learned of this fact; I guess it wasn't helped by the fact that the Spanish accent is different from Latin American accent. A cool concept, in theory, but it can get lost. Oh, another thing I was forgetting, the soundtrack; it's excellent, particularly during a certain story section that I won't spoil, but if you're familiar with Alan Wake, I'll say it involves the Old Gods of Asgard.\n\nAll things considered, I can say I recommend Control.

If you die, you are penalized and you are returned to the closest control point and you have to start over and over and over and over and over and over again. This is just frustrating. Would have been much better to be returned to the point where I died. I initially gave up but then discovered the assist mode and proceeded with it for the sake of the story. \nThe story is also not as good as in AW. I just don't get it. It is told mostly through documents, a lot of text, text, text, text, text that one has to read to understand what's going on. And everything is dark all the time. The storytelling component is just not the best. \n\nI would say that for a big Alan Wake fan this game was a bit disappointing.

What I ended up with was the virtual equivalent of a hamster wheel.'Control' clearly puts the 'art' in 'artificial intelligence'. Its enemies exhibit the kind of brilliant diversity typically reserved for a pack of lemmings heading towards a cliff. After a few rounds of combat, I found myself thinking, \u201cWhy use strategy, when you can simply press the same sequence of keys until your fingers develop a mind of their own?\u201dThe game's location, The Federal Bureau of Control, felt like an endless, twisting labyrinth. Unfortunately, the minotaur at its center had apparently taken a long vacation, and in his place was the echo of the same three or four encounters that I'd had at the start of the game. With every turn, I felt like a seasoned time traveler, having seen it all before.Then there's the narrative. 'Control's story is as abstract as a Picasso painting. The problem is, Picasso never charged me fifty bucks to figure out what the heck is going on in one of his paintings. By the time I pieced together the scattered documents and cryptic video messages, I was less concerned about the paranormal activities and more concerned about my creeping existential dread.At the end of the day, 'Control' is not just a game. It's a monotonous techno-ballet. It's a symphony played on one note. It's the gaming equivalent of Groundhog Day, minus the charm of Bill Murray and the relief of a new day.In conclusion, if you're an enthusiast of pressing the same keys repeatedly while navigating through an ever-recycling landscape of baddies, then 'Control' might just be the greatest thing since pre-sliced bread. For everyone else... Well, you might find more variety in watching paint dry.

The backdrop of the game had a lot of potential as its mysterious and creepy atmosphere captured my interest immediately. However, the overarching main story doesn't take this further, especially in the area of enemy design. Most of the enemies throughout the main story remain the same, with the really interesting ones being in the side content and I'm really not sure why they weren't introduced in the main game. The creepy/mysterious atmosphere sort of stays stagnant and is never really elevated. Sure, the world gets expanded upon in the form of collectibles but I can't help but feel that form of storytelling is a bit outdated. The weapon/personal mods doesn't really add that much to the game, nor did it really change up my playstyle and it felt too game-ified and I think it would have been better if it was left out entirely. \n\nHowever, where this game really excels is in its gameplay and the level design. Hurling objects at enemies, controlling them, and being able to levitate and shoot from above never ceased to feel satisfying even when the enemy types didn't change much. The way the level shifts, move, and its use of bizarre geometric effects really sells the paranormal backdrop and its always mesmerizing to see. The Ashtray Maze is the best example of that and I wish the game had more of that. \n\nOverall, it's a fine game.

The ending also feels somewhat forced, i almost thought it was [spoiler] another fakeout instead of the real ending [/spoiler]. \nStill overall a great experience, the DLCs are absolutely worth it for the ultimate edition. \nAshtray Maze is best.", "timestamp_created": 1685559409, "timestamp_updated": 1685559409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139293613": {"recommendationid": "139293613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046183760", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2063, "last_played": 1685589120}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1685494993, "timestamp_updated": 1685494993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139289222": {"recommendationid": "139289222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998324424", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 4424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1446, "last_played": 1687040264}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool 3rd-person shooter with some additional \"powers\".

Its...a nice peek into all these what if, and the original mythos of the old house, service weapon, and the board really brings it to a nice package of crazy theories and story boarding.\n\nall in all, I must say it was a wonderful ride, and not particularly long, if all you want are the story boards.

It has a strong protagonist, interesting side characters, a very weird, mysterious setting and lore, and an alright story. The mystery setting and weirdness are basically the main selling points.\nIt doesn't hurt that it looks beautiful and runs very well.\nThe expansions are also well thought out (except Expeditions, fuck Expeditions) and connect the game to some of the previous work done by the studio.\n\nHowever, there are a few glaring problems that have never been fixed and which spoiled a lot of the experience for me. For example, if you finish the game and decide to alt+tab out while the credits roll, upon your return the credits will stop and you will be prevented from acquiring the 3 collectibles you would have received had the credits not been interrupted. And collectibles that expand on lore in a lore-heavy game are a big deal.\n\nThere have also been points in the game where it just stopped working, gave me a black screen, and prevented me from shutting it down or killing it with Task Manager, so I had to do a hard reset. The last time being just now, and along the way it erased about 3 hours of my progress. That's the main reason for the negative review, this shit should have been fixed ages ago.\n\nIt seems this particular issue only affects the Foundation expansion as it happened multiple times there.\n\nControl really deserves a glowing recommendation. But I can't give one to a game that deletes hours of my progress if it fucking feels like it.\n\nEDIT: I really really like the game and its weird and twisted charm that it simply overwhelms any technical inadequacies, so I'm changing the review to positive.

I wish the gameplay mechanics were as creative as everything else in this game, but there is certainly enough to more than balance the scales. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1684926605, "timestamp_updated": 1684926605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138892097": {"recommendationid": "138892097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072206214", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4737, "last_played": 1685095106}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1684915799, "timestamp_updated": 1684915799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138885735": {"recommendationid": "138885735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037205306", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 389, "last_played": 1691969152}, "language": "english", "review": "Challenging boss fight.", "timestamp_created": 1684904065, "timestamp_updated": 1684904065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138881800": {"recommendationid": "138881800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294731176", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1905, "last_played": 1681263557}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the only games that made me want to run around for achievements just as an excuse to play it more.

As a professional gamer, I have had the pleasure of diving into its gripping narrative, dynamic gameplay, and stunning visuals. Control is a game that truly stands out in the industry, delivering a unique and unforgettable adventure that will leave players captivated from start to finish.\n\nStoryline:\nControl takes players on a twisted journey through the enigmatic Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) as they assume the role of Jesse Faden, the newly appointed Director. The narrative unfolds with a perfect blend of mystery, supernatural elements, and psychological twists. The storytelling is masterfully executed, keeping players engaged with its deep lore and unexpected plot revelations. The game's atmosphere is superbly eerie, creating a sense of unease that only intensifies as the story progresses. Control's storyline is an immersive rollercoaster ride that will leave you questioning your own perception of reality.\n\nGameplay:\nControl's gameplay mechanics are where the game truly shines. Players are equipped with a shape-shifting weapon, the Service Weapon, and gain a variety of supernatural abilities as they progress. The combat is fast-paced, satisfying, and incredibly dynamic. The ability to telekinetically hurl objects at enemies or create shields to deflect incoming attacks adds a refreshing twist to the traditional third-person shooter genre.\n\nOne of the standout features of Control is the inclusion of the \"Bureau's Oldest House,\" a shifting and mysterious environment that serves as the game's setting. The architectural design and attention to detail are breathtaking, with each area feeling distinct and carefully crafted. The game world constantly challenges players with shifting rooms, hidden passages, and mind-bending puzzles. Navigating the Oldest House is an adventure in itself, as players unravel its secrets and explore its intricacies.\n\nVisuals and Sound Design:\nVisually, Control is a feast for the eyes. The game boasts stunning graphics, detailed environments, and impressive particle effects that bring the supernatural elements to life. The game's lighting, in particular, is exceptional, adding to the overall atmosphere and immersion. The Oldest House is a mesmerizing blend of brutalist architecture and otherworldly aesthetics, creating a truly unique and unforgettable backdrop.\n\nThe sound design in Control deserves special mention. From the hauntingly atmospheric music to the crisp sound effects, every audio element is carefully crafted to enhance the overall experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with strong performances that effectively convey the emotions and complexities of the characters.\n\nWhether you're a fan of action-packed combat or deeply immersive storytelling, Control delivers on all fronts.

It didn't demand much, and simultaneously failed to allow the player different ways to overcome enemies. \n\nThey all had a very particular way to overcome without it being too exciting as you would get in an action game.\n\nI don't recommend this for many gamers, I can think of plenty of games to sink your teeth in before this one.\n\nSuch as Metal Gear Solid :Phantom Pain.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1684723424, "timestamp_updated": 1684723424, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456431567668914795", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138724313": {"recommendationid": "138724313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360429357", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1688598174}, "language": "english", "review": "Control: A Sci-Fi Symphony of Desire\n\nPrepare yourselves, fellow gamers, for a review that shall take you on a bewildering journey into the depths of dumbfounded infatuation and unquenchable lust. Control, a hauntingly atmospheric sci-fi masterpiece, beckons us with its sinister allure, enveloping us in a world where intelligence takes a backseat to primal desires.\n\nLet us first delve into the alluring main character, Jesse Faden. Oh, Jesse, the epitome of irresistible allure and unattainable beauty. With her enigmatic gaze and commanding presence, she bewitches the feeble minds of us mere mortals, leaving us drooling in awe. Her every movement, every flicker of emotion, stirs the loins and ignites a burning passion that defies all reason. The writer of this review is unabashedly enamored, hopelessly devoted to Jesse Faden in a manner that transcends the boundaries of sanity.\n\nBut let us not be distracted by matters of the heart, for Control presents a sci-fi landscape that is as perplexing as it is captivating. The atmospheric ambiance, with its eerie whispers and unsettling shadows, casts a spell of bewilderment upon the feeble-minded. The intricate web of mystery and intrigue leaves the writer of this review dumbfounded, desperately grasping at straws to comprehend the intricacies of the narrative. But who needs intelligence when desire reigns supreme, right?\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of Control, a tapestry of supernatural abilities and mind-bending puzzles, are a playground for the feeble-minded and the lust-driven. The writer of this review, lost in a sea of confusion and carnal longing, fumbles through the game's challenges with a level of ineptitude that is both embarrassing and oddly arousing. The thrill of conquest, both intellectual and sensual, fuels the fire of desire that burns within the writer's loins.\n\nIn conclusion, Control is a tantalizing sci-fi adventure that ignites primal desires and leaves the intellect in a state of disarray. Its creepy atmosphere and enigmatic narrative captivate the senses, while the irresistibly alluring Jesse Faden commands the hearts and minds of the dumbstruck masses. Prepare to be dumbfounded, my fellow gamers, as you embark on a journey that tests your intelligence and leaves you yearning for the unattainable. Control, a game that appeals to the basest instincts, shall forever hold a special place in the writer's heart, alongside his undying love for Jesse Faden.", "timestamp_created": 1684711127, "timestamp_updated": 1684711127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138715826": {"recommendationid": "138715826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198866060715", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 3983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3831, "last_played": 1685745023}, "language": "english", "review": "I never play shooters (first person or third person), but Control got my attention somehow and I thought I'd try it out.

Secondly the game has quite a few several issues, the combat is not one of them, although it can get a bit repetitive it is enjoyable for the most part if you max out the telekinesis ability or whatever it is called then all the madness can ensue, you can literally destroy even the stronges of enemies with ease. It can get a bit repeptitive but it looks so damn good, so many effects and neat graphics, its fun. \n\nHowever the backtracking is a big nono for me, I hate it in a story based games. Next one is the overabudnacne of reading material, this was so unbearable picking new and new material to spool through over and over again, I just did not care, even though it could expand the story which is in my humble opinion quite convoluted and nonsensical for me. If you think the story of Alan Wake was hard for you to follow, wait for this. Why are there people levitating in the air, why are there enemeis that glow red and can levitate, throw stuff at you and explode on you. God knows why, I haven't managed to get into the grips with the story. I just cannot comprehend it, even though I read throgh the lovely making of Control book/artbook I still do not understand neither of it.\n\nOk now lets get back to the dlc, the first one, the foundation, was tedious...like really boring , I did not like it, it was like a tacked on experience. But the second one tying Alan Wake universe with Controls was a blast to play through, much more coherent and I kinda understand it a bit. Both of this dlc are couple of hours long so get it if you like a nice alan wake tie in.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it, the graphics, sound, the music , especially the track playing in the maze, it was fantastic, not as good as in Alan Wake, the huge concert with the old dudes but still great guitar riffs. The Combat is somewhat enjoyable, yet can get repetitive quite quickly right from the start and the backtracking is awful, so is the overload of reading material where you literally pick new and new material every minute....

Developed by Remedy Entertainment, the creators of Max Payne and Alan Wake, Control takes players on a mind-bending adventure filled with intrigue, danger, and awe-inspiring moments. With its exceptional world-building, compelling characters, and unique gameplay mechanics, Control has undoubtedly raised the bar for action-adventure games.\n\nStoryline and Atmosphere:\nIn Control, players step into the shoes of Jesse Faden, a young woman searching for her missing brother while investigating a clandestine government agency known as the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC). As Jesse delves deeper into the mysteries of the FBC's imposing headquarters, the Oldest House, she discovers a parallel dimension known as the Astral Plane and encounters a host of enigmatic entities.\n\nThe narrative of Control is a tour de force, expertly weaving elements of supernatural horror, science fiction, and psychological thriller. Every corner of the game is rich with lore, collectibles, and hidden secrets that immerse players in a dark and twisted world. The meticulously crafted atmosphere, enhanced by hauntingly beautiful visuals and a hauntingly atmospheric score, ensures that Control's grip on players' imagination remains unyielding from beginning to end.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\nWhat sets Control apart from its contemporaries is its ingenious gameplay mechanics. Jesse is armed with a shape-shifting weapon called the Service Weapon, which adapts into various forms, including a pistol, shotgun, and more. This dynamic arsenal, coupled with Jesse's ability to harness supernatural powers known as \"The Director's Abilities,\" provides players with an unprecedented level of control over the battlefield.\n\nThe combat in Control is a mesmerizing dance of destruction, offering a perfect blend of gunplay and psychic abilities. The frantic battles against otherworldly foes are exhilarating, enhanced by destructible environments and physics-based effects. Every encounter is a strategic puzzle that encourages experimentation, as players unlock new abilities and upgrades, amplifying Jesse's arsenal and augmenting her powers.\n\nMoreover, the Oldest House itself acts as a living, shifting entity, with the architecture and surroundings constantly morphing and transforming. The mind-bending level design keeps players on their toes, creating a sense of disorientation that perfectly mirrors the game's surreal themes.\n\nCharacters and Voice Acting:\nControl boasts a diverse cast of characters, each with their own compelling stories and motivations. Jesse Faden is a magnetic protagonist, portrayed with remarkable depth by Courtney Hope, whose performance brings the character to life. The supporting cast, including the enigmatic former Director Trench, the resourceful Emily Pope, and the charismatic janitor Ahti, are equally well-written and superbly voiced.\n\nTechnical Achievement:\nFrom a technical standpoint, Control is a marvel. The game pushes the boundaries of visual fidelity, with stunning graphics and meticulous attention to detail. The lighting effects, particle physics, and realistic material interactions create an immersive world that feels alive. Whether exploring the vast, concrete corridors of the Oldest House or venturing into the ethereal Astral Plane, the visual presentation is nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nConclusion:\nControl is an exceptional gaming experience that should not be missed by any fan of the action-adventure genre. Its engrossing storyline, innovative gameplay mechanics, and immersive atmosphere combine to deliver an unforgettable journey into the unknown. Remedy Entertainment has crafted a gem that seamlessly blends the boundaries between reality and the supernatural, leaving players in awe of its sheer brilliance.

The visuals are wonderful. The story is somewhat interesting. The setting is great. But there are serious problems with the game design that make it simply not-a-very-fun experience. Some of them:\n\n1. Unclear objectives and navigation. It's just too hard to find your way around. You spend way too much time looking for locations that should be straightforward. A breadcrumb system would \"dumb down\" the game but also make it much more enjoyable.\n2. Mushy combat. Combat is just not that satisfying, and that's a huge problem for a game in which physics-based combat is a huge attraction. The guns feel wimpy. It's hard to know when you're hitting or not. There's just not enough feedback in general, not enough clarity about what is happening, why, or how much, with the consequence that combat tends to be a matter of trying to find a decent position (that could change suddenly because of a secretly spawned-in enemy), softening up enemies with telekinetic objects, then killing them with a rather wimpy gun. The physics-based control power is very cool but not enough to make fights really satisfying.\n3. Strange and unclear level-up mechanism. There are lots of things you can level-up but none of them are very clear or delightful. It took me a long time to discover that I could level up my core abilities from the fast travel menu at checkpoints.\n4. Words, words, words. Tons of noise coming in about all the \"assets\" (meaningless), mods (often redundant), and intel (useful? useless?) you pick up as you move about. The Director video segments are incredibly boring to watch/listen to, yet might harbor useful information, I guess? Storyful games often have this problem of making the story too heavy-handed and dull. This one, which does give you the option to ignore or skip much of the story elements--documents and so on--flashes red triangles over sections you haven't read yet. I feel like the game is as nagging as my text/email inboxes.\n5. Strange, strange pace. The game starts in medias res, in the middle of things, as you walk in with no prior set-up to the Bureau of Control. Suddenly you're in the middle of things, and although the story unfolds over time the game in general has a terrible monotony about it. Weapons upgrade very slowly. Environments change slightly. New abilities appear. New enemies appear. But it's all kind of the same, as you've come into a game that's already two-thirds of the way through and just winding down.\n6. General lack of player-friendliness. To open a loot box (so to speak) you have to hold down the F key. Tapping it would be a little nicer, but whatever. What's worse is that you have to be closer to the box than I ever expect to open it. I will often run up to a box or document and press the F key only to discover that the game wasn't *quite* ready for me to press F yet. Playtesting should have shown the developers that just a *little* wider radius on the interaction circle would have paid off in much less frustration for players. A similar complaint but different: I'm often in a mission and know in essence what I must do: get rid of the slime from the pipe system, for example. But then once the slime is all gone... is it gone? Was that it? Am I done? Is there something else I need to do? In one game you're putting \"trash\" into a furnace (the \"trash\" turns out to be something else, not trash), and when you're all done... nothing. You're done, I guess? The game is just not very clear about a lot of things: what you're doing, where to go, whether an enemy missile is flying toward you, what to do next, what in the mission is left unfinished, how to level up, what weapon mods mean. There is a \"soupy\" quality to the game that most modern games have learned to clean up, to sharpen and make clearer and more satisfying.\n\nIt's a beautiful, beautiful game, and not a terrible game by any means. In fact it has so much greatness in it that its failures are all the more frustrating.

This game is funny, surreal, visually and sonically impressive, and has their most fun gameplay since Max Payne 2. However, it's not a game I desire to replay after finishing all of the main content.\n\nTo start off positive, the atmosphere in this game is fantastic. The 70s-era government prison/research facility for supernatural entities that warp reality it is both a wonderfully spooky concept and fully realized. And there is a surprising amount of variety between the areas of the building. It's basically the highest production value SCP game out there at the moment. The weapons and supernatural powers are a blast to use, especially the telekinetic throw which is incredibly destructive.\n\nDestruction is what makes this combat so awesome in general. Your average fight will obliterate office furniture, crumble pillars, and smash through thin walls. It's the kind of destruction I always envisioned games of the future having back in the mid 2000s.\n\nAnd the sound of everything is so well done too. The guns all have punch to them, the high pitched warp and deep bass hits of the telekinetic powers sounds badass, and of course the soundtrack sets the creepy mood and pounding action perfectly. There's a particular vocal track that plays when the game is firing on all cylinders that I don't wanna spoil, but I just have to bring up because it is one of the best action setpieces Remedy has ever done and one of the best in any game of recent memory. The way the track loops to match your pace as you traverse the area it plays in is just perfect.\n\nHowever, with the exception of some boss battles and an extremely frustrating timed section that is thankfully optional, this game isn't all that challenging. The telekinetic grab and throw is too powerful and is by far the most useful combat ability. Very rarely did I have to use things like the shield, mind control, or the melee abilities. And when I reached a point where they might've been more useful, the ability upgrade system the game has basically ensured that I committed to abusing the throw.\n\nSpeaking of upgrade systems, there's one for weapons that is almost entirely useless. You can add passive bonuses to the weapons you have equipped, but they don't really have a significant impact on your playstyle until you get some of the more powerful ones late in the game. So for 50-60% of the game it's basically useless. Also, I really hate how you can only use two weapon forms at a given time and have to swap out for others in a menu. They really should've all been available at once like Max Payne's arsenal, and instead of upgrades that fill up your inventory with useless junk, should've had an experience system similar to how abilities worked at the very least. But since the game is so easy that this whole weapon loadout and upgrade system can basically be ignored, the complaints I have about it feel insignificant.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this game is that the story is pretty forgettable, which is shocking because this has always been Remedy's strength. I could honestly not remember the plot just a week after finishing the game. I remember most of the characters, if not by name at least by their personalities. And to see and hear from actors of the previous Remedy games like James McCaffrey, Mathew Porretta, and Courtney Hope all back for this game was like a nice family reunion. But the plot itself was just not all that interesting to me. The mystery surrounding Jesse's brother and Polaris aren't nearly as interesting to me as the nature of The Board or Trench's death, but the former is the much bigger focus of the game than the latter.\n\nThe pacing of the story is also a total mess. I stumbled my way into the endgame without realizing it until about halfway through because the middle acts of the plot dragged on for so long and lost its way with all of the exposition and lore dumps about the supernatural objects Jesse comes across. And while the moment-to-moment arcs of having to regain control over those dangerous objects were cool, they all felt like side missions that were only important because they gave Jesse a new power to use to progress with the exploration instead of having any narrative meaning.\n\nIn many ways, Control feels like the opposite of Remedy's previous game, Quantum Break. The gameplay, characters, and atmosphere far outshine the rather uninteresting story this time around. And even though I don't have much incentive to want to replay this game, it was at least worth playing once. Plus, the expansive lore and likable characters provide a lot of opportunity for a good sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1684528713, "timestamp_updated": 1684528713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138568825": {"recommendationid": "138568825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151459215", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1157, "last_played": 1685486788}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has a nice concept, is mystical, a bit weird, and has a somewhat interesting combat system.\n\nCombat System:\nThe weapons simply do too little damage in some cases, which results in shooting at bosses/elite enemies for ages, which is not particularly innovative. In the end, you just fly around a bit, throw objects, and shoot like crazy at the enemies, which becomes dull over time.\nThe game is also quite challenging, as if they wanted to incorporate a bit of a Souls-like element, except that the combat here is simply not rewarding or truly strategic. There is hardly any feeling of superiority, even though you are technically much stronger than the enemies. In Souls-like games, this balance shifts over time, and strategy and attack patterns often matter more. As a result, you feel like a pro when you finally manage to dodge or parry an attack. The combat system is the game's biggest weakness for me.\nUsing the \"everything is one-hit\" feature made combat actually a lot of fun, but you can of course turn it off for boss fights. Except for Hartmann, don't do it to yourselves, trust me.\n\nArt Design:\nThe art design of the game is really nice, breaking away from the standard and featuring epic-looking areas. The effects and animations of anomalies are also very well done. Additionally, the atmospheric lighting often adds a lot to the experience. However, after 20 hours, it can become a bit tiresome due to the lack of variety, especially when faced with concrete walls constantly. But they're still able to show you something new or different from time to time. \n\nLevel Design:\nThe different areas don't differ significantly, and the level design can be quite convoluted at times. Often, the obvious entrances are blocked, and you end up searching for the right path endlessly. As a result, the running distances become tedious, as you move relatively slowly compared to the size of the game world. The dash ability doesn't make up for it either.\n\nStory:\nDude, I have no idea what the game is trying to say, but I like it? So far, I haven't understood anything, but that's probably on me. The main and side missions are diverse and often offer surprises or interesting stories/characters.\nEdit: Ok I played it through but no worries I still dont have a clue what happened.\n\nGo for the game if you feel like it.

The NPC interactions, dialogue and animations are all very well done so helps with the immersion along with Jesse's internal conversations. The gameplay is top notch, combat is exciting and varied based on your playstyle and how you level up, your gun has varied modes that you unlock as you progress and you can upgrade it, but really it's the abilities you pickup that you'll be using the most. Levels and enemies do vary enough to offer different scenery and creepy visuals, and a handful of the level designs are so impressive and fun that I might have to play through again just for the fun of it.\n\nBonus notes:\n- The building is large with lots of fun places to explore, but also has a great fast travel system so you can bounce around easily to accomplish missions. \n- Puzzles are mostly pretty simple to figure out, but I will admit needing a wiki search for a boss or two after many deaths.\nFor those that hate jumping puzzles, I think there was only one, maybe two, and they were pretty easy to deal with using Jesse's abilities at that point\n- Beautiful lighting and set design, there will be points where you just want to enjoy the scenery. Especially if you enjoy eerie and dark spaces. \n\nWould absolutely recommend this one if you enjoy action games that make you feel like a superhero.", "timestamp_created": 1684417484, "timestamp_updated": 1684417484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138483883": {"recommendationid": "138483883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042946159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 264, "last_played": 1690487413}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb! 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1684410662, "timestamp_updated": 1684410662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138471076": {"recommendationid": "138471076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013810420", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2898, "last_played": 1685396369}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredibly engaging and disconcerting experience!

Basically, it's fun, and the story is good, but the whole experience is held back by a few things that just feel either unfinished, or just cheap and unfair.\n\nFirst is the unfinished aspects of the UI.  You pick up audio and video logs (of various types).  You can listen to them at any time, great.  But you can NOT listen to them while still playing.  You have to just sit and listen, doing nothing else.  For some of the videos, fine, the video content is also interesting, but for all of the audio logs, and the \"may as well be audio logs\" of the Hotline feature, let us press \"play\" and go.  Lost the better part of an hour to this (at least).  There's a few other UI annoyances, but it's generally good, so this sticks out.  Also a bit of inconsistency with getting in/out of menus with the keyboard.  Just needed a few more passes on PC without a controller.\n\nThe biggest thing holding this game back though: insta-deaths.  95% of my deaths were \"full health -> huge hit to 5% health from nowhere -> stiff breeze finishes me off\"  WAY too many of these to count.  I didn't feel like I was battling, I felt like I was just \"gotta kill everything in sight, and spin 360 degrees all the time because of the silent one behind me that's just going to outright murder me despite winning against the rest.\"  And don't get me started on Hiss Distorted.  I finished the main game \"fairly\", but for the DLC I turned on the in-game \"100% damage reduction\" because I wanted the story, but not the BS.\n\nAlso too many plot threads just left hanging.  Didn't feel fully \"resolved\" at the end either, or even a decent path to BEING resolved.  AWE expansion better than The Foundation, and I never even played Alan Wake either.  Probably lots more there story-wise for those that did.\n\nSo a good game with some unfortunate decisions.  If it's on sale (75% or more) then pick it up, it's fun.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I...

Something sorely lacking in today's gaming landscape. It's probably not earth shattering, not really groundbreaking in terms of gameplay, but the developers committed to a style and it really works. \n\nThe gunplay is quite fun, and paced really well. Fights devolve into chaos, but you are the cause of said chaos, not some scripted setpiece. \n\nImagine taking some combat ideas from Doom Eternal, where you're in full control of what happens on the battlefield. Mix in some obtuse story telling and world building methods akin to a Dark Souls game. Paint over it all with an X-Files/SCP Foundation setting and you've got Control. The characters are great, and uncovering story bits both revealed just enough to push me to explore more, but left a lot up to mystery.\n\nSome sections overstay their welcome, and I wish fast travel was something you unlocked later... But I think if it didn't have fast travel I would be begging for it. I found myself using only one version of the gun by the end so it might've benefited from 1-2 rounds of balancing. \n\nIf you like shooters, you should play Control.
