The minimalist visuals, a chiaroscuro ballet of light and shadow, form the canvas upon which the narrative unfolds. In the silence that envelops this digital realm, every pixel becomes a poignant brushstroke, crafting a surreal landscape that is as captivating as it is disconcerting.\n\nAt the heart of \"Changed\" lies a narrative that eschews the trappings of verbosity, opting instead for a profound, introspective silence. The protagonist, a nameless figure navigating the enigmatic corridors of change, embarks on a journey that transcends the limitations of linguistic expression. The allegory of metamorphosis, manifested in the protagonist's evolution, is a symphony of understated profundity, leaving an indelible mark on the player's psyche.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of \"Changed\" are a testament to the adage that less is often more. The minimalist controls belie a complexity that mirrors the existential quandaries woven into the narrative fabric. Every encounter with the enigmatic denizens of this digital realm becomes a dance of evasion and assimilation, a tactile ballet that mirrors the thematic core of transformation.\n\nThe atmospheric soundtrack, a melodic echo in the corridors of silence, envelops players in an auditory embrace that heightens the emotive resonance of the journey.

It's not a game for the faint of heart, but it offers a compelling and atmospheric journey. Here's a four-star review that captures the essence of Changed:\n\n\"Changed is a game that's unlike anything else you'll find on Steam. It's a story of transformation, survival, and body horror that takes you on a dark and mysterious journey. The game's atmosphere is eerie and unsettling, drawing you into a world where nothing is as it seems.\n\nThe core gameplay centers around exploration, puzzle-solving, and encounters with bizarre creatures. As you progress, you undergo a series of grotesque transformations, each of which grants you new abilities and challenges. The sense of progression and change is a central theme of the game.\n\nThe pixel art style is detailed and effectively conveys the otherworldly and disturbing nature of the game's setting. The sound design and eerie music add to the atmosphere, creating a sense of tension and dread.\n\nChanged's narrative is intentionally obscure, leaving much to the player's interpretation. This can be a strength, as it encourages discussion and exploration of the game's themes. However, it can also be frustrating for those looking for a more straightforward story.\n\nThe game's difficulty can be quite high, and some players may find certain segments challenging. The lack of clear instructions and the trial-and-error nature of some puzzles can be polarizing.\n\nIn conclusion, Changed is a thought-provoking and unsettling journey into the realms of transformation and body horror. It's not a game for everyone, but if you appreciate atmospheric and challenging experiences and are open to exploring darker themes, it's a title worth considering. It's a unique and memorable adventure that will leave a lasting impression, for better or for worse.\"", "timestamp_created": 1699446753, "timestamp_updated": 1699446753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

-\n\nEste juego tiene sus cosas buenas y malas, y por desgracia las malas son mayoritarias \n(Hay que tener en cuenta que es el primero juego del desarrollador, y que esto est\u00e1 siendo solucionado en la ''Special Edition'')\n\nLas cosas malas del juego ser\u00edan principalmente la confusi\u00f3n que te generan algunos sprites, la forma en que la se te presentan algunos puzzles (son dificil\u00edsimos y m\u00e1s de una vez vas a tener que tirar de un walkthrough, as\u00ed que si lo haces no te sientas culpable), y la jugabilidad.\nSobre todo la jugabilidad, por la forma en la que est\u00e1 programado el movimiento del personaje se hace muy dif\u00edcil el esquivar a los enemigos, que es la ''mec\u00e1nica'' principal del juego, ya que no cuenta con un sistema de combate como otros muchos RPGs (Es algo que la verdad he echado en falta, pero contar\u00eda m\u00e1s este juego como una novela interactiva que como un RPG ngl)\n\nY ahora, las cosas buenas, que aunque no lo parezca, las tiene\nY se centran principalmente en la historia\nLos personajes son carism\u00e1ticos, no los m\u00e1s carism\u00e1ticos del mundo, pero no est\u00e1n mal\nEl desarrollo de personaje es bastante bueno, y en general la historia (para no hacer spoilers), me ha encantado\n(De los pocos juegos que me han hecho llorar)\n\nAs\u00ed que conclusiones: El juego est\u00e1 bien, a m\u00ed me ha encantado, lo recomiendo bastante por temas de historia y tal, pero si te esperas un RPG al nivel de Undertale, olv\u00eddate\nAl menos en la ''historia principal'', veremos \u00e1 ver con Changed: Special Edition, que cambian bastantes cosas\nEso y que 0/10 no te puedes culear a Puro\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n(This review has been translated with google translator)\n\nThis game has its good and bad things, and unfortunately the bad ones are the majority\n(Keep in mind that it is the developer's first game, and that this is being solved in the ''Special Edition'')\n\nThe bad things about the game would be mainly the confusion that some sprites generate, the way in which some puzzles are presented to you (they are very difficult and more than once you will have to take a walkthrough, so if you do, don't feel guilty), and the gameplay.\nAbove all, the gameplay, due to the way the character's movement is programmed, it becomes very difficult to avoid enemies, which is the main ''mechanics'' of the game, since it does not have a combat system like others many RPGs (It's something that I've really missed, but I would count this game more as an interactive novel than as an English RPG)\n\nAnd now, the good things, which although it may not seem like it, it has\nAnd they focus mainly on the story\nThe characters are charismatic, not the most charismatic in the world, but they are not bad\nThe character development is quite good, and in general the story (not to give spoilers), I loved it\n(One of the few games that have made me cry)\n\nSo conclusions: The game is good, I highly recommend it for story reasons and such, but if you are expecting an RPG at the level of Undertale, forget it\nAt least in the ''main story'', we will see with Changed: Special Edition, that many things change\nThat and 0/10 you can't fuck Puro", "timestamp_created": 1698810445, "timestamp_updated": 1698810651, "voted_up":

Its told in a non convoluted way and there isn't any hidden lore that's required to understand the story. The characters are well written, being such a short game, there are limitations to how much you can develop a character but changed does it well. The motivations of Dr. K could be fleshed out more but enough is there for the player to connect with. Puro is a lovable character with clear motivations and enough character development for the player to form a connection with. The cleaning robot is a character and I will talk about it. The cleaning robot is a well done addition and doesn't feel forced, the interactions are cute [spoiler] and the character is used as part of a puzzle in a later portion of the game. [/spoiler] The game play is just the right amount of challenging while still being fun, the puzzles are challenging and unique.[spoiler] The tiger shark boss fight is decent, the boss has 2 attacks and they are fairly easy to dodge. The squid dog boss fight is more challenging and can be frustrating at times, there is a route that you can take to make it more consistent. [/spoiler] The endings are good, the two bad endings are at points in the game where they are sad and impactful.

I went into this game knowing that and played it with an open mind. there are 3 things that can make this game enjoyable based in the concept alone:\n\nA. you are a furry\nB. you are into latex/transformation/CNC\nC. you find the idea of losing humanity to be a terrifying concept.\n\nI fall into none of these groups so my time playing the game was more focused on the gameplay itself. the 'transfurmations' are always very suggestive and fetishistic to the point that it was hard to ignore the first few times. the first part of the game before the main setup had alot of fuck you moments where you just lose by interacting with certain things or fall into traps that you can ignore with knowledge. I feel like this game could be done in a half hour once you understand the gimmicks and the pitfalls. speaking of gimmicks, this games rooms are very gimmick based. you use an idea for a room, then make a harder challenge based on the idea, and then move on to the next idea. areas of the game don't mesh very well because of this. the lore of the game is fairly basic and the dialogue is not very engaging, but it's all serviceable. this game has alot of backtracking in order to continue the story, and the saves are not very well placed. there are some saves that exist only through 1 room transition with no threats before the next save and some saves that take place right before a massive block of dialogue that you then have to go back to hit the save again to skip.\n\nDespite what I have said above I did have a good time playing changed. all 5 endings were either bad or melancholic, but the gameplay kept me engaged, puro is a silly guy and it was challenging without being too bullshit (I still used a walkthrough for some door codes).\n\n6.5/10 not for me but a good game none the less.

I don't know how or why kids around 15 and under find out about this game. I regret that they're exposed to the kinky imagery in it. I guess if they get into the furry fandom at a young age via the internet, like I did more-or-less, then that's how & it's another discussion. Either that, or someone in a Puro outfit shows up at children's school or function. Either way, I don't like or condone it. It's inappropriate.\n\nThat being said, I am an adult, and I did buy it for the latex TF kink and suggestive artwork as well as for the appealing art style and design overall. I also bought it for the music by SHIZI, and to discover what I'd later find out to be a very cute, tender and tragic story about friendship and survival in a post-apocalyptic world. The art style is distinct and memorable, and there is a genuine heart and soul to to the game besides the ostensible kink bait. I say this because you can enjoy the game just fine while skipping or not reacting to the \"transfur\" imagery, and instead focus on the character dialogue and relationships. With that alone, it's truly a fun and rewarding game, albeit heavy on the trial-and-error aspect on purpose; and it's a solid accomplishment from a very small indie dev team's first game. I'm very much looking forward to playing Changed Special when it's finished & getting the other endings and achievements for vanilla Changed in the meantime.\n\nTL;DR: bought it for the nice visuals & kinky art, finished it for the sweet & heartfelt story.

Unfortunately, we've hit a major roadblock - his fear of the \"skibidi toilet\" You might be wondering what a \"skibidi toilet\" is, and honestly, I had no idea either until we encountered it. Fron what I've gathered, \"skibidi toilet\" is basically a new genre of youtube video about evil singing toilets. Basically think zombies but instead they're toilets that sing in your face. I was fine to let my son watch the videos at first, as they seemed innocent enough and fairly harmless, but they soon devolved into strange post apocalyptic material with grotesque toilets fighting in a war against mankind, so I finally intervened and cut him off. I thought that was the end of it, he can't watch the videos anymore so theres nothing to be afraid of. Well, I was wrong. This has since turned into a complete nightmare for us at home. We recently started potty training and he refuses to use the toilet now due to skibidi toilet. Whenever we try to put him on it he screams and refuses to go anywhere near it. We've tried explaining that skibidi toilet isnt real and our toilet is completely safe, but it seems like it's too overwhelming for him. We even let him decorate it with stickers, hoping it would make him less afraid, but no luck so far. It utterly breaks my heart to see him so anxious about such a simple thing that every child goes through. I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Should we give him more time and hope that he warms to the toilet, or is it better to try a completely different approach? I know every child is different, but has anyone else experienced something similar?

given all the hype surrounding it. I mean, who doesn't love a challenging game? However, this game took it to a whole new level, and not in a good way. If you thought \"Elden Ring\" and \"Dark Souls\" were tough, prepare yourself for a level of difficulty that's just downright cruel.\n\nMy primary issue with this game is its unrelenting difficulty. I don't mind a challenge, but \"Changed the Game\" is punishing to the point of frustration. It's like the developers took sadistic pleasure in watching players suffer. The lack of any reasonable learning curve makes it almost impossible for casual gamers to enjoy.\n\nAdditionally, the game lacks any form of accessible difficulty settings. I understand that some players thrive on extreme challenges, but for those of us who want to enjoy the storyline and explore the game world without feeling like we're banging our heads against a brick wall, there should be options to tone down the difficulty. It's as if the developers catered exclusively to the hardcore gamer crowd, leaving the rest of us feeling alienated and disappointed.\n\nThe graphics and story could have been intriguing if they weren't overshadowed by the relentless difficulty. I found myself unable to fully immerse in the narrative because I was constantly battling impossible odds. What's the point of having a compelling story if most players won't even get to experience it due to the steep difficulty curve?\n\nIn conclusion, \"Changed the Game\" is not for everyone. If you're a glutton for punishment and enjoy the masochistic challenge of games like \"Elden Ring\" and \"Dark Souls,\" then this might be right up your alley. However, if you're looking for a more balanced and enjoyable gaming experience, I'd recommend steering clear of this one.

Changed is based around what is essentially non consensual horny art with animalistic features, if that makes you uncomfortable at all you really shouldn't play this!\nChanged isn't a good game.\n\nChanged is what happens when you give an artist with no game development experience a game making tool like RPG maker. All puzzles are either way too obtuse or laughably easy, almost every chase scene is based on RNG and the dialogue replaying after every death makes every attempt that much more frustrating. Not only that but the story itself isn't that well written, it's filled with plotholes and spelling mistakes, english wasn't the writer's first language but you can still definitely tell that the game didn't have too much proofreading, this game's primary purpose wasn't being a RPG and it shows.\nNow for the good part! I'm still recommending it after all!\nHidden behind all of the janky gameplay this game had one of the best character writing I have ever experienced, to a point where it makes the game hard to review without either giving it too many spoilers or unjustified praise. Every interaction makes you feel like playing more and all characters are written in a way where you can not only empathize with them but actually agree with their actions, different people WILL have different opinions on the story simply from their past life experiences and that's great! This is VERY hard to come across in games with a linear storyline and Changed executes it perfectly. The dialogue at times is genuinely heartwarming and the combination of the cute artstyle with the (frankly adorable) unintentional mistakes makes it have a personal feeling that you really don't get anywhere else, by the end of the game you really don't see it as a game with characters anymore, it goes out of it's way to make you treat Puro as a friend, and the usage of a blank slate character here works fantastically well, it does what Undertale couldn't and actually makes you feel like you're in that universe. I think this is best exemplified with the very first scene in the game:\nYou start the game with a very simple a basic area where you're introduced to the game, you familiarize yourself with the author's writing style and the game's controls, familiar to anyone that has been playing RPG maker games for a while. The first puzzle is seemingly just unlocking a door, easily identifiable by the simple artstyle. You interact with some white goo and right there you are immediately greeted by furry fetish art!\nalright you got baited it's time to talk about yiff lmaooo\nThis entire thing plays as if it was an excuse to show you as much furry art as possible, ranging from the core transformation fetish which pretty much acts as the game's selling point to some good old stuckage, bondage and hypno that are practically required for furry visual novels, this entire game is so pawfully horny from the get-go that it has a cult following exclusively devoted to hating it (which is probably how you got here in the first place), and boy, you can definitely tell a furry wrote those scenes! Almost everything is written as if it was directly out of a furaffinity CYOA fic but that really makes sense when you consider the target audience here. The fact that this is gifted almost exclusively as a joke really isn't surprising when you consider just how much of the game is spent just describing what it'd be like to be transformed into a hot latex animal.\n\nStill didn't leave the game page after all that? Good! Buy it! Go play the game! It's relatively short (took me 9 hours to 100% but I was really struggling when I started it) but well worth the price, I'd give it a 8.6/10 overall. The game really... STICKS with you\n(get it?)\nAlso since you read all this here's my advice (that most people probably don't agree with): Don't play Changed-Special first, normal Changed has better writing by a longshot. DO play it after Changed even if only for the new transfurs though, the gameplay is way better and it solves most of the problems I have with puzzles but I'd still not say it's a better experience overall.\n\nBig thanks for my man MemStride for gifting me this game!", "timestamp_created": 1694828821, "timestamp_updated": 1694828821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.671276986598968506", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146363711": {"recommendationid": "146363711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199030507357", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 171, "last_played": 1695585221}, "language": "spanish", "review": "donde esta la escopeta cabrones?", "timestamp_created": 1694818401, "timestamp_updated": 1694818401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146356587": {"recommendationid": "146356587", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144455618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11559, "last_played": 1695681612}, "language": "english", "review": "it is good some ppl like furrys so who like furrys they will like and love the game\n", "timestamp_created": 1694808700, "timestamp_updated": 1694808700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484886646270751953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146340373": {"recommendationid": "146340373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269256978", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 59992, "last_played": 1694714114}, "language": "english", "review": "This game changed my life..\n\nGET IT????

If that's a problem for you though, there is an easy mode. This is definitely Dark Souls (Furry Edition) in that regard, though.\nOverall though, highly recommend playing this little gem.

feelings about this game. On one hand, its clearly a fetish furry game with very explicit imagery that will disturb you if you arent into that kind of thing. Which is a problem. It makes it on the other hand all that much better, but as unintended horror game. But anyway, I am gonna delve into few things about why I would recommend but also not recommend this game.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I aint a fuckin furry. But I sure as hell will be made into one if I continue. I bought this game for shits and giggles to troll my friends while I streamed it. Which I both regret and dont regret. \n\nLets start with controls and gameplay. This is an RPG maker game. A chase/puzzle oriented game. DO NOT expect much in terms of controls. You will die. They are just that wonky. Its... infuriating at times. So you need a lot of patience. When it comes to puzzles, this game is either 300 IQ or I am just that retarded at times. Some puzzles are also made harder because of enemies which roles back to my first point with controls being absolute disaster. One problem is also how confusing this game is at times. You wouldnt you can get easily lost in RPG Maker game but I honestly had to sometimes google where to go.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, I hate how good it is. It has no right to be this good. And its probably helped by the fact I took this more as horror because Jesus Christ was I mostly unnerved by the things some find \"hot\". I am not gonna lie though, I really like Puro. His scenes are always good. Probably because he is the only one who can talk. [spoiler] Well, there is one more character who talks but he appears almost only at the end [/spoiler]. Overall I love the story. Unintended horror, but still pretty good.\n\nThe music and sounds is where its at. Do remember to put the volume down a bit though because its very loud. But the sounds. The ambience. THE MUSIC. I love it, and I fuckin hate this game for it. How does a fetish game pull out better ambience and sounds then some other games.\n\nThis game surprisingly, has bosses. They are, alright. Most of the time they are just \"run around like headless chicken\" or try to figure out what to do.\n\nLastly, the graphics. Eh. They arent bad by all means, but they arent screaming \"best looking game ever\". I do like them though. Most characters are ofc, just straight up furry or throw latex at it and be done. I do like main antagonist and Puro design though. The environment can range from boring to good looking to \"What eldritch monstrosity did I just walk into\". \n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes. BUT. You either have to be precisely the audience that this game drives in (sorry, but furries are definitely one of them) OR you have to masochist with few expectations of unnerving horror shit happening.

date is not a lie, at least in theory; sometime around then would be when I was first [exposed] to the virus. Notably, It did not spark my fascination with [this type of thing], instead it contributed to it. For literal years afterwards, I did not play the game, but it remained on the back-burner of my mind. The idea Changed presents was appealing to me. I cannot imagine how my life would be different were I not exposed to it at such a formative time in my life: it had such an impact on my life it is impossible to know.\n\nSection 2: HOMESTUCK: [ +Puro ]\n\n    I don't know if it's nostalgia or what, but Puro as a character has stuck with me more-so than any other character, period. Puro alone is the reason I bought the game, Puro alone is the reason why I finished it. To simplify my thoughts: I wish [Changed] was in real life. To quote I believe Socrates: \n\"Puro is a cutie uwu! Thinking about him ~3~... it makes me feel- HAPPY OwO!!!!!\"\nTo be cliche for a lonely person on the internet: I wish ____ was real... I think I just lack affection- at least I'm self aware \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\nAll I'm saying is if Puro went up to you and offered, who wouldn't want to kiss him on the lips? Probably most people...\n\nSection 3: Final Stage of Grief, Acceptance\n\n    I don't know how you can miss something you have permanent access to, yet I feel as though every day I miss something about changed. It's a strange feeling, I have no desire to play the game again, but miss it nonetheless. I know nothing will ever recreate the feeling of discovering the game and seeing every transfur for the first time, it holds a special place to me. I also don't think I want to recreate that feeling, it's more special the way it is. I love changed for no reason other than it made part of who I am, and that won't change.\n\n(I am so close to 100%ing this game but don't want to do either of the bad endings that have sad puro :(\n   -#1 Puro Fan)", "timestamp_created": 1692754270, "timestamp_updated": 1693196777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144820027": {"recommendationid": "144820027", "author": {"steamid": "76561199472096660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1695568810}, "language": "spanish", "review": "uwu", "timestamp_created": 1692745009, "timestamp_updated": 1692745009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529411792755126953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144819515": {"recommendationid": "144819515", "author": {"steamid": "76561199146500400", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 124, "last_played": 1682809454}, "language": "english", "review": "I think they called it changed because it changedes you as a person", "timestamp_created": 1692744347, "timestamp_updated": 1692744347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144807728": {"recommendationid": "144807728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340187594", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1689000823}, "language": "english", "review": "A weird game for weird people.

character design. Personally, I don't really focus on the \"kinks\" (since most people mainly focus about the transfurs) but I deeply put my focus more onto the story line and the essence of adventure the human has to escape the facility, the game also shows the essence of acceptance from one of a kind. \n\nThe game can be considered as moderately difficult but can be overturned when you get used to the tactics and moves for every attempts you do. Changed does have a balance between serious and wholesome moments which should be recognized, Moments with Puro is a great example for this category. The lore within Changed was also interesting enough which people should also take such recognition of. For example : the segment of you, the player, asking Puro about several questions the game gives you, he would really explain the events that happened even before where the game takes places, the amount of detail behind these dialogues are just outstanding. The characters (despite of most of them being latex creatures) are also to be credited, some are simple while some are actually well thought of (like tiger shark) and this even became a major influence with OC designs. Some shows about their personality which fits in to the lore (some of the character's personalities are even mentioned through dialogues) while others are up for speculation which is still passable.\n\nOverall, Changed is an outstanding furry-based game in terms of the story line, characters, and partially the symbolisms. Its just sad that most people pays attention to the \"kinks\" part of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1692290097, "timestamp_updated": 1692290097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144397314": {"recommendationid": "144397314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180902164", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1683424758}, "language": "english", "review": "gay", "timestamp_created": 1692265958, "timestamp_updated": 1692265958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437115222215652466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144376384": {"recommendationid": "144376384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373359513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1699743407}, "language": "english", "review": "My friends made me play this. \nThey also forced me to recommend it.\nWe are no longer friends.\n\nEdit: wait hold on this game is kinda dope-", "timestamp_created": 1692236653, "timestamp_updated": 1697486559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52355504035949707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144357687": {"recommendationid": "144357687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166356802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 553, "last_played": 1696742251}, "language": "english", "review": "so far its pretty fun, but very difficult, when i first wrote this review i maybe a quarter of the way into the game, and was getting annoyed at the controls, but it just takes time to get used to how it responds to inputs.\n\nI did thumbs up for recommend, because its just a great game, especially for how cheap it is.

Obviously, there are the weird parts of it (especially squid dog fight and death scenes) but the story, relationship, and difficulty make up for it. I still like the weird stuff personally but most won't. (Spoilers from here) The story was pretty good, with it mostly being dependent on your relationship with Puro, who is a black latex which studied language for a bit and is way smarter than other black latex's. At the beginning it is basic with you just waking up from a cryo-pod and looking around for survivors while being attacked by monsters. After getting through that stage, you meet Puro in a library. After that you do a bunch of difficult boss fights and chases with Puro always waiting for you somewhere. He does many cute things when you return to him after a fight/chase such as hugging you or resting with you. After all of that, you meet Dr. K who is the last scientist trying to stop the latex virus and has mostly failed but will certainly fail if you escape. He tries to stop you, but with the help of a cleaning drone and Puro, you beat him and get to go to the bottom floor. When you are at the ending, (BIG SPOILERS) Dr. K does a whole speech about how you shouldn't leave and how it would just destroy the last chance of humanity on the earth. So you get 2 choices, with a secret one I will talk about later. First, you get to stay in the tower, not risking destroying humanity but you are confined and most likely will be transfurred. Second, you can leave the tower to go outside but you risk all of humanity as you don't know if you carry the virus or not. The secret option you have to press ESC when it gives you the 2 options and it will begin a segment where you willingly become transfurred but get to stay fully conscious and are cured of the virus. This ending was great, especially at the end (of the ending I know) where you get to go with Puro into the world and live out the rest of your lives together. This was super cute too in my opinion. The only problems I had with this game is its absurd RNG sometimes and the delay between pressing the arrow keys and actual movement. Other than that, this game was perfect. 10/10 (soundtrack is also a banger)", "timestamp_created": 1692177362, "timestamp_updated": 1692202806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144311499": {"recommendationid": "144311499", "author": {"steamid": "76561199259871734", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 644, "last_played": 1692238827}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked the game, sure it had some difficult areas but they're sorta understandable, the only thing I don't like about it is the fact that if you don't time it right with the sharks and the squid-dogs they'll catch you.

[/h1]\n\nAlright, let's talk about Changed, an action-puzzle game that's definitely not your typical run-of-the-mill experience. It was released back in 2018 and developed by DragonSnow, with some interesting background music by Shizi. But be warned, this game has some kinky, fetish undertones, so brace yourself.\n\nThe plot is simple yet intriguing. You wake up in a research facility after being unconscious for who knows how long.\n\nYour goal? \n\n Escape. \n\nBut here's the twist, everything in the facility wants to transform you into a latex furry. Yeah, it's as bizarre as it sounds. \n\nAs you progress through the rooms, you uncover the backstory from various written materials and meet other characters with their own motivations.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix of puzzles and action sequences. Figuring out the puzzles can be a challenge, especially when the rules suddenly change without warning. Fail, and you'll face some rubbery transformations. But hey, that's part of the appeal for some players, right?\n\nVisually, the game is simple but effective. The chiptune-style music adds to the tension during chase scenes and creates a calming atmosphere in other areas. The transformations are a major theme, and while some occur at the sprite level, others are displayed as full-screen images with more detail. Some of the transformations in the Changed-Special version even feature bondage elements, which might interest some players.\n\nSo, is Changed worth playing? \n\nWell, if you're into furry, latex transformations, this game might just be your cup of tea. But if you're person that's just curious and want to see what this game is about...  It's certainly not without its flaws. \n\nThe puzzle challenges can be fun, but there are probably better puzzle games out there if that's your main interest. The real charm of Changed lies in the quirky transformations that happen when you fail. Just remember, it's not your typical game, so approach with an open mind and a willingness to embrace the unconventional.\n\nOverall, its a good game and my curiosity has been satiated. Furry or not, the game does have a charming indie feel and you can definitely tell that this was a passion project at heart.", "timestamp_created": 1690159140, "timestamp_updated": 1691045769,

What kind of apples are best for apple pie and how to get an amazing, flaky pie crust.\nBest apples for pie\n\nThere are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties that you can find at your local grocery store!\n\n    Granny Smith - These are the best apples for making apple pie because they are super tart and very firm. Firm apples hold up well during the baking process unlike varieties such as McIntosh which kind of turn to mush.\n    Honeycrisp - This is my second choice when it comes to apple pie. This variety is super crisp, tart, sweet and holds up great during the baking process.\n    Jazz - Another crisp and sweet apple variety.\n    Golden Delicious - Widely available apple variety. Holds up well during the baking process but will be a little softer than the others.\n    Jonagold - A little tart and sweet.\n    Pink Lady - Just like Jonagolds, this variety has a good balance of tart and sweet.\n\nThe perfect pie crust\n\nA great apple pie starts with an amazing pie crust. We love to use either this all-butter pie crust or our sourdough pie crust. Each of these pie crust use butter and just a little bit of vinegar to produce a tender, flaky pie crust that just can't be beat!\n\nThe crust can be made a few days in advance and kept in the fridge or frozen until ready to assemble your apple pie.\n\nIf you decide to use a store-bought crust, make sure to follow the directions on the packaging to determine when to take the crust out of the fridge in order to handle it more easily.\nHow to make apple pie from scratch\n\nPeel, core and slice the apples. In a large mixing bowl, gently toss the apple slices, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon zest and lemon juice until well combined and set aside. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat your oven to 400\u00b0F.\n\nRemove the discs of pie crust from the fridge and let set at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one of the discs into a 12\" circle that is \u215b\" thick. Place the crust into the bottom of the deep dish pie plate.\nA pie crust being placed into a pie dish.\n\nSpoon the apple pie filling into the crust, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the mixing bowl. Spread the apple slices evenly.\nApple slices in the bottom of the pie crust.\n\nOn a lightly floured surface, roll the second disc of pie dough into a 12\" circle that is \u215b\" thick. Place the crust over the apple pie filling.\n\nUse a sharp knife to trim the excess dough from around the edge of the pie plate. Use your fingers to pull both the bottom and top pie crust up and slightly away from the edge of the pie dish. Fold the edge under itself and press down to seal the edge in place. Rotate the pie a quarter turn and repeat until edges are neatly tucked in.\n\nPlace the pie dish onto a baking sheet and gently brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash and sprinkle sanding sugar on top. Use a sharp knife to cut vents in the crust.\n\nIn order to protect the edges of the pie from over-browning, use a long strip of aluminum foil (about 38\" long) by folding it in half lengthwise and then folding in half again, lengthwise. Wrap it around the edges of the pie plate and over the edges of the crust. This is referred to as a \"pie shield\".\nA strip of foil around the edges of the pie keeps them from over-browning while baking.\n\nBake the pie at 400\u00b0F for 25 minutes. Remove the pie shield, lower the oven temperature to 375\u00b0F and bake an additional 30-35 minutes.\n\nYou'll know the apple pie is done when the crust is a lovely golden brown and the juice is bubbling up the sides of the pan.\n\nTIP: I recommend using a pie shield during the first 25 minutes of baking instead the second half of baking to prevent burning yourself when placing the shield onto the pie dish.\nHow to store\n\nThe pie can be made up to 2 days ahead of time and stored, loosely covered, at room temperature or covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.", "timestamp_created": 1690073530, "timestamp_updated": 1690073813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142614778": {"recommendationid": "142614778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842280286", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1690640807}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is quite good, with some parts being annoyingly difficult.

But it doesnt need extreme horror to be good. The style the game uses is great. The remake called \"Changed Special\" is better, but the original still is good. Just dont fall for the misconceptions about this game! Claims that call it various nsfw things are wrong. While the game is mildly suggestive, and a bit more so in the Special Edition, so is countless things people and even kids enjoy that are more suggestive than this game. The \"nudity\" warning is there because of the fact the animals are animals and therefore dont have clothes, and the mild suggestive content. A lot of claims about hidden nsfw meanings have been debunked by the creator. The creator rated it 12+ on an interview and I would agree with that. I love this game!

Puzzles are innovative but sometimes flat out kinda annoying to figure out, mostly just holding the arrow keys and shift button occasionally F12 If you don't want to see, you know the *Art*, although I don't think this game is trying to appeal to anyone who wants a genuine gameplay experience.\nThe Presentation/Art:\nPresentation of the game could've been very much more improved with a few cinematic elements and the pixel art of the game is above average.\nControls:\nVery bad.  no keybind switching, clunky movement, and bugs when you try to do two actions at the same time, although I'm just shouting info at the void.\nOverall, Don't buy this for the actual game, but I think everyone knows that's not why people buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1689827436, "timestamp_updated": 1689827436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650119483470916748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142419051": {"recommendationid": "142419051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384846559", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 338, "last_played": 1699494241}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not a furry but this game is a 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1689789053, "timestamp_updated": 1689789053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132270812988281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142417286": {"recommendationid": "142417286", "author": {"steamid": "76561199202053541", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 125, "last_played": 1690481565}, "language": "english", "review": "cant sex puro but the game still gets me hard, 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1689787039, "timestamp_updated": 1690219427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487999975681304932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142411314": {"recommendationid": "142411314", "author": {"steamid": "76561199078268861", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 295, "last_played": 1699086127}, "language": "english", "review": "Why is it that the genuine Changed Special I downloaded from Steam is not complete, while my friend's pirated Changed Special downloaded from other channels on his phone is complete?

Naivety\n\nWhile browsing the Steam Points Shop, i stumbled upon multiple items from a small game called Changed. i enjoyed the aesthetic of the depicted creatures and so i delved deeper. i read the game's synopsis and an idea popped into my head: \"This game would be perfect to stream to my friends.\" i thought. \"It's short, its premise is wacky, and haha latex furry game.\" How wrong i was, that this game would only lead to a few hours of entertainment. That it would have no lasting effects upon myself.\n\nPart II: The First Impression\n\nThe game's premise is mysterious but simple: leave this complex. So many questions are immediately raised: \"Where am i? Why am i here? Why am i being chased by latex creatures?\" But your initial thought is to simply ignore the questions. Answer naively that it doesn't matter, that it's just a fun furry puzzle game. You don't yet know what is in store.\n\nPart III: The Challenge\n\nEarly on, you'll find that the game's difficulty is inconsistent, that it raises and lowers randomly. Many puzzles will lead to your death. You will die again and again and again. But something strange was happening. As i died over and over and over again, i still felt compelled to finish this game, to beat the challenge, to understand the mystery. The game told me making it out of this place would not be easy, there were times i had to go back several puzzles because i missed something i needed to progress the story. So why did i stand in defiance to it? i don't know. i don't know. But i could feel myself... changing as i played.\n\nPart IV: The Change\n\nIn the military, recruits are beaten down until they are broken and then recreated in the image of a soldier. Changed is much the same. This game has broken me down again and again and again. My spirit has been crushed. And in the stead of that person, a new me was made. Forged in the fires of this hellish game. i have come to care for the creatures of this world. i have come to be... a furry.\n\nPart V: Acceptance\n\ni know now that i was no match for the game. Much like Lin, the player character, whom i have seen get covered in the oozing latex and furrified hundreds of times, i too have become furrified. THAT is the true nature of this game. And when it came time for the game to end, i nearly wept. For i had become a Puro truther. Puro's pain had become my pain. i was assimilated. The game told me to get all the achievements. The game told me to purchase all the trading cards, to forge a badge, a badge to mark the game's victory over me. But why does defeat feel so liberating? This question i shall ponder for hours longer, as i complete Changed: Special Edition.", "timestamp_created": 1689055840, "timestamp_updated": 1689055840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4,

I sometimes wake up from these night terrors with a cold sweat, panting in the darkness of my bedroom. Visions of a wife, a pet, maybe even kids flood my mind; the only source of respite that warms me in my terror. However, the ending is always the same. Blackened ichor fills my mind as my dreams fade further and further away from me. Had it not been for the paralysis I could\u2019ve chased this ideal, the path I could have taken had I done things differently. That path was shut to me now, my future, morphed into a terror of the unknown that now stands before me. It pools in the corner of my room, taking a form that I cannot identify, even its subtle whiteness masked by the dark hour of the night. This beast does not move, and does not attack me. Yet it watches, maybe understanding the position I find myself in, as maybe I am not its only victim. However, as days continued and my mind is yanked from slumber it amasses autonomy, slowly but surely as I give it thought and legitimacy in my mind. Every time I awaken it inches closer and closer, form growing longer as the perspective moves from farther away, to almost looming over me. Now these days you can hear the subtle cacophony of droplets hitting the floor, growing louder and louder as I try to free myself from my cell, a cell I put myself in. My self incarceration only I can blame myself for, and my death penalty one that I had agreed to.

cant get past the first few rooms of the game, i feel like slowing the npcs down via a mod would improve the game prominently however due to lack of knowledge on modding rpg maker games i cannot do so. i recomend it to people who enjoy heavily trial and error games however the \"puzzles\" in the game arent necessarily puzzles and more of chase sequences through long courridors with opponents who are faster than you and in front of you. id anyone knows how i can make this game more enjoyable without the penalty of not being able to beat the game please comment and tell me how. this is not a

The Boss fights are hard (so prepare to suffer) and unique with each their own transfur animation same with the enemies you encounter in the game (so prepare to suffer even more). There is a Changed Special Edition, but its still under development and will probably be finished around late 2023 or early 2024.

words onto paper due to his progressing blindness. The epic, an extension of the biblical Genesis, was thought of to be a criticism of the British Commonwealth that serves as a warning for the values the British Commonwealth are losing that will make the \"paradise that was lost.\"  The epic would go on to be cited and parodied several times, becoming one of the most popular poems among the likes of T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land or Poe's The Raven. \nAmerican scholar Thomas Paine cites the poem in his 1776 pamphlet titled Common Sense, where he argues for British separation. Specifically, he quotes Satan pondering to himself, where he wonders what would happen if he attempted to seek forgiveness from God, thinking, \"For never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep.\" Paine uses this line to argue that because of the wars and taxation the British placed on America, that \"nature hath deserted the connection [between Britain and America],\" and that it can no longer happen, but actually, I think it's talking about how my friend gifted this to me and how i now feel about him anyways 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1686432110, "timestamp_updated": 1686432110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676981985569000244", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139852660": {"recommendationid": "139852660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412903828", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 595, "last_played": 1677764732}, "language": "english", "review": "Peak videogaming experience", "timestamp_created": 1686425948, "timestamp_updated": 1689251344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507042229175567627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139842899": {"recommendationid": "139842899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183685567", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1686398419}, "language": "english", "review": "transfur me :3", "timestamp_created": 1686413171, "timestamp_updated": 1686413171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502958595752716064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139839877": {"recommendationid": "139839877", "author": {"steamid": "76561199499544795", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1696893391}, "language": "english", "review": "     A large majority of people have a very common ability of being into something due to the plot and relatability. I however cannot say the same. I've never binged a show, played a full game in one sitting, or watched an entire movie franchise. However this game was special, this game CHANGED me. I love Change because it was something I can relate to and enjoy the plot/character development.\n     I've always had issues connecting to things, i would not consider myself normal by any means. I'm quite the recluse, I had my true passions from everyone, I hate talking about my sexuality and other personal things. However, after I had started taking this game seriously, I found myself really comfortable. I felt like Puro, I felt like Human. I felt myself portrayed all round. From my more submissive traits portrayed by Human, to my more masculine/dominate lustful traits portrayed by the \"enemy characters\". Puro especially i related to. leaving the pack to pursue what i wanted, even if it wasn't \"Normal\" or \"Natural instinct\". I also related to the bad parts of Puro: a loner yearning for a companion. Around 8 months ago I stopped pursing a chance of finding myself a companion. I had lost emotion for someone and I never wanted that feeling again so I suppress all emotions, almost becoming numb. However deep down, I wanted someone like Human to just stumble into my life like he did into Puro's. I want to trust, I want to feel, I wanted somebody there. This game was like looking into a twisted mirror into myself.\n     Furthermore, in addition to the extreme and personal connection I have with the characters. It also helped me realize that everything will be fine in the end. Puro goes from being a smart, lonely fella often seen as a monster, to a really good friend/lover (depends on how you look at Human's and Puro's relationship). Seeing him go to what I portray myself as to someone I want to be, it feels me with hope. Hope for the chance to explore a boundless world with my companion, It gave me a hope for difference, it gave me hope for change, I had changed.", "timestamp_created": 1686409370, "timestamp_updated":

The art is very unique, reminding me of a DS game like Rhythm Heaven, and the animation pretty good to boot. The story is quite cool, and the characters are nice too. I do have a bit of a distaste for the difficulty. This game is hard, and it gets really repetitive after dying over and over again, but there's not much you can do about that past letting you skip dialogue, and having closer checkpoints / savepoints so, I guess it's okay. The real problem I have with this game... The death animations. They're really- weird. They're strangely... sexual. It made me very uncomfortable every time the screens came up, and made me feel uncomfortable playing the game in general in fear of seeing another screen like that. The concept was there it really was. The idea of a living gloop running around trying to get you, and when it does it takes over your entire body transforming you into something not human, is terrifying. I thought it would be a horror game based of what I knew going in. And well, this game is a horror game to me, but for all the wrong reasons. The death screens ruin the game for me. Ignoring that fact though, (which is hard) the game was alright. Most of the music was a bop, and the diversity between the different infected people was cool. Just... god the death scenes.

First of all, how on gods green earth is this game CUTE to people? I mean, it literally has a mature content warning because of the animations in this game! And even then, the mature content warning is easily bypassed by a small child with one click. And, that's not the only part. The mature content, which because I want to at least have a CHANCE at the pearly gates I am not going to describe here, depicts some.... Non family friendly activities between a furry and a human being. (The trailer gives you a pretty good image of this, and yes I know the scenes are not detailed and do not show the parts you'd find in normal similar content which is all I'm saying) While I mostly don't mind furries, making sexual content out of them is absolutely disgusting. It's gross and wrong to make that type of content with a character that has animal traits, because I don't care if it also has human aspects, they have animal traits, and that instantly throws out all chance of that stuff being okay. It's no different to bestiality, and should be considered so. Anyway there's some ramblings over this pornographic, perverted, steaming pile of shit game.

game.\n\nHowever, Remy is dumb as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Like seriously? Putting in the carrots AFTER the beef when making bolognese sauce? How the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 did this dumbass get a job to teach people how to cook and she puts the carrots in after the beef? I tried like 3 times to get a perfect dish for the achievement, and then going back and reading the instructions I realise I'm doing it in the \"wrong\" order. Well, dumbass, you put the carrots in WITH the onions as carrots contain a high water content that needs to be heated and evaporated to make sure the sauce isn't too watery (which can happen if you have a lot of vegetables) and to intensify the flavour. Moreover, putting the carrots in early helps them get direct heat with the pan, which enhances their flavour even further and ensures all pieces get cooked at the same time. Now, because this absolute troglodyte put them in after, it becomes much harder to balance the cooking time of the beef and the carrots to ensure best possible flavour, AND because of the lack of space in the pan it's much harder for the carrots to get direct heat in order to cook them at the same time and concentrate their flavour. Sure, make the argument \"wElL iTs gRaTeD cArrOT sO iT doEsNt mAtTeR\", it's still best practice to teach people to cook vegetables all at once in most scenarios. Instead of teaching this london train station meal, teach people why certain veg need to be cooked more depending on their density and water content, and in special cases like onions, why direct heat is needed to ensure caramelisation and enhanced flavour. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 dumbass, being one of the oldest (if not the oldest) character in the game and she does that. Id rather have Jax's microwave mac'n'cheese or Seth's ramen noodles than that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. At least they don't act as though they know what they're doing when it comes to cooking, being honest with yourself about a dish you made and looking for realistic improvements is one of (if not) the best way to improve what you create, so why can't I critique her tutorial. Also, how the flying \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 did she manage to get FRESH herbs but not DRY herbs? Dry herbs are on supermarket shelves pretty much all year round, and cost significantly less than fresh herbs per kg. However, she could get the freshest rosemary or thyme plant watered with triple distilled unicorn tears and it still wouldn't make up for the fact that she put the carrots in after the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 beef. Wanker. I'm not even gonna go off on the lack of seasoning for the sake it's a game but I can't forgive the war crime that was. Making that recipe public is just asking to get cement-shoe'd by the Sicilian mafia. Complete character assassination, was an 11/10 big tiddy bunny girl, but now she's just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665.", "timestamp_created": 1685215823, "timestamp_updated": 1685812460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402750462293624878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139092410": {"recommendationid": "139092410", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024779380", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1687099286}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck this game someone gifted it to me and now i have to actually play it to get the steam cards fuuuuck", "timestamp_created": 1685201439, "timestamp_updated": 1685201439, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489323854446411133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139066716": {"recommendationid": "139066716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814576833", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1683156840}, "language": "english", "review": "this game made me  and gooped me up one billion ! thumbs up and also how to i make my twitter likes private", "timestamp_created": 1685171299, "timestamp_updated": 1685171299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520766794681549072", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139042261": {"recommendationid": "139042261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198994540205", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 24824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12256, "last_played": 1691838942}, "language": "english", "review": "based brought for the death stayed for the story", "timestamp_created": 1685133118, "timestamp_updated": 1685133118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139041439": {"recommendationid": "139041439", "author": {"steamid": "76561199013346080", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1699474824}, "language": "english", "review": "good game just way to fucking hard :(", "timestamp_created": 1685132220, "timestamp_updated": 1685132220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "139027366": {"recommendationid": "139027366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198887095072", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1009, "last_played": 1689465539}, "language": "english", "review": "Changed is honestly a really bad puzzle game.\nClunky Controls\nUnfun puzzles\nPunishing you for not choosing a specific dialogue, which will take you ages to figure it out.\n\nAnd changed special is even worse, all it is right now is pretty much just Dragon Snow drawing all their possible kinks, and their supporters kinks into a single game.

To be honest, I'll probably keep playing it, if only to say that I finished it and feel somewhat justified for having spent money on it. But it is one of the most infuriating things I have ever tried to play through. The \"puzzles\" are only challenging because the slightest mistake leads to you dying and having to start over from the last checkpoint, which is usually farther back than it should be and stuck behind a cutscene or unskippable lines of dialogue. Half of the boss fights don't even have save points right after them. This means you have to trudge through the same scenes again and again only to keep dying to the same thing. Almost every single room has the threat of death and losing progress if you misstep or investigate the wrong item, often for seemingly no reason except because they can. The mechanics are not explained well and leave you trying to figure them out yourself most of the time. None of the chases seem to have any sort of consistency. It's purely luck whether or not you are able to succeed at them, and the enemies move so stupidly quickly that even the tiniest slip up causes you to get caught instantly with no chance for correction. Even if you don't appear to make any mistakes, you still end up dying half of the time. The game is difficult--and not in a fun way. It has potential, but it's nearly impossible to focus on the story or enjoying the experience when I'm too busy being frustrated about the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1684714505, "timestamp_updated": 1684771667, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "138723143": {"recommendationid": "138723143", "author": {"steamid": "76561199446315825", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 182, "last_played": 1684864850}, "language": "english", "review": "Im sorry but this game is very badly made with it being masked as difficulty.

For this tutorial, i am going to be using a plastic water bootle as an example. Place about 50 miligrams of nitrogen chloride in the bottle then insert your dry ice carefully. Mix your contents with about half a spoon of vinegar in the bottle. Close and shake your bottle careffuly and allow the dry ice to impact the cap. The point of impact will become where you attach your shoelace. Tape your shoelace onto the impact point.

The game's voice acting is superb, adding an extra layer of realism and immersion to the experience.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are equally impressive, with an expansive open-world that allows you to explore every corner of the city, from the bustling downtown streets to the sun-soaked beaches. The game's driving mechanics are especially noteworthy, with an array of vehicles to choose from and a physics engine that makes every car, motorcycle, and boat feel unique.\n\nOverall, \"Changed\" is a timeless classic that remains just as enjoyable today as it was upon its initial release.

(And play it till the end)[/h1] And this is a NORMAL review!!!, Don't listen those Goofy Ahh ppl who played it for 2 minutes, got transfurred, And ran to write here something what causes a vague idea of \u200b\u200bthe whole picture of the game!!.\n\nAll this review is everything what I able to say, everything what I able to write about Changed, And here's only my opinion and how do I look at the game. Ofc you can look at this game different way, But... I will appreciate if you will understand my point of view and the way I looked at it.\n\nSooo.. The first thing I want to say is that this game is not really about furries, I think that furries were just brought into this game to make it easier to show the essence of the tragedy. Tbh, from the beginning of the game, It will show you almost everything that this game can. The first troubles, showdowns with latex monsters, tragedy in the world, interesting elements of the game, And... And the headache. But no-no-no This is not all potential of the game, this game is good because you can found something what is matching with our real life!, A human being life!. At least as I see this. because look, Everything in this game will try to kill you, totally from nowhere, trick you, make you stuck!, Bc you don't know the password Or reasons why this or something else happens this way, ([spoiler]For example why Puro will transfur us after generator.[/spoiler]) make you feel yourself hopeless, being out of ideas what to do next or where are you going (The game even reminds you about it all). And what is the most interesting and even scary thing in Changed is that All these events in the game, all the game lore that you learn about, has a strong impact on the player's psyche!. Like fr, I even had depression for a while, Because this all situation is very similar to my life O_O . Bc at the moment, in my life everything tryin to hurt me, I dont have friends, any help from anywhere, and alot of unpredictability. And this game as Another Universe or illustration of this all is totally correct and matching with what I have in reality. So guess this is the Main thing why I extremely fall in love with Changed!!!. Like all things in this game are connected with each other Like for example Would you ever think that a robot cleaner that likes the player will one day save your life!, Like, oh my god, what a small but cool detail!!, Made into the game!.\n\nSo guess thats it. Don't want to talk about Changed-Special here (And I think I dont need to bc I said my opinion to the Whole game picture.) But I want to mention that there are also quite funny moments that made me smile!!, Such as the moment where you're really got scared that puro is dead and you're too late, and Colin says - \"Sorry\" to Puro when holding his head, And after some seconds Puro Opening his eyes and answering \"Sorry for Whaaat??\", \"Our Puro taught us not to be ashamed of our decisions. Especially since they\u2019re such good size and all.\" And everything like that \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSo yeah I feel like Im already going crazy bc of what I had to write so yeah. Thats all. Thank you if you payed attention to this review. Or if not. I will feel very awkward \ud83d\ude02\nSo yeah tysm!!! This game is GLORIOUS Game!!, And can be popular like Undertale bc this games are kinda have the same idea!. Tysm DragonSnow for this game!, Its real masterpiece and with fact that its only 2 ppl doing a whole game is wonderful! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.", "timestamp_created": 1682258836, "timestamp_updated": 1682261795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137156733": {"recommendationid": "137156733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198908090849", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 597, "last_played": 1687891665}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No pude ser amigo de puro \ud83d\ude2d", "timestamp_created": 1682233599, "timestamp_updated": 1682233599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137151572": {"recommendationid": "137151572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068285964", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 396, "last_played": 1682223506}, "language": "english", "review": "My friend wanted me to play this game.

Not enough so that it could be classified as such. There are a few chase scenes as you run away from enemies, which are fine on their own; however, these chase scenes usually start with 1-2 seconds cut-scenes, which cannot be skipped. This sounds manageable, unless you are struggling immensely with certain paths (like the white tail chase) because of the hard-to-manage controls. This results in what feels like an eternity wasted just waiting to fail again. After the first fail, doesn't it make sense to either let the cut-scene be skippable or just remove it entirely?\nWhile the music isn't bad, after a while, it can get very repetitive, yet that is partially my fault, for sucking at the game. HOWEVER, some of the areas just don't have music, which was very strange. The sound of silence is very loud. \nThe best part about this game (for me) was the slip-n-slides, which truly felt like puzzles, and not brute force. \nLastly, for anyone wondering what this game should rated age-wise, M, M for Mature (17+), because there is no reason that anyone should have to involuntarily view these inappropriate images without consent. [The game does not give a warning about lewd images.]\n\nP.S. I can now never use the word \"change\" ever again.\nP.S.S.

This game is an absolute gem, combining challenging puzzles with a heartwarming and unique romance storyline.\n\nThe puzzle gameplay is top-notch, requiring careful planning and strategy to progress through each level. The puzzles are well-designed and never feel overly frustrating, striking a great balance between challenge and accessibility. The controls are easy to learn and responsive, making it easy to focus on the puzzles themselves.\n\nBut what really sets Changed apart is the romance aspect. The relationship between the protagonist and Puro is sweet and endearing, and the developers did an excellent job of making the romance feel genuine and believable. I found myself getting invested in the characters and their story, and was thrilled to see how things progressed as I worked my way through the game.\n\nThe visuals in Changed are also worth noting \u2013 the game has a unique and eye-catching art style that really brings the world to life. The characters are all well-designed and expressive, and the environments are full of detail and charm.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend Changed highly enough. It's a perfect blend of puzzle gameplay and romance storytelling, and it left me with a warm and fuzzy feeling in my heart.

"last_played": 1681976734}, "language": "english", "review": "It was 10pm one april evening, and I wasn't tired, but I wanted to play a game in my backlog. Decided to finally give Changed a shot.\n\nIf you want the tl;dr:\n~ This game can be VERY frustrating, with some puzzles being cryptic (You might need to pull out a guide), the chase sequences seemingly based on RNG. It might feel unfair at times.\n~ But this has an intriguing, fun story, great art style, great music, it's funny, cute, and If you're even mildly curious, give it a shot!\n~ If you don't like the look of slimy, wet latex look, then you might need to look elsewhere, or look at some other footage online to see if it's for you aesthetically.\n\n\nLonger review:\nThe screenshots really sucked me in, the art looked just so enjoyable! I was curious by these \"gooey creatures\" there, and your character turning into said creatures. I then decided to go for it.\n\nWhat I got in the end was an endearing adventure on friendship and sacrifice. And I want more! Even after I've 100% seen everything. \n\nWaking up in your capsule, scared, alone and attacked immediately, sets the stage for a game that will not hold your hand.\nFrom a moment that might be of respite, only to be turned around and actually hostile. There's no hope here, until you find a seemingly neutral monster that isn't going to attack you.\n\n\nThis game has really great artistic design. It feel's \"ms paint like\" old style flash game, but polished. I'm not sure if there's an actual name for this style, but when the game was trying to portray you feeling uneasy, I felt uneasy. When you felt scared? I felt scared. It's like this fear of the unknown. You don't know what's going to pop around every corner, or come out of the floor, walls or anything.\nI'll be honest too. I don't normally like the wet latex look. The idea of sticky, slime blobs and slime and stuff like that creeps me out, makes me feel uneasy. Knowing that the creatures \"assimilate\" you made me feel incredibly uncomfortable at first. The thought of your player being only wearing shorts the whole game, no shoes or shirt, the thought of getting this latex on them just made me incredibly uneasy. But after a while, I dig it actually, and I grew to like it!\n\nThe music, sound design, I thought it fit well. Atmospheric, and the music really fitting the experience too! I enjoyed this aspect, and I found new favorite chip-tune music to play!\n\n\nBut I want to probably bring out 2 of the most decisive parts of this game I feel. \n1: I had to pull out a guide on some parts because some of the puzzles felt too obtuse, cryptic to actually get through. Although I'm not the most proficient with puzzle games so your mileage may vary.\n\n2: Some encounters feel they're rooted in RNG and may take multiple tries to get through which isn't the most fun. I found them entertaining though and I kept pushing through. To be fair I'm also very stubborn and will keep trying and trying until I either win or get frustrated and ragequit. I kept pushing through, never felt the urge to ragequit! I always learned what to look out for, and became a more proficient player from last time.\n\n\n\nI really enjoy my time with this game. It was fun, it made me laugh, it made me feel things in my gut. I smiled, I was happy. This game made me happy, and I enjoyed every moment with it.\n\nIf you can have Patience for some of the more RNG aspects, difficult puzzles, and it's style of Furry TF related stuff, you got a fun game, and a great experience ahead! I recommend it. \n\n\nAlso yeah this game is very much rooted on Furry Transformation content!", "timestamp_created": 1681978655, "timestamp_updated": 1681978655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

I do not recommend buying unless it is on sale, or if you have nothing better to spend your money on. It took me 13.7 hours to complete entirely, and that was with consulting a guide whenever I got stuck on something for more than an hour. Whenever the game gives you hints it's either just straight up the answer or basically entirely indecipherable, and even then guides won't help you in chase sections. If you're going to play this, try to use different hands for interacting with objects and moving, it took me way too long to figure that out, and at least for the early game chases (like the cheetah in the vents) it aids tremendously. This game is almost entirely just hitting your head against a brick wall until something works, and often sections rely entirely on RNG to decide if you're actually able to solve them or not. The only entirely skill based section I can think of, at least off the top of my head, is the Red Crystal Cave, which is literally at the end of the game anyway. Oh and, if you're playing this game without consulting any guide after getting stuck, make sure to interact with Puro whenever possible, thank me later.\n\nHal Wes!", "timestamp_created": 1681508476,

I expected it to completely destroy my sanity. I was suprised. I enjoyed playing this game a lot, comparable to my favourites, like Hollow Knight, Celeste, Terraria, Rain World and many more. I'm going to seriously review this game now. Be careful, some minor spoilers ahead.\n\nThe furry aspect of Changed\nSo this part is probably why you are reading this. And uhm~ fair I guess. The game is clearly oriented around the concept of furries And it's true. Changed gets dangerously close to the \"suggestive\" border. Before I played it, I expected it to uhm~ cross the border. I hate to clarify it again, but I was DARED to play it, and I take dares seriously. I am NOT interested in any freaky furry stuff. I really hope that's clear to everyne. One of the main concepts of the game - transfurmations is uhm~ interesting. Basically, you lose the game when you get touched by certain enemy creatures. Upon death, you get transformed into an anthro- thing. They all have their own animations.\n\nFuck why is this game fun - the gameplay\nThe gameplay mainly consists of running away, solving puzzles, etc. Basic rpg stuff. My main point is that Changed is NOT an easy game. I love hard games, and reseting hundreds of time just get to the next part of the story might not be for everyone, but it is something for me. The savepoints are fair and not frustrating. The puzzles are decent, not always very fun, but they are great still.\n\nIm crying rn - the story\nAs much as the concept of the whole game is uhh~ questionable, the story is just amazing. I love it, the characters, the world, it's dripping with emotions (no pun intended :clyde: ). You can see the motivations behind each of the three characters very well. The aren't much decisions to make in Changed, but when there are, you feel an extreme weight behind them. I loved the ending of the game the most, it felt very emotional and I loved it. I've grown very attached to those characters, and i felt their reasoning very well. This was truly one of the best pieces of storytelling I have ever experienced, along with the games like Celeste or Hollow Knight. Changed is amazing at making you feel emotions they want you to feel. The despair, hopelessness and powerlessness of waking up in an unfamiliar, dead world, with everything trying to \"change\" you makes you really enjoy those moments when you find someone who you can trust and who can help you.\n\nArtstyle\nCool ig, reminds me of OneShot. I just don't really understand why they had to make multiple animations of the player being turned into furry creatures\n\nNumber summary\nGameplay: 8/10 (it was hard)\nStory: 10/10 (very emotional)\nGraphic design:7/10 (decent ig)\nCharacters: 10/10 (puro ^w^)\nMusic: 9/10 (i love 8bit and chiptune)\n\nSo, basically I would recommend you to play this game, but be warned of the \"transfurmations\" uhmm~ they might make you feel a bit uncomfortable , if they dont, then theres something wrong with you.\nI can safely compare this game to OneShot, though it isn't fourth-wall-breaking.\nCya.", "timestamp_created": 1681164124, "timestamp_updated": 1681164124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750973820686340332", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136488526": {"recommendationid": "136488526", "author": {"steamid": "76561199115701769", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1681149369}, "language": "english", "review": "this is dark souls furry edition", "timestamp_created": 1681155771, "timestamp_updated": 1681390045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136466401": {"recommendationid": "136466401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119533897", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1681079172}, "language": "english", "review": "I heard this game was good so  i tired it,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was so awful that i puked all over, never have i seen such a shitty, uninspired, furry and boring game. \nI swear The first 30 mins of the game is so boring i alt tabbed and watched paint dry.

The art style is cute, as are the characters and interactions. My heart was kept rather warm for the duration of the game (at least as far as I could make it.) And obviously the game will probably awaken... something, within you. The only issue is how unbelievably infuriating the actual gameplay can get. \n\nThe game was apparently made in RPG Maker XV. It utilizes an invisible grid system for movement, which is honestly the entire problem. There are multiple chases and puzzles to complete while being harangued by wandering enemies. The issue is you have to be absolutely *perfect* with your movements and placements, which isnt easy when the grid system isnt displayed and you constantly are catching on invisible grid corners or hitting enemies hit boxes without realizing it. It doesnt help that the movement controls seemingly cant be changed from the default awful arrow keys to WASD. Why I must use the arrow keys when I almost never do in any other game, I do not know.\n\n I made it as far as probably 75% of the way through the normal difficulty version and got to a point where you have to simultaneously dodge floating enemies and stationary obstacles, all while a robot mimics your movements in a different area. You have to make the robot navigate a course with YOUR movements while UNABLE to see it half the time. So while my eyes are on it (or Im trying to get the camera to pan to it), I get hit with an enemy or blunder into a trap on my side. I gave up, as this was probably the fifth time I was filled with frustration just trying to get past one area. I was even following a walkthrough play by play. \n\nIs it all a skill issue? Sure. I admit I sucked at this game. But I ran out of steam, and I bet many people will too. Until the next \"special\" version comes out that supposedly lessens the difficulty, I cannot recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1681003095, "timestamp_updated": 1681003095, "voted_up":

I had already watched Neco the Sergal on a few episodes before playing but I found out it's quite a good puzzle game with an interesting story; I was really worried it would be super fetishy and stuff but it's fine. I do think anyone can enjoy this game but people who like anthromorphic animals will enjoy it more as the person who made it is a furry I think.\n\nSome of the things I enjoyed: I think the game really nails the ambience, you truly feel you are in a apocalyptic world rather than just being in one especially when you go outside.  I also really enjoy the retro styled art the developer used; and also DragonSnow's friend SHIZ I think made an excellent soundtrack to match it. The latex beasts are awesome too and the art they have. \n\nI do think the most important aspect of Changed is its benefit on people's mental health. I think in this hard world, you need this kind of escapism to help you release all the pain you have and keep you going. I think mental health within the furry community is generally quite difficult because when going through stresses, you desire that certain someone who's a anthro to help you out. I know I wish there were literal anthros walking around but know that it ain't true. However, your relationship with Puro is that someone in Changed who is that anthro helping you in life. I know that was a bit of a tangent just to talk about Puro but it's the kind of escapism that helps me get all that stress off my chest and keep me going. I know this is a bit cheesy but maybe you have experienced or will experience the same thing while playing this game.\n\nRegarding the endings, I'll try not to spoil anything but some of them are quite gut-wrenching especially with the context. However, a bit of a negative are the conditions to get some of the endings; you'll probably need to read up a guide after getting a bad ending to see where you went wrong. I recommend saving in different slots so you can choose the best point to try and get the other endings. The conditions are mainly to do with your interactions with Puro but with the best of intentions (and for someone like myself who loves Puro to bits) it's extremely difficult to get a good ending without looking up guides.\n\nI think there are some sections of this game that were really difficult. I know some people talk about the difficulty of the squid boss but I thought the shark boss was harder. There was one puzzle to find a code that I would never have found out without a guide but majority of them I could work out. It takes a bit more thinking but quite satisfying when you work it out.\n\nTo summarise, I love this game and love the anthro aspect of it. I do recommend this to furries but also non-furries too who like a warm but tear wrenching game with puzzles and a bit of action. The game will only take you 2 hours to complete if you know what to do but it took me 12 hours as there's a lot of puzzles and difficult parts that take a number of times to do. I'm also looking forward to the special edition when DragonSnow releases it. The awesome thing is DragonSnow is very passionate about his game and I'm sure he'll improve on a already awesome game.\n\nAlso thank you so much for making a game that touches my heart. I am deeply grateful for this game and has helped me out in life so much. I wish all the best for the developer and hope he continues to find success in his game development career!", "timestamp_created": 1680198399, "timestamp_updated": 1680198399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "135719229": {"recommendationid": "135719229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204756329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 484, "last_played": 1680571089}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game for a friend and I bought it for myself as a joke.

And I need those 2 hours, so might as well give it a shot, right?\n\nSadly, I do not recommend this game for a variety of reasons.\n\nAs for the menu:\nNo resolution control, no audio control, no changeable keybinds, no nothing.\nThere's really only two buttons you'll be using outside of your arrow keys: shift for run, z for interact.\nBoth of which I have an issue with.\n1 - Forced to use z even on qwertz layout.\n2 - Outside of sneaking areas you'll hardly ever let go of shift. All it does is tire your pinky.\n\nAs for gameplay:\nThere's two difficulty options, easy and normal.\nThe timings on chase sequences are very tight, even on easy difficulty, making me wonder why it exists in the first place.\nParticularly since choosing easy will end the game at the halfway mark and lock you out of the true ending. Why?\nThe way to progress is not through skill, but trial and error, and some encounters are entirely RNG based.\nYou get a key - F12 - to skip death scenes, but you cannot skip the cutscenes ahead of chases, which you'll be rewatching a lot.\nYou will encounter button mash mechanics that are designed to f*** with you.\nThe abundance of insta-kill obstacles, particularly in safe zones, is more of a nuisance than anything.\nAdditionally it is very easy to accidentally brick your save file by saving in the wrong spot in the wrong moment.\n\nChanged advertises itself as 'high difficulty' and is designed to test your patience. But even when compared to typical rage games in the I WANNA format, Changed does not hold up. All in all I've been mostly left with a feeling of frustration rather than accomplishment. Changed is not made to challenge you, but to p*** you off.\nThis is a crudely made game worth ~20 minutes of playtime, not accounting for the additional hours of trial and error, with little love put into it looking at the complete lack of basic game settings, and the various grammatical errors within the dialogue.\n\nThe only redeeming quality here are the stickers you can get from the points shop.

"language": "english", "review": "Short review: If you are really looking for a rather odd and obscure indie rpg then this isn\u2019t a bad choice. (Spoilers) Longer review:I bought Changed simply because I thought it was a weird furry game that I could stream to my friends as a joke, but also partially because I was curious as to whether or not the game had something more to offer. I was honestly surprised with how much more effort was put into the game than I anticipated. The gameplay and its mechanics are relatively simple. You explore, solve puzzles, and dodge monsters. However, it still manages to be very challenging. You will most definitely be spending a lot of time doing certain areas on your first play through. I would say that the majority of the games puzzles and other challenges are at least somewhat enjoyable  (though some are rng dependent). Some memorable ones include the very first password puzzle, the chase sequences, and the two water level bosses. You essentially avoid fighting directly against most enemies. The monsters and areas you will see along the way are unique, even if they are similar to previous versions. Again, the gameplay is simple but it still works. The OST isn\u2019t anything I would listen to on it\u2019s own but the simple tunes can be nice to listen to in game. Now for the main draw of the game, the story. You play as a human who wakes up in an abandoned tower with little to no recollection of what has happened. The tower is a research facility and it has latex furries wanting to infect you. You journey through these obstacles to escape as you also figure out what has happened to the outside world. Along the way you meet Puro, a silly talking latex furry. He\u2019s important to the plot as he influences every ending in the game. (You pretty much have to be nice to him or your run will cut short) At the second half of the game you and Puro work together to escape until you are stopped and captured by Dr. K another talking furry that was once a human. He explains how the research facility is meant to find a treatment to a disease that almost wiped out humanity and that you may have the virus. If you were nice to Puro, Dr. K will be knocked out. giving you time to escape. At the end, Dr. K confronts the player once again to give them a choice to either stay and sacrifice yourself for humanity or leave with Puro and risk dying. The story is quite interesting with its sci-fI aspects and it\u2019s focus on the relationship between the human and Puro. Overall, I would say Changed isn\u2019t a bad game when you look at it with an open mind. If you can ignore the fetishy aspects then it can be a just a nice game that may give you a new perspective on furry\u2019s (not joking).", "timestamp_created": 1679639521, "timestamp_updated":

But in the end, even though there are some suggestive scenes, it doesn't really have anything that lewd, it's actually much softer than the ecchi you normally see in anime. There's nothing sexually explicit, it's actually pretty cute and wholesome and has some Undertale vibes to it. It's one of the best indie games I've played, just wish it was longer (but looks like the special-edition will fix that).\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nQuite simple 2D game where you basically just have to walk around and interact with things, you also have to run once in a while.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game is entirely in flat color pixel art, it has good quality and some cutscenes feature even more detailed pixel art.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe soundtrack is quite nice and it fits well with the atmosphere of the game. The sound effects are okay.\n\n[h1]Price[/h1]\nThe game has a fair price for the content it provides.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nThe game is mostly linear so it isn't hard to find everything and most of the puzzles are easy as well, although some may take a while to find out what you need to do. There are some parts where you need to be fast, which can be challenging, but nothing impossible.\n\n[h1]Duration[/h1]\nThe game is a bit short, even if you explore everything and want to get all endings, but the upcoming special edition will add a lot of content so it will be a little longer.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nYou may want to play again to get an ending you lost or just to see some game over scenes you haven't seen in your previous run.\n\n[h1]Achievements[/h1]\nThey are fairly easy to get, you just need to get all endings, which are quite easy to achieve.\n\n[h1]Problems[/h1]\nIn the Portuguese version, there's a puzzle you can't normally solve because of a mistranslation, the only workaround is to search for the answer on the web.", "timestamp_created": 1679238507, "timestamp_updated": 1685476519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134969408": {"recommendationid": "134969408", "author": {"steamid": "76561199476687884", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1696620507}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish i could give this game a yes-ish-no-ish, cause its semi fun, Its pretty hard and mostly repeats its self in different settings.

I'm okay with a bad ending, if it would at the very least let me finish it. Now to see the rest of the game I'd have to go through the many chase scenes and puzzles coupled with the worst movement in a modern game I've seen: It does not accept more than one movement direction, meaning you can't walk diagonally unlike every single other modern 2D game, meaning before getting used to having to let go of one movement key before pressing the other one and changing direction, you're going to walk into goo puddles and get stuck on walls frequently. The hitboxes of objects also aren't clear sometimes, meaning what clearly appears to be two objects blocking your way, there's actually an empty space between them somehow, or you'll be stepping on a puddle but not actually in the puddle's hitbox and therefore not dying. I enjoyed the game's art and the story it was trying to tell, but I don't believe not going though uninteresting dialogue should award you such an early bad ending without any warning.

But I promise you that this game is very fun even though some of the controls and A.I. is clunky it is still A very amazing game. the bosses and chase sequences are usually passed with skills but sometimes it relies on RNG. Sometimes the A.I. is moves faster than the last attempt or slower which can throw off your rhythm of how to go about passing the sequence heck sometimes even the movement screws with you by making it so you don't move in the direction you pressed when you are pressing two keys at once even though it worked last attempt. This may cause you to rage quit but even though I have rage quit many times I can't help coming back to try and get past that one part that has stopped me and then I somehow get through. That is to say you can really only pass some parts with time and patience along with a clear mind. This game is overflowing with character and I would recommend this game to anyone with a interest in a furry puzzle game that is very unforgiving. That or you have a transformation fetish either or I don't judge!\n\nSincerely, Someone who just wants to be honest about what the game is and recommend it to as many as I can I really hope you found

I failed at this game for 6 whole hours of my life. But you know what, I do not regret it. It's so hard to the point of making me want to blow my brains out, but when I get past a section, you get that dopamine rush, not to mention the art in this game is pretty swell. The dialogue is quirky and you've got to appreciate the feeling of no hope in this game, you literally are the prey, bottom of the entire food-chain, you and your stubby little fucking hands can't do a thing against goo, so you run. You run until you literally cant no more.\nBut now that I'm done with it, I've beaten it senseless and I've died countless times, I want to go back. This game really lifts my spirits and just makes me feel, I dunno.. Happy. Happy is a good word.\n\nFinal statement; This game will turn your little brother into a furry and disappoint your parents to an extent.", "timestamp_created": 1676963482, "timestamp_updated":

More like CHASED!! *buh dum tss*\nBut seriously this game is a \"Get chased by bad guy\" Simulator.\nThe only thing that holds this game is the story and banger ost. Everything else is straight dog water. Lets also mention that this is a kink game, so if you feel uncomfortable with that type of stuff than this game aint for you. The difficulty in this game is straight up unfun. I died more times in this game than I have ever in any Soulsborne game. I think I died more than 100 times. I beat the game, but got the bad ending. I think It was because I didnt kiss puro's ass 17,000 times. I would recommend this game, but at the same time I wont. Just wait until the remaster comes out. Hopefully it'll be a lot less chasey and a lot more fun.

I also found the story to be a bit frustrating in that characters would do things for seemingly no reason or against their own motives just so that the game could progress.

I'll try to review it regardless, but your decision to buy it will probably hinge on this fact.\n\nChanged offers a range of challenges including creative puzzles and action segments. The music is one of the positive aspects, with respectable chiptunes that complement the gameplay without getting in the way. \nThat being said, it is excruciatingly difficult, with challenges that are hard to solve, sometimes relying on guesswork even. The action segments are often frustrating due to trial and error and input issues (it's made in RPG Maker). The story is shallow and the game is only 6-10 hours long, with a lot of the length depending on puzzle solving skills. The save points are also usually far from challenges, which feels really annoying. \nProbably the thing you might be most interested in, which is the art, is actually pretty middling and relies on being a fetish to bring value. The death animations and post transformation art are limited, and the quality isn't outstanding either. It is pretty much what you paid for, at this price point.\n\nI can recommended it only for those who enjoy the artistic content. If you were gifted it by friends, it can be fun with them in voice chat, as they can help with puzzles and laugh at the challenges. \nIn the end though, it is not recommended for non-furries (and probably even many furries) looking for a good game, as it is often frustrating and just plain not worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1675363391, "timestamp_updated": 1675363419, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511812508106231689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132042975": {"recommendationid": "132042975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143327770", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 534, "last_played": 1679328723}, "language": "english", "review": "I would literally die for Puro; don't play.\n\nPlayed On: \nUbuntu 22.04\nIntel Core i7-10700KF\n16GB RAM\nNVIDIA RTX 3070 ti\n", "timestamp_created": 1675313038, "timestamp_updated": 1675313038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132035522": {"recommendationid": "132035522", "author": {"steamid": "76561199100594879", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 117, "last_played": 1679094776}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so this game is actually amazing!

Enjoy doing the boss fight again, sucker.\n\nAnd then, the actual storyline. Gosh. I grew attached to these characters, and understood their motivations and inner struggles. It feels ridiculous to say this.

A sedan and a station wagon were available, with rear-wheel drive. Its predecessor was Recolt.\nIt was positioned next to the Senator, Opel's flagship at the time. Despite competing with the likes of the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz Medium-Class and Audi 100, Opel stopped producing the Omega in 2002 and has since exited the E-segment.The second generation model, Omega B, appeared in 1993 (sales in Japan began in 1994). Adopted a bolder aero look. The body was enlarged to integrate with the Senator, and the body shape was a sedan and a station wagon. In addition, the long-lasting in-line 6-cylinder engine was replaced with a newly developed V-type 6-cylinder engine.\nIn the UK, the Carlton name was abolished and replaced with the Vauxhall Omega, similar to Opel.\nIt was improved every year in 1996, 1997, 1998, and in 1999 (Japan specification from 2000) minor changes were carried out. The design of each part has been changed to show dignity suitable for Opel's flagship, and the slightly too aggressive design has changed to something that is more acceptable to conservatives. The interior was also changed from an instrument panel that used many curves to a straight line design. In Japan, it is commonly called 2000B after minor changes. In the home country, a BMW 6-cylinder diesel engine was also set. In addition, a model equipped with the same V-type 8-cylinder 5.7-liter engine as the Chevrolet Corvette was also released for a limited time.\nAt the time, GM's Cadillac division sold sedans under the name Catera to compete with BMW, Mercedes, and the newcomer Lexus in the United States, but sales were poor. The Catera was discontinued in the 2001 model year, and the following year it became the Cadillac CTS, although it was the same rear-wheel drive car but adopted a newly designed platform called Sigma Architecture. CTS stands for \"Katera Touring Sedan\".\nThe models officially imported to Japan are as follows. A sedan or wagon body shape could be selected for all grades.\n- Omega GL\nIn-line 4-cylinder DOHC engine 1,998cc 136 horsepower\nA rare model that was introduced in the middle of the model life and dropped out of the catalog due to minor changes.\n- Omega CD\nV-type 6-cylinder DOHC engine 2,497cc 170 horsepower\nA core model of Omega B. It was the best-selling grade.\n- Omega Sport\nV-type 6-cylinder DOHC engine 2,596cc 180 horsepower\nAppeared at the end of the model. Based on the CD, the displacement was expanded and the engine management was changed. At the same time, the suspension and brakes were strengthened, and it was a sports-oriented grade that enhanced driving performance.\n- Omega MV6\nV-type 6-cylinder DOHC engine 2,962cc 210 horsepower\nOmega's top model. Since the Senator has been abolished, it is effectively Opel's flagship.", "timestamp_created": 1673778298, "timestamp_updated": 1673778298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 11,

A game not being fun is the most scathing insult I can make towards a game. Note that I didn't play the special edition, but from what I can tell the only notable differences would be that the game would be slightly less of an eye-sore and slightly easier.\nPros:\n- excellent rockin' Gameboy-esque soundtrack\n- if you're part of the 0.0000001% or whatever of the human population who is into various homo-erotic furry scifi transformations, this game sure has a lot of that for you to touch yourself to\n- Puro is an interesting, cute, and fun character\n- it has somewhat interesting sci-fi universe and setting\n- it is dirt cheap when on sale, so if you don't like it and can't refund it, you don't waste a lot of money, just time.\nCons:\n- the game isn't challenging in a fun way, it's just designed to kill you a lot to force you to watch homo-erotic \"transfurs\". Challenges are either based on going through an area a few times to learn what to do to not get insta-killed, RNG, QTEs, or exploiting bad enemy AI. It felt like a waste of time, unlike other challenging games. There was one especially poor fight, that based on RNG would make it impossible for you to win.\n- the game gives you too much exposition telling you what you should be thinking and feeling. The game's \"point-and-click\" aspects could have been done a lot better, and would've been better with a more \"show don't tell\" design\n- the game dialog and cutscenes and transformation scenes are unskippable, and to boot they're verbose and meander too much. This is a big pain-point, as if you're like me you'll die several times before getting though an area, and you'll be forced to go through dialog and transformation sequences over an over. After the first couple of times viewing dialogs or scenes, I just want to skip them so I can try the challenge again. Even though the game is generous with save points, they still don't feel like enough due to the unskippable dialogs.\n- if you miss triggering several easily accidentally missable dialogs with Puro even once in the first half of the game, you essentially miss out on the second half of the game. I can understand triggering a different ending, but locking out half the game is overly cruel. If I actually liked the game, I would likely just play through it again \"correctly\" to unlock the second half, but the game sucks so I'm not doing that.\n- the game's artstyle is garbage and looks like it was made in ms paint. It gets painful to look at after awhile.\n- the game is chalk full of what appears to be shoved in OCs. Adding people's OCs is always a bad idea for a game, as the developer has to insert encounters in other than for good gameplay purposes. They ruin immersion, make the setting feel inconsistent, and are typically eye sores.\n\nPass on this game, watch a youtube playthrough, or visit e621 .", "timestamp_created": 1673209724,

if you are off by one pixel you die and no their is no load screens but the painfully unskippable cutscenes that play followed by unskippable dialog pop ups every time grates my nerves \nOH but their is an Easy mode that reduces the difficulty \nEasy difficulty also cuts out a portion of the game and locks it behind beating it on Normal if it wasnt full of stupid waste your time in frustration chases all the fucking time this wouldnt be such a Steaming Pile of DOGSHIT \n\nArt work is nice \nOST is nice \nStory is interesting \nAll completely ruined due to the garbage ass chases that is this game \n\n100% do not recommend this trash fire if the gameplay is that frustrating to deal with", "timestamp_created": 1673142712, "timestamp_updated": 1673142712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0,
