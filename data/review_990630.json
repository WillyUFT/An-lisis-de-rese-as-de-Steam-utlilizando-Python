But, since the characters are Embers and not humans and gender has absolutely nothing to do with the game, they were kind of stuck with that.  I guess they could have gone with some made up pronoun, but six of one, half a dozen of the other.  Second, even though the theme and the overall story is very nice, it has problems at the detail level.  But, it's good enough.  And finally, there are a few things that are left hanging in the game (the Cook, Orchard and giant pig come to mind).  But, again, trivial and not all that important.  Anyway, I paid just a bit over $3 for it and it took me a skosh over 10 hours to complete.  And, it's well done and enjoyable.  So, I'm completely satisfied.

If you're looking for a whimsical and emotive experience, definitely worth buying. I would recommend it regardless, but if you're looking for something more substantive, I'd recommend waiting for a sale. If you're looking to scratch an indie-game itch, this is definitely worth it.\n\nThe game is beautiful--the environments are vibrant, the soundtrack is gorgeous, and the character designs are cute and memorable. I couldn't praise the team more, they really hit it out of the park. I'm not that emotional of a person, but even I found myself moved by the end of the story and I really do think a large part of that comes from how phenomenal the presentation is.\n\nOn the other hand, the content of the game is a bit lacking. It is a puzzle game, and most of the puzzles are isolated logic/brainteaser puzzles, like block-pushing or rotation puzzles, that spring up as you try to help various strangers. There are more dynamic puzzles in the overworld, but those also tend to be fairly isolated to a single area. However, the puzzles are really hit-or-miss. I more or less breezed through most of the puzzles and the few that I couldn't figure out right away only took a few minutes of trial-and-error to get the solution right. Some of the puzzles I could hardly call puzzles, and the 1st area (which you play in the demo) does a really bad job of showing the player what puzzles they could expect. For example, there's a puzzle where you need to place a prop on a pedestal to move to the next section, send the prop down to the next level via elevator, and do that two more times. There's no thinking involved, as there's only one move you can make every time. Even if you want to say that it's for the sake of getting the player familiar with the mechanics, it's disappointing that they would have to hold your hand that tightly. That said, the puzzles do have their own narratives that progress as you complete the puzzle, so they may be thought more like cinematic setpieces, but even so, I'm sure there could have been more engaging puzzles.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, I completed every puzzle available in the game. There are also some extra collectible notes you can find along the way and I think I got most, if not all of them on my first playthrough. At the end, my playtime was a bit shy of 5 hours after starting with the demo. And while the game was a pleasant experience, the underwhelming puzzle design holds me back from wanting to jump back in.

Entonces, cual es mi recomendaci\u00f3n? si te interes\u00f3 algo de lo que dije en esta rese\u00f1a, te invito a probar primero la demo del juego, es bastante extensa por si eres indeciso como yo, y es bueno, no una joya que tenga una fanbase establecida, pero si un buen t\u00edtulo para pasar tardes en las que no tengas la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima idea de que hacer, y solo quieras relajarte un poco y matar tiempo.", "timestamp_created": 1698279563, "timestamp_updated": 1698279563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148870662": {"recommendationid": "148870662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004347626", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1698263419}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very cute, and has some nice puzzles, but also way too many which arent even real puzzles but just very slow \"grab this and put it here\" challenges. \nThe biggest flaw is that the game tells the details of its story in fragments, yet you need background knowledge to understand these fragments.

The story centers around a race of fantastical creatures known as the embers and the daunting journey they embark upon in their dying days. On the path to their mythical destination, however, the the sorrows and stresses of life sometimes causes some of the embers to turn to stone, thus becoming \"forlorn\". Your character is a brave ember intent on reaching out to the forlorn and guiding them back on the path of their mysterious pilgrimage. The gameplay of The Last Campfire is centered around a series of diverse and unique puzzles which your character must solve in order to find these forlorn and break them out of the stone state. The art and sound-track work with the other elements to create an environment that is cozy and wondrous but with a bleak and ominous undercurrent.  The Last Campfire explores serious ideas of inadequacy, hopelesness, and grief with a beauty and gentleness that adds complex maturity to an otherwise cute and simple game. One of the best bits about this game probably has to be the narrator, whose dramatically powerful but soothingly gentle voice saturated in a Nordic accent always captivates attention and enhances the gameplay throughout.

The puzzles are easy, the game doesn't actually have any real dangers and the story is a simple one to follow.\n\nAfter finishing the game I think the narrator did a great job, because, for me, she captured strangeness and fear in her performance. The game was not meant to be fully cute considering the theme. And the third person narration, which I have seen others ridicule, makes sense [spoiler] because the dead can no longer speak and we have to carry on their stories [/spoiler].\n\nThere is not much walking, considering the metroidvania approach of powers and items unlocking alternate paths, unless you specifically go back to the completed areas.\n[spoiler] While I would have just locked them to not confuse people, there is a reason for them to be empty and feel like a waste of time.[/spoiler]\n\nThe sadness makes sense if you understand it. People probably have false expectations judging by the colors and simple game-play. I was definitely not looking into playing another child-trapped-in-a-scary-world-indie-game or a puzzle game which eats my life away. The developers somehow made the cliche work and the puzzles to be adequately rewarding for their time. They stopped just before making them grinding.\n\nRegarding the game requiring dexterity, I played with a controller and besides finding it difficult to leave with the boat, I had no challenges. What I think another reviewer is referring to is a bug regarding pigs which also confused me at first. Some pigs clip or jump around, which might make it seem like speed is needed.

The puzzles, while relatively straightforward, contribute to the smooth pacing of the game. Surprisingly, the world-building and narrative are fleshed out, despite the game's short length. The beautiful artwork, featuring vibrant colors and clean lines, evokes memories of my favorite game, Journey. Moreover, the narrator's presence adds a nostalgic touch, making me feel like a child being read to.\n\nWhile the puzzles provided a good challenge, I only needed to seek help once. I highly recommend this game, especially considering the additional enjoyable puzzles. It's a fantastic game that skillfully explores themes of hope, grief, death, and moving on, all wrapped up in a cute puzzle game with delightful music. The puzzles strike the perfect balance between being challenging and achievable, stealing a piece of my heart along the way.\n\nBeyond its stunning visuals and smooth gameplay, the game boasts an intuitive interface. The emotional depth of the dialogue and story caught me off guard, as it warmed my heart and showcased incredible empathy and depth. The captivating aesthetic offers a relaxing experience, accompanied by a mysterious story and a wonderful message. Although the puzzles are generally straightforward, the sense of accomplishment upon completing them remains satisfying.\n\nThis polished game gem shines with remarkable storytelling, featuring a simple yet meaningful narrative filled with metaphors. Despite the initially pushy narration, it contributes to the fairytale-like experience. The excellent gameplay introduces fresh mechanics, and the puzzles strike a perfect balance of challenges. Overall, I highly recommend this game, especially considering its price. It's truly a worthwhile investment.\n\nAnd if you need a helpful walkthrough guide, I've created one specifically for this game.

This is essentially an exploration game with puzzle elements. Ember, who I guess is a gender neutral symbol of a flame, is trying to get out of wherever he or she is. Basically you move from area to area unlocking puzzles by talking to certain characters. You have to solve a certain number of these puzzles to light the campfire and move onto the next area. It's a short game, taking only about five hours to complete, but the content overall works. \n\nI just have two things I really don't like about this game:\n- The lack of any platforming or combat aspect\n- The narrator\n\nThe narrator is a little girl with a European accent and she talks constantly. After a while it's a little less jarring, but for the first hour or so it's really irritating that she has to narrate every single thing that's happening on the screen, being the only voice in the game. It's not really a big deal, nor does it ruin the game, but it feels out of place hearing this disembodied voice talk constantly. With that said, the environments are nice and simplistic. Most of the puzzles just involve pushing blocks, some are so easy that they take no effort to solve. There's only two that I really had to pause to think about to solve, and even then it only took about five minutes. You don't even need to complete all the puzzles to finish the game since you only need to do about 2/3 in each area to progress, though you won't unlock the respective achievement.\n\nWith that said, each puzzle does have this \"aha!\" moment where you figure out what you're supposed to do, and I can credit the game for never being frustrating, as puzzle games often are frustrating. It might be a tad bit too easy considering that some of the puzzles just solve themselves if you manipulate the blocks for a few minutes. The final puzzle isn't even a puzzle, I'm not sure why they even included it. I understand that it's essentially a kid's game but throwing in a couple uber hard ones probably would've made the game more memorable. And the fact that you can't jump can sometimes make the game feel weird, since often your solution is to climb to the highest point in the area by manipulating the blocks around you.\n\nIt's a simple game with great music, a nice concept and solid presentation.

Which ended up being vital to solving the thing. BUT that could have been my own duh dumb moment too. \n\nAll said and done - great game to sink 5-6 hours into if you're taking your time, exploring, finding all the lost diaries, etc. You might be able to do it in half the time if you're blowing through and not completing each area.

It's supposed to be kinda like a storybook, but the writing could be a bit \"tell, don't show\", even when the player could see what was going on. Still, the narration was pretty charming, and I do think it added a lot to the characters (I especially liked the Builder).\nThe visuals were really nice, and the environments were super pretty! The bloom could be a bit much, and it felt like I couldn't really see some details with how bright it was. I think the caves, both at the beginning and the end, were my favorite locations.

The visuals are cute and vibrant. Puzzles are not bad, a little too easy perhaps, but that could also be a plus depending on who you're asking. Narrations are kind of annoying. The characterization and the story are the two biggest reasons why I do not recommend this game. Characters aren't fleshed out at all since the game simply jumps from one character to another non-stop and their dialogues do not change whatsoever.

You know the kind; it doesn't take too long, can finish it in maybe two or three sessions, is fairly relaxed and doesn't test you too much. That's not to say there's nothing to the game, but it clearly doesn't aspire to be more than a pleasant and charming experience with a thoughtful message underneath it all. As a puzzle game, there were only a couple of instances where I was left thinking for the solution for longer than it took for me to actually do all the inputs to make it happen. Part of that is that the game makes it incredibly clear what it wants you to do and that when you are solving something it's pretty bitesize.\n\nThe trade-off is that the puzzles end up not being overly challenging, but I'd rather that than anything feeling unfair or completely esoteric. There are a few dozen collectables to find which break up the pacing as they're typically found through exploration, although some do come with their own puzzles that can be quite fun to solve. The narrative driving you on is again pretty simple and is delivered, along with all of the text, in voice over. I went between finding the tone of this spot-on and annoying, though with specific regards to the latter, I do think children would actually engage with this part of the game quite well. In fact between that and the relative simplicity of the puzzles, this would probably be a great puzzle game for younger kids. \n\nAt the end of the day it's a charming and satisfying game that doesn't outstay its welcome.

El uso de la paleta de colores es tan bello, que va en sinton\u00eda total con cada modelado, destacando ese estilo tierno, regordete y hermoso que engancha visualmente durante la aventura.\n- Duraci\u00f3n de 5-7 horas aprox. Lo cual es correcto, punto.\n- La banda sonora por su parte si puede ser mejorable, por que, sin estar mal para nada (ya que ambienta y sabe sonar en los momentos adecuados...) no es recordable como tal. Por su parte el uso de un motivo, una melod\u00eda que destaque como tema central hubiera potenciado mucho m\u00e1s la experiencia. De hecho, es m\u00e1s bien curioso notar el mismo acorde de pocas notas (puede que a modo de gui\u00f1o) resonando durante algunos momentos puntuales, perteneciente a la otra obra del estudio de HELLO GAMES, \"No Man's Sky\".\n\n\u00bfPero de que va el juego en s\u00ed?\nThe Last Campfire es un juego de puzzles como mec\u00e1nica principal, pero que, con un m\u00ednimo de atenci\u00f3n, son todos solucionables, de hecho, entre 2 a 3 puzzles ser\u00edan los m\u00e1s \"desafiantes\". Por ende, se nota la intenci\u00f3n de tratar a los acertijos como un medio de juego entre cada avance de zona, m\u00e1s no como una barrera que se opone al jugador. \nY la raz\u00f3n de esto es: Su historia. \n\nLa historia contada con algunas escenas y sin di\u00e1logos por parte de los personajes sabe comunicar visualmente de forma correcta la situaci\u00f3n, la soledad, el miedo, la p\u00e9rdida o la desolaci\u00f3n. Los textos en pantalla por su parte son simples, oraciones con enunciados cortos, los cuales pueden ser entendidos con total tranquilidad. Pero justamente ah\u00ed radica uno de los puntos m\u00e1s fuertes. Al leer entre l\u00edneas. Las oraciones pueden ser interpretadas sin mucho esfuerzo o disecci\u00f3n literaria, sin embargo, la carga emotiva en la gran macro-forma de las cosas, denota la intencionalidad por parte de los desarrolladores para intentar transmitir emociones complejas.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLo \u00fanico chocante (bajo mi punto de vista personal) es la voz narradora. Que, estando presente de inicio a fin, siempre lee todo en pantalla, siendo por momentos levemente molesta. Pero no porque lo haga mal, de hecho, en algunos momentos es un disfrute escuchar las acentuaciones sil\u00e1bicas a modo de jugueteo verbal/sonoro de varias palabras. Pero muchas veces mantiene una neutralidad mon\u00f3tona que aporta poco cuando se lee m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido los textos con la vista, mientras la voz a\u00fan habla.\nOtro punto regular, es que es una voz \u00fanica (una sola persona) narrando siempre, con lo cual podr\u00edan haber optado por m\u00ednimo conseguir unas cuantas personas m\u00e1s para los distintos personajes, o bien incluso, dejar la parte de locuci\u00f3n de la narradora como una voz en off general y para cada uno de los personajes el recurso de \"onomatopeyas/ruiditos\" cuando dicen algo, evitando la intervenci\u00f3n de la narradora en todo momento.\nComo dije, este es un punto de vista personal en cuanto a lo mejorable, porque tambi\u00e9n hay una opci\u00f3n en el juego para bajar el volumen de la narradora, sin embargo, ah\u00ed se notan ciertos huecos de silencio en el juego. Y de lo que he visto, hay personas a las que les encanta y fascin\u00f3 la narradora por su forma de hablar tan apacible y dem\u00e1s. Por ello en este apartado reitero, no es que este mal, pero, dentro de la perspectiva personal, trastabilla.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVolviendo a la historia y para finalizar, la intenci\u00f3n de los autores en como manejaron el relato a la par de las mec\u00e1nicas como para plantear la experiencia jugable a trav\u00e9s de puzzles, es lo que se queda con el jugador. Los escenarios, los fragmentos de historia y dem\u00e1s plantean una micro-narrativa que motiva al jugador a sacar sus propias conclusiones. Porque dentro de lo que acontece en la aventura, si bien hay un eje central, la interpretaci\u00f3n final de todo lo sucedido es libre. Lo cual refuerza a\u00fan m\u00e1s la esencia de lo bello del juego.\n\nRecomendado sin dudas.\n\u00a1Adelante, probadlo!\n", "timestamp_created": 1680833595, "timestamp_updated": 1680833595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325074672698975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136186550": {"recommendationid": "136186550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121176015", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 732, "last_played": 1680750906}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es un juego tranquilo de puzzles, destaca su animaci\u00f3n y su historia muy buena, vale la pena y cada centavo", "timestamp_created": 1680751148, "timestamp_updated": 1680751148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136170063": {"recommendationid": "136170063", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983515065", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 312, "last_played": 1680729923}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfectly pleasant puzzler providing poignant pondering.", "timestamp_created": 1680725365, "timestamp_updated": 1680725365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647410154342651367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136040601": {"recommendationid": "136040601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198967341126", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 403, "last_played": 1678985795}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute joy, the story is beautiful, and I think I'm in love with the narrator's voice.", "timestamp_created": 1680549263, "timestamp_updated": 1680549263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "136010349": {"recommendationid": "136010349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137422675", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 414, "last_played": 1680505693}, "language": "english", "review": "I love these little ember goobers.

The environments coupled with the music and narration create an engaging experience. A lot of the time I just played silently because I was captivated. The music is beautiful and is quite melancholic. There is one narrator who does all of the dialogue which makes it feel almost like a fable.\n\nThe puzzles were well-integrated and fun. Some were challenging but never frustrating. You can also see if you're on the right path because snippets of narration will start playing! \n\nThe characters are super charming and I'm in love with little Ember. The animation where Ember approaches a forlorn melts my heart. The character interactions show the importance of compassion.\n\nI think the story could be a [i]bit[/i] tighter. I'm not asking for it to be straightforward, as the slight ambiguity is good. But something that is open to interpretation can still be well-constructed.\nI think there could be additional parts to bring it more together - in particular, the characters and their personal stories, such as The Wanderer. Maybe some more cutscenes? There are scattered notes in hidden chests but these are optional for the player.\n\nHaving said all that, I don't have a problem with the story overall.

I ate it in a single sitting, the second such occurrence in the last couple of weeks\u2026 maybe I need to play more puzzle games. \nAnyhow, the last campfire has you guide your little character, Ember, through a series of environments, with several veins of puzzle to solve along the way. The main story seems to be about finding ones way home, by locating and restoking \u2018campfires\u2019, (read \u2018bloody massive bonfires\u2019) but reveals itself to be something a little more than that in theme. You progress by helping other characters through simple and gentle puzzles that generally match the sort of thing you were doing in the environment.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] The ambiance is wonderful. The music, art style, movements, and characters are just\u2026 delightful. It\u2019s all very gentle. \n[*] The puzzles are simple and immensely solvable. Some are overly simple and just in the way, while others require a smudging of thought. Not a single one was frustrating or difficult, however, and it really helps the pace. \n[*] It touches on quite dark themes very gently. The whole hope thing really hit home for me, and I felt it dealt with the undertones quite well. That said, it [i]does[/i] beat you over the head with them, so there is that. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*] Controlling blocks with the instrument was just terrible when using the mouse. It was the only truly frustrating part of this game. \n[*] The movement is delightfully rapid, allowing you to really cover ground, but the pathfinding was off, and the character has a habit of getting stuck on terrain and/or bugging through things while running around. So the collisions and general movements were not great in a game where you spend most of your time moving. \n[*] The narrator gets a bit old by the end of the game. She has a lovely voice, but in one sitting of 6 hours, I got a bit tired\u2026 Maybe if I\u2019d broken the game up a little it would have been less grating by the end. \n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]\n [list][*] Fix collisions. \n[*] Fix mouse control of the instrument puzzles. \n[/list]\n\n\n[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]\n\n\nYeah, this is a sweet little game. \nAt the time of writing it is on sale on steam, and also part of a humble bundle, so it\u2019s well priced and extremely good value for money respectively. \nThis game is not for people who want dakka-dakka, whizz-bang, fast-paced action, or people who are out for a solid challenge. \nThis game is simple enough and gentle enough that it would probably be good to play with kids, and is great for filthy casuals. \n\nFinally, my favourite factoid about this game; at time of writing 34.7% of people have finished the final puzzle, but only 34.6% of people have finished the game\u2026 this means that 1 in 1000 people spent the 6ish hours needed to beat the game, but then couldn\u2019t be bothered to watch the final five minute cutscene\u2026 This is absolutely wild to me.", "timestamp_created": 1678057050, "timestamp_updated": 1678057088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "134153271": {"recommendationid": "134153271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173121358", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1678055472}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely moved up to be one of my favorites.

Not once was I upset with how a puzzle was solved.  An absolute rarity in these types of games.  \n\nPrior to completing this game, I would always recommend A SHORT HIKE to friends looking for a nice, relaxing game to play in under 10 hours, and I still definitely recommend that, but THE LAST CAMPFIRE has now jumped to the top of that list.  \n\nIf possible, I do recommend playing this with a joystick.  There are some very minor issues playing with the keyboard that affect the character's movement and ability to manipulate objects.  Basically, a lot of problems trying to do anything on the diagonal.  It's not game-breaking or even puzzle-breaking in any way, but if I had a joystick I would have switched right at the beginning to  save some minor frustration.  Even with those quite tiny issues, it doesn't affect my love of this game at all.\n\nI rate this a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it.

Nothing game breaking.\n\nOne slight annoyance is the boat undocking procedure, the button to row is the same button to climb back up the ladder, which sometimes makes it difficult to sail away.\n\nAll in all, great little game, plus there is a demo you can try before you buy!", "timestamp_created": 1677520186, "timestamp_updated": 1677520186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133727454": {"recommendationid": "133727454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070585375", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1677487771}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a very wholesome game.

It's a rather straightforward tale, with only a few moving parts. However, it's delivered with a rare sincerity and earnestness that was not only compelling but emotionally impactful. I could tell where about it was all going fairly early on (playing enough games or reading enough stories will do that), but in spite of that fact it still managed to illicit tears from me (the 2nd game to do so for me personally) by the end.

Such a good game, I give it an 8/10! Here's why:\n\nArt: 10/10\nThe art was so cute in this game! Ember, the adventurers and the forlorn but ESPECIALLY the pigs. They were so adorable and chunky! \n\nGraphics: 10/10\nThe graphics were so aesthetically pleasing, it felt cozy and I was very immersed in the game.\n\nMusic: 8/10\nIt definitely has a great soundtrack, it was pleasing to listen to while playing.\n\nSound Effects: 10/10\nWhoever worked on the sound effects, let me tell you... you are amazing! My ears were super pleased with every sound effect. I especially loved the crispness of the campfire and the sound of chains.\n\nGame Mechanics: 6/10\nIt was a bit wonky and I didn't really care much with the controls on the keyboard it didn't feel natural. It took a bit of time to get used to but still playable.\n\nBugs: 3/10\nThis game was really buggy. I constantly got stuck in walls or stairs. Two time I even got stuck under stairs and had to re-start the game because there was no way to get un-stuck. The biggest one though was that during my second to last play-through of it between each transition the game would break the screen. The screen would be split in half and mirrored upside down! I've never seen that happen in a game before! It definitely added an element of surprise but unfortunately it was unplayable and had to re-start the game a few times until it \"calmed down\".\n\nStory: 8/10\nCute story about life and the struggles that come with it. \n\nPuzzles: 8/10\nPretty good puzzles, a lot of them were too easy. I got stumped in a few of them. I had to take a break and come back to 3 of them and I only had to look up the answer to 1 of them. I wish there was more balance in the complexity of the puzzles but otherwise enjoyable!\n\nPrice: (My range: Awful-Bad-FAIR-Good-Great)\nThe price is 14.99 which I find it to be fair for this game. \n\nOverall: It's a rounded up 8!

A partir de ah\u00ed, y lleno de miedo, iniciar\u00e1 un periplo que le deparar\u00e1 muchas sorpresas, y no solo al personaje sino tambi\u00e9n a nosotros mismos.\n\n[h1]La alegor\u00eda como recurso permanente[/h1]\nNo pasar\u00e1 mucho tiempo hasta que nos demos cuenta que The Last Campfire no es m\u00e1s que una extraordinaria alegor\u00eda de la vida misma por la que todos transitamos. Nuestro personaje, Ember, se ir\u00e1 topando con otros como \u00e9l, pero algunos estar\u00e1n convertidos en piedra porque han perdido las ganas de vivir, la esperanza y ese impulso vital que nos mueve a todos.\n\nNuestra labor ser\u00e1 entrar dentro de ellos, puzle mediante, y encontrar esa ascua de esperanza que a\u00fan arde en su interior para devolverle las ganas de vivir y animarles a continuar su camino. No por nada, el juego llama a estos personajes \u201calmas en pena\u201d.\n\nB\u00e1sicamente, este es el objetivo del juego, todo ello mientras vamos avanzando por los escenarios buscando un modo de hallar el r\u00edo para volverlo a retomar. \u00bfPero no es el camino realmente lo importante en el viaje? Sin duda, The Last Campfire tiene unas intenciones narrativas mucho m\u00e1s profundas de lo que a priori se podr\u00eda esbozar en un primer vistazo, y lo hace todo de manera notable.\n\nDurante la aventura nos encontraremos con personajes fascinantes y muy peculiares, y algunos de ellos nos pedir\u00e1n ciertas cosas para poder seguir avanzando, con puzles o buscando objetos. Esto es todo un acierto, porque se nos muestra que nuestro personaje es realmente un reci\u00e9n llegado, y que all\u00ed ya pasaban muchas cosas antes de que \u00e9l llegara. Todo ello ayuda a crear una narrativa muy entretenida y realmente profunda si sabes de qu\u00e9 se est\u00e1 hablando en cada momento.\n\n[h1]Puzles por doquier, y todos muy entretenidos[/h1]\nAparte de la exploraci\u00f3n y el descubrimiento de hojas de diarios que nos cuentan una historia que nos meten en situaci\u00f3n, el juego tira del recurso del puzle casi permanentemente. Pero no desesperes, no son del tipo de puzles que acabas cansado o aburrido, ya sea por su simpleza o por su alta dificultad. Ni mucho menos.\n\nMover bloques, girar manivelas, encender fuegos, iluminar estancias y otra serie de puzles ingeniosos son los que poblaran el lugar. Es un tanto complicado plasmar lo entretenido que son los puzles sin contar c\u00f3mo son, pero es mejor que los descubras personalmente para que te sorprendas y te diviertas a partes iguales. Salve decir que nunca te aburrir\u00e1s de ellos y que solo estar\u00e1s deseando encontrar m\u00e1s durante el viaje.\n\n[h1]No solo es profundo y entretenido, tambi\u00e9n es muy bonito[/h1]\nAparte de lo anteriormente comentado, The Last Campfire ofrece unos gr\u00e1ficos bastante bonitos con unas animaciones muy bien hechas y graciosas. Ver al personaje principal moverse es todo un espect\u00e1culo, porque es gracioso y enternecedor en todo momento. Adem\u00e1s, todo es muy colorido, y siempre ofrece escenarios novedosos durante toda la aventura.\n\nA esto hay que sumarle la voz de la narradora, la cual nos ir\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ando y cont\u00e1ndonoslo todo durante el periplo con una voz muy dulce que enriquece bastante la experiencia global.\n\n[h1]Conclusiones[/h1]\nPor todo lo comentado, y por m\u00e1s cosas que mejor que las descubras t\u00fa mismo, The Last Campfire se descubre como una experiencia tremendamente enriquecedora, ya que aporta un mensaje profundo y una jugabilidad realmente entretenida.

Your goal is to help guide some requisite number of lost souls move on before you're able to progress\n- Each so-called \"forlorn\" you encounter transports you to a puzzle you must solve to save them.

It runs well. The puzzles are fairly varied. But it's also rarely challenging and very slow.\n\nWhile it lets you backtrack to see if you missed anything or if anyone reacted to changes, it never rewards doing so. Dialog doesn't change even when the character was talking about a level-changing problem which you have since solved; their lines don't change and they act like nothing happened, which makes the game world feel very static.

But I also found myself losing interest in the story and audio/text logs that you find. I just wanted to do the puzzles, not listen to more. While the story is wholesome and sincere and about a deep concept, it also doesn't actually have that much depth, and TBH I kept zoning out.\n\nI don't regret playing through itm but IDK if it was the best way to spend that time either.\n\nIt might be good for young children, who might find the puzzles more challenging.

Performance obviously is great and it has ultrawide support.\n\nSound design also is good and adds to the overall atmosphere.\n\nGet this on sale, it's worth it.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Good puzzles\n[*]Good story\n[*]Good sound\n[*]Ultrawide support\n[*]Chill\n[/list]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*]I don't even know\n[/list]\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32930811-Kosmos%27s-Cosmic-reviews/?appid=704030][h1]Follow my curator page for more[/h1][/url]\n[url=https://www.twitch.tv/crazykosmikbunny] [b]My Twitch[/b] [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1669758592, "timestamp_updated": 1669758592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792870044708251953", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127581543": {"recommendationid": "127581543", "author": {"steamid": "76561199241653483", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 485, "last_played": 1669746589}, "language": "english", "review": "Very touching, kind and cute game.

The gameplay itself is really nice. Interesting puzzles, lots of variations on ideas and mechanics. These vary from pretty obvious to more challenging, and at least for me none were particularly frustrating. \n\nOne thing I was really impressed by is how the game has a story to tell, but it mostly doesn't slow you down to tell it. The narration will play even as you close a message. This lets you move towards your next task while taking in the story. It is easy for this sort of choice to go unseen because it is elegant and well executed.\n\nAnother impressive choice for me, was seeing additional story hidden around the world. You can get the core story without these. But for those who explore and want to find everything, this is what turns up. The richness of this story made seeking out all these little notes rewarding. Instead of grinding out secret little trinkets like most games, here you truly are rewarded for nosing around a little longer.\n\nBecause of how well executed the gameplay is, it seems simple and intuitive throughout. That is important because it stands aside and lets the story shine, and this story does. It is thoughtful and melancholy, bittersweet and engaging. Some stories rely very much on the plot, some hang thinly on [i] v i b e s[/i]. The Last Campfire deftly navigates tone and content, coming out stronger for it and very affecting as well.

Together with the sense for the style of a children's fairy tale, these parts add up to a recommendable result, filled with themes that are close to all of us and not really just set in a faraway world. Inspired by the Brothers Grimm, among others, real-life problems are addressed in a fantastic way. Adult themes, for example concerning fears and loss, are cleverly packaged in an easily digestible way without resorting to violence at any time.\n\nIt's a tiny world compared to NMS, but one that can be enjoyed by all.

I tried this game because people say its similar to Lost Words: Beyond the Page, and its true. The overall vibe and atmosphere of both games are alike, the difference is that LW: BtP's levels are more linear, 2D-ish, and with some platforming parts. TLC is 3D, has levels you can roam freely (usually around a hub area) and focuses more on puzzles, with no platforming as you cannot jump.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on exploration and puzzles. There are hub areas, named Campfires, where to progress you must save several forlorn souls. They're usually in side areas near the hub. You don't have to save them all to progress, but you better do. To reach a forlorn you sometimes need to explore or solve a puzzle, but the real puzzle begins when you enter their head. Each forlorn has a unique \"puzzle room\" for you to solve. The puzzles range from very easy to a bit confusing, but nothing too difficult. If you missed a forlorn, don't worry as you can backtrack to previous areas.\n\nThe puzzle is basically to create a path to their soul, either by activating levers, moving heavy objects with your Lanthorn, reflect lights, etc. A good feature the devs made is that the solved puzzles can be played straight from the menu, with some bonus ones. It's nice to be able to replay puzzles without going through the whole game again, but the only ones available are the forlorn puzzles, not the ones you encounter in the \"real\" world.\n\nLastly, the game has a pretty meaningful message, like how sometimes, if not most times, the journey and helping others along the way are more important than the goal itself. It's kinda deep and touching, but not really sad, rather heartwarming I think. If you love puzzle games, or ones with cute aesthetics, give The Last Campfire a try.

The journey isn't that simple, though. You need to solve puzzles on your way to reach them.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- 25 puzzles with varied mechanics\n- Collectibles have markers for easier tracking\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip animations\n- It's hard to distinguish between climbing stairs and paddling a boat since they use the same button\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like cute-looking visuals and simple puzzles, buy this game.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nMost areas look simple, but the presentation makes it seem that they don't. Decorations, crumbled walls, and fogs help to obscure the areas, hiding hidden paths to collectibles and making the area look more gorgeous and vast. It's still easy to traverse the area and find your way through, and the marking that shows when you are near interactable objects does a good job to distinguish it from the decorations.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story was told like in a children's book, albeit with more difficult words. It tries to tell the story in poems and short words, and sometimes it can be hard to understand what was being told because of it. The voice actor does a good job with it, though. The voice sounds soothing and mysterious at the same time, while still trying to be distinct whenever another person is talking.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n[b]The Last Campfire[/b] has two kinds of puzzles. One is where you need to explore your surroundings to unlock new areas and another where you have to go to a closed space and solve puzzles to save another Ember. The first one is easier since it serves as a warm-up before you get to the juicy part, and although some of the second kind of puzzles will require you to exercise your brain, they are still easy to solve.\n\nThe exploration puzzles require you to remember your surroundings. The most that they can do is to trick your eyes, as they have hidden areas and secrets that conceal collectibles. You need to remember where you need to use objects, the puzzle mechanics, as well as all abilities that you have to uncover everything. Although it might look simple, there were times when I didn't realize that I can do things and stumped for a while.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2875667034 \n\nPuzzles are unique. All puzzles might look similar at first glance, but they usually have a different focus. One might require you to push a box to a certain spot, another might want you to fiddle with switches. The variance help to make the puzzles not boring, and although some are reused, they are usually positioned far from each other. Some of them also can be brute-forced, and others might require you to think outside the box.\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nThe in-game clock says that I finished the game at 5:02:34. I did get everything, from saving all Embers and obtaining all of the collectibles. As I said before, the game is easy to beat. There might be puzzles that can leave you stumped, but it's mostly because you need to rethink your approach and try other things. Brute forcing might be helpful in some puzzles, but not without having an idea of what to do beforehand. As for collectibles, they are still easy to track as long as you know what to do. The game also has a counter for the collectible in each area for easier tracking.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2863769604 \n\n[b]Issues[/b]\nAlthough the game looks beautiful, it can be boring to see the same animations over and over again, especially when you are doing a puzzle that is required to save the Embers. The game will usually show the same animation after you finished the puzzle with a minor change based on the one that you saved. Despite that, it doesn't allow you to skip the animations.\n\nThere is also no restart button, so you need to revisit the area and have to see the opening animation again every time you reenter the puzzle room. Lastly, the game tends to fail to distinguish between paddling a boat and climbing a ladder. Both actions use the same button and you will encounter them in a lot of areas.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]The Last Campfire[/b] is a puzzle game for casual players. The short playtime and easy difficulty are perfect for its target audience, and the cute-looking creature help to increase its charm. The atmosphere that the game has also helped you to relax, and with how small each area is, it's easy to finish everything without missing out. It's a cute, charming little game that will leave your heart melting with its presentations.", "timestamp_created": 1666603028, "timestamp_updated": 1666605178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766100168228149414", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124307881": {"recommendationid": "124307881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180930455", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 510, "last_played": 1666582898}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly a beautiful game. \n\nI cried. \n\nBeautiful.

It's a game with a lot of heart, but some frustrations that really hurt the experience.\n\nLet's start with the good. The ambience, aesthetic, and narrator work perfectly to bring to life the game. The art team did an incredible job, with everything from the innocence to the voiceover's accent bringing a sense of wonder and innocence that makes the game one of the best artistic pieces out there. I cannot express just how great the soundtrack, the narrator, and the colour palette are.\n\nThere's a lot of variety in gameplay. From moving blocks in specific patterns, to traversing water with a boat, and directing animals to certain locations. Every area felt different and I felt the game got stronger as time went on and new mechanics were added.\n\nThe thing that's hurting this game is how it communicates to you. I struggled a lot at the start, always being unsure of what I could do, where I could go, and ultimately how I can progress. Once I figured out that the game is structured in such a way that you have to bring pieces between areas to solve puzzles or find items in different locations the experience got a whole lot better. Maybe this is on me, but I do feel like there is a pretty big hurdle in the early game after you find the Forest Campfire.\n\nI definitely recommend this game despite this, especially those who want something with a great hopeful vibe to it.\n\nPros:\n+ Atmosphere. The ambience is fantastic.\n+ Soundtrack. Gorgeous with a great variety.\n+ Narrator. Fantastic performance.\n+ Variety in Gameplay. For a short game, there was a lot of variety in the puzzles.\n\nCons:\n- Game Design. Confusing at points.\n- Game is too short.\n\nOverall, definitely worth playing if you want a short puzzle game with great atmosphere. 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1666492498, "timestamp_updated": 1666492498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124244974": {"recommendationid": "124244974", "author": {"steamid": "76561199181220457", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1666482964}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely adorable, and extremely heartwarming.

Those games always have some kind \"deeper meaning\". In order to make the player see the deeper meaning, no matter how dense they are, the game forces the player's hand a lot. You can't change the view because the nice looking level design has to be viewed perfectly the way the developers intended you to view it. You can't run or jump because you're supposed to take your time walking from A to B and jumping would take from the atmosphere the game forces on you. The graphics are okay. Nice to look at from a distance, but after 10 minutes you have seen the lot. You can't turn off the whispering woman's voice narrating every single piece of information and frankly it discomforted me a lot.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not ground-breaking. They're using existing puzzle mechanics and spice them up with an additional caveat here and there. Most of the time you already know what you have to do and it just takes \"ages\" to do it (this is not a real puzzle in the game, but \"Walking from A to B\" is simple, but if you gotta walk for 5 minutes it takes time. If you solve a puzzle with one look but have to move x pieces into the right position and you can't speed this up, then it's simple but still takes time). The other times you're not viewing the whole thing as one puzzle but just do \"the next step\" (because there is just one, obvious next step) and you also arrive at the solution.\n\nSo if you like artsy games that you don't have to think about too much, and you just want to chill for an hour and then go to bed, play this.

A laid-back experience perfect for cozy, upcoming fall and winter days.

Once you interact with them, you will transported to a puzzle stage in which you have to move or manipulate objects to reach the goal and save them. Each world you go to has a set amount of Forlorn you must free to continue on and reach the end.\n\nThe game has great graphics, nice use of colors, and great narration to keep you interested in the story. The whole thing has a storybook kinda vibe and I totally dig it. The best part is that it's not a terribly long game. You can extend it a bit by looking for collectibles from a being known as The Wanderer. They are not necessary to get %100, but still fun to find.\n\nI think my only gripe with this game is simple. With puzzle games like this, it's almost necessary to have some kind of hint system in place for your puzzles. This game does not have that. Most of the puzzles were simple to solve and may need a few more brain cells than normal to solve, but some of the later puzzles really had me stumped and I had to look up videos just to help guide me in the right direction.\n\nFinal verdict? This was a fantastic little game. I loved the vibe, the story, and the puzzles had a great \"Ah Ha!\" feel to them at times which always feels good. If you're looking for calm and chillaxful puzzle game to play, The Last Campfire might be what you're looking for.

Fears we have, worries we ponder about, regrets we bear... all the things we isolate to be a forlorn. There are no answers to those, but the story convinces that we move forward regardless.

The puzzles were great, and you'll be able to solve most of them if you just take a step back and look at all the clues they give you. There was only one puzzle that I had difficulty with, but when I finally figured it out, I felt stupid -- I think it was called \"<i>Congested - Rearranging the Many<i/>.\" The clue was in the VERY beginning of the puzzle and I missed it!

Still, definitely recommended.\n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group Ribbon Hunters for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/ [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1661767822, "timestamp_updated": 1661767822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600847244262695313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121411302": {"recommendationid": "121411302", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983406149", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 347, "last_played": 1661723113}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1661758191, "timestamp_updated": 1661758191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121406783": {"recommendationid": "121406783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069252628", "num_games_owned": 1129, "num_reviews": 159, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 352, "last_played": 1661747151}, "language": "english", "review": "Decent little game.

the actress sounds so charming, with a soft accent that i can't quite decipher - sounds either french or scandinavian-rooted to me, and i believe it enhanced the game experience for me because it did feel like i was experiencing another world that was translated to me in a way. throughout the game, there are hidden stone ''boxes'' that have pieces of lore descriptions inside, and when you open one, the actress will say ''[character name] found a scrap of journal'' and idk theres just something so charming and sweeet about the way she says ''scrap of journal'', im obsessed with it haha\nnothing bad to say about the game! i think the story is a bit convoluted and mysterious, its not really explained in the end, but i guess its all up to interpretation, especially considering that there are some obvious motifs relating to mental health topics, so i think its good that the story is up to interpretation because everyone experiences mental health in a different way.\nall in all, a wonderful game!

For those that don't know, there is a female narrator that narrates the entire game, what NPCs say, how you feel, what things are, etc. These bleeds into the philosophy of \"show, don't tell\" in games, and the narrator can step over this boundary sometimes, including telling you how the protagonist feels, which should largely be up to the player in my opinion. In the beginning, I was very disappointed about the narrator being there to begin with, and talking as much as she did, largely because I'm not used to have someone narrate the entire playthrough of any puzzle adventure game I've played.

I can't say I was disappointed to have checked it out, as it is only 4-6 hours long (6 hrs if you complete everything, which I did), but I also can't say I can wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nBy far and away the biggest issue is the game's difficulty, or lack thereof. I usually don't knock a game for being easy; not every game has to be hard and I've certainly enjoyed games with nice, relaxing playthroughs. But this one might be the easiest full game I've ever beaten, and uh, I've played a -lot- of games. Technically this is a \"puzzle game\" but it's hard to call what's in here puzzles; my jar was agape at how simple some of the solutions were. The first hour of this game is one of the worst first impressions I've had with a  game, as the tutorial section drags on way too long for being such a simple game, but truth is the bigger issue is you feel like you're always in a tutorial. It gets slightly, and I mean slightly, more complicated as you go, so you get a bit more engaged, but in the end I don't think a single puzzle took more than 2 minutes to solve, with most solved in 30 seconds or less. I found myself audibly whispering \"no way..\" under my breath in disbelief every time I ran into yet another puzzle that I couldn't believe actually made it into an otherwise very polished game. I'd say maybe this game is meant for kids, but I know the games I was beating as a kid, and this would have been way too easy for me even then. Don't come in expecting any feeling of accomplishment here; the puzzles are simpler than I am even making sound.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, reminding me a lot of Runic Games' 2017 release \"Hob,\" which it borrows much of its style and premise from. That isn't a bad thing, as by far the most enjoyable thing about the game is exploring its overworld and seeing all there is to see. The entire game is narrated storybook-style by a woman with a soft, bespoke accent, which I initially disliked but I grew to appreciate. It isn't \"Bastion\" levels of quality in narration, but she fits the game quite well. She isn't helped by the writing though, which keeps true to its wondrous, storybook theming throughout, but ends up being quite repetitive. This compounds with the already simple and chore-like nature of the puzzles to make this short playthrough a bit of a drag. I enjoyed exploring the varied environments, and there are actually a lot of unique elements in each area and across the puzzles, but in the end everything is so straightforward it doesn't feel inspired, but more of the same. You go through the game finding and saving lost souls, each of which the narrator gives you very similar sounding lines for. And then you do that 20+ times until the games over. Very often the puzzles are so easy I'm finishing the task before the narrator even finishes her lines.\n\nThe story is a central focus but there isn't exactly a plot here. It's more a vibe, and that's fine. A lot of time is spent on trying to fill out a story that can be summarized in a sentence of two, but in the end it does a fair job of giving us the setting, visuals, and environments, which again are all top notch. There are also these optional collectables which are journal entries that are once again rather repetitive; I found my brain turning off as the narrator read off yet another of the 40+ entries hidden throughout the game. I'm not sure they added a lot, as there's just not a whole lot to say, but man it sure tries. Lots of writing to say not very much.\n\nThe OST is unintrusive; nothing special but filled with ambiance. Rather forgettable honestly, as you can tell by how few listens it has on Youtube / other platforms outside the game itself. It's not a weakness but certainly not a strength of the game either.\n\nI should mention that there are a handful of bugs here and there (I had one that broke a puzzle on me). The initial cutscene actually broke for me and I had to restart (which certainly didn't help my first impression). Not the best look after Hello Games' notoriously bug-riddled previous game, No Man's Sky, but truthfully the couple bugs I encountered didn't sully the experience too much. There was a handful of frame drops (which shouldn't happen with my monster of a PC), which are apparently far worse on other platforms (Switch, notably). Again, not a big deal, but figured it was worth mentioning.\n\nOverall, The Last Campfire has a ton of charm, with a relaxing, laid-back vibe that is maybe is a bit -too- laid back, verging on boring. It's got an awesome world to explore, and fulfills its mission of being like a children's book in design and feel, but uh forgets to have a game somewhere in the middle. Like I said, there is a -lot- I like about this game, but ultimately it fails the core, most fundamental question that needs to be asked when evaluating a game: \"Is it fun?\" And uh, not really? It's about as fun as flipping through a children's book and looking at the pretty illustrations and art.

The worldbuilding is only present for what the game wants to show the player, the moral is clear, and it's about as clean a cut as you can get.\n\nOverall, the puzzles were very intuitive and used a set of clean, understandable mechanics that put the challenge in arranging simple parts together. The puzzles were fun, and I ended up doing a 100% completion on my first run simply because it felt like the right way to play.\n\nMy final verdict is that the game is very worth it. I don't know what average playtime is like, my run lasted just over 5 total hours in two sessions, but I am a very fast puzzle solver and pick up on stuff incredibly easily, so I can't be certain that it will be the same duration for other players. ymmv.", "timestamp_created": 1656701125, "timestamp_updated": 1656701125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117992533": {"recommendationid": "117992533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968646806", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 345, "last_played": 1656679861}, "language": "english", "review": "Only took about five and a half hours to complete so not very difficult or very long, but it was an absolutely exquisite experience!", "timestamp_created": 1656680020, "timestamp_updated": 1656680020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117961822": {"recommendationid": "117961822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066958246", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1656633053}, "language": "english", "review": "I am playing using Steam Proton and this game runs fine but it has absolutely no audio.", "timestamp_created": 1656633524, "timestamp_updated": 1656633524, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117947726": {"recommendationid": "117947726", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078403549", "num_games_owned": 757, "num_reviews": 553, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 267, "last_played": 1669192996}, "language": "english", "review": "The good:\n+ OKish story with slightly better finale\n+ Nice puzzle for casual player, although few level are either too easy or too hard if you too focused on specific sequence\n+ Nice visual, although character animation feel stiff on few occasion\n\nThe bad:\n- The exploration of themes is shallow and the game forcing certain emotions\n\nThe ugly:\n* Narrator voice is ok, but become stale after few hours\n* Missing some feature such as key rebind, instant restart on puzzle level and telling when last auto save happened when you quit the game\n* Exploration doesn't feel rewarding, you only get short piece of diary which isn't really interesting\n\nIt's not bad game, but i'd choose \"Not recommend\" since Steam doesn't offer \"Neutral\" option.

I actually walked away for a bit and forgot my computer was still on. I believe this game is worth the price, its a very well loved project that shows the effort that went into it. With my initial thoughts out of the way, here are the pro's and con's.\n\nPROS: \n- Amazingly soothing soundtrack\n- Beautiful and captivating aesthetics \n- Wonderful voice acting \n- Cohesive to follow \n- You feel connected to the main character\n- You can receive hints that don't just give it all away\n- The tasks don't seem redundant or medial \n\nCONS:\n- While this project was very well loved some of the graphics have issues with collision \n- You can't change control keys, and the run button is in an awkward place\n- If you \"fail\" certain puzzles you get restarted to the beginning of the puzzle including the title sequence. \n- The puzzles are almost too easy, taking a minute tops for most of them\n- While the voice acting is amazing from the one narrator, I do wish we had a variety of voices for all characters\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy calm simple games to pass the time this is for you. However if you want more of a challenge, this might not be the best game to buy.", "timestamp_created": 1655505194, "timestamp_updated": 1655505194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117130259": {"recommendationid": "117130259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198883178130", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 394, "last_played": 1655478845}, "language": "english", "review": "beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1655478851, "timestamp_updated": 1655478851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117103929": {"recommendationid": "117103929", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070014029", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 388, "last_played": 1638945758}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautifully crafted games I've ever played", "timestamp_created": 1655431720, "timestamp_updated": 1655431720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117100103": {"recommendationid": "117100103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120430550", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 363, "last_played": 1655082057}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was cute and relaxing!", "timestamp_created": 1655424850, "timestamp_updated": 1655424850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117082060": {"recommendationid": "117082060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051164438", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 294, "last_played": 1655404228}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great puzzle game.

I agree, because I've finished the game and I'm still searching for meaning. This game is clearly trying to convey a melancholic tone and tries to make you feel sad because \"the ember people around you are sad\" with no real explanation. The only deeper meaning to be found in this game is that which the player projects onto the game itself.

Players will need to save lost \"embers\" in each area, each requiring a puzzle to solve. They are basically vibrations of sokoban, throughout the game around 30 of them. One pipe puzzle and one stacking pillar puzzle are well made, took me some time, the rest are easy even for kids. For the first 2 areas player explore on land, mainly using telepathy to move platforms, lure pigs to eat ivy which blocking the way, use mirrors to reflect sun beams... In the 3rd also the last camp player can explore the area by water. The environment varies, though the world is made easily without much details, but it looks fine.\n\nFor me 4 hours of gameplay is about the right time. Puzzles feel repeated but not too bad, adding one more area would be painful, though. Devs are good to keep players interested.

That's why I give it a thumbs up. \n\nThe puzzles are quite easy to solve, a bit repetetive maybe, but always surrounded by beautiful scenery. \n\nWhat really spoiled it for me was the story's end.
