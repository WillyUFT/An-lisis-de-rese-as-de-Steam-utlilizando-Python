These pixel-based games have a charm that\u2019s difficult to get right but really shines when they\u2019re successful. Fez is such a game. As a puzzle platformer, the genre isn\u2019t original. However, pivoting in 2-D planes to create a 3-D game is an ingenious way to expand the gameplay. Of course, this also makes it a little difficult to keep track of where you are and where you\u2019re going. But with such relaxing visuals and sound design, spending extra time in this game isn\u2019t a bad thing.\n\nThere are limitations to the pixelated style that make navigating the half-dozen worlds difficult to memorize. Sure, there are gimmicks in each world that define how you move around it, but knowing where to go to solve a larger puzzle within the game can be challenging. That there are so many branching paths that need backtracking to explore every corner of the Fez universe is both a blessing and a curse. There\u2019s a lot to explore, but you\u2019ll also be going through the same hub locations a lot as well.\n\nWith minimal plot, I appreciated the somewhat meta ending that played on how games from decades ago would behave. These games definitely inspired Fez and its visual style hearkens back to the time when you had to use pixelated graphics because that was all the computers could render. After getting to the credits, I had little desire to reach a 100% play-through. There were enough missing items that I knew where they were located, but did not know how to unlock them or get to them. Still, I enjoyed myself playing the amount of the game that I wanted to.\n\nA retro-inspired puzzle platformer with a mind-bending gameplay mechanic, I give Fez 4.0 stars out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1697595419, "timestamp_updated": 1697595419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148354739": {"recommendationid": "148354739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235554804", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1697934146}, "language": "english", "review": "UwU", "timestamp_created": 1697488730, "timestamp_updated": 1697488730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472222238779067993", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "148313247": {"recommendationid": "148313247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025772667", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1697419640}, "language": "english", "review": "Gave this one another chance since first trying it back in 2014 and I'm glad I did.

Not every game needs fast travel, but maybe some players don't want to spend time running back and forth. Also the game requires a bit of deciphering that the player has to figure out on their own, if they want to complete everything. There are many secrets.

The game's standout feature is its unique 2D/3D mechanic, where you can rotate the 2D world to reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles. This simple yet ingenious gameplay mechanic turns every corner into an opportunity for discovery, and it's executed flawlessly. The transition from 2D to 3D and back is seamless, creating a sense of wonder and amazement that's hard to find in other titles.\n\nThe art style of Fez is a visual delight. It combines pixel art with a charming retro aesthetic, resulting in a world that's both nostalgic and fresh. The attention to detail is remarkable, with each area of the game feeling distinct and meticulously designed. The soundtrack, composed by Disasterpeace, is equally mesmerizing, enhancing the overall atmosphere and immersion.\n\nWhat sets Fez apart is its dedication to exploration and discovery. There's no hand-holding here, which allows players to truly engage their problem-solving skills. The puzzles are challenging yet fair, rewarding players with a genuine sense of accomplishment when they conquer them. This sense of wonderment and curiosity is what makes Fez such a joy to play.\n\nFez isn't just a game; it's an experience.

It's already hard enough to imagine that, from a design perspective, the people who designed this game's levels had to understand how two-dimensional planes relate to one another in an overall three-dimensional space, but all the puzzles are so abstract and creative, yet make so much sense in hindsight (except for those mysteries that are still unknown--yes, still unknown--to this game's community). I've never played a game that rewards the player more for their ability to think than this one. Not only that, but the animation is fluid and charming; the music is calming, vivid, and atmospheric; the controls are sensible and reactive; and the world is intriguing and complicated. There's an entire linguistic, numeric, and glyph system to understand, and the game makes great use of its own design paradigms to progressively add challenge as you explore its giant, interconnected map (as such, a quicker and more straightforward transportation system would've been nice, but it's not like the lack thereof hindered my experience). There's no social commentary, and there are no messages. You don't actually have to understand anything substantial to play or even finish this game, and you'll still have fun playing it regardless. And if you choose to solve the intricacies of FEZ, it's still just a great experience and a captivating ode to the power of indie development.\n", "timestamp_created": 1694406104, "timestamp_updated": 1694406104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.61538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146091812": {"recommendationid": "146091812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078554382", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 958, "last_played": 1694394715}, "language": "english", "review": "Hidden behind the many layers are some of the most clever puzzles I've ever seen in a game.", "timestamp_created": 1694394962, "timestamp_updated": 1694394962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "146075939": {"recommendationid": "146075939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066310618", "num_games_owned": 3017, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 431, "last_played": 1694083541}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game comprised exclusively of right angles, it is ironically one of the most obtuse games I've played. The puzzles in the main path seldom exceed a difficulty level higher than what a typical child could achieve, yet on the other hand, the majority of the optional secrets are obscure beyond belief and sometimes even encroach into ARG territory. So you either A: win the game, and be left without the feeling of accomplishment due to the lack of hardship endured, never quite shaking off the feeling you're still in the tutorial. Or B: attempt some of the needlessly obscure secret \"puzzles\" and be left with a tremendous headache after bashing your head against some of the most frustrating and asinine puzzles you'll likely ever encounter.\n\nHere are a few cherry picked examples of what you can expect from the plethora of secret puzzles: \n1): a QR code revealing the correct sequence of inputs. This isn't a puzzle; it's literally just getting your phone out and pressing the correct controls that it reveals. Though I suppose it's an admirable attempt at a meta puzzle, at least the first time around.\n2): a QR code revealing the correct sequence of inputs. Ok, this isn't cool or interesting anymore.\n3): a QR code. Ugh, did they really did just reuse the same dumb \"puzzle\" 3 times? But wait, there's more\u2026\n4): a QR code, but this time it's obstructed by some scaffolding from the level rendering it unscannable by conventional means. So I guess we're expected to reconstruct the QR code ourselves in some 3rd party program? Yeah, this is a bit too far for a video game for my taste. Perhaps this style of puzzle is right up your alley, but personally I can't imagine a less fun puzzle; I have no motivation to even attempt it. This is not what I was anticipating from a puzzle platformer game, especially considering the complete absence of any mention of this kinda stuff on the store page. \n\nThere are many other secret puzzles, however a lot of the time they are far too confusing to even attempt or begin. On 2 or 3 occasions it's just been a small empty room completely devoid of, well, anything. Nothing to solve or look at or any hint towards anything, at all. For those I bet the solution is something like pressing the controls in a certain order as indicated by a sequence of random symbols in a random room in a random house in a random level but only if turned sideways and parsed through a base64 encoder backwards with the decryption key being the first letter of each person's name in the game credits. And based on what I've read from discussions and guides, I haven't even mentioned the worst of it; apparently there is an entire made-up alphabet and numerical system that you are required to learn in order to solve certain riddles. Yeah nah, if I'm going to go through the effort of learning a language I'd rather learn a real one with practical use as opposed to what essentially amounts to a glorified cipher. So, just skip the tortuous secrets? Unfortunately as I mentioned, ignoring the side stuff leads to a hollow and vapid game experience. This game is bafflingly designed to be an enjoyable experience exclusively for those with an IQ below 80, or above 150, or if you just love following guides. \n\nEven if you possess the intellect required for the secret puzzles, you still need the patience to endure agonizingly slow level transitions and clunky character movement that will result in many falls to your death. This is another huge issue I have; the lack of airborne maneuverability. If you miscalculate a jump, you're essentially screwed as your ability to control yourself in midair is negligible. Amusingly there's no punishment for dying; you literally respawn exactly where you were before, so the rigid movement doesn't result in a more difficult experience, it just adds to the tedium. And those doors, I cringe at the mere thought. Here we have the epitome of frustrating design: a game chockablock full of doors and gateways - about 3 average per level - and the time it takes to transition through one is 10 seconds. That might not sound like much, but each level is small in scale and will rarely take longer than a few minutes, so entering all those doors accounts for a lot of unnecessarily wasted time. With level design being non-linear and splitting off in all directions like it's a family tree from Dark, this naturally precipitates backtracking which would be fine in and of itself, if not for that superfluous transition every time you enter a level. By the end of the game, I had had enough and was just glad to have gotten this game over with. This is obviously not a good feeling to have when finishing a game, especially such a short one, hence my negative review. \n\nAdmittedly, the core game mechanic is genius. This is a unique, innovative indie gem, and it might even be considered a masterpiece by some people. The visuals are bursting with life and energy, with even the smallest critters having delightful animations, despite the inherent low fidelity of pixelated graphics. Town areas in particular are incredible examples of pixel art scenery, with so much visual detail to soak in. My initial experience of the game was very positive, as the rotation mechanic was, and frankly still is, mind boggling. Unfortunately for me, several major flaws stuck out and soured my experience enough to dislike the game overall.

Not that I've played many, but I'm comfortable saying it might even be one of the best ever.\n\nFrom a game design point of view, this game is pretty appreciable in a lot of ways. You can play it straight and quick, gathering the 32 cubes needed to reach the neutral ending within a matter of hours, and that experience in itself is great: the artstyle is simultaneously cutesy and endearingly simple, but also detailed and engaging. The level design is pretty brilliant, with various puzzles for hidden loot you can go on sprinkled in-between the various puzzles and puzzle-ish mechanics for level completion and progression. The controls are pretty solid, though I'll admit to some annoyance in that protagonist Gomez can feel a *little* slidy, as if on ice, at times, and the key mechanic at the center of this game -- rotation -- is done superbly well. It's not perfect, and can be a little buggy or irritating at times, but it's mostly not a problem and is utilized to awesome effect in level designs and puzzles.\n\nTwo of my favorite things about this game would be the soundtrack and the intricate world-building. Disasterpeace's soundtrack for this game is fantastic, with truly gorgeous, truly eerie, and truly BANGING chiptune songs serving as a perfectly fitting backdrop for this game. This game, too, has so much world-building and lore that never once gets addressed or explained to you in the (relatively minimal) dialogues throughout, instead appearing on chalkboards, obelisks, signs, posters, and what have you: it's there either as eye candy for the passive player, or, for the more dedicated puzzle enjoyers, the key to solving the more thought-provoking, complicated puzzles that are hidden, scattered, throughout this game's world, as well as understanding the story of this world and its peoples. \n\nMy least favorite things are the backtracking and black holes. Backtracking becomes only truly necessary in two situations: first, if you don't play the game correctly and just skip over some cube bits or cubes, thinking \"It'll be fineee\" (it won't), and that's on you; second, if you want to do all the secrets and hidden puzzles. Some puzzles just cannot be done in the same moment you find them, and might require to go all over the world to read an alphabet explanation on some classroom in case you forgot it, or to go talk to some owls who are STUPIDLY far apart in terms of location, or you just have to travel a really long way from a warp gate to a puzzle room you missed earlier and it becomes tedious when you have to do that about ten times.\n\nHowever, it would be less tedious if it weren't for the FUCKING black holes which become more frequent as you progress through the game -- I get that they have purposes, to hinder the player and have them find creative workarounds, but they completely forgot that second purpose in execution, because most of them will just show up and stay there until you exit and re-enter the level. These being the closest things to \"antagonists\" in this game makes me feel pretty comfortable in saying that they are some of the absolute worst antagonists of the most irritating nature in any game I've ever played; the last thing a puzzle-oriented game, which requires much patience, needs, is something to directly flip you off and tell you to come back later, because it makes that crucial patience wear thin FAST.\n\nAnd, yeah, as for the puzzles? I first played through completed this game on Xbox almost a decade ago, after me and my oldest brother spent two years, on-and-off after schooldays, playing and decoding it together. Some things required a guide, but we got most of it -- make no mistake, this is a game that, if you want it to enjoy to the fullest, including the blissful satisfaction of solving some of its most mind-boggling puzzles, you're gonna need a notepad and pen and a fair bit of patience, as me and my brother did. But man oh man, solving those puzzles and coming to the point where, even at a young-ish age, I could read them like a second language felt awesome.\n\nThis game strikes a fine, fine balance between being a memorable treat of a playthrough for a casual gamer and a gourmet meal for a  \u0336t\u0336o\u0336t\u0336a\u0336l\u0336 \u0336n\u0336e\u0336r\u0336d\u0336  truly dedicated gamer.

I mean, I see no problem asking online or looking for an answer to a question or doubt when it comes to games, but do we really need to check online to solve every puzzle? is that how this game is supposed to be played? I'm puzzled.\n\nNot only the puzzles are a chore to solve, the navigation is a drag and not good in the long run, coming and going is just boring, confusing and simply badly designed considering that every new zone has sub zones those sub zones have more of them, I really wish I would have liked the game more than I did, it just isn't for me.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIt certainly had an impact and I can see that on the reviews praise the game and its concept, for me it just did not cut it, convoluted, boring, repetitive, cryptic and unclear. I wish I could give it a neutral review, but alas that is not possible.", "timestamp_created": 1691975313, "timestamp_updated": 1691976573, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144135393": {"recommendationid": "144135393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198996154458", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1692740308}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u29c9 \u273f\u2756\u2602", "timestamp_created": 1691972255, "timestamp_updated": 1691972255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144077642": {"recommendationid": "144077642", "author": {"steamid": "76561199478614700", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 630, "last_played": 1687688384}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2611 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2611 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10\n\n\nGrab this review template here! \ud83d\udc49 https://vojtastruhar.github.io/steam-review-template/\n", "timestamp_created": 1691920830, "timestamp_updated": 1691920830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144007444": {"recommendationid": "144007444", "author": {"steamid": "76561199146915973", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 476, "last_played": 1691853615}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming game with lovely music, good challenges, and above all, a lot of cubes.

The graphics and music are excellent, dialogue is minimal, allowing you to focus on the gameplay, and what story you will see is weird enough to be oddly compelling.\n\nIf your goal is to go above and beyond simply completing the main quest, the puzzles become far too cryptic for my liking. Many of these optional puzzles require decoding the strange symbols seen throughout the game. After looking at a guide to see how this was supposed to be done... yeah, I doubt many people will figure these ones out on their own. If you don't enjoy using guides, chances are you will not enjoy going after every last hidden item. Some of the puzzles felt similar to TUNIC, so fans of that game's puzzles will likely enjoy some of these.\n\nThe best part of a puzzle game is that moment where everything clicks and you finally find the solution, and Fez has plenty of moments just like this that you're sure to encounter on your journey. The worst feeling in a puzzle game is when you say 'screw it' and check a guide, which you will have to do in order to obtain 100% completion, at which point you're barely playing the game!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with the main quest in this game and would highly recommend giving it a go if you haven't yet.

But I found the over-world design very confusing to follow where I was, where this warp gate had taken me to, and how to get back to where I needed to be next. It has a very non-Euclidean kind of geometry where sometimes you step through a door and it teleports you to a different stage on the level, sometimes it is just a room you can explore, and sometimes it teleports you to another level entirely. And that kind of killed the vibe a bit for me. Instead of feeling like I was exploring I mostly felt like I was just lost.\n\nI collected 11 of the 32 cubes before I had my fill of the game.

Hints leading towards rewards are littered everywhere in FEZ, and while it does have 75+ collectibles, I feel the game's length made it so the process of collecting all of them doesn't overstay it's welcome. The puzzles were unique and went beyond what I could've thought of, such as decoding parts of the map, scanning QR codes, using context clues, and much more to reveal secrets. Though it's not without mention that some of the puzzles are downright unsolvable on your own; The game's show-not-tell philosophy was quite interesting, but I think they took it too far.

It's a game that showcases creative level design, intriguing puzzles, and a distinctive art style. However, it's impossible to talk about FEZ without acknowledging the eccentric and controversial nature of its developer, which has garnered mixed opinions within the gaming community.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, FEZ excels in providing a fresh take on the platforming genre. The central mechanic revolves around rotating the 2D world to reveal hidden paths and solve puzzles. This unique twist adds depth and complexity to the gameplay, challenging players to think in unconventional ways. Exploring the intricately designed levels and uncovering secrets is an absolute delight.\n\nVisually, FEZ stands out with its pixelated art style, reminiscent of classic 8-bit games. The vibrant colors and charming retro aesthetics create a nostalgic atmosphere that adds to the game's charm. The soundtrack also deserves praise, with its soothing melodies that perfectly complement the serene and mysterious ambiance of the game.\n\nHowever, it's important to address the controversy surrounding the developer, Phil Fish. While his creative vision brought us the unique experience of FEZ, his public persona has been divisive. Some may find his outspoken nature and controversial remarks off-putting, which has led to a divided perception of the game within the gaming community. It's worth noting that personal opinions about the developer should not overshadow the merits of the game itself.\n\nDespite the eccentricities of its creator, FEZ remains an engaging and enjoyable puzzle platformer. It challenges players with its clever puzzles, rewards exploration, and immerses them in a visually captivating world. If you're a fan of puzzle games and appreciate unique gameplay mechanics, FEZ is definitely worth a try.\n\nRating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nA Puzzle Platformer with an Unconventional Developer: FEZ offers a mind-bending experience with its innovative gameplay and charming pixel art style.

Gomez is a 2D creature living in a 2D world.\nWhen it discovers the 3rd dimension, you must maneuver this 3D diemnsion using 2D spaces to solve puzzles to try and save the universe.\n\n\n[u]Gameplay: 7/10[/u]\n\nGameplay is... alright. It depends on how you deep you want to take the game. There are three \"tiers\" of difficulty or puzzles.\nAn easy tier, a very difficult and obscure tier, and then an impossible tier.\nThe easy tier is... well... easy, and is more of a platformer where you collect things.\nThe difficult tier, is much more of a difficult code-cracking puzzle game. Where you will likely need to end up looking up a guide to solve some challenges.\nThe impossible tier... well, hasn't been beaten yet. If it [i]can[/i] be beaten.\n\nIn short, the best experience is likely trying to solve 80% of the puzzles in the difficult tier and all the \"puzzles\" in the easy tier without a guide.\nThis way you can experience the unique challenges the game presents, and enjoy the game's exploration without getting too bogged down by the obscure stuff.\n\n\n[u]Story, World and Characters: 5/10[/u]\n\nThe story is fairly basic and overall the world is very vague. There is no backstory to your character, and very little explanation to the ideas presented about the world's history.\nThis doesn't fit the game poorly in my opinion, as long as you don't go in expecting a great story.\n\n\n[u]Graphics, Audio and Technical Execution: 8/10[/u]\nThe graphics are the beautiful with the minimalistic pixel art aesthetic really matching the game and was pulled off very well.\nAs for the music and sound effects, they are done well. Also, the bugs I did encounter were not too game-breaking. Apart from a crash, which wasted about 60 seconds of my time.\n\n\n[u]Replayability, Value for Money and Extra Content: 5/10[/u]\n\nI did a lot of puzzles without a guide, and 100% the game. If you 100% the game, you will have incredible value for money.\nAs for replayability, I don't really see it. Once you know how a puzzle is solved, you probably won't forget and I don't see myself replaying this game any time soon.\nThere is basically no extra content, excluding the impossible puzzles which don't count.\n\n\n[u]Innovation, Impact and Technical Execution: 7/10[/u]\n\nI feel like, the game innovated a lot on its puzzle genre with loads of fresh and new puzzles and ideas.\nThe game runs well, but has very poor controls on PC. \n\n\n[u]Overall - [b]64/100[/b] - \"Reality is perception. Perception is subjective.\"[/u]\n\nThis a great little game, that you will likely enjoy despite the flaws it has. The way it deals with mystery and discovery is great.\nHowever, there is still the tedium of travelling from one spot to another spot and the obscurity of some puzzles.\nOverall, a great little adventure but one I wouldn't replay.", "timestamp_created": 1677265771, "timestamp_updated": 1677266062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133428942": {"recommendationid": "133428942", "author": {"steamid": "76561199259464229", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 800, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 800, "last_played": 1676052715}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game made me go slightly insane, especially since there are two controls for \"left\" and \"right\", one of which rotates the level, and one moves Gomez.

Put simply, it is a real joy to play, with excellent pixel-art and animations, a fantastic soundtrack and a great variety of different levels and puzzles.  Many of the environments are absolutely beautiful and truly evoke a perfect nostalgia of the 8- and 16-bit eras.  The rotatable, 3D level design is genius and the litany of collectables and tough puzzles will keep you searching for a great many hours, including an foreign alphabet and numeric system to decode.\n\nWhile there isn't much of a storyline, that did not bother me much; although it would have been a nice addition.

Players can use a set of keys to view the current screen from another quarter-turn to the left or the right. In addition to arrow keys for movement and spacebar for jump, there is also a set of keys to rotate the level left or right (AD) and another set keys to look around (IJKL). I got these mixed up sometimes (and sometimes used the wrong ones for IJKL due to touch-typing and moving back and forth from the arrow keys). I think my confusion only really happened when trying to use all three key sets at the same time. On the whole I think the original bindings were good.\n\nThe story is that you play as Gomez, a citizen of Village who must restore its balance by reassembling the hexahedron by collecting 32 cubes. The cubes may be broken down further into shards. [spoiler]Also, anti-cubes may count toward this tally.[/spoiler] There is falling damage, but the game quickly and seamlessly resets you to the last solid ground you had touched. The frequent auto-saves make it easier to chip away at this game little by little.\n\nThere are probably about 100 rooms all told, with occasional warp points and/or wormholes to shortcut navigating through them -- or in some cases, out of them, if it was difficult to reach a specific place in a room. The in-game map is very helpful for figuring out what's left to do and how to get there. Although it may be useful to know not to \"sweat it\" if you can't complete a room right away. [spoiler]Sometimes you need items from other rooms.[/spoiler] While movement through rooms is mostly linear, players have a lot of freedom to choose which room to go to; however, because puzzles generally felt like they had only one solution, I think I would count this game as mostly closed-world.\n\nI'm not very familiar with retro arcade games, but in terms of feel, FEZ does seem to be a nod to (and maybe inspired/influenced by) them. Level design, from the perspectives of art and puzzle-solving, is excellent! The music and sound effects are pleasant and complement the throwback feel of the game. No voice acting, all game dialogue is text-based. Gameplay is pretty solid. The few glitches I encountered were visual. [spoiler](And a few weren't even bugs -- I later realized the game was \"supposed to do that\"!)[/spoiler] I don't remember how I found this. Maybe through the Steam store. Then again, I may have seen friends playing it. \n\nI had played halfway through FEZ a few years ago. I feel like I understood the game (mechanics, especially) better this time around. Specifically, I found it helpful to [spoiler]think of each rotated level as its own (or new) room[/spoiler]. The rotations I felt sometimes had some counter-intuitive effects, but once I got a handle on them, puzzles were challenging and entertaining. So due to getting used to how the game world behaves, I would say there's a little bit of a learning curve with this game. I expected this game to take somewhere between 6 to 12 hours to play. A Time Played clock associated with my save slot in the game marked me as taking 6.5 hours. \n\nFEZ is a nice, quick mind-stretching puzzle game with unique game mechanics and a new take on a classic theme. I would pull this one out again to get the rest of the achievements (I'm at about 50% right now) and collectibles.\n", "timestamp_created": 1673809269, "timestamp_updated": 1673809269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130865094": {"recommendationid": "130865094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107347182", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 773, "last_played": 1673737178}, "language": "english", "review": "Really engrossing puzzle platformer.

imho. Key mechanic seems more fun than it actually is and I felt it did not allow for many creative puzzles (or at least, was not used in many). Main fun of this game was getting anticubes for me, there are some satisfying puzzles connected to them, though I was not a fan of repeating exactly the same puzzles multiple times. Getting all anticubes is very hard, but not ridiculous yet. What is beyond ridiculous is the very end game content, just go look that up on the Internet.\nExploration is fun, but navigating through that world is quite painful. \nAlso, there are some bugs, there were a few times when I needed to restart the game. Also, I got all anticubes, but I believe there are two of them that I have no memory of collecting (definitely I did not solve puzzles associated to them and I really doubt I got them by accident either).\nB tier game for me", "timestamp_created": 1673110232, "timestamp_updated": 1673110232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130283216": {"recommendationid": "130283216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881438183", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1660949664}, "language": "english", "review": "Fez is a good puzzle-platformer. Plenty of people agree with me about this fact. But there's more to it than that:\n\nAesthetically, I think this whole game hangs together really nicely - the art-style and Disasterpiece's soundtrack combined are undoubtedly gorgeous. I enjoyed the platforming elements immensely; the changing-perspective-to-get-from-A-to-B mechanic was really well executed and didn't get boring.\n\nAs a straight-up puzzler, the game was fairly weak. Granted, you could pretty much ignore much of it (as I did) and still get to the credits. But this weakness really doesn't make me want to 100% this game (plus navigating the entire World isn't that great, either). The esoteric substitution cypher isn't great; I know what the solution is after looking it up after the fact, but I wouldn't know where I'd find this in the game.  And God help you if you're not a native English speaker familiar with pangrams.\n\nSome of the puzzles are okay, but others are pretty mean. The Bell puzzle, in my opinion, is terrible; it relies upon solving the substitution cypher to ring the faces of the bell a number of times. But the bell chimes are tuned to allow the Westminster Chimes to be played; having the Westminster Chimes be the answer would have been a far better and more intuitive solution to this puzzle.\n\nThe fact you can skip over anything you find rubbish and be assured you can still beat the game is a positive, but harly a ringing endorsement for the game as a whole.\n\nI might drop back into this game at some point. But the strength of the puzzles and navigation aren't ever going to bait me into wanting 100%. \n\nBuy this game on sale and have fun getting to the credits. It's worth that, for sure.

The main mechanic of the game is the ability to change your perspective of the world around you, which is crucial to platforming and puzzle solving. Your main goal in FEZ is to collect the 32 cubes, a majority of which are broken into smaller pieces you need 8 of to combine into a cube. Most of the cubes are gotten from platforming and exploration.\n\nThere is another side of this game, which is what some find to be the \"real game.\" This side is the 32 anticubes. Every anticube has some sort of puzzle attached to it. Some are much harder than others. Most of these anticubes make up my favorite portion of this game, which is the \"meta\" puzzles. This includes things such as QR Codes, translating a new language, etc.\n\nAlthough I loved this game, I think it has some major flaws. These flaws aren't big enough for me not to recommend it, but they do exist.\n\nThe first flaws come from learning the language. While I had no trouble learning the language, it requires you to know a very specific english phrase, which if you don't speak english is almost impossible for you to figure out. My issue is with the puzzle for figuring out the number translations. I feel like this could have been explained better, as the puzzle for figuring out how to read numbers is complicated and explained poorly.\n\nThe second flaws come from the secret \"red cube\" collectibles. There are three of them, and I think all three puzzles to solve them are terrible. I'm going to explain my issues without spoilers, so people who have played know what I'm talking about and people who haven't don't. I would have never figured out any of these solutions, and resorted to a guide for all of them. The red star puzzle has a solution that makes me think that I would have never gotten it if I was left in a room for thousands of years, as nothing even hints as to what your supposed to do for the solution. The solution to the security room puzzle is just bad in my opinion, and the black pillar puzzle solution is so obscure that I haven't even found an answer online as to how your supposed to figure out the second code.\n\nAll in all, FEZ is a great game with some flaws in the later puzzles.

It's really more of a platformer with light puzzle elements. I really enjoyed the puzzle elements but I wish they took more advantage of them. It felt like more of an exploration game.\n\nThat being said, it was still an enjoyable exploration game. It was cool spinning the world in a 3D perspective to traverse it in 2D. It reminded me a bit of Carl Sagan's Flat Land theory about a possible fourth dimension. The puzzles themselves didn't really feel mind bending but trying to traverse the world was. The world map was really confusing to read. Fortunately each \"level\" is very small and can be traversed in just a couple minutes each. \n\nMy one major complaint is the jumping. Jumping feels weird, there's a strange momentum that feels slow. Sometimes when you climb onto a platform, you have to give your character a second to get situation before he jumps. If you try to jump immediately, it just won't work and you'll run off the platform. If you fall from a tall height, you'll die an instantly respawn where you fell from. Generally speaking, when you run into those cases where you accidentally run off a platform instead of jumping, it'll be from a height great enough to die and respawn but it still makes it feel a bit tedious.\n\nThis is still an enjoyable, albeit more casual, \"puzzle/platformer.\" Indie titles like this always age gracefully, don't let the release date fool you.

I'm writing a review to thank the developpers for the wonderful time I've had playing Fez and replaying it now. Every aspect of Fez is brilliantly designed and seamlessly contributes to the exceptional experience that is this game. Its art style is both pretty unique and absolutely gorgeous, to the point that everything in the game is a pleasure to watch. The stunning art direction is also completed by a very nice sountrack. Other than that the controls are very responsive and the puzzles all stimulating, cleverly designed, and rewarding to complete.

The first is a puzzle-platformer that uses 2D planes in a 3D world in a fun and challenging way to force you to think about more than what you're just seeing. The second is an esoteric, often-times seemingly cryptic puzzle game that requires some thought removed from the game itself to solve.\n\nOf these two games, I like the first, but dislike the second. By-and-large, you can see the credits roll without needing to engage too much with the second. The problem I found, however, was that as you were playing through the first game it started giving way to the second. By the time I was almost at the credits, I was finding it more and more difficult to find the part of the game I enjoyed. So why the recommendation?\n\nWhat this first part offers is a rhythm where you can really build up a momentum to moving around and finding this or that, or giving you the time and space to work out what's being asked of you and to mess around until you get the reward. With an inviting aesthetic and a suitable soundtrack, this is Fez at its best. Sure, some of the asks do get more challenging, but they're often met with the satisfaction of realising what you should be doing, or that moment of idiocy you feel when you realise the simplicity of the solution compared to your muddling through. All these aspects that make a puzzle enjoyable.\n\nYou get hints even fairly on though that this second game is going to take over sooner or later. Even before then, maybe you find the playable Gomez a bit sluggish in movement, a bit uncertain of your jumping from platform to platform. I got used to it, but I do wish it was a little faster and confident. You also have to reckon with general map traversal which I never found easy, almost as if I was fighting the map as much as I was the puzzles. Doors lead you all over the place, some jumping from one area to a distant other, but the lack of any sort of minimap, despite a smart preview of where a door leads if you've already been in, makes the greater scale of the world unnecessarily frustrating to navigate. The large pause-menu map works, but it can be clunky and breaks the pacing.\n\nThese issues can be put to the side, as frustrating as they are, with how enjoyable the puzzles are, but as you start having to skip rooms because you have no clue what you're supposed to be doing, or have to come back later when you work out what the game is telling you to do in its own language it wants you to decipher, as well as getting lost or going in loops, the early enjoyment begins to recede. If I played much longer, I think I would've turned on the game and started to dislike it.\n\nOverall, there's some brilliant puzzles in here that are genuinely satisfying to solve and moving around a world that has a greater scale than what you can initially see is fantastic, but the longer it went on the more my enjoyment waned.

The atmosphere was also very well done in creating the mood.\n\nThe puzzles were very well crafted.\n\nThe game features a rotation mechnic, where you rotate \"the world\" for a different view of the land. This is mixed with 2D and 3D things. Where a 2D object will disappear depending on the angle. Things will reveal themselves from a different angle of rotation. The rotation is automatic, whereas you push the rotate button and it rotates 90 degrees.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say, is that the game quickly devolved into \"jump up to a place and rotate 4+ times before moving on and quickly repeat a short distance away\". You do this the entire game.\nIf you don't, you will be missing out on secrets, easter eggs, solutions to puzzles, puzzles, collectibles, and so on. This could be a turn off. If there were markers to show you where puzzles are, then you begin to solve it. This will cut down on the constant rotation everywhere you go.\nFinding the puzzle I'm sure will be part of the \"exploration\" people will argue. Yes, that is true. I agree to a point that the rotation was very well utilized to create interesting scenarios for the player to enjoy. The mechanic itself is used too often. I enjoyed the game more by actually solving the puzzle. This mechanic was also melded together where exploring IS the puzzle so one can move on.\nI feel they have done pretty much everything surrounding the rotation mechanic.\n\nThe game was created with lots of love, and it shows all throughout.", "timestamp_created": 1658971278, "timestamp_updated": 1658971278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541906654834747314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119533394": {"recommendationid": "119533394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407573707", "num_games_owned": 1224, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 741, "last_played": 1649225067}, "language": "english", "review": "Fez is a super interesting platformer with a million things to say.

This game was an escape from reality. Fez breaks the rules of platformers and reinvents them in its own unique and interesting way.

Disasterpiece is an absolutely amazing musician that 200% deserves more respect. The pixel art is fantastic, and the semi-3D feature of the environment as you rotate makes everything look great.\n\nFez is a game all about perspective; not only from each \"face\" of the cube-world, but in its puzzle design. It's great for people not super interested in the meta puzzles, which require notes and creativity to solve, because it can be as simple as just rotating the world to get the golden cubes/cube bits in the right way and jumping. But for those inclined to look a bit deeper, there's a whole world to understand and get to grips with that asks [i]you[/i] to figure it out. \n\nThe key element to exploration and beating the game is the map\u2014 at first it can seem very confusing, but with enough time, it gives you more than enough information (including which rooms [b]have secrets[/b]) that you're well equipped to explore everything the game has to offer. There are also \"hidden\" doors that link to random rooms, which are probably the poorest element of traversal, but with the many hubs and teleports between, I didn't have too many issues getting where I wanted to go.\n\nThe game ends when you collect 32 cubes\u2014 or at least that's what it wants you to think. There's an abundance of anti-cubes (32 of those) and red-cubes (3 of those) that provide further incentive to completing the game, with some being quite simple, and some of the others, being mainly red-cubes, having no explainable solution other than the community having brute forced it. \n\nI definitely recommend this game to just about anyone, and if you're struggling with some of the deeper puzzles, I'd recommend Absolute Steve's guide which attempts to give players hints without fully spoiling things.", "timestamp_created": 1658270125, "timestamp_updated": 1658270125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "119098300": {"recommendationid": "119098300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044583543", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1324, "last_played": 1658369452}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game about the importance of perception.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Every area has its own mechanic, which I respect immensely.\n\nHowever, while on the subject of collectibles, that to me is where this game falls a bit.\n\nThis game will make you backtrack to places where you dont even know you have to go to, unless you remember every aspect of each area and know exactly what you're doing.

While I didn't spend nearly as long with FEZ as I might have with some of the others, (especially Picross dear god am I a Picross nerd) in that I spent a solid 12 hours 100%ing (well. in steam achievements terms.) the game and doing basically all I wanted to, I still feel like this game, as a puzzle, has done something no other puzzle game has, for me. And that is provide me with a situation where i'm like \"holy shit these symbols have meaning.. I NEED TO TAKE NOTES ON THIS\". And I mean that entirely genuinely positively. It was super rewarding to solve puzzles by putting together details that I've actually encountered in the world, develop hypotheses, get proven wrong, learn how it actually works, and figure things out on my own, and solve things. That's super rewarding to me. It's not perfect by any means, some things definitely stumped me and I couldn't figure out how to do important things and then I looked up how to do it and I'm like \"well i'll be damned. if i paid attention to that detail I might have figured that out. I just didn't really know to pay attention to that specifically.\" to varying degrees of being miffed about just how cryptic the detail was. Some things I just never thought to try. Anyway, that's a sometimes thing for me. The puzzles I did solve on my own did feel very rewarding to figure out, and I can still appreciate the thought process behind some of the things I didn't figure out. All of this so far is to say nothing of the other various very nice things about this game, like how it looks with the 2d - 3d voxel / pixel mix and all, and the wonderful soundtrack by Disasterpeace. It's a very peaceful game. Very cute. Very detailed, there's clearly a lot of effort put in to the world and the things in it, and I love that. Even if you don't crack the codes for everything and figure out the significance of things, you can still clearly tell, abstract and stylized though this world may be, there are things that exist for a purpose, monuments to things that you don't quite fully grasp the significance of immediately, places where people once were but no longer are.

la hora de probarlo, desde que me entere que era \"Uno de esos juegos indie, lo mantuve en mi mente, y cuando menos me di cuenta  ya estaba en descuento, por lo que decid\u00ed, sumergirme en el mundo de este juego, luego de casi 10 horas de juego, personalmente puedo decir que Fez es un Juegaso, tanto a nivel mec\u00e1nico como a nivel personal considero que cada aspecto de este juego, incluso si esta echo para no verse tan f\u00e1cilmente, tiene un nivel de atenci\u00f3n al detalle  que hasta asusta, cuando salio este juego yo todav\u00eda ni siquiera pensaba en videojuegos como una gran parte de mi vida, pero aun as\u00ed, me agrada que desde incluso tiempo atr\u00e1s ya exist\u00edan juegos y desarrolla dores que pon\u00edan un gran aporte a la industria, difuminando cada vez mas la delgada linea que los videojuegos tienen entre medio art\u00edstico y de entretenimiento.\n\nCon lo anterior, por supuesto me refiero a en lo que Fez mas destaca, en este caso su premisa y su jugabilidad tan innovadora y creativa por igual, el simple echo de pensar en las dimensiones ya da para un tesis entera y aun mejor plasmar ese estilo en un videojuego del 2013 es una locura, acompa\u00f1ado por esa banda sonora tan relajante y tan satisfactoria, que incluso estoy pensando en comprarla para escucharla, los puzzels son ingeniosos y no han envejecido para nada, cada uno se mantiene fresco e interesante, por destacar algunos (SPOILER ALERD) puedo mencionar la fant\u00e1stica  secci\u00f3n en donde si no mantienes el ridmo de la musica que te acompa\u00f1a sera casi imposible continuar.\n\nPERO, realmente este juego despert\u00f3 no solo buenas sensaciones como su Bello final, ya que tambi\u00e9n me dejo pensando bastante muchas de las cosas incluidas en el juego, despu\u00e9s de todo no todos los indies son joyas dignas de un museo y un legado, en este caso Fez falla en algunos aspectos...\n\nPrimero que nada, estoy consciente de el tipo de persona que es el creador de este juego y toda la lamentable pol\u00e9mica  que llevo a la cancelaci\u00f3n de la secuela de Fez, cosa que ami en lo personal me parece de lo mas est\u00fapido que e visto en mucho tiempo (y eso que veo noticias casi a diario xd), pero aun as\u00ed, realmente tengo que destacar algunas cosas que no me gustaron de este juego:\n\nPara empezar tenemos el control de nuestro personaje, el cual personalmente no es de mi agrado (cabe aclarar que esto es mas de mi gusto personal), en juegos como Hollow knight, pude tolerarlo y uno se puede acostumbrar, el mismo caso es en este juego, pero aun as\u00ed abr\u00eda agradecido un bot\u00f3n de para correr o aumentar la velocidad de nuestro personaje.\n\nOtra cosa que de verdad va mas all\u00e1 de mi gusto, son algunos de los puzzles, no me malentiendan, en su mayor\u00eda me agradaron e incluso hay un que otro que no voy a olvidar por su creatividad, incluso debo admitir que en algunos trataron de innovar, cosa que algunas veces salio bien (como el ejemplo antes mencionado) y otras rosa con la tortura, personalmente creo que: \"ninguna mec\u00e1nica, por tan buena que sea no debe ser llevada al limite para el jugador\", un ejemplo que genuina mente odie, fue el puzzle de el reloj, (a no ser que visites una gu\u00eda, la cual seguro que no te va a servir) para mi este fue la peor parte del juego, la cual consisti\u00f3 en prueba y error.\n\nOtros ejemplos son los puzzles que tienen que ver con los anti cubos, y los artefactos, la mayor\u00eda de estos objetos no tiene una pista dentro del juego, lo cual por un lado esta bien, pero el tiempo que a pasado desde que se huso la investigaci\u00f3n de este juego ya tiene mas de media d\u00e9cada, por lo que muchas partes de juego van a ser muy confusas o directamente frustran tes.\n\nEDIT: Algo que olvide mencionar es que hay bastantes bugs, los cuales tengo entendido no van a arreglar, si piensas en acabarte el juego en su totalidad, te recomiendo que seas paciente con estas cosas, que son muy pocas la verdad, pero lo que si que esta mal (no se si solo me paso a mi o es algo que el juego tiene de entrada), son los bugs visuales de el modo 3D, eso es algo que la verdad no me agrado para nada, mas que por los bugs que por el modo 3D.\n\nEso si, recalco que el juego es una maravilla t\u00e9cnica, la cual como m\u00ednimo tienes que probar una vez, en mi caso me engancho casi en su totalidad, incluso me llevo a acabarlo en su totalidad, y lo vuelvo a decir le juego me encanto y ese final a un mas.\n\n90% RECOMENDADO\n\"Si te desesperas f\u00e1cilmente o no estas acostumbrado a este tipo de juegos, personalmente recomiendo que no empieces por este titulo y busques uno mas \"Sencillo\" o que se acople a tus necesidades\"\n\nGRACIAS POR LEER :D", "timestamp_created": 1653876538, "timestamp_updated": 1653876787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count":

Often pixel art is used as a sort of indie staple, that gives it a certain feeling. For FEZ, the pixel art is a necessity, because it is how the game functions. Each level is 3D, but you can only see one side of it in 2D. By rotating the level, you get a new perspective that allows movement to somewhere else. \nFrankly, the puzzles are very well thought out. Brilliant use is made of this one core mechanic. The difficulty progression is great, and the later levels really are mind twisters. \nOne key component is often searching for where to even go next. Because so many things are hidden on other sides of the same level, even finding the next door to go through can be difficult, as there are often many, branching paths. The exploration is never a bore though, because everly level is beautiful, with masterwork pixel art.\nAnyone who likes puzzle games should pick this up.

I was following the development, and I love lush pixel art, and all the colors, and Paul Robertson did some animation, and it's just . . . this game should be my Jam. But it's not.\n\nRight off the bat, Fez envelopes you in its serene sound design and immaculate pixel placement. You control cute lil' Gomez, and he jumps and climbs around, and it's great. Then you get to twist your perspective around, and hey, that's the gimmick! That's cool! There are cool perspective puzzles, you get to, uh, see more perspectives, of the world, you know. And in order to progress, you have to see things from a different . . . perspective . . . .\n\nListen, I'm out of nice things to say. I loved the idea of exploring this world and collecting the shiny trinkets, so I set off on a grand journey. And I found a neat puzzle! You've got to set up these blocks so that they form different tetronimoes from each side. I pushed them around, got them in almost the right formation, but the controls wouldn't let me nudge one of the blocks in the right direction. So I tried again. Like seven more times. And the problem for me was: the physics of this world don't make any sense. The 2D interactions just *bug out* when in a 3D world. I got a block to float in mid-air with nothing below it, just by pushing the four blocks around. At that point I gave up, and decided to see if I had the idea wrong. And it turns out you can PICK UP BLOCKS? The game failed to teach me that I could pick things up. On top of that, the solution involves putting the blocks on separate shiny spots, *not* touching each other. That is *not* how the tetronimo do.\n\nSo anyway I solved that puzzle finally and tried to figure out where to go next, but the confusing in-game map did not make it easy to navigate (why are discovered warp doors not displayed?). Exiting and entering a room resulted in an unexplained change in the room, but whatever. The physics continued to be broken (rotating caused part of Gomez to be visible, but the instant he jumped, he was suddenly behind everything). Collecting a cube caused Gomez to levitate in the air right into a glitch that killed him, ruining my immersion further. I proceeded to walk through a doorway in just the right way to lock the game up and force a hard reset.\n\nMy experience deciphering the runes in the game: the alphabet is laughably easy but tedious, the number system is poorly communicated, and the tutorial for the input glyphs breaks the game's own pattern of reading right to left.\n\nSo anyway I beat the game. And there were some clever moments that I enjoyed. But most of my 10 hours was spent checking off boxes, craning my neck 90 degrees to the right, and looking up puzzle solutions when I wasn't sure what to do because there is literally a puzzle that the community had to brute-force in order to solve. Most everything in the game that doesn't involve the main gimmick is either finding a secret code that you input with your controls or clumsy platforming ideas taken from better games. There is no story to speak of aside from sparse, vague background details about the world.\n\nI do Not recommend this game. The exploration runs counter to the incongruous world design. The precise puzzling runs counter to the sloppy character controls and physics. There are graphical glitches that impede my sense of immersion that are *separate* from the intentional glitches put into the game by design. The incessant saving icon impedes my sense of immersion. Decoding the hidden messages makes me feel like the kid from A Christmas Story when he gets his decoder ring. The keyboard controls suck except for the map screen, where a controller sucks.

Now that I finally have a proper graphics card, I decided to try it out.\n\nThe premise of FEZ is that it\u2019s a puzzle platformer where you move in 2D but can rotate the environment in 3D. This allows you to use perspective tricks like bridging platforms that are far apart at one angle but close together at another.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the actual gameplay of FEZ.\n\nAbout halfway through the game, after you get all the easy collectibles that are solved through perspective puzzles, the game completely changes. All the remaining puzzles are absurdly tedious and obtuse, and mostly revolve around decoding ciphers that will tell you the solution outright. As in literally, the solutions are just sequences of button presses. After a few hours of flailing I gave up and just looked up the answers, most of which still had me boggling. (One puzzle is so bad the community had to [i]brute-force it[/i], and to this day they still don\u2019t know what the intended logic was supposed to be.)\n\nThe cipher keys are generally very poorly integrated and not signposted at all \u2014 you are supposed to look at a fox jumping over a dog (in an area full of other wildlife that is otherwise irrelevant to gameplay) and make the leap that the stone tablet of moon runes next to them says \u201cthe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\u201d. You are also somehow supposed to realize that the numbering runes can represent the same number through multiple different systems, the only hint for which requires you to assume a series of moon runes is an arithmetic equation and also to assume that the symbol at the end means \u201c10\u201d. (And also that the writing system is top-to-bottom, and and and\u2026) The game asks you to take way too many leaps of logic without any indication of if you\u2019re going in the wrong direction.\n\nOh, and to developers everywhere: A puzzle that requires you to sit in place and wait for something to happen is not a puzzle, it\u2019s just a waste of time.

Si lo que buscas es un desaf\u00edo intelectual, entonces has encontrado el juego perfecto.\nLa cantidad de puzles que contiene este juego es enorme, y aunque todos se basan en una mec\u00e1nica similar, la manera de resolverlos es completamente distinta para cada uno. Adem\u00e1s, posee varios finales y para acceder al \"mejor\" tienes que jugar al NG+, que a\u00f1ade una mec\u00e1nica inesperada e innovadora para resolver esos rompecabezas que diste por imposibles la primera vez. Eso s\u00ed, recomiendo jugarlo con mando porque si no puede costarte bastante, y una posible pega es que el fast travel est\u00e1 bastante restringido, con lo cual tienes que acordarte de qu\u00e9 puerta lleva a qu\u00e9 sitio y mirar el mapa constantemente, hubiera preferido que pudieses teletransportarte a cualquier lugar desde cualquier otro pulsando en el mapa, por ejemplo.\nAh, y ten papel y l\u00e1piz a mano...\n\n[b] DURACI\u00d3N [/b]\nEl juego te llevar\u00e1 unas 10 horas si decides completarlo al 100% y no te atascas demasiado en los rompecabezas, aunque por lo que tengo entendido hay uno de ellos que fue resuelto por la comunidad usando fuerza bruta (tranquilo, no es necesario para los finales) y que todav\u00eda no se ha conseguido explicar del todo. No es un juego muy largo, pero por 10 euros est\u00e1 bastante bien y pasas un fin de semana entretenido.\n\n[b] ATM\u00d3SFERA [/b]\nEl juego es precioso visualmente. La est\u00e9tica 8-bit le pega much\u00edsimo, cada \u00e1rea tiene detalles que la hacen diferenciarse del resto, la perspectiva es \u00fanica (recuerda mucho al cuento Planilandia) y el personaje principal, a pesar de no hablar, se hace entra\u00f1able. La \u00fanica pega que podr\u00eda ponerle ser\u00eda que la banda sonora se hace ligeramente repetitiva, y algunas escenas pueden marear o tal vez provocar episodios de epilepsia a algunas personas, cosa que otros juegos advierten y que no he visto en este.

I must say that I\u2019m not a fan of bridge games, so to be honest I tried this one out just for the Portal concept. As far as physics-based puzzle games go, I\u2019ve always felt that bridge construction ones depend too much on trial and error, and I end up brute forcing solutions (granted, probably due to my own ineptitude).\n\n[b]Writing[/b] The most relevant thing about the Portal context is that you get to see GLaDOS again and the characteristic Portal sarcastic tone. Unfortunately, this is mainly explored in the first stages of the game, and by midgame interactions and any kind of narrative are mostly gone. But it if nothing else, it was enough to make me want to play Portal again, so there\u2019s that.\n\n[b]Aesthetics[/b] The design is inspired by the Portal setting.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] In terms of bridge construction, Bridge Constructor: Portal seems to be rather limited (only 2 materials throughout the game). Most Portal elements are present, including repulsion and propulsion gel, buttons, laser fields, cubes and aerial plates, which make for some interesting puzzles. Oh, there are also portals, which I felt were the least interesting aspect. Failing a level has no consequences, and you can just reset. Level progress is saved and you can save multiple solutions.\n\n[b]Value[/b] It took me 16h to get all the achievements, which is something. You can revisit previous levels from the menu. There are multiple endings available, depending on how far you progress in the game. Achievements are mostly related to \"perfecting\" levels, and triggering some events. There's also support for user-designed levels. Besides those additional levels, replay value depends on how obsessed you are with optimizing solutions.\n\n[quote][i]For more puzzle-game reviews and curated lists check out the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326007-The-Clueless-Adventurer-Puzzle-Trove/]Puzzle Trove[/url].[/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1639524830, "timestamp_updated": 1672054756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602081418037414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "105729655": {"recommendationid": "105729655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397991938", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2118, "last_played": 1639668028}, "language": "english", "review": "combines the aspects of both a 2d and 3d gameplay environment in an intuitive and enjoyable style of play.

It is a game that clearly has a lot of care put into it by the many who worked on it.\n\n\n[b]Visual design[/b]\nThe art of the game is outstanding. It takes a theme and sticks to it excellently.\nEach area has a very distinct feeling and you can identify its purpose in the overall world immediately - The peaceful airs of the observatory that reaches for the ever present constellations; The heavy industrial smog over the factories stuck in automated purgatory; The ??? of the r\u0337\u0342\u0320\u0323e\u0335\u030e\u0312\u035cd\u0337\u0312\u031e\u0318 \u0337\u0315\u0306\u0322\u0356a\u0336\u0341\u0352\u0332\u0326b\u0335\u0357\u032a\u0316y\u0338\u030e\u0341\u032as\u0334\u030a\u030f\u034d\u0359s\u0338\u0352\u0333.\n\nThere is an absurd level of attention to details in each area; Animals unique to their area (Along with their own inventive visuals), landmarks, textures and sprites. No matter where you go, you will see something new. There is almost nothing I could suggest to improve upon the art.\n\nAlmost. I will say that the map screen is lackluster - It's very helpful and useful, but a needlessly difficult to understand and use. It'll lock onto things you don't want it to, the orthographic view, while in theme, leads to a lot of confusion. I think this stems from the difficulty of making a 3D map for such a unique style.\n\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nThe first thing that sets Fez apart from other puzzle games is its grand open world. As much as you're seeking out puzzles to solve, you're also always learning about the world surrounding them. The open world doesn't feel like a convenient package, it feels fully integrated into the puzzles.\nMany puzzles can only be solved in the context of this world. The game features at least 3 unique \"languages\" for you to understand (Which, I must say, I can read fluently now). Breaking any one of them feels like a real accomplishment, and is integral to understanding some puzzles and the world at large. Some puzzles require you to have paid attention elsewhere, paintings and shapes. Many require strong reasoning.\n\nMany have proclaimed the game is hard, with limited direction, but I object to this. First, there are very few puzzles that are required to beat the game. Without saying too much, you need to solve about half of the puzzles to beat it. If you get stuck on one puzzle, you can move on to a different one - If you decide to take on the harder puzzles, it will be because you want to.\nSecond, the difficulty of the puzzles comes not from some mechanical complexity, nor massive leaps in logic. The difficulty comes from the game trusting you enough to figure things out on your own, to pay attention to the world around you and take note of anything that might be important. You won't receive hints if you're stuck, you won't be told anything, you're trusted to take notes, pictures, make connections. There's no (required*) puzzle I felt had some unfair leap in logic, and it made solving all of them an experience to remember.\n\nThe difficult puzzles felt the perfect temperature for me, relating to existing concepts enough to be identifiable, but unique enough to provide something to think about. There are many smaller puzzles that act as reinforcement for ideas, and as nice rewards to collect as you explore the expansive world.\n\n\n[b]Platforming[/b]\nEverything I've said so far has been quite positive, but I must buck the trend here. Fez is not a challenging platformer - Not because it's uninspired, but because it's under explored. There's a lot of potential depth to the platforming: You have momentum and it carries, there's many types of platforms, and the game's core feature of changing perspectives has an absurd potential for exploration. But it doesn't utilize it very well.\n\nI wasn't bored with the platforming in Fez (often). The platforming that is there is pleasing, there's a nice rhythm to some sections, you can find techniques to get around faster, and it complements the feeling of exploration the rest of the game cultivates.\n\nHowever, there's not really a strong feeling of flow. Sections I [i]think[/i] were intended to be hard had me standing around waiting for the game to catch up. Many areas introduce interesting platforming challenges - That they use a couple of times and never again. It feels like a constant tutorial in terms of platforming, I always felt like I was waiting for it to really start. It does make backtracking a bit boring.\n\nWorse yet, the 3D aspect of platforming is frankly poorly explained. Your z position (that is, towards the camera) is regularly shifted, and you have no way of knowing where you are on it - That is, until you change perspective, and find out it's put you at the total opposite end of where you wanted to be. The platforming is so simple however that this doesn't tend to be a problem, just an annoyance. There was one puzzle that required moving around a bunch of blocks that became a real nightmare because of this ever shifting Z position.\n\nIt didn't dampen my experience overall - It's still [i]good,[/i] but in relation to everything else that shines like a brilliantly polished diamond, it does feel a bit neglected.\n\n\n[b]Music[/b]\nog mty godsh disasterpeace is so beautiflu i love him\n\n\nA great game I would love to see more people take inspiration from.", "timestamp_created": 1635426157, "timestamp_updated": 1635426157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929101943969727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101736480": {"recommendationid": "101736480", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987029088", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1962, "last_played": 1687126597}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un cl\u00e1sico de cl\u00e1sicos, relajante , inspirador, m\u00fasica y gr\u00e1ficos perfectos.", "timestamp_created": 1635389931, "timestamp_updated": 1635389931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "101726356": {"recommendationid": "101726356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989399932", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 351, "last_played": 1665265655}, "language": "english", "review": "It's chill, beautiful, lots of care put into it.

Seriously, why does he wear a fez? I dunno, but it's a strong personality. \n\nThis game is awesome.\n\nIt's 2D world but in reality it's voxel-like 3D orthographic enviornment forced onto one of the four 2D side-view planes that you can rotate freely, the genius coming through the fact that it applies 2D physics rules to that afterwards, where you can navigate platforms like they don't have depth differences. It feels more of pleasant to navigate the levels using it than chore, combined with just a good feeling platforming physics, great graphics, great music.\n\nBut it's not a platforming-action game, it's exploration-puzzle game. Platforming is mostly pleasant, there are no enemies. Or much of friends outside of your village, leaving you feeling alone to experience new areas with music that get you feeling deep. There are 32 normal cubes hidden and 32 anti-cubes that are much harder to get. You only need to get 32 cubes to get a normal ending and extra ending won't net you amazing new lore either, it's ok to finish with 32 cubes. Go as far as you can. There are no abilities to unlock aside from one you get in New Game +, albeit you keep progress when you go NG+. So you can get your first normal ending anytime you want, go NG+ and continue getting remaining cubes for another ending orrrr for self-pleasure, like I did.\n\nBecause puzzles are really enjoyable there. There is some decypher ones that I didn't bother, at least word translation and numbers, managed to figure out the fancy command type. Was not a fan of QR Codes, ended up looking up guides as website didn't want to accept Steam's F12 jpeg screenshots. No, I am not using those QR code scanners on my phone, their permissions are mighty sus. But otherwise, very fun, especially how puzzles don't require you to find ability in another side of a map, usually, albeit there is one switch somewhere. But still, the desire to explore the mysteries, to tease my brain optionally and observe around for clues, it was really strong. I do wish game had in-game way to store some clues, but you won't need more than a single page in notebook.\n\nDevs did want you to go and challenge yourself with puzzles and exploration as the very last part of normal cube is hidden along with anti-cube, haaa.\n\nLovely, highly recommended, Myst can suck it, it replaces it, fite me.\n\nOh yea, and there was Phil Fish. I call it \"learning how Internet fame and Internet community works in mainstream in 2010 era\". Which we didn't know, but, imagine this, gamers(tm) back then seriously thought that having strong shit opinion (like all ours) deserves witch hunting. Companies like Nintendo abusing human passion by CnDing fangames in our perversed copyright law, going far beyond the minimum requirement? Naaaah, it's fine, it's by law thus it's morally OK.

The gameplay and how the 3D mechanic is utilised is really smooth as well despite it not reaching its full potential in my opinion as there aren't a lot of times where rapid flipping of the environment is required. The way the areas can basically be explored in whichever order you choose for the most part also adds to the game and the carefree nature of it.\n\nMy only real issue I take with the game is that some of the puzzles are ridiculously obscure and one took the internet bruteforcing it to solve. It is irritating to have to go and look for a guide mid play session because some puzzles were made basically impossible without people on the internet bruteforcing or datamining the game for the solution.

And now that I fully appreciate it, was it worth playing through? No, not really.\n\nMechanically I don't think that the central gimmick of being about to rotate the level ninety degrees did all that much more that obscure or reveal the next platform to jump to. It didn't really add much to the difficulty of traversing the individual levels, but I found that it did make navigating the larger open world of the game more of a chore and got in the way of enjoying the game on a larger scale.\n\nAlso, the game feels like two different games taped together? The first half is a pretty straight forward platformer, and the second half is all about understanding ciphers and inputting codes? I'm not sure that it wouldn't have been better to just concentrate on one of these rather than switch track mid game. \n\n(On the topic of codes: I know that QR codes are neat and all, but having me pause the game three different times to look up a QR code is not what I call fun gameplay. Maybe QR codes were a lot more exciting back in 2012.)\n\nAll that said, probably the most unforgiving thing for me was how nauseating the game was. I was mostly okay with the levels rotating around, though that was bad enough, but then the game added more lights and motion on top of that.

Try getting a couple bits in any given level and you'll end up finding a door, which will lead you to grab another couple bits and even more doors. You'll end up losing yourself if you don't use your map, which by the way, is pretty awful to nagivate in. The game starts strong, but after a while... nothing happens. You quite literally only have to all the cubes, and there's no more to it. It's never addressed how the flat 2d people can have their rooms decorated in all dimensions when they themselves can't grasp the concept of \"changing perspective\". The game is completely devoid of proper story writing.\n\nThen actual platforming is way too easy to clear, to the point where you'll seem like a speedrunner even if you're just casually going around. Once you clear a few levels, the perspective shifting mechanic becomes second nature and it loses its novelty. However, rather than exploring more ways to spice up the main game mechanic, the devs put most work into the puzzles.\n\nAnd most puzzles, frankly speaking, are complete trash. It's like they didn't go through game design 101, putting absurd conditions to unlock the cubes. The most prominent type of puzzles relies on learning to input a sequence of commands by learning the symbols of the game, but it's not until late game when you're given a cryptic hint as to how to solve them. Then there's the bad puzzles that are impossible to solve without looking it up, like writing down a sequence in binary, turning it into hexadecimal and then to ascii. Pure madness.\n\nLastly there's the bugs. The game is full of minor bugs that show up doing basic things that shouldn't have made it past some playtesting. I'm baffled this game got GOTY back when it was released. I can see how all these bullshit puzzles that came up might have made people be in awe due to how \"innovative\" they were, but that's all there is to it.

The main attraction here is the perspective-shifting 3D mechanic that most people already know from the trailers and descriptions, but these small pieces of the game don't reveal another core component of Fez: the secret-finding, collect-a-thon, and even code-breaking natures of the game. This unfortunately does mean the main mechanic of the game takes a backseat for the latter half of the game, and that the drawbacks of most secret-finding and collect-a-thon games are present, such as most newcomers practically needing a walkthrough or guide if they want to collect everything and some tedious backtracking if one misses a collectible in an area. \n\nFor me, however, these extra things overall weren't a hindrance, but a supplement to the core 3D-shifting mechanic of the game and helped prevent Fez from wearing out its welcome. Add onto the charming, pixelated aesthetic, the calming soundtrack, and the quirky and beautiful art style and Fez proves to be an outstanding indie title that is incredibly recommended, with the caveat that one is willing to be thrown a curveball occasionally.", "timestamp_created": 1625892715, "timestamp_updated": 1640470401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555084764957427979", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95422788": {"recommendationid": "95422788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045040335", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 263, "last_played": 1664591727}, "language": "english", "review": "this game definitely made my brain think because i definitely didn't beat half the puzzles by googling stuff HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHJHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAZLDFHSDIJOLHGSIUODGHWEOUIHTGGSDIOUGIUF", "timestamp_created": 1625859780, "timestamp_updated": 1625859780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483870983123779297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "95298862": {"recommendationid": "95298862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193799399", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1401, "last_played": 1625714450}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite indie puzzle games.

Presentando elementos \u00fanicos y un pixel-art sumamente enriquecedor y agradable a la vista con cientos de secretos y acertijos para resolver en un vasto mundo por explorar, todo esto acompa\u00f1ado de una m\u00fasica que complementa cada escenario y progreso de la aventura.\n\nFEZ se caracteriza principalmente por sus mec\u00e1nicas las cuales fueron y siguen siendo sumamente innovadoras a d\u00eda de hoy. Ciertamente es dif\u00edcil pensar en otro t\u00edtulo que haya hecho una mec\u00e1nica remotamente similar a la que posee este t\u00edtulo, puesto que el principal distinto es poder cambiar la perspectiva del mundo en 4 diferentes \u00e1ngulos y as\u00ed, poder avanzar a trav\u00e9s de los distintos niveles y rompecabezas que el mismo escenario nos plantea, algo que vuelve a FEZ sumamente \u00fanico en su tipo, sin mencionar que los escenarios por los que avanzamos aportan peque\u00f1as variantes, obtenemos nuevos objetos y novedades a la mec\u00e1nica principal de rotar el mundo, lo que hace el juego bastante diverso de m\u00faltiples situaciones, logrando as\u00ed que la monoton\u00eda no sea uno de sus problemas o desventajas, puesto que siempre habr\u00e1 algo nuevo que ver, explorar, recolectar y resolver, por m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo que parezca en un inicio.\n\nFEZ posee un apartado visual y sonoro muy ingenioso, arm\u00f3nico y complementario, no es solo por el hecho de que su pixelart junto a su paleta de colores sean muy bonitos a la vista o lo agradables, calmadas y motivantes que sean sus melod\u00edas; sino tambi\u00e9n porque cada zona es totalmente \u00fanica acorde a lo que el juego quiere transmitir, y estos fungen en muchas ocasiones como gu\u00eda y pistas hac\u00eda otros posibles secretos y misterios que por lo general suelen pasar desapercibidos. Rayos, el juego llega a poseer rompecabezas tan bien elaborados e ingeniosos que tiene hasta su propio lenguaje llamado \u201cAlfabeto FEZ\u201d, y no es sino por la mera observaci\u00f3n del entorno y la perspicacia del jugador que lograr\u00e1 darse cuenta y desencriptar los mismos para avanzar a otros lugares a\u00fan m\u00e1s incognitos. Por suerte este tipo de retos FEZ se ofrece para dejarlos como algo \u2018opcional\u2019, algo para los jugadores m\u00e1s comprometidos y codiciosos con el 100% de los logros, por lo que aquellos que buscan una aventura m\u00e1s breve y personal no deber\u00edan tener muchos problemas o adversidades con llegar al final del juego.\n\nSi bien todo lo que he mencionado de FEZ parece perfecto, tiene un peque\u00f1o problema que no hace que sea una obra maestra de su tipo, la cual es su historia o motivaciones del personaje. Quiero decir, en FEZ nos plantean una base, tanto la descripci\u00f3n de la p\u00e1gina de Steam como los 10 primeros minutos de juego: [b]\u201cEres un personaje con cabeza rectangular llamado Gomez, el cual obtiene la habilidad de navegar y explorar de diferentes \u00e1ngulos un mundo 2D gracias a un gorro Fez que obtienes al inicio del juego, y que tienes que salvar el universo por obras del destino\u201d.[/b] Por lo cual aqu\u00ed surgen varios problemas:\nSi bien, al inicio del juego nos plantean las motivaciones tanto para nuestro protagonista como para nosotros el jugador, la verdad es que en ning\u00fan momento se profundiza y explora mejor este elemento, brind\u00e1ndonos mayor informaci\u00f3n acerca del peligro real que estamos aconteciendo o como el universo est\u00e1 en peligro en primer lugar, ya que su final simplemente nos muestra una serie de im\u00e1genes psicod\u00e9licas en bucle sin terminar de complementar la peque\u00f1a narrativa que tiene el t\u00edtulo y haciendo sentir nuestras acciones como si nunca hubiesen tenido un peso o importancia real, m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de entretener al jugador por un par de horas. Ya que incluso, no posee un desaf\u00edo final que ponga a prueba todos nuestros conocimientos y habilidades adquiridos, como har\u00eda otros juegos como Super Meat Boy. Es uno de los errores que hace que FEZ no logre sacar su m\u00e1ximo potencial como obra independiente, ya que tiene una serie de elementos hermosamente cuidados en su mec\u00e1nica, pero poco o nada en su historia y final del mismo.\n\n[u]En conclusi\u00f3n:[/u] A pesar de lo anterior expuesto, no debe ser un motivo decisorio para no adquirir esta joya oculta e infravalorada del mundo de los videojuegos Indie, todo lo contrario, puesto a que como mencion\u00e9 a lo largo de toda esta rese\u00f1a, son m\u00e1s las caracter\u00edsticas favorables y destacables que posee el t\u00edtulo, brindando una experiencia desafiante a la par de entretenida, con grandes dosis de ingenio, novedad y creatividad [b]sea por donde sea la perspectiva que se le mire.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1625421390, "timestamp_updated": 1625421390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632297694683074951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94934915": {"recommendationid": "94934915", "author": {"steamid": "76561199180558502", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1627579646}, "language": "english", "review": "love it <3", "timestamp_created": 1625291312, "timestamp_updated": 1625291312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "94926204": {"recommendationid": "94926204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025212944", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1375044222}, "language": "english", "review": "The core mechanic and platforming are a lot of fun, and the music and environments are charming.

While the puzzles themselves are relatively simple most of the time, I loved seeing how different parts of the map would connect to each other, and just how far they'd bend the 3D space they had. Twisting and turning the screen to take new perspectives is something I thoroughly enjoy, and it feels quite reminiscent of Captain Toad in that regard. The game is also fairly flexible in how you complete your first run - you don't need to grab x amount of Golden Cubes to open any given door, just x amount of cubes. So, if you were lucky enough to figure out how to snag an Anti-Cube, it actually counts towards your total. This means you don't have to scour every nook and cranny to find every yellow cube if you do manage to get a few Antis along the way, which promotes doing some of the more complex challenges.

I generally recommend this game to my friends if I know they enjoy exploration and puzzle games, and if they like the art-style. If both of those things are true for you, I would certainly recommend you stop reading this review and give FEZ a try. I lost a good weekend (and then some) to this game, and I think it's well worth its $10 price tag. If you're still unsure, what follows is a slightly more in-depth look at the game, though I warn you there may be minor spoilers.\n\nFEZ is absolutely gorgeous. You can see for yourself the level of detail that went into the art design by looking at Steam's slideshow of screenshots. What might not truly be captured in this brief preview, however, is the combination of level design, music, and background noise that give the world of FEZ its atmosphere -- somehow mysterious and warm at the same time. My entire adventure had me feeling like a stranger in a foreign land, yet at the same time as if I were rediscovering a home I'd long since forgotten. \n\nMost of the surface-level puzzles are simple and straightforward. You see bits of a cube, do some platforming to get to them, and continue to work your way towards either a whole cube or another area to explore. This is not [i]really[/i] the game of FEZ; this is just getting you familiar with the environment. There are a lot of little clues in FEZ -- seriously, even in the first little area there is a hint (perhaps more than one, I don't remember) to later puzzles. The real game comes from engaging with the world and getting immersed in it. \n\nThere [i]are[/i] moments of frustration in FEZ. It was unclear to me at times whether the puzzle in front of me just needed more thought or if I was missing a crucial bit of knowledge that would let me figure it out. This led to me banging my head against a wall more than a few times. Unfortunately, while putting off a puzzle you can't solve is often a good solution, that requires backtracking. You will do a lot of backtracking in FEZ. There are a few teleports to major areas, however the puzzles you are likely to struggle with can be tucked away in areas far away from these teleports. You'll have to run back and forth every time you want another crack at a puzzle you set aside for a bit.\n\nFurthermore, two of the later puzzles [b]do not have solutions you can find in-game[/b]. Yes, you read that right. One of them [spoiler]a literal black monolith[/spoiler] needed to be brute-forced in order to find the solution. Another required digging through the game's code. Correction -- people who worked on have [i]claimed[/i] that there [i]is[/i] an in-game solution to the first puzzle I mentioned, however how to arrive at the solution has been debated for [i]years[/i] with no conclusive answer. Some theories were built around the release date of the game's Xbox port -- seriously, the theories for how to arrive at the solution are absurdly convoluted. Personally I'm pretty happy with this puzzle, it feels like there are still mysteries waiting to be solved, and having to work on puzzles like this out-of-game, it almost makes FEZ come alive. \n\nSome things I didn't like about the game -- I found the companion to be pretty annoying. Sometimes when you turn the screen your character ends up behind the landscape and if you move while behind it you immediately fall. As mentioned before, I found the backtracking to often be frustrating, and a few of the puzzles had me smashing my head against a wall. Moreover, for puzzles like the one I mentioned earlier, there were times where the solution was difficult not because I was lacking information, [i]but because there is no known way to find the solution in-game[/i]. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with FEZ. I hope you will too. If you can't figure out a puzzle within a reasonable amount of time, please move on temporarily -- it's possible you will learn something that will give you a new perspective. Pay close attention to the world, there are clues everywhere.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

In concept, its great. The puzzle mechanics are solid, the atmosphere is great, and the soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. But as a game, Fez isn't all too much fun to play.

Now, well, it still confuses me.\n\nA lot of the game is just platforming and shifting your view to collect items, which are then used to open doors once you've gotten enough of them. Some of the items are used to understand the language used in the game, but honestly? It created frustration from me, so much so that I had to use a guide (shoutout to 'The Ultimate Guide to FEZ,' which was probably the only reason I stayed sane working towards 100%).\n\nThere are also QR codes in the game, which seemed cool, but... Yeah. Keep in mind that this game was made back in 2013, and at the very least, it makes sense for this game, being block based and all.\n\nI would recommend this game for anyone who loves perspective-based gameplay, platformers, and brain games.

I played the \"main story\" and it was dull. The main mechanic is cool and it IS well implemented, but it still gets boring so fast. For a while I just kept going, playing a boring and easy platformer, waiting for the puzzles to get increasingly difficult. But the only things I found were mysterious objects, places I didn't know how to reach, and text I didn't know how to interpret, and which were seemingly irrelevant to the main goal of getting the cubes to finish the story. By the time I finished I was just playing to see what happened, maybe I would be able to read the weird signs everywhere, but I wasn't having any fun.\n\nAfter \"beating the game\", just for curiosity I searched on the internet how to get to those seemingly unreachable places, and generally what were all those things I didn't get. And apparently I had missed more than half of the game. I couldn't believe the things I had to do and to think about in order to \"start\" that second half of the game. I like puzzle games, and games like baba is you and the witness both have \"end games\" which are accesible after a \"hidden\" puzzle, and which are noticeably harder than the main game, but by the time you end the main game in those games, you can have an idea of how to get to that second part, they are seamlessly integrated within the main game, and that second part is harder but still follows the same logic as the first. But in fez? Not at all. Not only the access of this second part is extremely difficult IMO, but it doesn't follow from the main game that is just about platforming and rotating the map to change the perspective. I had to look for it to understand what I had to do, and I didn't even do it because it wasn't something that seemed fun to do.\n\nHaving said that, if you like breaking your skull trying to unravel all the mysteries of a game with little information, and don't find travelling by platforming tedious, you may well enjoy this game a lot.

Getting lost in the world is amazing, try to find a way through the \"pseudo-2d\" map while slowly collecting cubes and fragments is a terrific experience. The fluidity of the platforming is also a wonder. I am not sure the developer  attended those 2 specifically, but from the interviews I watched about the game, there seemed to be other things that the devs paid attention too the most. In any case, exploring the place and the different biomes couldn't be done any better, kudos to the devs.\n\nSimilarly though, the things I was furstrated with 10 years ago were the same things that left me frustrated again. The thing that the devs seemed to have paid the most attention too, that is, the puzzles, and the concept that their solution has to be so obscure in order to be solved by the community so as to emulate the feelings that old games like the first \nZelda's would give etc., is a wasted effort that ultimately spoils the experience. I know that many people are into these things, but it satisfies a very specific itch that really is not enjoyable to most. I dread the moments when I was wondering for more an hour why the room I was in is not \"solved\", and it turned out that the solution to it is more obscure than a solution for Cicada 3301.\n\nIn short, get the game and get lost in it, that's the best way to experience the game, and it does that part magnificently well, it is really a flawed masterpiece in that sense.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you Polytron Corporation.", "timestamp_created": 1616460422, "timestamp_updated": 1640733674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479005992412567139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "88865444": {"recommendationid": "88865444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134333681", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 331, "last_played": 1616825374}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has fantastic visuals and is really fun with both simple and complex puzzles.

However, I didn't find the game to be particularly enjoyable. While it has a *great* concept, in execution I can't help but feel it doesn't quite snap together as it should at times. Jumping, and especially landings, are frustrating as it doesn't feel like I was ever very precise as well as the fall damage is extremely unforgiving. Its failure to impress me with its gameplay is a bit softened due to its fantastic, bright, and energetic color scheme and art design in general. It looks really great and I think it pulls it off well! \n\nUnfortunately, I do come looking for a good *game* and I don't feel like what I have is something I really enjoyed playing. The experience is game-centric, so it has a difficulty barrier which may keep some from being able to complete the game and experience all of the content the game provides. This means missing out on more of its great art and music. \n\nBecause of all this, I can't recommend FEZ, BUT I do highly recommend not only its OST (original soundtrack) but also to explore other music from some of the featured artists. Really, really great stuff to be found in the music. As for the game - I'd say catch it on a \"Let's play\" or even a long play on somewhere like YouTube or Twitch. Just not worth the $10 IMHO.\n\nupdate: Forgot to shout out Disasterpeace as the amazing artist behind the soundtrack. He's also done work on other games and movies.

The world changes depending on how you rotate it.\n- Cool aesthetics. Nice colorful pixelated graphics.\n- Well designed world. There are many levels to explore each of them with its own color identify and design.\n- Clever puzzles of all difficulties. There are some easy ones along with some pretty well hidden secrets.\n- The gameplay is simple but effective and brings some small innovations.\n- The main character is adorable. Actually every animal and NPC you meet looks great.\n- Animations are smooth and so cute.\n- Sound design consists mostly of electronical sounds and effects. It is simple but fits perfectly to the rest of the game's aesthetics.\n- There are some points that it is hilarious. You will have fun.\n\nThe bad\n- Sometimes you need to walk all the way back to get to the previous level. Especially when climbing down is necessary, it is painful to do it without dying.\n- The controls on the map's menu are a little bit frustrating.\n- I experienced some crashes on desktop.\n- This green/black effect on the underground levels is annoying.\n- The story is too abstract.

The game makes you look through different thoughts and perspectives while having loads of fun and relaxation with the game's awesome world. The world is so special and well thought that it always amazes you each time while entering a new level or part of the world. Everything sits so well together that it never makes you feel that anything in the game is repeating, there is always something different. \n\nAbout the puzzles... In this games every puzzle or secret has a solution within the game but mostly you have to focus and think really carefully where could the actual solution be. Sometimes you have to come up with words yourself but most of the time the solutions are hidden so well. This is one of my favourite things about the game. Each puzzle is more mysterious than others and each time it is such a good feeling to be solving these puzzles. \n\nI normally can't really complete games since they get quite repetative after sometime but this game made me complete it without a doubt. I loved the FEZ universe so much that i wanted to spend as much as time with it.\n\nIn conclusion, i would strongly recommend you to get this game if you are looking for a game with different gameplay mechanics, unique ways to use these mechanics, amazing art style and such a universe that you never get bored of with the awesome soundtrack the game has. I would especially thanks to Phil Fish and everybody that worked on this awesome game. I might be a little late to play it but i am really happy that i eventually found it.

Not that the game is bad, far from it, only that it is difficult to describe why the game is so good without going on a tangent describing minor things that I liked about the game. Sure, I could say that this game has fantastic environments, wonderful animation, and a beautiful soundtrack; but all of these things are discovered when playing the game. However, in the interest of time I believe that if you have any interest in this game you should [b] definitely [/b] play it. If you are skeptical about purchasing this game then you should read on.\n\n[i] Fez [/i] has garnered quite the reputation as being the difficult puzzle game that was made by an overly sensitive developer who did not respond well to criticism. Whatever your opinions are of Phil Fish, I believe that this game should be viewed on its own merit without accounting for what was largely fake news and media hype over certain things Phil Fish has said. With that out of the way, I would like to discuss why this game is so clever and unique.\n\nMuch can be said about the puzzles in [i] Fez [/i]. Sure the game does have difficult puzzles but I don't think they solely define what makes this game special. Sure, the puzzles are fun to solve and very unique in their own right, but that isn't all there is to the game. The art style may not seem unique with how many retro-style, 16-bit games there are on the market nowadays, and you may be tempted to overlook the game because of that. [i] Fez [/i] was one of the early pioneers of this art style and I think credit should be given to the game for opening the market not only to other indie studios, but also for the massive influx of nostalgic 16-bit titles. The soundtrack of this game is by far one of the best I have ever heard. I don't want to spend too much time talking about it so I will just say it is excellent and leave it at that. The animation and stages of this game are so well done, but I digress.\n\nIt would probably be in my best interest to talk about what this game is: a puzzle platformer (with a heavy emphasis on the puzzle portion). All that needs to be said about the platforming in this game is that it is decent, there are some portions of the game that could induce nausea due to platforming and using the unique rotation mechanic that this game offers, but that would be too much to get into. As for the puzzles, the puzzles of this game are (for the most part) pretty good. Most puzzles can be solved using internal logic that is defined by the game but some require knowledge and intuition that I think most people lack. I am not saying that I have solved every puzzle in this game (and I don't think I will), but I am warning you that you may need to consult a walkthrough or a guide that provides hints to some of the puzzles. There are no shortage of resources online that provide hints to the solutions of the puzzles without outright spoiling them (and I have used my fair share of them throughout the game). I recommend that you try to avoid these guides and use them only when absolutely necessary as solving the puzzles in this game provides an intrinsic satisfaction the likes of which I have scarcely seen in other games. I don't think it is necessary to complete all the puzzles in this game to gain your money's worth and only think the puzzles after the credits of the game are for the most dedicated and ingenious of people (that which I am not).\n\nTo summarize, I think [i] Fez [/i] is one of the most wholly unique games that is offered and I think everyone should experience this game, and people who like a good, challenging puzzle will really enjoy what this game has to offer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1609347196, "timestamp_updated": 1609347196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "83451279": {"recommendationid": "83451279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074982211", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 746, "last_played": 1514317021}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first game I ever bought without hesitation.

The difficulty scale is all over the fucking place and the gimmick isn't even interesting. Most of the puzzles can be described as \"turn the camera until you're looking in the correct direction\" and there's very little skill involved beyond some light trial and error. This game also does the thing where the every single level is connected, but since each level can be connected to up to six (!) other levels, it's impossible to navigate. I got through about 90% of the game before realizing there was a map and once I started following it, it literally didn't help at all. The music is uninteresting, The story is--well, there is no story. The other characters that you can find on a few levels serve no purpose and have no relevant dialogue. The one thing this game has going for it is the pretty graphics. This game is really pleasant to look at, but that doesn't really count for shit because it's a pain to play. I haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. Remember at the beginning of this review when I said the difficulty was wack? Well, I only explained half the issue so far. While the normal puzzles that you need to solve to progress are easy, some of the secrets are absolutely impossible to figure out. If you play through the game normally, you will probably begin to suspect that there is more to the game than just solving basic perspective puzzles. In fact there is, and I'm going to explain why it's bullshit, but don't read it if you care about figuring it out for yourself, though I doubt you will!  \n\n[spoiler]Throughout the game, there are runes etched in stones scattered across the levels. If you thought they were just decorative, YOU ARE WRONG. They come in two varieties, one of which encodes camera instructions, and one of which encodes hints in English. Now, I was able to figure out the simpler code after hours of head-scratching but I was absolutely stumped as to what the more complicated one could mean. I ended up googling it and it turns out that there is one otherwise innocuous room tucked away in a random location that has \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" scrawled on a blackboard in the background, and that's how you're supposed to figure it out. Now, I had been to this room several times but I didn't even SEE the blackboard because it BLENDS RIGHT INTO THE FUCKING BACKGROUND. Not only that, but there's no indication that this one wall out of ALL THE RANDOM WALLS IN THE GAME is useful to solving the puzzle. It's not like this is the only room that doesn't otherwise serve a purpose either! There are a bunch of empty rooms that do absolutely nothing but this one in particular happens to be the key to solving LIKE A QUARTER OF THE SECRETS IN THE GAME. Honestly, the one moment of enjoyment I had while playing the game was when I figured out the first code. I really felt like I had accomplished something. That feeling went away after I looked up the second one. It's not like solving these puzzles unlocks anything interesting either! It just lets you get whatever collectibles you hadn't gotten yet.[/spoiler]  \n\nThe nonsense doesn't end there, though. There's an optional puzzle in this game that has a solution so obscure that the only way people figured out how to solve it was by fucking BRUTE FORCING IT. Did I also mention there's a puzzle in one of the levels that requires you to wait actual DAYS in real time to complete, with practically no indication of how much time is left? And if you don't happen to catch it at the perfect moment then you have to wait all over again? Yeah, real engaging gameplay Phil. Ugh. This game somehow manages to be the least challenging and most insanely difficult game at the same time. It's a bloody miracle. So yeah, Fez is a fucking mess. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself. You'll experience the boredom, the loneliness, the frustration at not being able to solve the most cryptic shit ever, the feeling of emptiness inside your soul as you traverse dozens of indistinguishable maps looking for some secret that you missed, only to find [spoiler]some shitty runes etched into a rock that you don't know how to read[/spoiler]. \"Oh well,\" you'll think to yourself. \"I'll come back to this later when I've figured more things out.\" And you will come back, again and again, only to be just as clueless as the first time. Fuck this game, fuck Phil fish, and fuck all the cocksukkers who call it a masterpiece. 2/10.", "timestamp_created": 1607562954, "timestamp_updated": 1607562954, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484439224004745483", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81893039": {"recommendationid": "81893039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198840195300", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2002, "last_played": 1546613684}, "language": "english", "review": "Increible Juego una joya, juego indie con mucho trabajo, una gran historia y una estetica hermosa", "timestamp_created": 1607522562, "timestamp_updated": 1607522562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81874356": {"recommendationid": "81874356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041659764", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 860, "last_played": 1580762469}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1607489849, "timestamp_updated": 1607489849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "81850493": {"recommendationid": "81850493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026900478", "num_games_owned": 768, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 722, "last_played": 1468768974}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle games are pointless when you can't solve it by yourself.

Having to keep in mind how rotating the world 90 degrees changes everything's perspective and what you're capable of doing one screen to the next lent itself to a great-sounding game I wanted to try for myself. Upon doing so, I can't say I'm surprised by how many layers there are to the puzzle elements, though I really am at a loss for what I could possibly do beyond what I've already figured out by this point. \n\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] \nAt its best, FEZ will perplex and baffle you for a while, but as you start understanding how the game functions and what you're expected to do, you'll begin solving puzzles and fall further down the rabbit hole. This elation is contrasted by the bewilderment and frustration from FEZ's most perplexing and mind-stumping puzzles. On many of the late-game puzzles and secrets, I admit to having no idea where to even begin, and I mean that almost literally. The map showing all the areas gives an indication of whether you've cleared it or not, but even within an area where I know I'm missing something, I can be completely lost as to where I should be looking so I can even try figuring out the puzzle. Some of this is made worse by the fact that although there aren't many moves or mechanics that open up late-game, there's a crucial one that could be hiding an important clue. Additionally, I may have noticed a hint or solution somewhere else in the game, but have no idea where it's supposed to be used.\n\nSince FEZ has a unique style and approach to puzzles, with no prior work from the developer to understand his mindset, I don't think all of his intentions were conveyed clearly to us as players. I'm aware there are guides for all the puzzles in the game, but I don't know if anyone understands where all the solutions were in-game, what the clues were supposed to be that connects those dots. Making a hard puzzle isn't difficult, as all you have to do is tell someone to enter in the correct 6 digit password with the answer hidden 'somewhere,' which should be doable even without the clues because there are only so many possible solutions. Whether they can brute force it and get the solution isn't the issue, because a good puzzle has enough of a basis that a person can understand the problem, work through the clues, and provide the answer. At the very least, have a semblance of what's going on if someone else solves it and offers an explanation. With FEZ, finding the puzzle can be a challenge in itself, let alone figuring out what elements in the game are distractions and which are clues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257030603\n[h1] Controls [/h1] \nThe controls in FEZ center around platforming and rotation, and you can do so with either the keyboard or controller. I never had any problems with the controls responding properly. Moving left and right is done with the 'D-pad,' or 'L joystick' while climbing up and down is done with the same. You'll jump with the 'A' button, and rotating the perspective 90 degrees either direction is done with the 'R and L triggers/bumpers.' Rotation isn't instantaneous, but you can hold it down if you need to turn it more than once. 'Y' bring up your inventory and 'Select' brings up the map screen. 'Start' goes to the main menu. Much later in the game, you can bring up a first-person perspective by pushing in on the 'L joystick.'\n\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] \nYou control Gomez, a young lad who goes to speak with the town's elder, who winds up giving you a nice fez. This innocuous hat winds up opening a whole new dimension, and your task is to learn what's going on with the world and help establish balance. Doing so introduces you to sentient cubes, who want you to collect smaller cubes. Some are found pretty easily, while others require you to backtrack and use what you learn or find in one area in other parts of the game. What will happen when you do as the cubes wish? That's just another part of the mystery.  \n\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1] \nAlthough the deep levels of puzzles are the most impressive part about FEZ, I'd say the graphics are a close second. The environments are whimsical, colorful, and when you look closely, are drawn well. As you find new areas and sub-sections, these areas will develop a theme and aesthetic that creates a different tone for these locations. For instance, I find the place with the owl statues somewhat grim and eerie. Additionally, for the puzzles to work, every background had to be considered from the perspective of rotating the screen 90 degrees, and each setting fits into the next screen cleanly. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2257031132\n[h1] Sound Design [/h1] \nAside from certain events, such as rotating the screen, there aren't many sound effects in FEZ. This leaves plenty of quiet moments for the soundtrack to play out clearly. The music in FEZ is varied, to help fit the different settings you come across. Some have a laid back, calming aspect to them, while others have a slow build-up and almost sounds ominous. The soundtrack is certainly a positive element in FEZ. Going back to the sound effects briefly, when you do find a cube or solve a puzzle, it feels especially triumphant with the accompanying sounds that play. This is a nice emphasis that makes those moments stand out. \n\n\n[h1] Pros [/h1] \n\ud83c\udf1f This game's version of a map gives enough information that it can help you determine where you should be going next or what areas need to be looked over again. For instance, when you fully clear an area, it'll have a gold border. \n\ud83c\udf1f Finding a new area you overlooked before and solving puzzles that confused you earlier provides great \"Eureka\" moments that make solving puzzles so enjoyable. \n\ud83c\udf1f Although FEZ includes platforming, it's basically window-dressing for a gigantic puzzle. \n\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1] \n\u274c Our minds are hard-wired to find patterns and meaning where none exists, and since part of playing FEZ involves searching everywhere for such clues or answers, it's hard to know what falls into that category or not. \"Those blades of grass... they're spaced out in such a way that I could enter this in as an answer somewhere.\" \n\u274c There's no way to take notes or place reminders in-game, and with how labyrinthine FEZ can be, it'd be quite useful. As would being able to teleport from area to area, instead of having to trudge from one place to the next. \n\n\n[h1] Tips [/h1]\n\ud83d\udd0d If you want to solve puzzles on your own instead of resorting to a guide, you'll want to take clear, detailed notes. Taking pictures with a smart phone would be helpful too. \n\ud83d\udd0d Take an occasional break from FEZ, as sometimes stepping away for a short while will let your mind rest, with the puzzle being easier to work out afterwards. \n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] \nFEZ is an incredible puzzle game that shows how creative and interesting puzzle games can be, even for those who wouldn't consider themselves fans of the genre. I've seen many puzzle games that are nothing but the puzzle mechanic, and though it has its place, it reminds me of buying a book of Sudoku, word finds, or crosswords. Why play the video game equivalent, with so much potential for more, if nothing interesting is done with it? FEZ wouldn't have any significance if it were nothing but a series of block-turning puzzles, and I hope others will be inspired by what was done here. I recommend FEZ, as well as whatever guide you use to solve the areas where it becomes too cryptic. \n\n[url=https://saveorquit.com/][quote]Visit Save or Quit for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1602984034, "timestamp_updated": 1608656752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818740487098693848", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77643257": {"recommendationid": "77643257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201403541", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 560, "last_played": 1698491693}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun parkour & problem solving game that was introduced to me because it sounds like my own name!", "timestamp_created": 1602849233, "timestamp_updated": 1602849233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77491948": {"recommendationid": "77491948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067947502", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 574, "last_played": 1450712699}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no te enga\u00f1es t\u00fa tambi\u00e9n has usado la gu\u00eda para entender qu\u00e9 estaba pasando\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1602587360, "timestamp_updated": 1602587360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77411983": {"recommendationid": "77411983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086183516", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1453146434}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Puedo dar fe de que este juego puede llegar a ser tan complejo que simplemente no puedes completarlo, el hecho de convertir un juego 2D en 3D con un simple click es algo de otro nivel, en su momento este juego brillo como era debido y creo que debe seguirlo haciendo, nunca complet\u00e9 el juego tal vez por lo poco paciente que soy pero en ning\u00fan momento pens\u00e9 que fuese un mal juego, todo lo contrario ya que es una incre\u00edble y respetada entrega, un trabajo hermoso e innovador.", "timestamp_created": 1602443291, "timestamp_updated": 1602443291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "77377545": {"recommendationid": "77377545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203726925", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2035, "last_played": 1610505214}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos independientes que he jugado, posee puzzles que var\u00edan entre complejos y simples, siendo los complejos un verdadero dolor de cabeza.

It\u2019s an incredibly unique take on the genre, and unlike any other platformer I have ever played. There are a few shortcomings, but overall it\u2019s a great game.\n\nWhile collectathons have had their unique genre recently stained with grindy open world games, the seemingly endless quest for items in [i]Fez[/i] is actually amazing. You collect cubes which allow you to unlock some areas, where you find more cubes to unlock more areas etc. This is all supported by a neat little tongue-in-cheek story with some some fun and interesting moments. The environments are very nicely detailed and compliment the world Polytron has built. \n\nThe biggest drawback is the secret language spoken by some of the NPC\u2019s, and that inscribed on some statues in the levels. It\u2019s not essential to complete the game, but it still sucks that there is a ton of dialogue that you don\u2019t really get to easily read. Even once you are able to decode it (which I genuinely think is nearly impossible without a hint or guide), you still have to individually translate everything. Would have been so much better if one of the artifacts you pick up automatically translated everything after you input the solution. Keeps the puzzle solving aspect but makes the result more enjoyable. \n\nRegarding the level design, when I started playing [i]Fez[/i], I felt that stress often experienced during metroidvanias where you feel like you\u2019re missing out want to go back. Except turn that feeling up to 100. I kept going through areas and thinking \u201coh man, I missed an exit two levels ago\u2026what if I went the wrong way??\u201d My number one advice to newcomers is to keep pushing through. Just don\u2019t stop exploring. I forced myself to forget about other passages I missed, and it was the best decision I made. Exploring this endless rabbit hole of levels and worlds was addicting and exciting. \n\nThe art style and music is also fantastic. The synthesizer-driven soundtrack by Disasterpiece is heavenly, sharp, dreamy and poignant. Every single track perfectly fits the level you are in. If I had one complaint about the art style, it\u2019s that there are quite a few levels that are just kind of \u201cthere\u201d, and are indistinguishable from other levels. But otherwise, the colours complement the blocky 16-bit feel, and there are so many unique environments.  \n\nI wish the fast travelling was better implemented. It definitely gets better on your second playthrough, once you start to remember where some of the shortcut doors will take you, but I would have liked some kind of additional indicators on the map. Re-platforming some areas can be a slog because the controls aren\u2019t super tight.\n\nI suppose the most frustrating part of the game is the absolute reliance on a walkthrough for a some of the puzzles. There is a whole secret alphabet and numbering system which is incredible\u2026but deciphering it on your own ranges from extremely difficult to nearly impossible. I almost made it through, I probably had to look up 10% of the games secrets, but some of them I wouldn\u2019t have guessed in a hundred years. (And apparently, one of them was guessed at random by the community and there is no proper solution as to what it is.) I will admit, something like that is kind of cool, and very avant-garde. But as someone that just wants to be able to figure stuff out, it\u2019s also annoying lol. \n\nIn the end, I\u2019d give this an 8.3/10. It\u2019s such a great game, but short of being a near-perfect one because of some of those puzzles, back-tracking and the secret language. The last one may seem unfair to call it out, but if you hide a lot of the game behind something that is genuinely difficult to decipher, it\u2019s not so fun.

While Fez can be partially completed (\"the bad ending\" which was still pretty awesome and soul-stirring) without a notebook, you'll probably need one to clear it 100%, which speaks to the depth and creativity of the puzzles.\n\nFez is a unique puzzle-platformer, I want to call it 2.5D but that's not quite accurate.  While the game basically plays as a side-scroller, you can rotate the world 90 degrees along its Z-axis left or right, showing you a new perspective of your surroundings.  The mechanic is employed brilliantly, as puzzles sometimes have you gripping a mechanical wheel and rotating your view, for example, or rotating while jumping on platforms to make moving or rotating platforms correlate with each other differently.  There is a great variety of platform puzzles, perspective puzzles, stacking puzzles, linguistic/crypto puzzles, and a big interconnected series of settings to map out and search for clues and secrets in.  The core of the gameplay loop is exploring and inspecting environments for pieces of cubes, fully assembled cubes unlock doors that grant access to different areas of the game and secret passages that connect them together.\n\nThe gameplay never really gets stale or repetitive, and is consistently a joy to play.  You could sort of consider the game similar to a \"metroidvania\" with the exception that you never obtain any new abilities in the game - which is fine, that's not the focus.  You do however revisit parts of the interwoven stages of the game with a new perspective (hah) on the puzzles.\n\nThe visual design and animation is top-notch and distinctive, with a high-FPS retro pixel vibe that shifts through bright primary colors, eerie monochromes, and subdued muted palettes.  The music is equally well-designed to give each space its own mood and stands up as one of my favorite game soundtracks in this faux lo-fi style that recalls early video games while also making full use of the dynamic range of modern sound hardware, sounding lush and detailed while also recalling that purity of older game music.\n\nThis game is enjoyable for a wide range of ages.  I found it a very high quality gaming experience as an adult, and I've successfully gotten 5-6 year-olds through the game with some coaching.  Fez does not contain any violence at all, although there are a couple sections where you destroy crumbling landscape features with cartoonish bombs that you lift and throw as puzzle elements.  \n\nI've never encountered another game that quite accomplishes what Fez did, it's one of the more unique gaming experiences I've had.  This is a solid full-price purchase if you enjoy puzzle-platformers at all, or if you enjoy metroidvania-style games and are interested in a more chill experience that is not rooted in combat.  Gamers who enjoy exploring and figuring things out for themselves without explicit instructions will enjoy many hours of \"aha\" moments playing Fez, and the Z-axis rotation mechanic quickly becomes natural enough that you'll find yourself using it just as readily as the jump button and thumbstick/D-pad.  Fez is also quite comfortably playable on a keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1600729446, "timestamp_updated": 1600729446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284441947937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "76341327": {"recommendationid": "76341327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025442533", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 191, "last_played": 1600803614}, "language": "english", "review": "I was feeling overwhelmingly nostalgic for this game recently after listening to its OST again, so I decided to write a short review.\n\nDespite a lack of story, this game does an exceptional job at creating a mysterious, disjointed world full of intrigue. To me, the atmosphere and settings tell a story much like the way instrumental music does: it's archetypal, it transcends words. There's abandoned, crumbling industry hinting at civilizations long passed, as well as serene environments illustrating many different eras in which man-made architecture and the natural world collided, all of which now wholly devoid of sentient life again. We have no idea what happened, and the game doesn't make any effort to tell you. There's also the contrast between the small 2D village Gomez comes from, the abandoned \"worlds\" mentioned previously, and [spoiler] the city you eventually stumble upon with the people privy to knowledge of the 3D world [/spoiler]. Many people have claimed that the creator simply failed to write a cohesive narrative for one reason or another, but I'd like to think he kept things intentionally vague and indirect, unlike most games.\n\nWhile on the topic, I don't have much to say about Phil Fish, the developer. Apparently he became very angry at the video game industry and at some point quit altogether. I know very little about other controversies he may have been involved in, but whatever the case, he as person does not impact my view on his game in the slightest.\n\nThe gameplay is very platforming and puzzle-oriented, both of which I'm very fond of. The game's core mechanics that allow you to explore a 3D world through the lens of a 2D being is certainly unique, and is a whole lot of fun. The punishment for death is next to nothing, which encourages trial and error as you attempt to navigate the strange world of FEZ.\n\nI absolutely love great pixel art, and FEZ delivers in this department as well. The landscapes are bright and colorful when they need to be, but also dark and foreboding in other places. Most scenes are also strangely lonely.\n\nAs for the music, Disasterpeace is an incredible individual. He never fails to deliver music that elicits nostalgia and other raw emotions from me, and he absolutely perfectly captures the atmosphere of each setting in FEZ. I can think of few other musicians who similarly are able to auralize such sentimentality for the beautiful landscapes in FEZ. I also love how the music changes with the game's day/night cycle, as well as how the rhythm changes based on certain events or on its own irregular timer.\n\nFinally, there's a lot of additional depth to this game as far as puzzles go, but you're not at all required to figure them out to complete the game. You may attempt to unlock the \"good\" ending if you wish, but these puzzles are so convoluted that the average person will need to look up a guide to complete them.\n\nI played this game years ago, and I still get a little emotional every time I listen to this game's soundtrack. I suppose it's one of those things that you either get engrossed in, or you just get extremely bored.

I definitely recommend this game if you're into platformers, especially 2D platformers. The colourful, pixellated retro graphical style is gorgeous to behold, and the gameplay is simple but fun. What I liked most of all was accessing new areas; the game world is divided into numerous places for you to find, with each of these places grouped together into areas with their own distinct colours and aesthetic.\n\nThere's plenty of collectibles to find, though be warned: if you're aiming for 100% completion, some of the puzzles are very challenging. There's an in-game language and numerical system you have to decode, as well as various puzzles featuring a code based on an old, classic retro game (I won't say which one; I'll leave that for you to figure out). Hell, to be honest I had to look online for some of the solutions! Not that I felt that was too much of a bad thing, personally.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like about this game was the clock room puzzle. I won't say too much about it here, but you may have to tweak your computer's clock in order to speed this one up and get some of the collectibles. I might not be a game designer, but if I was, let's just say that's the sort of puzzle I would not put in a game.\n\nBut other than that, my experience of Fez was very good on the whole.

This is a mind blowing concept and and the developers 100% delivered on it with just about every possible mind blowing puzzle you encounter while playing. The story is very simplistic and that's what is so good about it. Your goal: Get all the golden cubes to stop the world from turning into a black hole.

Another thing that was a bit of a shame was the reutilisation of the same puzzle mechanics, sometimes a bit excessively (for instance : the pillars giving a code when entering in first person view (4 cubes), or the code giving trough stereo audio (4 as well)).

It\u2019s the kind of game that you can only really appreciate if you played many video games and can appreciate when video games stray from their usual path. I want to say that I really hate this game, but that\u2019 only because I have a tendency to finish games like Fez 100% and Fez just didn\u2019t let me do that.\n\n[h1] In a world that is entirely two-dimensional, a three-dimensional object appears [/h1]\n\nFez begins as a simple looking 2D 8-bit pixelated platformer. Gomez (a cute, ghost-like character), lives in a 2D city in the sky with the rest of his neighbors. One day, he gets called to the top of the mountain and there he witnesses a 3D cube. Upon touching the cube a fez (hat) appears from it and lands on Gomez\u2019s head after which the game crashes (not really, but it makes it look like it has crashed) and starts again from the beginning. Gomez starts the game again, except now he has a Fez\u2026 and the power to rotate the world by 90 degrees left or right. While Gomez gains this power and experiences the world as he had never seen it before, something bad had also happened. The object that produced the fez, is now broken and Gomez must gather its many pieces so he can restore it, otherwise the world, as he knows it will come to an end. It\u2019s up to Gomez and his new power to explore his entire world, now from brand new perspectives, and restore the sacred cube. \n\n[h1] When 2D meets 3D and borrows its camera control [/h1]\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to explain how Fez\u2019s unique rotating mechanic work without witnessing it yourself but I will try my best to explain it. Fez is very much a 2D platformer that mostly plays like one. You will have platforms that you can jump on, things you can climb on, doors to enter, things to collect, ledges to drop on, you name it. The controls work well, you don\u2019t have any life bar or lives, there is no game over screen, no bosses, not even a real story. So what\u2019s the catch?\n\nThe catch is, that you wouldn\u2019t be able to progress much in this game if it weren\u2019t for its unique world rotating ability. Remember when Gomez found the fez? The fez game Gomez the power of 3D, however, since he is still in a 2D world, he will still view things in 2D, only he gets to rotate the camera, like you would in a 3D game, in a 90 degree angle and view it again in 2D. I know, I know, it sounds really confusing. \n\nSo, how does this really benefit our hero on his quest? Well, a lot of platforms are unreachable and the only way to get to them is to rotate the world. Once you get to a point where you can no longer progress, it usually means that you need to look at things from a different angle. A long far away floating platform that you can\u2019t reach will become a narrow floating platform close to you simply by rotating the camera. \n\n[h1] Curiosity and exploration are much more important than precision and skill [/h1]\n\nYou may think that just because Fez is a 2D platformer with a twist that you might need to be savvy with games like Mario, but that\u2019s not really the case.There are some sections where you might have to make a precise jump or two but what this game really wants you to do is look EVERYWHERE. If the world of Fez only had one side, like all other 2D platformers, it wouldn\u2019t be anything special, but since Fez has 4 sides, it\u2019s important that you explore all of them. A hidden object just might be behind that wall but you won\u2019t be able to see or collect it unless you look at things from a different angle. There might even be a whole new level or world behind that tree but you won\u2019t be able to see it unless you rotate the world a bit. Fez is also an open world game and it\u2019s one of those open world games where you will have to come back to places you have previously been to. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s pretty amazing how much more lively a 2D world seems when you can look at it from different angles.\n\n[h1] Pick a path and just wing it, then do it again from a different path [/h1]\n\nDespite being a short game, Fez is surprisingly non-linear. When you enter a new zone, you will see lots of paths that will each lead you to a different location and each of those locations will end with a cube reward. Once you find the cube, you normally get a small warp portal that will transport you back to the central zone and from there you will just go back and try a different direction. This would really confusing if it weren\u2019t for the game\u2019s decent map. The map will highlight places you visited and the places you completed fully, which really helps, but it will also mock you\u2026\n\n[h1] I hated the puzzles [/h1]\n\nWhile most cubes are out in the open or hidden at the end of levels, some of them are hidden behind cryptic puzzles. Sometimes you will enter a room that seemingly has nothing but drawing and junk in it and yet you will know that something is hidden there. Such rooms require you to rotate the room a certain number of times and in certain directions (kind of like opening an old safe) in order to get a reward. I really hated these because usually you would have to really think outside of the box. One puzzle had my controller vibrate on both left and right side and I had to feel which sides I needed to rotate and in which order. Another time, I got a barcode on screen and after scanning it, my phone told me the location. Another time, there was a poster with hidden arrows I had to follow in order to get a cube. I know these might sound creative, but for someone who wanted to complete the game a 100%, I just got frustrated whenever I stumbled upon one of these rooms because often, I just didn\u2019t get what Phil Fish (the developer) wanted me to do. Yes, I say Phil Fish because these puzzles felt, well, personal. I always felt like the game held something away from me and I had to discover it and the game would open up more, but that never happened, or at least, not during my play through. \n\nBy definition, this should be brilliant game design and, it kind of is, yet, it frustrated me so much. I mean: \u201cCMON PHIL, JUST LET ME GET THAT CUBE. WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WANT ME TO BANG MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL BEFORE I FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY YOU WERE THINKING\u201d, but I digress. \n\nLuckily, I didn\u2019t need to collect everything in the game in order to finish it so I just ended it as soon as I gathered enough cubes.\n\n[h1] I\u2019m not sure if I actually liked Fez but I really think everyone should experience it at least once [/h1]\n\nHonestly, I am really happy I got the play a game like Fez. Even though it came out almost a decade ago, there still really isn\u2019t anything like it out there. I would have preferred it the game didn\u2019t have so many cryptic puzzles and if the world wasn\u2019t so open but it was a really good experience for me and I certainly don\u2019t regret playing and finishing it. \n\nI think that if you are someone who likes video games in general that you will most certainly find something to enjoy in Fez. You can argue whether or not the game is good or fun but, one thing is for sure: this game is very unique. \n\nNext game: Fieldrunners\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075061111/recommended/209690/\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

You play as a white figure donning the titular FEZ, which gives you the ability to rotate the enviroment around you. What do I mean?\n\nThe environments are 3D, but you can only see two dimensions on screen at any given time. With the FEZ equipped you can change the 2D enviroment into a different side of the three dimensional structure.\n\nWith that out of the way, why do I not enjoy it?\nIt's definetly a charming puzzle game and everyone, who enjoys a good puzzle game will enjoy it... until a certain point, that is.\nYou see halfway through the game, FEZ decides to turn into one of those mysteriously cryptic games, that people need years to solve. The puzzles become so cryptic, in fact, that  backtracking becomes a necessary and tedious feature. This is bad, because your character isn't exactly a master of traversal.\n\nSecondly, the game has such a lack of direction, that you can get lost very easily. Again, this is not good, seeing as your character isn't Sonic the Hedgehog. It's ok for a game to not give you directions, but all games have at the very least some semblance of where you're supposed to go: A map with a blank unexplored spot or some torches leading you in the correct direction. FEZ has none of that.\n\nThirdly the game requires pretty advanced knowledge of cryptography to actually be completed. This isn't stated anywhere on the games store page and feels like a scam. There are also a few QR codes to scan, so sorry for people, who don't have smartphones.\n\nEDIT: It's been a few years, and I apologize for the harsh tone of the review. I've since grown up a bit, and I just wanted to add, that FEZ is a game made with a lot of love, and you still may enjoy it, especially if you take my warning, and already have some cryptography knowledge/are willing to spend the time to learn it to go on this game's eccentric journey.\n\n[h3]Much Love To Phil Fish, For Trying Something New And Playing Such An Intergral Role in Indie Game History With This Release, (Even If I Didn't Like It, Personally)![/h3]", "timestamp_created": 1593102491, "timestamp_updated": 1664827562, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486270040273666382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71303108": {"recommendationid": "71303108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012592964", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 917, "last_played": 1539146864}, "language": "english", "review": "Just not very satisfying to play.

I think this can all be boiled down into one core sentiment: I don't think FEZ respects your time in the slightest.\n\nFEZ has its place in gaming history, with a \"love-to-hate-him\" developer and puzzles that took a dedicated community ages to figure out.

Perspective shift is one of the most unique mechanics in gaming and makes for some interesting and extremely satisfying to solve puzzles. \n\nA lot of the secrets require understanding the Fezian language to solve which the game finds some interesting ways to help translate but unless you're really really smart and playing with a laser-sharp, microscopic focus you're unlikely to figure out on your own. Couple of puzzles are agonizingly difficult and/or the solutions are obtuse but you can find enough to complete the game easily on your own, the design is generous in that way. \n\nAnother sticky point is the black holes that randomly spawn blocking are sometimes a challenging obstacle to work your way around but more often than not they're perfectly block your only route to progress and become an annoying design choice causing nothing but frustration, forcing you to exit and return to the area (sometimes more than once) to remove them. But aside from these nitpicks it's a beautiful game that is just joyful to explore and uncover. The soundtrack hits right in the nostalgia, instant favorite and goes a long way in elevating the experience.\n\nI think the whole 2D character being given a 3D perspective is an analogy for us humans being 3D creatures stuck with limited perception in a 4D universe. The endings (yes there's an alternate one) might not be to everyone's liking but I found it pretty deep and thought provoking.\n\nEDIT: Additional thoughts after 100% in NG+. I was wrong, the game is definitely not short, it's  massive. It's surprising how much is kept hidden for players that come back for a 2nd playthrough (including yet another entirely new perspective to see the environments in)", "timestamp_created": 1590067818, "timestamp_updated": 1590097830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69530660": {"recommendationid": "69530660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198828658607", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1623770663}, "language": "english", "review": "Regardless of what you feel about it's creator, FEZ is a game that just oozes quality with its masterful game design and stellar presentation.", "timestamp_created": 1590050696, "timestamp_updated": 1590050696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464654475450515747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69449868": {"recommendationid": "69449868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090503501", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1647449381}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING", "timestamp_created": 1589935282, "timestamp_updated": 1589935282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69439168": {"recommendationid": "69439168", "author": {"steamid": "76561199056168291", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 257, "last_played": 1590262637}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm very new to gaming and this is very forgiving in terms of movement and making mistakes.", "timestamp_created": 1589918254, "timestamp_updated": 1589918254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69328294": {"recommendationid": "69328294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259998907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1613435214}, "language": "english", "review": ": )", "timestamp_created": 1589747155, "timestamp_updated": 1589747155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69320081": {"recommendationid": "69320081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153180766", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 854, "last_played": 1589739072}, "language": "english", "review": "really nice recommend", "timestamp_created": 1589737323, "timestamp_updated": 1589737323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69224621": {"recommendationid": "69224621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210711707", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 364, "last_played": 1683273510}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most beautiful games I have played so far.", "timestamp_created": 1589620253, "timestamp_updated": 1612731556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560563385486602783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69102055": {"recommendationid": "69102055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376315304", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1070, "last_played": 1589434103}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego, con unos puzzles muy buenos, y un plataformeo exigente, pero no imposible.

Aside from its mind-twisting multiperspective world, it presents its lingo through coruscating ciphers that require a colossal deal of perception to be interpreted. What astonishes me the most is the way its multidimensional level design encourages your imagination to utilize its bizarre physics and anomalous structures so as to proceed from point A to point B.\n\nGomez\u2014the main protagonist\u2014serves as the pivotal axis in the middle of a 3D world presented in a 2D vista. To him and his folks, it\u2019s mythical to accept any platonic solid delineated within the Metatron\u2019s cube\u2014it\u2019s just beyond their belief and dimension. The story kicks off when you cross path with Geezer\u2014the previous Fez Guy\u2014who will pass to you something special that allows you to experience the third dimension. Subsequently, a sentient Hypercube is revealed to summon Gomez and bequest him the Fez, but due to abstruse cosmic instability, the Hexahedron shatters into teensy cubic bits across the world.\n\nNow, the stability of space rests on your shoulders, as the world will suffer a catastrophe unless you find those bits and integrate them back into the singular cube. With the help of Dot\u2014your four-dimensional tesseract companion\u2014you must navigate through the dazzling levels of the game to collect those bits using your new ability granted from the golden cube. As simple as the prime game idea seems, it is quite perplexing and is all about perception. You shift the dimensional plane 90 degrees around the vertical axis in opposite directions to find a fitting plane to your perspective to create a genuine platforming route for your character to navigate through.\n\nLet me elaborate more: imagine two 3D columns next to each other viewed from a 2D perspective. Each column has a platform at one of their sides obscured due to dual dimensional limitations. You have to revolve the landscape 90 degrees clockwise or anti-clockwise parallel to the horizon plane to reveal those hidden platforms to navigate through the two columns. Well, that's very straightforward until the game adds optical illusions to the mix\u2014now, things get really interesting. Illusive tricks play a twisting role when you shift to different planes in which the objective is to make a traversable path by rotating and connecting disconnected structures.\n\nFor instructions and communication, the game presents its language and tetromino signs as enigmas for you to decode. To me, I find that decrypting the ZU letters can be a conundrum, provided that English isn't your native language, as the clue presented in the scenery depends on your knowledge of holoalphabetic sentences. It's substantial to understand the ZU letters and symbols, since they play a crucial role in most of the game's riddles. FEZ is flooded with mysteries. Exploration, deep cogitation, and analysis is a must to unveil them.\n\nThe puzzles and secrets in FEZ are truly presented in an unprecedented manner; it can go as far as decompiling the executable file of the game to reveal a hidden secret in its finale. What blew me away was the way FEZ tied itself with reality by offering puzzles that require QR scanners to be solved; I didn't expect this level of idiosyncrasy. Eliminating the death penalty in case of failure is a good move by the developers to avoid any frustrations and to encourage confident experimentation.\n\nFrom an artistic scope, FEZ's vivid conglomeration of 8-bit colors splendidly creates a lekker outlook. Sometimes, I had to stop for a while to admire the bewitching landscapes surrounding Gomez. By mixing classical retrospective visual style with decent old-school music, FEZ offers a sterling opportunity to experience the past in the future.\n\n[b]- Flaws:[/b]\n\nThe lack of a story is disappointing. Adding a genuine tale would have taken this game to a completely new stage. It would have been very fulfilling to link solving puzzles with a compelling story. Don't get me wrong though, there is a story, but it's very primitive and doesn't have any excitement in it. The map layout in FEZ is discombobulating and lacks details or even labels for its locations.\n\n[b]> Verdict:[/b]\n\nFEZ splendidly seduces the player to fall in love with it by its brilliant puzzles, cryptic atmosphere, charming sights, and simple view-shifting mechanics. It never fails to make the player feel satisfied after passing an obstacle, unveiling a secret, or solving a riddle. The principal concept of FEZ is how it incentivizes the player to think out of the box. It also sheds light on some thought-provoking questions: What if a 3rd-dimensional being experiences the full potential of the multidimensional space? Will it allow him to achieve terminal knowledge of the universe? Or will space glitch like it did in Donnie Darko? I guess we will never know for sure...\n\n[h1][b][u]Aspects Rating[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[b]General Quality (60% Overall Score):[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Technical Optimization: 10\n[*]Controls: 10\n[*]Graphics: 9\n[*]Audio: 10\n[*]Soundtrack: 9\n[/list]\n\n[b]Single-player (40% Overall Score):[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay Satisfaction: 10\n[*]Level Design: 10\n[*]Story: 4\n[*]Character Design: 7\n[*]Dialogue: 6\n[*]Replay Value: 7\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b][u]Overall Score[/u][/b][/h1]\n\n[quote][b]9[/b][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1587333207, "timestamp_updated": 1628202643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695351898670196533", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "67620418": {"recommendationid": "67620418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010878481", "num_games_owned": 1089, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 730, "last_played": 1587295531}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing atmosphere.

Manipulate the environment to find all the mystical cubes.\n\n[h1]Story & Characters [b]9/10[/b][/h1]\nFez is a nice and unique story about discovering new dimensions, You play as Gomez who has lived in a 2D world for all his life, You are invited to come to the top of the town, and there a cube appears, It starts spinning and teleports you to a strange area where a cube talks to you in in a strange alphabet, You get a Fez which enables you to rotate the perspective, and by doing so you destroy the cube and crash the game, You get set back to the main menu and the game will start like it did before, Only this time you can rotate from the beginning.\n\nOnce you step outside a 4D hypercube called Dot appears stating that something is terribly wrong, The Hexahedron has been destroyed and all its fragments are scattered and without it everything will collapse. He goes on to say that you have received a gift, A great secret has been reveiled to you, You are the only one who can access these other dimensions. And with that he implies you are the only one who can save the world. Dot continues to explain some basic game mechanics and he will continue to guide you on your journey.\n\n[h1]Gamemodes & Gameplay [b]10/10[/b][/h1]\nFez is a single player exploring game with very unique game mechanics. You play the game in 2D, but the world is 3D and you can turn everything in steps of 90 degrees. There are collectables around every corner and some are behind some true mindbending puzzles, The game has its own Alphabet, A lot of secrets where you just have to enter a button sequence in certain rooms. It is pretty tough, but it creates a very nice mixed gameplay of exploring, collecting and solving puzzles. \n\nYou need to collect 32 Golden cubes, You can find them whole, but quite a few are in pieces of 8, Then there are 32 antimatter cubes, which are always whole but a lot harder to find, Then there are 3 red cubes which are the hardest to find. The game also has Artifacts and Treasure maps which will help you on your journey to find every cube. You travel from area to area using doors, Some are locked but you can use any key you find to unlock them. Some doors are locked behind a total number of cubes, But in general you can move pretty freely.\n\nThe game has only 1 gamemode, But after you complete the game you can start a new game plus which does not reset any progress,but does unlock a first person perspective, So you can actually look around and find more things that where hidden from you before, The nice 3D map makes it pretty clear in which areas you are missing stuff, So it is not like you are searching for a needle in a haystack, But you are certainly going to need your brain to figure out this game. The game even has a few mysteries that have not been solved untill this day, by anyone. \n\nThe platforming is no challenge at all. The game is very relaxing, If you die or fall you respawn on the spot, It is very forgiving, The hardest part of the game are the puzzles, but you can take your time or skip it if you don't feel like it. Everything in this game feels optional, You are free to go wherever you want and do as you wish. which is pretty great.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Soundtrack [b]9/10[/b][/h1]\nIt has very nice pixel graphics, Very colorful with diverse areas which are well decorated and feel very alive, It looks a bit strange in the first person perspective but that is already way more than I ever expected from a game like this. The soundtrack is great, It has a lot of variation in tunes and enhances the game with every step you take. The animations are also beautiful, It is all very geometrical, But I think it is almost an art on itself\n\nThere is a lot of geometrical art in the game, Like animated shapes that loop in on themselfes, infinite zoom illusions, etc. It uses a lot of color and somehow this fits the game just right, It is a journey about multiple dimensions, and I think this game is a good representation of how additional spacial dimensions past the third would look to us. I think the idea is great and it has been executed wonderfully.\n\n[h1]Performance & Support [b]8/10[/b][/h1]\nThe game performs great, The FPS is locked which can be bad for very low spec systems. But I had no performance issues. I also had no crashes or other issues. It ran at a solid 120fps from beginning to end. If I have to make a remark, I feel the loading screens are a bit long, There is no random generation, I don't see why there is a loading screen in the first place. But it is not that long, It is just strange.\n\n[h1]Endgame & Replayability [b]7/10[/b][/h1]\nI do think all the secrets help here, There is a lot of mystery to the game. Sadly the game is pretty short, Surely collecting all collectables will take you a few hours but there is literally nothing to do once you collected all collectables next to revisit the world you already fully explored. There is a new game + but it does not offer anything new next to a camera angle, One you need to collect all collectables. It even lets you keep the collectables I do not really see it as a new game plus, More as a continue or clean up mode. You can ofcourse start a new game, But knowing the puzzles the challenge is gone. The game is amazing, But it is amazing to experience, not one to keep playing.\n\n[h1]Conclusion [b]9/10[/b][/h1]\nI really love Fez, It is a nice story, with nice pixel art and very unique game mechanics, If you like relaxing platformers with a heavy focus on exploring and solving puzzles you will love this game, and even if you don't like any of those genres, Fez truly is amazing. You will probably enjoy it. It is short, and not great in replayability, But it offers an unique experience everyone should have played in my opinion.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35216846/][h1]Follow my Curator Page for more Reviews like these[/h1][/url][/quote]\n\n[h1]Game Info[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]# of players[/td]\n\t[td]Single Player Only[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Steam Cloud Save[/td]\n\t[td]Working fine[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Controller Support[/td]\n\t[td]Yes, Xbox One Bluetooth Working[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Achievements[/td]\n\t[td]Pretty easy[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]FPS on Ultra 1080P[/td]\n\t[td]Locked to refresh rate[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Ram Usage[/td]\n\t[td]600mB[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Installed Size[/td]\n\t[td]420MB[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Launch Command[/td]\n\t[td]gamemoderun %command%[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Issues[/td]\n\t[td]None[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Operating System & Hardware[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]OS[/td]\n\t[td]Arch Linux[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Kernel[/td]\n\t[td]5.5.9[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]DE[/td]\n\t[td]Gnome 3.36[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]CPU[/td]\n\t[td]Intel I7-6800K Hexa Core @ 4.2 Ghz[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]GPU[/td]\n\t[td]Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 (Nvidia 440.64 Drivers)[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1584119631, "timestamp_updated": 1584120560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819411993026733398", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "64748485": {"recommendationid": "64748485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100002788", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 399, "last_played": 1587963903}, "language": "english", "review": "Astonishingly beautiful game that reveals its bogglingly labyrinthine nature the longer you play.

Let's get down to it:\n\n[quote=Murderous Mammons]Spin, twist, and flip... a pervert at every turn... on this god-fricking menage I haven't banged anyone...[/quote]\n\nYou probably heard about this one, but if this review may be of use, then let's consider it otherwise. Fez is part of what could be called the Chaotic Trinity of indie forerunners (FEZ being the Chaotic-Neutral of them), back when Edmund McMillen was just another brick in the wall, Phil Fish decided to take a dip in the shark-infested waters of PC-gaming to realize the work of a lifetime. If I told you that here you play as a square-shaped kid who plays the drums and lives in a vertical village in the likes of a Ghibli film... you might think this will be your average colorful adventure platformer, right? Well, [b]WRONG[/b]!\nIf you are used to the afore-mentioned genres, this is [u]not[/u] your average everything there... FEZ unfolds like that quiet kid in school who gets cornered by bullies and suddenly rips them apart, and that is a major positive feature of the game. You can expect to jump a lot in these surreal landscapes, although it may not be as hard as his Chaotic-Evil cousin Super Meat Boy. Gomez greatest challenges lie in the search for fragments of the mysterious Tetragrammaton to restore order to his dimension [spoiler]under the guidance of none other than a little tesseract[/spoiler], and quite a few others just because he can, he is the guy with the FEZ after all.\nEven to my addicted puzzle taste, this game is quite strong, ranging from simple decryption puzzles to ludicrous binary and hexadecimal sequences... I'm gonna be honest here, after two entire years I gave in and sought help for the last two secrets, without any regret since those solutions were so above human level, that I still believe that no one has actually solved them to this day, aside from data miners who pulled them from the source code. If that doesn't discourage your interest then you won't play anything like this elsewhere... My only gripe about it is the fact that Phil Fish hanged his keyboards after some unprecedented flaming and we might never see a sequel. Till then, we keep the old [i]Spin, twist and flip[/i].\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Feature[/th]\n        [th]Rating[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Length[/td]\n        [td]10-12 hours... or was it years?[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Difficulty[/td]\n        [td]There should be a health warning about it[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]Colorful Peaceful Pixels[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music[/td]\n        [td]Sci-fi, Lo-fi, Laid back chiptunes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]Get this cool cap and go save the universe, lad![/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Closest Thing[/td]\n        [td]Jonathan Blow's second project, The Witness[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]TL-DR: To this day this is the only way to experience Phil Fish's unique genius.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1579127482, "timestamp_updated": 1579127842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580736815929412842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61807666": {"recommendationid": "61807666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061068287", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 128, "last_played": 1580082175}, "language": "english", "review": "Separate the art from the artist; Fez is a great game with fun mechanics!", "timestamp_created": 1578941511, "timestamp_updated": 1578941511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61772616": {"recommendationid": "61772616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009357794", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 781, "last_played": 1637036230}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic new take on classic puzzle solving platforming.\n\nChill, tranquil, nice vibe, ambience, and music.", "timestamp_created": 1578873441, "timestamp_updated": 1578873441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61756648": {"recommendationid": "61756648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296822011", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 123, "last_played": 1589696274}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game that adds a new twist to the usual side scroller game, also incredible soundtrack, worth buying just to listen.", "timestamp_created": 1578850472, "timestamp_updated": 1578850472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61751781": {"recommendationid": "61751781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969356078", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1233, "last_played": 1698930920}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming and engaging.\n", "timestamp_created": 1578844781, "timestamp_updated": 1578844781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61716748": {"recommendationid": "61716748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256400968", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1198, "last_played": 1684449840}, "language": "english", "review": "FEZ is a stunning example of a game taking its mechanics and pushing them to the limit to bring an interesting perspective (no pun intended) to the player.\n\nThis is a game that I have been wanting to play for a while, and my friend gifted it to me over Christmas.

exactly how to feel about this game. This is gonna be a long one.\n\nI'm sure the main mechanic of rotating a 2D world in 3D was very novel at the time, and platforming around is very satisfying, but while I play I get this constant feeling that I'm completely lost, stumbling through the game without actually doing anything worthwhile, and overall just doing everything wrong.\n\nSo, this game is full of secrets and sprawling worlds that have multiple exits. What I did was just keep going forward, entering every door and collecting every little cube I found. I even figured out one of the easier puzzles and got an anti-cube. Though once I got enough cubes to unlock every door in the main room, it suddenly hit me that now I needed to go back. I had no idea where I was spacially, and the map was of little help because of how much information it displays, and the sheer number of nodes and secret exits. Eventually, I found the way back not because I knew where to go, but because I kept trying different ways and found it by accident.\n\nWhen entering the cube doors, I found that behind them was a single room, and that confused me a lot. That cant be it, right? Before now, every room had hundreds of different places to go, and now that I got some cubes, I unlocked these tiny islands with a few more? And whats up with the cryptic language and Tetris pieces everywhere? I found a QR code in a room, finally thought I might solve one thing in this game, but even after adding the parts that were missing from it, the code was still incomplete and unreadable.\n\nThese puzzles have layers and layers of complexity to them, and when I keep going and do some more dumb platforming, I know I'll never solve anything, and that I'm experiencing the game wrong. I should be ashamed! The graphics and music and world are so beautiful though, that's a looooot of effort that went into this! I bought this on sale so I spent like what, a dollar on it? I truly cannot say if it was worth it or not. I've never played a game that made me feel so crappy and yet so engaged at once.\n\nAll that said, I recommend it purely because the experience itself is enjoyable enough, and this game truly made me think about a lot of things. All these conflicted opinions aside, this will probably be a blast for you if you're a fan of platformers, or cryptic puzzle games. As someone who thought they liked these kinds of puzzles, I'm seriously reconsidering.

Most puzzles have to be solved after getting an understanding a new form of language that the game made. I'm not even joking. One of the puzzles actually makes you pick up cryptic bread crumbs and a ROSETTA STONE. Of course you can just look up the answers to that puzzle online but completing this game isn't very fun when you reach the point where half of your time while playing is alt-tabbed. There were only a handful of collectibles that felt gratifying to collect (i.e QR Code and Time-Anti Cubes with the PC's internal clock) but it could barely feel good collecting them when there were twice as many annoying ones as there were fun ones.\n\nSpoilers for end of the game: [spoiler] You can't get the \"true?\" ending on the first run. To get to the true ending you must collect all 64 main cubes. The first 32 are pushovers so I can understand why the game would end at that point but the first ending feels so unsatisfying. I'm not joking. It shows all your collectibles, shows the ones you're missing, and plays a drug induced hallucination scene. So after collecting 32 annoying cubes, or less if you got some extra before the first ending, you get to the true ending. In this one you watch the big cube at the beginning become complete then another crazy hallucination plays again before the credits roll. At least Gomez played the drums in first ending. This true one might be worse which is why I put some quotes on it earlier. It was just so ridiculous.

Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best games I've ever played. But I feel like some parts of this puzzle game aren't meant to be solved. I've been searching for years to find an actual puzzle game, after breezing through Portal 1 & 2 and The Turing Test, I came across FEZ. FEZ is the most challenging puzzle game I've seen since I picked up Mega Man. This Pixelate jigsaw puzzle had my desk full of sketches trying to figure out their puzzles. When I figured out just one meaningless puzzle, such as decoding Tetris shapes to make out \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\", it was one of the most satisfactory feelings ever. My first run of the game (100%), I spent 4 hours figuring out the easy puzzles, with me questioning why people are complaining why it's so hard. When I finished the game, the ending confused me. I'm not going to spoil it, but it didn't all add up. It felt like I was only halfway done with the game, even though my save file said 100% complete. There was a whole 35 more puzzles that took me either minutes to figure out one, or one taking hours of making real-life 3d paper shapes to even understand how a clue helped me in a puzzle. Most of those secrets I found by myself, with dedicating my whole day to figure out one puzzle. But some puzzles seem like they don't want to be solved. The developers thought that this wasn't too hard of a game, since they already knew the answers to the puzzles. But there's one puzzle that no-one ever figured out, and brute-forced every possible combination of inputs to solve it. To this day, nobody knows why the solution is what it is. But this game changed my life, and made me think more logically and outside the box than I'd ever think would be possible.

The game is about a cute little boy that one day becomes the holder of a fez, which gives him the ability to switch perspectives in what was first believed to be a fully 2D world. Most of the puzzles revolve around this mechanic; being able to switch perspectives in a 3D world while only having a 2D perspective. Together with the beautiful graphics and amazing soundtrack performed by Disasterpeace, (also known for their work on Hyper Light Drifter) makes for a game worth buying.\n\nThough the game offers a little more than that. It's also filled with mysteries and more puzzles that are layers and layers deep. That makes uncovering mysteries and finding out solutions all the more satisfying as you scribble and analyze the notes that you made throughout playing the game like a mad scientist (it's highly recommended to keep some notes with you if you're planning on taking all puzzles by yourself).\n\nThe puzzles can sometimes be a little too deep/hard for it's own good. Seriously, as a consequence there is a puzzle in this game that no one ever before has properly solved. It was only solved thanks to a hint from the development team. Even with this hint, the solution was only found through a mass attempt at brute forcing a code required to solve the puzzle. A theory to the solution is out there though, one that has yet to be confirmed by the devs. Perhaps the point of this puzzle was exactly what happened; the community coming together to solve the puzzle.\n\nAnyway, I digress. What mostly has kept me enthousiastic about this game and even made me come back to it after 5-6 years is the layers deep mysteries but also the very calming atmosphere the game has (no enemies, no stressful situations). It offers some kind of immersion, the game sucks you in.

Who ever could'a thunk up such a thing? Why, Mr Phil Fish, that's who! \n\n   What's a \"Phil Fish\", you ask? Where's your head been the last decade or so: in a hole in a desert someplace? Shame on you. No Fez review could be complete without mentioning its ever-fascinating creator...so let's talk Fish, shall we?\n\n   I like Phil Fish. I really, really like Phil Fish. In fact, I probably like Phil Fish more than I like his game, and I [i]do[/i] like Fez: even if I've started it twice now, just to lose interest part-way through each time (more [i]my[/i] fault than the game's, methinks). It's certainly not my usual kind of game - it's non-violent, for starters - but if ever there was a shameless labour of love, this would be it. [i]So[/i] much love from Mr Phil Fish; yet so much hate [i]for[/i] Mr Phil Fish, from so much of the so-called gaming \"community\". \n\n   Actually, that's rather cynical of me. I shouldn't put the word \"community\" in inverted commas, because communities [i]always[/i] have their own peculiar forms of witch-burning, don't they? And Phil, in the eyes of many, became a witch. Oh, how they hated Phil Fish, boys and girls. But why? [i]Why[/i] did the gamers come to hate Phil Fish so much, oh humble reader?\n\n   Anyone who's watched Indie Game: The Movie as many times as I have - which is a lot! - will know that Phil Fish is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve. Whether his heart is in the mood to embrace other hearts, or wants to \"cold-blooded f*cking murder\" all other hearts in the room...there it is, bleeding all over his shirt. And we gamers - and indeed, most human beings on the planet - not only hate and despise people who wear their hearts on their sleeves, but feel a need to BURN THEM like THE EVIL WITCHES THAT THEY ARE. How dare someone announce a game, get us all hot and bothered, then take [i]years[/i] to finesse it into a quality product that shedloads of people can now enjoy? The cheek of it.\n\n   Shame on you, Phil Fish. Shame on you. And shame on Renaud for helping you take so many years to finish it. Why, a mega-corporation with a design and programming team of a hundred people could easily have pumped out a game in [i]four-fifths[/i] of the time it took the two of you to make one lousy, if lovingly-rendered, little pixel game. Shame on you for not employing another ninety-eight people to help you get this game out quicker to the jaded, frothy-mouthed masses of fat, bearded fan-boys in Gamer-land (like me). I hope you both writhe on [i]flaming stakes[/i] for your crimes against humanity.\n\n   You let down every single gamer-boy and gamer-gal on the planet who couldn't wait an extra couple of years for you to finish your painstakingly detailed retro tribute to all the games you grew up loving. Your heartfelt homage to games from the 1980s became hopelessly dated in the interminable wait from 2007 through to the eventual release date in 2012. Thanks to you guys, lonely bedroom warriors had to find [i]other stuff[/i] to do in those intervening years, like, erm...playing other video games, I guess. The [i]nerve[/i] of you guys!\n\n   Damn you both to Eternal Damnation for what you did to those people. And damn you doubly, Phil Fish, for then refusing to bring out a Fez 2 to appease those very same scorned gamers who decided to forgive your sins against humanity after the game eventually got released and turned out to be pretty good after all. Thanks to you, they have nothing to look forward to or express anger towards, because the world really is a very sad and Fez-less place now that you, Mr Phil Fish, selfish so-and-so that you are, have decided that you have no desire to make another Fez game. Surely you aren't labouring under the misapprehension that your life is one to be lived by and for [i]yourself[/i], as opposed to being born to serve the whims of these far superior, couch-clad beings?\n\n   YOU, SIR PHIL FISH, ARE A DISGRACE TO HUMANITY.\n\n   ...\n\n   Oh yeah, the game. It's pretty good, actually. Charming, unique, with a very groovy world-rotating mechanic that cleverly comments on the way that some people see the world as a far more limited place than the three-dimensional one that lies just outside their front door.\n\n   Waitaminute...Phil Fish...you mischief-making gremlin, you! You weren't making a comment about stereotypical [i]gamers[/i], were you, Phil Fish? You cheeky, clever man! There we were, deriding you all along, when the joke was actually on [i]us[/i]! Now all we need to do is watch a film like Zero Charisma, and we would all implode from the self-revelation that maybe, just maybe, we're [i]not[/i] the impeccable, irreproachable creatures we all previously envisioned ourselves as. Maybe, deep down inside, we're just like you, Phil Fish. Flawed. [i]Human[/i]. Say it ain't so, Mr Phil Fish. Say it ain't so...\n\n   Oh, and by-the-by, I will endeavour to finish this game some day. It just hasn't been the right \"timing\" for me, but I'm sure that day will come. [i]One[/i] day. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it right now, if it sounds like something you're currently in the mood for.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\u200b\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\u200b\nCheers!)", "timestamp_created": 1562566359, "timestamp_updated": 1562567474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058493137359619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "53918157": {"recommendationid": "53918157", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967081018", "num_games_owned": 3697, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1483824355}, "language": "english", "review": "A mind blowing experience both times I've played through it.

Changing perspective allows you to use the terrain to get to places you wouldn't be able to get to normally - it's amazing how well they implemented this. It's presented very simply where you basically jump in and get started, story is minimal and it's all about the fantastic exploration where your curiosity drives you forward.\n\nThe map is pretty big with a bunch of rooms that connect to each other in a particular layout, and you can only tell if you've collected everything in a room if it shows up as gold on the map. Each room is unique and it is a blast to explore every room and attempt to 100% it.\n\nWith that being said, the game is virtually non-100%able if you don't use a guide for certain rooms, as the game features it's own cryptic language to decipher and rooms that any regular person would not figure out in any timely kind of manner. This was a big turn-off for me since I don't like to spoil myself or use guides, but when I learned what you needed to do, I felt no shame since the game was not meant for a NORMAL person to 100% (the save file actually tracks to around 214%, this is what I'm referring to by 100%).\n\nWith all that said, I still recommend it as you can get it for very cheap, and it was still an excellent, UNIQUE experience that I'm glad to have experienced.
