I pre-ordered it after I connected with the devs prior game, Everlasting Summer. Naturally, that game was the point of comparison to this one.\n\nI'll start with the things I enjoyed about this game.\nThe visuals and music are both very well done, and are very effective at selling the atmosphere of the game. The few lyrical tracks were a highlight.\nThe games choices are very well designed, and you can intuitively and easily get onto the route of your choice.\nUnfortunately that is where my positive things to say ends.\n\nThis game does not have four routes, it has two. The girls are paired off into their own routes, and they only diverge in the epilogue. What this means is that you'll pick one route (for this example, we'll say Ellie) and you end up spending half of the games runtime with a character you most likely do not care about (Kagome).\n\nAnd the only reason that is a problem is because of the character writing. Characters are given one (usually archetypal) character trait, and past that have zero consistent writing or psychology. The story's plot is driven solely by artificial conflict caused by the characters seemingly deciding to act a certain way with no explanation, as every single conversation devolves into circular arguments where none of the characters even attempt explain themselves.\n\nThis problem also extends to the main character, which seems to be the main complaint looking at other reviews. And, yeah, he is insufferable, again solely to move the plot forward. Everlasting Summer had a main character that was sometimes insufferable as well, but that played into the core plot of the game, which was about the MC growing as a person. There is no such plot in this game.\n\nWhat disappointed me the most was the absolutely insane tonal dissonance during my first playthrough, which was Ellie's route. I played the Demo of the game, liked her the best (love band storylines), and pre-ordered the game. I still quite like the first opening act of the game, where you essentially pick the route you take. It's light and kind of fluffy, the tone I'd expect from a romance visual novel. But as soon as i got into the meat of the games routes, and the circular argumentative dialogue begins, the fun band storyline I wanted is abruptly and messily intercut with [spoiler] the KGB is monitoring me, a man has been kidnapped [/spoiler] , only for when I lock into a single characters route to have all that sloppily dropped in an instant.\n\nThe epilogue for Ellie's route had its own issues as well, stemming from the same issues the rest of the game has, and that is it's need for pointless conflict to drive the plot forward. It brings up incredibly serious subject matter with absolutely zero tact or care, seemingly to try to shock you into getting invested.\n\nAnd funnily enough, I got to the ending of the route, and I liked it. It fit the tone the start of the game had, which makes me believe they had the endings and act 1 written first, and then desperately scrambled to make all the routes fit together, making this incomprehensible slurry of plot points and nonexistent motivations.\n\ntl;dr: Overly-long, poorly written routes and characters, and generally less charming or enjoyable than Everlasting Summer.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever lock in to finish all the routes of this game, but between my sheer disappointment and how obnoxiously long these routes are, it won't be anytime soon.", "timestamp_created": 1699561845, "timestamp_updated": 1699561845, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530871450901031494", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149541481": {"recommendationid": "149541481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198833180630", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1677, "last_played": 1699358024}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u044b \u043e\u0431\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u042d\u043b\u0438", "timestamp_created": 1699130986, "timestamp_updated": 1699131002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183186769485474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "149075021": {"recommendationid": "149075021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344810495", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1895, "last_played": 1692815583}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, (or not - idfc) I've got no freaking idea why do people leave all sorts of negative reviews towards the game, but you can't help seeing them from time to time.

(In fact, high enough expectations to have pre-ordered and backed it during development.) Did it live up to them? Well... mostly, while even exceeding them in some areas.\n\nThe first thing to catch my eye was the absolutely stunning visual look of... everything, really. Every single detail seems very well thought out and executed, from the menus to the VHS fast-forward effects that show when skipping text. And the art is unlike anything I've ever come across in my - admittedly limited, compared to some - experience with visual novels. Right from the first scene, the art is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, and as if that was not enough, nearly everything is animated: character movements, elements in the background, cherry petals blowing across the screen... It all comes together to immerse the player in the game's world, 1980s Tokyo. The effect this has on the overall playing experience cannot be overstated - they're called [b]visual[/b] novels for a reason, after all.\n\nHowever, visuals are not the only section where LMR excels. The game features an absolutely massive soundtrack, with over five hours of music according to the devs. Despite the huge amount of music, I can't really name a single track that doesn't live up to the high level of quality set by the artwork. The soundtrack serves well to further paint a picture of the surrounding world, working especially well in routes and situations where music becomes part of the story. Not only that, but at times I found myself bopping my head or otherwise just jamming to the tunes, which I don't remember happening with other similar games. Personally, I'm usually not the biggest fan of having lyrics in my visual novel soundtracks, but LMR does its best to make me a believer. These songs are used sparingly and saved for hard-hitting moments, where they add a whole new layer of emotion.\n\nWorld-class visuals? Check. Amazing soundtrack? Check. Writing? Well...\n\nDon't get me wrong, the writing is not bad by any means. The characters are thought out well, there are no glaringly obvious inconsistencies in their actions or personalities. Most of them are actually rather fun to get to know closer, turning out to have actual depth to them. And not only the main heroines - I found myself looking forward to interactions with Nikolai's best friend, Kyosuke, who is admittedly kind of overlooked in the beginning but really proves himself toward the end of some of the paths. The story itself, a combination of the usual high school love affairs and a surprisingly complex spy thriller, is quite intriguing. It seems to be a trademark of Soviet Games to have stories full of dark mysteries and utterly unexpected twists of fate. Answers are often found where you'd least expect - a key mystery of one story path may be left unanswered, only for the truth to pop up in another playthrough. This is one of my favourite things about Soviet Games' products, as being able to piece the overall picture together bit by bit gives a massive boost to replay value.\n\nHaving said that, I found it hard to really properly get into LMR at first. After the initial excitement following its release, I found myself kind of lost with it. Yes, the visuals were stunning and the music was great, but I didn't really get the story at first. I had no idea if I was near the start, mid-point or end of the story, and it just... kept... going... on. When the end did eventually come, it felt quite abrupt, and most of my questions were left unanswered. To be fair, most of this was later explained in the other routes and endings, but I had to gather some steam to plough through the rest of the game. LMR may be a highly [b]visual[/b] novel, but it sure also is a visual [b]novel[/b]. I guess the best word to describe the writing is heavy - there's a lot to the story, and it takes a long time to get there, but the more you know, the more fascinating it gets. Still, getting all the endings took me 50 hours, with abundant use of the skipping feature - and I'm a faster-than-average reader, mind you. The game also feels slightly unpolished at times - small typos and missing full stops at the ends of lines are not uncommon. Nothing game-breaking, sure, but it still stands out in a game that has obviously seen countless hours put into its development.\n\nIn summary, LMR is a lot. A lot of amazing art, a lot of excellent music, and a lot of story. It's perhaps not the easiest visual novel to pick up even for those familiar with the genre, but if you're able to get past that, it's definitely worth the time and effort. What it does best is immersion. Everlasting Summer got me feeling nostalgic for a place I've never been to and a country that hasn't existed in my time. As I'm writing this down, having just completed the game, I'm already feeling like I will miss my little escapes into LMR's and Nikolai's Tokyo, so I guess it is fair to say that despite not reaching perfection, LMR still shines where it really counts.", "timestamp_created": 1694378260, "timestamp_updated": 1694378260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "145198554": {"recommendationid": "145198554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288456201", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1959, "last_played": 1694946640}, "language": "english", "review": "dead game", "timestamp_created": 1693230270, "timestamp_updated": 1693230270, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144756904": {"recommendationid": "144756904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099508092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3310, "last_played": 1668828788}, "language": "english", "review": "Devs you guys never disappoint me.

Although there are parts of the story that describe a location as a crowded but not a single person can be seen in the background. \n\nOf course, visuals are important for a Visual Novel, but the writing is just as important. The dialogue is bad, there is no character growth except maybe for the resolution of self vs self conflict for Catherine and the main character also coming to terms with Catherine's past decision at the end of her good ending route. The main character remains an asshole, and the dialogue remains frustrating as fuck in the other 3 \"good endings\" which really felt more like bad endings, and the 10 actual bad endings. Unlike other negative reviews, I don't think the problem with the writing comes from bad translations. There are very few typos and mistakes, and the spelling and grammar make sense. The real problem comes from the intentional writing. The way they tried to make the main character (player's perspective) and his high schooler friends the center of the Cold War. Only one character in the game plays music despite the game's cover and title, and the story felt like it was written with the intention of it being dark and emotionally frustrating at the cost of good dialogue, believable interpersonal relationships, character development, and consistent character personalities.\n\nSpoilers below for a more detailed explanation:\n\nWhen I started my first playthrough without looking at any guides, I was convinced that Catherine Winters is an asshole. Naturally, I tried to avoid her and I also wanted to avoid the childhood friend Himitsu who knows no boundaries. I slowly started to notice the problems with how the main character, Nikolai Anokhin is treating the people around him like Himtsu, his friends and classmates Kyosuke and Michael but I still gave Nikolai the benefit of the doubt. I thought that maybe something happened between Nikolai and his friends, making him a little more hostile towards his friends and that Nikolai will resolve his problems with his friends and become kinder to them. But I was wrong about both of those possibilities; Nikolai had no reason to be mean to his friends Kyosuke and Michael and especially not to Himitsu. \n\nNikolai reveals that he has known that Himitsu has loved him for years now, but Nikolai does not give Himitsu a clear answer about whether he likes Himitsu back or not. Nikolai is afraid that he will have to grow up and stop being a baby at 18 years of age, without Himitsu coming over to cook for him, clean his house, and be like Nikolai's live-in maid for free if he tells Himitsu that he doesn't have romantic feels for Himitsu. Nikolai pretends like he is entitled to Himitsu's kindness and as if she owes him somehow despite the fact that he treats her like a necessary annoyance in life, and doesn't give her a clear answer even if you choose the routes of any of the three other heroines. But the game reveals the full extent of this abusive relationship over a long time, and you only get to know what an asshole Nikolai is once you've progressed faaar into the story. Then you start to feel bad for having thought earlier that Himitsu should have had some boundaries with Nikolai, when Nikolai is the one who should have told Himitsu to keep some boundaries, take her keys to his house, and to let her know that he's thankful for what she always does for Nikolai but that he still only loves her platonically. But Nikolai doesn't do that. He just takes her kindness for granted in every route! And if she acts like your housewife and treats you the way that Himitsu does, then she probably IS your wife! Nikolai just can't move on from the intensity he felt from his first love with Catherine and believes that love means feeling an adrenaline rush the entire time he is in the presence of someone he believes he loves. This negative review isn't just because of Himitsu, so let's get back to whose route I ended up on my first playthrough due to my first impression of the characters and the beginning of the story and what a letdown the entire route and its endings are.\n\nAt the beginning, I believed what Nikolai said about not being able to solve his perceived issues with Himitsu with words, which was wrong, Nikolai is a big baby and can't understand that most problems CAN be solved by just talking it out. He's just terrible at speaking, always blames others, and doesn't believe in the power of words and so he just hurts everyone around him by the way he treats them. He didn't have some sort of bigger issue that needed more time before he could sort them out with his friends like I believed at the time. And the way he described Catherine made me think that she was the asshole in her former relationship with Nikolai and leaving him without a goodbye and returning to the USA from Japan. At this point, Nikolai has had his first encounter with Ellie in the cafeteria and I knew that she was going to be a date-able heroine but I also knew that she's the heir to the super rich Kobayashi Corporation, so naturally I thought that the not too rich and not too poor Kagome would be the best match for Nikolai. I thought that since Kagome is the shy meek girl who gets bullied at school would like the heroism of the macho protagonist I had perceived Nikolai to be when he decides to intervene and stop the bullies from bothering Kagome at school. I believed that Kagome's cold treatment of the protagonist came from the fact that she found it hard to trust people because she got bullied at school and might have had some personal problems at home. I could not have been more wrong. Kagome turns out to be a complete sociopath as the bullying escalates and either the bullies or Kobayashi Corp or one of the intelligence agencies from the poorly written political espionage subplots set Kagome's family restaurant and house on fire after her dad is kidnapped, presumably by the Kobayashi Corporation that he used to work for. And conveniently enough, Kobayashi Ellie goes to the same elite high school as Kagome and Nikolai! In Kagome's route, Ellie is kidnapped and the KGB is proud of Nikolai for doing so but Nikolai believes that someone else has kidnapped Ellie and it definitely isn't Kagome!! But it turns out that Kagome WAS the one who kidnapped Ellie and she seems to have a personal grudge against Ellie and neither Nikolai or Ellie know why, as Kagome's previous and current treatment of Ellie seems to extreme for just having a hostage valuable to Kobayashi Corp as leverage for releasing Kagome's father. This isn't even the worst part. If you take Ellie's route, Ellie's bully friends get kidnapped and killed, all 8 of them in one night. The police and everyone first suspect Kagome, but the police releases Kagome (I will explain why later) but it is still heavily implied that Kagome was the one who did it. After some pointless plotting and seeing that Kobayashi Corp won't give in to their demands to release Kagome's father and when they find Ellie in the warehouse where she was tied up by Kagome, she escapes to the countryside with Nikolai for a while and they work hard jobs with little pay and pretend like life is normal. One day when Himitsu spots them in the village since it's close to her grandma's house, Kagome and the MC decide that they need to return to Tokyo as they've been found out anyway. NOW is the time when Kagome admits that she's the child of Kobayashi Jun's illegitimate daughter and this whole problem could have been solved from the beginning! She could have just tried to convince her grandfather, the head of Kobayashi Corp, to release her father instead of all this pointless bullshit \"plot\" the writers forced into the story to waste everyone's time and ruin out emotional investment because Kagome turns out to be a self-serving sociopath and her good ending brings no joy.", "timestamp_created": 1692294584, "timestamp_updated": 1692294584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55397564172744751", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "144355245": {"recommendationid": "144355245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194181886", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 2119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2119, "last_played": 1692211150}, "language": "english", "review": "To be completely honest, The art and the musics are amazing and they are noticeably better than the previous game.

Everlasting Summer. However, after reaching 100% completion, what I got was surprisingly different for both better and worse.\n\nThe good:\n-Art is absolutely phenomenal and well made in every scene\n-Animations for both the characters and backgrounds are great and sometimes really help to add emotion to some scenes\n-Music is surprisingly good and I'd consider it even better than Everlasting Summer\n-I really enjoyed two of the routes presented from start to finish for different reasons [spoiler] Ellie's was my favourite due to the various events which occur, her sweet nature and serious personal problems which Nikolai helps to solve in her good ending. Kagome's route starts out as perhaps a bit annoying, but it's clear from the start she has much more going on than it first seems. She has far more dramatic events which are better if you prefer a serious story from start to finish. [/spoiler]\n\nThe bad:\n-Some of the routes feel too long and padded with no choices presented to the player for a long time [spoiler] Catherine's route is especially bad when it comes to this. [/spoiler]  This truly does hurt the pacing and makes the game feel like a slog sometimes\n-I played this game in English and the translation is rough. A few lines are shockingly bad and haven't been fixed even months after release which is astounding. I understand that this game has a lot of dialogue, but surely these errors could've been fixed by now\n-Two of the other routes range from mediocre to bad and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone [spoiler] While Himitsu has a lot of stuff happen in the end, it's not enough to save how utterly generic the beginning and middle are. Her route mostly feels like a boring slice of life story which we've seen a thousand times by now. However, her path is nothing when compared to how terrible Catherine is. Besides the pacing issues, she is annoying and toxic from start to finish and never really changes. I couldn't wait to finish all her endings and never return due to how bad she is. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to fans of Everlasting Summer even at its current price due to how much effort has been put on display with the art, music and long story with some truly emotional moments.

He is unstable. On Ellie/Kagome route he became  way more likeable,and the times he \"explode\" made more sense.\n\nHimistu the first route( Japanese intelligence), your childhood friend that stand up with you after your girlfriend left you,she seens ok and care about you and blablabla but in the end she was just used by her father to spy on you, then you feel bad for her and declare your love and forget your ex,but something seens weird about her. The ex-girlfriend Catherine(2nd heroine) tells something that bugs me, \" you dont know who she  is, what she has done to us\". well since is the first route you just ignore it and in the end you 2 left the country, why.... welll  apparently your father was a spy and got killed and now all the worlds wants some documents on the research so you are the target for a lot of things.But in the end all \"works\" and they escape. \nHimistu is just crazy on the sick level towards the main character,she will do everything to stay with him(killing is a option for her aparently).\n\nCatherine (CIA), your ex-gf that come back to your life and is really \"forwards\" on in-jokes, her route at the moment is the most \"basic\" ,dindt think nothing was special about her knowing all the story. in the end you both escapes for the US .I dindt like her.Her fight with Himistu make sense ,since in this route you see the other side of your lovely childhood friend.Oh btw she was pregnant and lost your baby and Himistu make sure that you know about it...Also her mother signs the pappers to kill your parents..\n\n\nEllie ( Big corporation) The best by far at the moment,Looks way more plausible. A rich girl who loses her parents and had someone overprotective about her, that want to became a rockstar.Her and the mc , the romance go ways as expect, looking to good to be true and only close to the end you figure out her problem, she was addict to drugs, and almost die once because of that.Is the only route at the moment that i think noone was using noone,and i can see that happening the way it happen in real life. And in the end you 2 for a band and became famous so a Happy ending compared to the others 2.\nThe rival here is Kagome and the way she tries to broke you 2 was making Ellie jelaous since Ellie has no experience with relationship and making her jelaous was easy. And on her bad end , you sleep with Kagome, which result on Ellie going way too hard on drugs,and well you follow her after Kagome dump you, because she was only using you to hurt Ellie.\n\nKagome(...the vitim???) the only i was waiting for , her story was the one who most intrigued me from the outside, her father was kidnaped and she was seeking for revenge, and that was it she was more a vilain that a heroine, even on her rival route( Ellie route) she wanst that cruel, she used everyone, kidnaped Ellie( witch was supposed to be the vilain but was just another victim) and used the main character for revenge.

Thankfully Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll blow my expectations. They now have animated characters and artwork, most backgrounds are animated and have little easter eggs, some important scenes have animations aswell and the music is really good, but not bothersome (apart of some particular scenes with [spoiler]Ellie[/spoiler], in which vocals are being used and can distract you from your reading). Overall, a great steps up.\n\nI have noticed some bugs and glitches tho, but nothing game-breaking. For example, sometimes while fastforwarding, the characters might become invisible or turn into a pink mess. This is nothing compared to the translation tho. I don't know how they made it, but there are SO many moments in which a text repeats a word twice for no good reason, usually it's \"had had\" or \"think think\". You WILL encounter this. Not too annoying, but it shouldn't happen.\n\nThe story is also good, at least when you don't have the full picture of what is happening. There is only one good ending for every character, every other ending can range from [spoiler]you running away to the USSR[/spoiler] to [spoiler]you dying from overdosing.[/spoiler] I don't really like this approach, since some good endings are really shit compared to other more interesting bad endings. There is no harem ending (which I don't mind) but I feel like there is a lack of great endings. Of course, you can decide that by yourself, because even if the endings are not the best part of the story, the path to get to them is pretty rewarding.\n\nNikolai is not the best character ever, he repeats himself a lot and it's kind of an asshole. Eitherway, he is what you want him to be via your decisions. I can only think of one route in which he acts really like an asshole all the time, and that's mostly because you are taking the \"wrong\" choices everytime. I actually prefer to have a character with personality rather than a blank character to self-insert. I had read reviews about this game that talked about Nikolai being shitty like it's a bad thing. I don't think it is, because he is not always like that, and he has some reasons to be like that, even if they aren't the best ones. In most finals he grows as a person.\n\nTL;DR: If you liked Everlasting Summer, you will probably like this VN aswell.

But these games are comparable only to an extent, While Everlasting Summer was an escapist-eroge fantasy of days past with a hope to turn the life around, LMR is a more realistic light-novel with crime elements and no graphically sexual content.\nYou get to choose four girls and four \"good endings\" as well as TWO bad endings with each character. These are more bad endings than in Everlasting Summer but none of them seem to be as bad as the one with Lena. They are much more grounded and in these instances you can see the evolution of the scriptwriter. In other instances this evolution is not so clear... One scene was particularly telling for me, it's a scene where the protagonist must run away from his pursuers and he starts to philosophise about running and what it means etc. utter bullshit that no sane person who is running away in a stressful situation would ask himself.\nAnother minus is the lack of diversity of scenes/backgrounds. After so many years of development (and I was amongst the first ones to sponsor this development) the creators were not able to aquire enough backgrounds for varied storys. Therefore the characters tend to return to the very same places and streets with different dialogues.\nThe best parts of this game are the music, the writing and the early (qualitative) graphics that were also present in the early demo. The completed game had rather sub-par graphics.\nDon't get me wrong: I still love this game, But I've waited so long only to become a second-class product from a team who's writer is narcistically in love with his own texts... it had so much more potential...", "timestamp_created": 1682551787, "timestamp_updated": 1682551787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537206292152404785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137343333": {"recommendationid": "137343333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170907491", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1232, "last_played": 1689330678}, "language": "english", "review": "its actually impressive how intolerable almost every character in this visual novel is. absolutely has to be some kind of record.", "timestamp_created": 1682547276, "timestamp_updated": 1682547276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488655209541320801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "137340732": {"recommendationid": "137340732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246234164", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 152, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 585, "last_played": 1682531171}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\n10/10: The graphics, story, and characters all make for a top tier visual novel, and the perfect score is justified even if there's more elements of a spy technothriller than there is love, money, or rock 'n' roll!\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n\nCan you believe ol' Il Pallino was never sought out to officially review a visual novel? The important thing to know is that the story of [i]Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll[/i] (sic) starts in the year 1987 about a Soviet boy named Nikolai who had fallen in love with a girl named Katya only to have to break up due to Nikolai's family relocating to Japan after Nikolai's father lands a research job at a multinational corporation. Nikolai's parents die in an auto accident which leaves Nikolai orphaned but with a home and a decent amount of money, Katya ends up returning to Nikolai's life, only for other girls to appear in Nikolai's life on top of the proverbial \"lifelong friend\" in Nikolai's neighbor. One of the other girls at Nikolai's school has her father mysteriously vanish, and enlists in Nikolai's help finding out what happened to the father which makes Nikolai question the \"accidental\" circumstances in which his parents died. All the while, Nikolai returns to his old interest in playing the bass, only to discover that all of the female students that Nikolai has encountered also share an interest for music. (But for some strange reason, neither of the two male classmates of Nikolai are interested in music.)\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nNormally the most important aspect about the graphics, is that the girls all average an 8.98 on the Kawaii-O-Meter, and one of the background scenes even contains movement. (Something never seen before, but [i]Escalation![/i] doesn't count!) Another nice thing about the graphics is that the girls do not keep the same facial expression through scenes, and regardless if a scene is unique or a stock scene, there is movement to be had, and not just blinking eyes.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967490354\n\nWhile there's little sound to speak of, the developers aced it with the soundtrack. The music doesn't always play, which is good, because ol' Il Pallino would have long since muted the music. Instead, music plays at more dramatic moments in the game, and each tune is both perfect sounding and perfectly fits the mood of the situation. There's even a concert scene which contains vocals that add to the feeling that a concert is being witnessed.\n\n[h1]Positives and Negatives[/h1]\n\nThe characters are all realistic, and even more realistic than what can be encountered in slice of life visual novels. This must be good for people who love it \"real,\" but everyone is also too flawed of a human being to really feel likable. (Much less lovable.) Interesting? Yes. Intriguing? Absolutely... Just not possible for many players to develop an attachment to outside of looks. (I suppose it is realistic in the sense that many women IRL have more interesting looks than personalities.)\n\nApart from the title missing the word \"and\" in it, the title does feel misleading. But why sex up an already amazing story? [i]Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll[/i] isn't a trashy visual novel by any means, and nobody would have purchased the game expecting any portion of the visual novel to be a technothriller.\n\nUnlike other visual novels, [i]Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll[/i] provides help for any players who may be lacking knowledge of various cultures, and need the clue-by-four for explanations about things like Bastille Day in France and ryumachnoyas, and when available, the player can click on the text to receive a description... So while being as intelligent as any good slice of life visual novel, the player can play [i]Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll[/i] and truly learn something!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2967491631\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[i]Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll[/i] is a strong buy, and there's even achievements and trading cards. (The thing which drives hardcore gamers to Steam in the first place.) Not only is this game SFW, but it isn't even trashy so Steam users can gift this visual novel to those few strange people who would rather enjoy enjoy a visual novel without sex and nudity!\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino...

I'm fine with dramatic VNs, I've played my fair share, I've played through Clannad and After Story numerous times, I've played a decent amount of them, but this one pissed me off.\n\nFirst off, the good things: translation is pretty good given its Russian, noticed tiny missing words or slightly incorrect word usage but nothing that made it difficult to read, it wasn't common. Also music isn't bad, but its really grating once you hear the same tracks over and over again, (and its a multi-choice romance VN, you're gonna replay this at least 4 times, even just 2 times ruined the soundtrack) I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a VN but I was expecting something a bit more rock for something with Rock'n'Roll in the name. (especially when its alluding to the classic trope of Sex, Drugs, and Rock'n'Roll) Arts pretty good, its clean and unique without being cheesy or grating. Animations were nice but seemed completely unnecessary, their disconnect from what they're actually doing was more distracting then it should've been. Dialogue wasn't bad for the most part. UI is clean if but strange to be done in such a way. The writing is also enticing when it makes sense. That's about all the good stuff I can think of.\n\nNow for the frustrating and bad:\n\nForemost deceptive name for someone who understands the allusion of the name, I had a complete false pretense of what this game had going for it and the synopsis was next to useless.\n\nIf you believe this is a story about music at all, and for which the banner claims that as the case, you're wrong and you were scammed. Only one of the routes includes any interest in music at all.\n\nAs is usual with a bunch of low rate VNs, the decisions don't make any logical sense and you need to use a guide or a diagram to traverse each route properly. This is especially bad because all the good endings require very specific decisions which many don't even seem related and which make no semantic nor narrative sense to contribute to said ending.\n\nAnd now lets get to a big elephant in the room, and spoiler warning for the game, but Himitsu (the childhood friend archetype) has been stabbing the MC in the back from the start and Kogame is a literal sociopath. Both of their paths are pretty frustrating in light of these facts. For Himitsu, it really does start to feel like she was merely spying on the MC in light of what the story gives you instead of actually caring about him, only for the story to forget what it said and move on as if she only did something extremely minor. As for Kogame, she kidnaps Ellie forcing the MC into a position where he can't refuse to help her. And guess what happens if you do? The MC is murdered by Ellie's grandfather. WHY?!?!? Out of every single element of the goddamn story, this was the thing that completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief, which was starting to get on thin ice for how often the translation, being totally proficient in what it was saying disagreed with the tone and feelings of the characters and their behavior, you think that despite everything that you actively releasing someone from rope ties after being kidnapped in a warehouse, after said kidnapped character asked you to release her and pleaded with you, you would goddamn think that minimally Kogame would be the one killed. I'm sorry but what the actual hell is wrong with you? Are Russians this so goddamn braindead they believe these sequence of events make any goddamn sense? I swear to God after that fiasco and forcing the MC to participate in kidnapping and then constantly torturing him over it and then the goddamn kidnapping girl whining and complaining that you're somehow in the wrong, I can't forgive this crap tier story for this. I wasn't even invested in finishing the story because it doesn't matter what more you had to say, you jumped the goddamn shark when you justified kidnapping someone innocent and drag innocent people into your affairs that will get them killed. The story never points out how evil this is and the MC has to just go through with it, the more I played this part the more angry and depressed it made me, I just wanted to stop. I honestly want a refund over this trash, too bad visual novels fall outside the realm of Steam's refund policy, nothing was worth this, I don't care about the positives, just this entire branch that goes on for at least a few hours was so horrifically stupid I can't stand even opening this game again. And I'm willing to bet the railroading, maybe not being as bad in the other branches I haven't played, they likely are just as jarring, even if not as frustrating, as this. How the hell do you even translate the story so well and produce complete nonsense thinking? Its supposed to be the opposite way around.

How immersive!\nI resolutely played my first round without changing my choices, even if I regretted them immediately... And I did. I got Kagome Bad End #1 for my first play-through. Despite that, the story was engaging, thrilling, infuriating, irritating, emotional, and a bunch of other things. I actually felt the weight of my emotions after receiving my ending. I'll be slowly collecting all the other endings as well, make no mistake about that. This novel is the best I ever played, period.\n\nBut regrettably, that doesn't mean it is without some flaws, even if they're minor. Firstly, the MC: Nikolai. What wreck. Super impulsive, emotional, self-destructive, rude, and just annoying at times with his self-hatred and self-pity. \nThe other characters also have their things: Himitsu is clingy (though I don't mind that. She's cute). Catherine is just... Mystery. Kagome is just irritatingly stubborn, whether or not you get a good or bad end. And Ellie [spoiler] seemingly sent me to my death [/spoiler] for who-knows-why so I'll need convincing that she's a good character.\n\nThen the choices, for such a large novel, felt a little far and few in between. At times, it felt like there where choices where none was warranted and no choices when there should have been. But that said, the choices change the direction of the novel drastically, with your very first choice seemingly sending you down one or another set of 7 endings each.\nThere are a few spelling mistakes here and there but nothing that will ruin the tone of the sentence or conversation. Just throws a little lol.\n\nAll that said, LMRnR is a solid 10/10 for me, even with its flaws. Worth every cent, every minute, and every session.\nP.S. if you plan on sitting through the credits for the Patience achievement, be prepared to sit through about 1 hour and 40 minutes of credits (I timed it) you were warned.

You will be in for a ride.\n\nNow, on to the real, long version of my review...\n\nI have never played visual novels that much. When I found out about Love, Money, Rock'n Roll, it wasn't even because I was looking for a new game to play, but because I was looking up certain things about the Unity Game Engine and wandered off and came across an article about how the environment visuals of Love, Money, Rock'n Roll made. The techniques were interesting so I took note. When it came out, I wasn't in any hurry to play it and kept dragging my feet. But here I am. \n\nLove, Money, Rock'n Roll had been an emotional roller coaster for me. I was interested in Japan, in the techniques used in the making of the game, the setting sounded interesting enough, but what I experienced far outmatched my expectations. \n\nWe play as our protagonist, Nikolai, at the first real important turning point of his/our life, making decisions for himself/ourselves in the world of 80s Japan, our decisions leading us down paths we least expect. The dangers, conflicts, happy and sad moments we experience throughout the story felt all very new, unique and deeply touching. I found myself feeling what Nikolai would have felt, became excited at the prospect of waking up to a good day, looking forward to spending time with people we cared about, felt devastated at the misfortunes and wrong decisions we made and where those decisions brought us. The way this novel handled human relationships felt so different, inartificial, for some reason.\n\nThen there is the music. Every single moment in the game that I was brought to emotional extremes, the music joined in, enveloped my emotions, brought them to new heights. I found myself smiling silly when silly or happy things happened, relieved that things were okay. I sighed in relief when we dodged a sticky situation, or the storm has passed. When things went downhill and we were in the deepest parts of hell, I felt my limbs go numb, my heart clench hard. I even found myself having to take some breaks at certain points to not actually feint. The way the entire OST fit the time period, the place the story was set in, and most importantly, the moments they empowered, was amazing. I have found a good many songs I would listen to from today onward.\n\nI can count with my hand the number of content that made me feel the things Love, Money, Rock'n Roll made me feel, Nikolai, Kyousuke, Kagome, Ellie, Michael, Himitsu, Catherine, their lives, their experiences, their interactions, feelings and conflicts.

It's quite appealing visually, the characters are nice and the story is well told.\n\nBy nice characters I don't mean they are nice persons but they are understandable and have solid motivation. The whole story is rather dark though. IMHO even good endings don't match the game vibes very well. But maybe it's just because I'm depressed.\n\nThere're several things which kinda annoying.\n\nFirstly, some bad endings are harger to catch than good ones. I tried tips but in fact it's quite clear which choise belongs to which girl. But despite of that I had to get a guide to find the Catherine 2nd bad ending.\n\nAt second, some endings looks... Forced, I'd say. I.e. the story goes on and on but you suddenly die. As if one more ending was wanted so it was just added to the random place of the story.\n\nAt third, some dialogs sound empty. The characters just exchange some general phrases and nothing happens. This makes an impression of hardly stretched story which lasts and lasts.\n\nAt fourth, I still can't get why so many beautiful girls fight for such a lazy and passive person as the main character. I guess the author suspects it as there're a couple of related jokes in the game :)\n\nAnd... well, the game is more about relations than about spy games and scientific problems. So the last 2 things plays as very blured background with not much details. E.g. Makito Sinkai loves this type of stories when a war or a global disater is just a background for the tale of the main characters relationships. But he has these things roughly explained so at least I can get what the characters fight against.\n\nThese thoughts above are the ones I've got in the middle of the game. The last storyline I complete was the Kagome one. And I must admit I'm happy I played this game. After all the author has their own style and this NV is beautiful. Some things still scratching my brain and I still want to through something heavy to the protogonist's head while he's talking to Himitsu but I guess it means the storytelles has acheived the goal ;)\n\nSo it's worth to spend some time, money and rock-n-roll to read through.

I also think that the Russian perspective to storytelling, brings a fresh look and feel to visual novels, which I absolutely adore. It's just ...darker..edgier. And looking back at all the backers (yes, I got the achievement for watching to the end), I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\nThis story is full of noir themes, and philosophy, almost Tolstoy-ish at times (and that is the highest praise I can give here) invoking humour, but also terrible pain and anguish when it goes to almost unimaginable places of despair. For example at one point where (I think in the Kagome arc - which was one of my favourites) refers to the 'dark day', when you literally have to run away from your normal life, leave everything behind that you know and love, with no money and just the clothes on your back, to get to safety. This was mind blowing and such an eye opener for us who lives with modern day luxuries.\n\nI adored the 80s setting, references and the music and it was so fitting with the vhs menus and game forwards and rewinds. The 80s was also a time where this spy drama is set, when you were only as strong as your intelligence. When the CIA, and especially the KGB were scarier than the boogeyman. Kind of difficult to imagine these days with our free flowing information on the internet. I also want to send a big thank you and shout out for[spoiler] the little Easter egg with the rock goddess Alisa in front of the music club[/spoiler] it brought back so many good Pioneer camp memories for me, thank you :) \n\nPROS: It's kind of harder this time to pick a favourite lady in my opinion. You have the best friend and girl next door, you have the ex girlfriend from a foreign country, you have the popular girl and rock star and you have the quiet mysterious one. All solid choices. This left me with the need to play all the good endings for the 4 main ladies, so it ticked the replay-ability box and then some. More is always better, I personally would have loved and arc where we get to romance and interrogate the beautiful Irina as well, alas, perhaps for the future :) At the time of this review, I was not yet done with all of the endings, feeling the need to pace myself after all the emotional highs and lows. Going on to the darker endings, well, I'll only advise for those who are ready for it. But do brace yourself, it's ruff.\n\nCONS: Finally I do want to make a point about the lack of carnality, yes you read that right, lack of lusty adult scenes that was so elegantly used in your previous game. I get the reasons for it, your selling platform having a fit about school uniforms and hanky panky. You have frequent alcohol references, violence, but giving and showing love scenes is still taboo? Grow up people, we want to make our own decisions on our entertainment. You do no not need to nanny us, we are all adults. And this is an adult novel in all other ways. I also understand there was some kind of patch for the Russian version, but no working one (at the time of this review) for the English version. Will keep an eye on this. Real life, and real 18 year olds do drink and have sex, even if you want to stick your head in the sand about it. Thank you for the censorship, not. Okay, glad I got that of the chest :) \n\nAlso with hind-site, a not so much likeable main character, with little development and personal growth as a person. An orphan who is stuck in his ways. But again, not unbelievable as a character. Some commentators have mentioned 'hysterics' at some arcs, which I can agree with partially, but again, how would you generate some drama otherwise? Did you grow up in the 80s, did you understand the KGB, are you an orphan who is being hunted, etc? If not, check your commentary.\n\nIt is a very good visual novel, with beautiful music that was put together with love, money and rock 'n roll.

I feel like, that depending on which route you take, you either need to deal with a lovesick ahole that can't decide, or a more well rounded or maybe driven/focused MC. Could also be by design, but it made one branch less enjoyable to go through.\n\n- Not all Endings received equal treatment. While Ellie's and Kagome's good Endings gave a glimps into future years, Catherine's felt abrupt and incomplete. Himitsu's didn't have an outlook as well, but at least had a better conclusion that left nothing open.\n\n- Text should have gotten 1 or 2 more correction passes.

The game's Art Direction and even minor animations are done very well and put more life into the characters and their surrounding world (Great Job to the Background Artists also). The Music was pretty great going from Calming Songs to Rock and Roll which was done nicely. The game is pretty lengthy which could be it's downfall due to some issues. One of my biggest problems with this game comes from the writing of our MC(Protagonist Boi). The way he was written for some reason made him pretty frustrating and annoying to me. There are zero positive sides in regards to our character and most of the times he comes out as a giant prick, dumb ass or an apathetic moron. This would not be a huge problem if you didn't spend most of  the time in this jackass head, reading his thoughts which got pretty boring and samey after the few 2 hours. The Heroine's also have their flaws and act pretty oddly at times but they still have some positive features in them that do make them likeable. There is also some minor translation issues and bugs (one stopped me from advancing on a certain route) but they are getting fixed as we speak. Their previous game had a pretty odd translation quirks which can also be seen here but that just makes the game have it's own charm. For all of you degenerates, there is no H-Patch due to country(or was it steams?) regulations, so you gotta make do with rule 34. Overall I did enjoy a big chunk of the game if it wasn't for some minor bugs and the major character issue (which was worsened by the lengthier game time).

I dont think I can do catherines or Kagome's routes. I can parrot the same criticism as everyone, Nikolai is an asshole, hes fatalist to a stupid detriment, hes a bipolar schizophrenic. Hes literally me FR!\nNot every MC is going to be a stoic, 99% of the time silent guy. Think when your playing a game like Witcher, You are roleplaying but you are not role playing a character *you* made, you have to play the role of Geralt whether you really like it or not. So while it at times it can be frustrating that he is going against how I want a situation to play out, thats just how it has to be. Now the solution to that is to have more and more choices, which leads to more and more divergences and that makes it even harder to decide how each ending should play out if all these intermediary choices should really have an effect or not. So I am fine with how Nikolai acts, except for in ellies \"\"Good\"\" Ending, I did not time it but after making the final choice and getting the ending felt like almost an hour and a half while I just have to watch an absolute spiral of despair that I couldnt have a choice in.\n\nI do not like catherine, and I do not like her implementation into Himitsu's ending making unavoidable problems that could be very easily solved by either a slap or making it very clear for her to dissappear. Other than that, the writing of Himitsu's story is beautifully tragic. I want to thank the writers that came up with her route as while it felt quite short it was a perfect roller coaster of emotions that ended very happily.\n\nWhen it came to Ellie's route I did not think it would be nearly as depressing as Himitsu's was mainly due to that shes the only one of the girls whos steam trading card wasnt them crying or being angry. I was wrong! How I was wrong! Im from a working class family so stories of some commoner guy winning the heart of an upper class girl and breaking class boundaries always capture my heart in a special way, thats what I thought this would be. It reminded me of the song \"Common People\" in the beginning showing a girl who's used to servants waiting on her without the need to ever go to stores and the like. Throw in a dash of cocaine a couple hours later and you realize the rock star princess that you loved is an addict and no matter how much you try she just does not listen. Ending up with an overdosed ellie, and from here is where you are locked onto rails as she gets mad at *you* for trying to get her to stop with the cocaine, followed by continued misunderstanding perpetrated by Kagome. I have probably done a very bad job explaining the course of events, it is mainly because the series of events mirrors something very closely that happened in my own life, so that might bias me to think the way they turn into a good ending was extremely contrived and rushed to just make the big concert happen.\n\nOverall 8/10 Just dont do ellies route", "timestamp_created": 1672882733, "timestamp_updated": 1672882733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130112552": {"recommendationid": "130112552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252935679", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1176, "last_played": 1674238150}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderfully", "timestamp_created": 1672843315, "timestamp_updated": 1672843315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130061317": {"recommendationid": "130061317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198938775159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3803, "last_played": 1672784102}, "language": "english", "review": "Himitsu number one!", "timestamp_created": 1672784131, "timestamp_updated": 1672784131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130019538": {"recommendationid": "130019538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115561749", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2538, "last_played": 1672742634}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll a pesar de ser un juego s\u00f3lido, ha resultado ser una decepci\u00f3n en muchos aspectos. Lo llevo esperando desde que termin\u00e9 Everlasting Summer hace muchos a\u00f1os pero hasta ahora no he podido jugar a este.\n\n\u00bfLo he disfrutado? La respuesta es: a ratos. Este juego tiene much\u00edsimo relleno y much\u00edsimas cosas innecesarias que tienen m\u00e1s importancia de la que deber\u00eda. Est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado como un dating sim de toda la vida con sus rutas y sus cosas pero al final eso es m\u00e1s secundario que otra cosa y la subtrama de esp\u00edas y conspiraciones y politiqueo acaba tomando el primer plano y la verdad es que lo arruina todo porque es innecesariamente compleja, no resuelven nada y no es interesante en absoluto.\n\nVoy a ir punto por punto empezando por las cosas que s\u00ed me han gustado:\n\n+ Visualmente el juego es una delicia. Los fondos se sienten vivos, muchos de ellos animados, con muy buena calidad y de verdad que son preciosos en su mayor\u00eda. Normalmente es algo que se suele obviar en otros juegos al ser considerado m\u00e1s secundario, pero en este juego le han dado un protagonismo importante y se agradece. Tambi\u00e9n hay muchos personajes escondidos en los fondos tanto de cultura popular como Big Floppa como otros de juegos como Everlasting Summer, Ace Attorney o Steins;Gate que aunque no interactuan en el juego, verlos de fondo si los reconoces es agradable.\n\n+ Relacionado con lo de arriba, los personajes se sienten vivos. Transiciones fluidas de animaciones que se agradecen, y lo que es verdaderamente curioso es que hay una cantidad absurda de personajes. No entiendo si son ideas descartadas o qu\u00e9, pero el que hayan hecho modelos para personajes que salen literalmente en una escena con sus animaciones y todo me parece increible por el hecho de que crea m\u00e1s inmersi\u00f3n, pero a la vez te deja con la intriga de por qu\u00e9 ese personaje existe si s\u00f3lo sale en una escena y no lo vamos a conocer m\u00e1s. \u00bfQuiz\u00e1 una posible secuela o un DLC? seria interesante la verdad.\n\n+ La m\u00fasica es el otro punto fuerte del juego. Igual que con los fondos y los personajes, el apartado art\u00edstico es el que mejor cuidado est\u00e1 con diferencia. La banda sonora es increiblemente extensa y buena. No soy muy de comprar bandas sonoras pero si un juego se lo merece, es este.\n\n+ Est\u00e9tica de los 80: Habr\u00e1 a quien le guste y a quien no, pero la nostalgia pega fuerte. Y un juego basado en los 80 con un apartado art\u00edstico tan bueno es una delicia a\u00fan mejor.\n\n* Personajes principales: Sin entrar en spoilers grandes, hay cuatro rutas con cuatro chicas diferentes. Las rutas son de una calidad variada, en mi opini\u00f3n s\u00f3lo dos considero que merezcan la pena, el resto tienen demasiado relleno. Por suerte, las chicas son en su mayor\u00eda buenos personajes. No se aferran en exceso a estereotipos y te van a dar alguna sorpresa que otra. Y otra cosa que me gusta es que no son predecibles en absoluto, y que todas est\u00e1n un poco mal de la cabeza a su manera lo cual las hace sentir m\u00e1s reales y menos planas en el sentido de aferrarse a su estereotipo hasta la muerte. Kagome my beloved <3\n\n+ Trivia y datos curiosos tanto de la URSS como de Jap\u00f3n: Para los que no est\u00e9n muy metidos en cultura japonesa o rusa, el juego marca en azul toda frase o palabra que puede no entenderse para lectores de fuera, lo cual se agradece mucho (o redundante seg\u00fan el conocimiento que tengas), pero en general se agradece.\n\n+- No s\u00e9 si considerarlo malo o bueno, pero el juego no tiene nada excesivamente turbio, raro o creepy como s\u00ed pasaba en Everlasting Summer y me ha hecho estar en guardia todo el rato para nada. S\u00ed que es verdad que echaba de menos alg\u00fan giro argumental turbio, que aunque los hay no les dan la importancia que merecen.\n\nDicho esto, vamos con lo malo, que no es poco:\n\n- El gui\u00f3n: Es un desastre en todos los sentidos. El juego intenta ser un simulador de citas en los 80 con una subtrama de esp\u00edas y conspiraciones a gran escala, pero resulta ser todo lo contrario. El romance pasa a un segundo plano y a menudo se siente hasta forzado. Se podr\u00eda entender si la ''subtrama'' fuese interesante pero no lo es. Es un aut\u00e9ntico caos de literalmente cuatro facciones con intereses difusos que se est\u00e1n tirando de los pelos todo el rato y que el protagonista est\u00e1 en el medio un poco porque s\u00ed. Al principio puede ser interesante pero despu\u00e9s te das cuenta que no te van a resolver nada. Parece que vas a descubrir algo, pero no. Y siempre es igual. No hace falta ser un genio escribiendo misterio para saber que si no le das al lector informaci\u00f3n con cuentagotas pierde el inter\u00e9s en el misterio.\n\nPersonajes que act\u00faan de formas que no tienen sentido, intereses que se contradicen, agujeros argumentales... Adem\u00e1s de que el inicio del juego es horriblemente lento por esto mismo, mucha intriga al principio pero despu\u00e9s nada, son pesados que existen para alargar el juego de forma artificial, junto a los mon\u00f3logos incesantes del protagonista que de nuevo engordan la duraci\u00f3n del juego. Finales repentinos e insulsos. Reconozco algunos que est\u00e1n bien, pero otros es como ''ah, pues vale''. Acaban y te quedas igual porque no hay sensaci\u00f3n de cl\u00edmax, de resoluci\u00f3n de conflictos, de nada. Simplemente acaba, normalmente gracias al archiconocido recurso del deus ex machina que yo personalmente odio.\n\n- Skip lento: Los finales malos son una loter\u00eda, algunos son pochos y otros son incluso mejores que otras rutas enteras. Pero para llegar ah\u00ed, hay que releer texto haciendo elecciones diferentes y aqu\u00ed el skip es necesario en cualquier novela visual con finales m\u00faltiples (o una flowchart vendr\u00eda genial) pero aqu\u00ed es absurdamente lenta, por el hecho de que se detiene cada vez que los personajes hacen una animaci\u00f3n o sea que te puedes llevar un buen rato. A mi incluso se me rompi\u00f3 el skip en cierta ruta y tuve que estar pasando manualmente durante una hora contenido que ya hab\u00eda visto, o sea que no mola nada y lo que hace es arruinar la experiencia y te obliga a que uses gu\u00edas salvo que seas un masoquista.\n\n- Protagonista. Hay dos tipos de protagonistas en las novelas visuales: El self-insert con cero personalidad para que el lector se sienta identificado, o el que intenta romper esos esquemas pero el 99% del tiempo acaba siendo un idiota insufrible. Bueno, el segundo caso es nuestro NIkolai. Es un t\u00edo incre\u00edblemente t\u00f3xico, trata a sus amigos fatal, insulta a la m\u00e1s m\u00ednima aunque le hablen de buenas, es un borracho y un penas y encima es un mentiroso compulsivo. Una joyita de t\u00edo, vaya. Y la historia hubiese sido realmente sencilla si dejase de ocultar cosas y mentir a todo el mundo por razones desconocidas. La mitad de las conversaciones del juego acaban mal y casi siempre es culpa del protagonista que como digo es un impresentable, es imposible identificarse con una persona as\u00ed.\n\n- Esto es algo menor, pero el arte oficial en el que salen las cuatro chicas en una banda, no aparece en ning\u00fan lugar ni momento del juego, lo digo por el que espere una novela visual alrededor de la m\u00fasica. S\u00f3lo hay una ruta en la que participas en una banda y es con un personaje nada m\u00e1s, y como le pasa al resto de las rutas pasa a un segundo plano por la aburrida subtrama de esp\u00edas.\n\n- Por \u00faltimo, entiendo que es una novela visual grande, pero hay una cantidad enorme de faltas de ortograf\u00eda, bugs visuales, personajes diciendo frases que no le tocan y movidas as\u00ed que por desgracia son bastante recurrentes y sacan un poco de la experiencia. No s\u00e9 si en ruso es igual pero la traducci\u00f3n al ingles tiene muchos errores. Se deja entender, pero a poco que prestes algo de atenci\u00f3n te das cuenta de que es un desastre.\n\n- Cr\u00e9ditos de 2 horas: En serio, poner un logro por ver los cr\u00e9ditos que duran casi dos horas me parece un pasote. por muchas gracias que les quieras dar a los que te han apoyado econ\u00f3micamente, ni la gente que ha pagado se va a ver dos horas de nombres para ver el suyo.\n\nMe he quedado sin espacio, lo cual es una pena, quer\u00eda decir m\u00e1s.

I suppose anyone who has read most or all of Everlasting Summer (their previous title) should already be able to figure this out, but when this story ends bad, it can end *very* bad. I just finished my first ending yesterday, and it's probably going to be haunting me for the next few days (and it isn't even the end, but some of the stuff that leads up to it that is probably also in the good ending). Lena bad end is comparable.\n\nAdditionally, this title really should have content warnings comparable to those in DDLC, though I suppose doing that sort of thing is a purely American thing. So for those of you who might otherwise stumble across something you'd rather not have read: Content warning: Drug use, mass murder, suicide. Also sex, but I'm pretty sure you're here for that.\n\nFinally, Nikolai is at least as bad as Seymon when it comes to social ineptitude and unjustifiable hostility. And unlike Seymon, he isn't surrounded by girls who can heal him; they can barely take care of themselves. This is not a fun happy romance story. Shit gets real.\n\nAnd that's what it comes down to: this story provides a very realistic portrayal of the uglier side of life. Yes, I got frustrated with Nikolai's behavior, but the fact is I've known guys like him, and at times, I've been guys like him. There were times I nearly screamed with frustration at Nikolai's latest idiocy... then remembered that I'd done something similar in the past. I wasn't as bad, but I can definitely relate. If you think of yourself as a socially well adjusted, reasonably popular, effective person who'd rather have nothing to do with \"that guy\", you're probably not going to like this story, because Nikolai is very much \"that guy\".\n\nAll this being said, everything about this VN is story is fantastic. The art, in both conception and implementation, is top notch, and a more than substantial improvement over Everlasting Summer. The soundtrack is good, though the jury is out on that until I've had a few more playthroughs to let it sink in. And the writing is very good, and less awkwardly phrased than it was in Everlasting Summer (where I wasn't sure if the problem was the original script or the translation). I enjoyed the earlier parts, the middle parts were super stressful, and the end... well, I got a bad end, but I can't help but think that after all that, a good end would be quite rewarding.", "timestamp_created": 1671705880, "timestamp_updated": 1671705880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751495301723480225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128754066": {"recommendationid": "128754066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027443875", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1671337173}, "language": "english", "review": "I've tried 3 times to get into it, the story just has no draw for me.

Soviet Games really caught lightning in a bottle with that game and it was free! It was so good that I actually kind of felt like I ripped the developers off by not paying for the thing. I decided right then that if these guys put out a paid release I was going to buy it regardless of what the game was. That's why when the trailer dropped for Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll I added it to my wishlist right away.\n\nIt was a long wait before the release of this game and I have to tell you that when I played it for the first time I was kind of disappointed. I strongly disliked one of the heroines Catherine and the way she interjects herself into Himitsu's storyline. Normally if you don't like a character in this sort of game you can just ignore them until they go away but not in this case. It led to several situations where I wished I could talk for the main character and just tell her to go away. \n\nI was also a bit disappointed that this game doesn't have any weird hidden routs like Everlasting Summer did. When I first played I was all oh sure it says four heroines but there is probably some weird hidden routs where you save Japan from Godzilla or I don't know something. After all we had been waiting years for this thing there are probably a few surprises but nope, what you see is what you get as far as I can tell. \n\nAll of this doesn't mean Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll is a bad game. It isn't, it's solid, but the game isn't great either. I'm looking forward to the next game from Soviet Games. I'll be buying it day one, but I won't be expecting another Everlasting Summer.

stop until getting all the good endings.. well.. as non-stop as I could, because most of the time after finishing my first 2 routes I just had no desire to play. I felt so saturated by this VN that I couldn't even bring myself to write a review until now, 4 months later.\n\nAs others have pointed out, the OST and the visuals are amazing, the technical aspects, like the animated characters and background, are also top notch.. everything is good.. but the writing.\n\nTo extend on that, it isn't exactly bad in a few specific things, some characters were well written, and even the the most criticized character, Nikolai, wasn't all that bad either (most of the time). The biggest problem IMO is how long anything and everything took to happen, or just how dragged out things get, I truly feel that 5-6 hours of each route could easily be cut out and it wouldn't change anything, if anything it'd add to the game. There just seems to be so much filler after the \"middle\" point of the story that you start feeling *tired* of reading what's pretty much nothing over and over, just waiting for *something* to happen. (I never even went back to 100% the game after getting the good endings, just couldn't bring myself to suffer through so much text just to get a few bad endings and achievements)\n\nAnd I'm not trying to be mean here but sometimes I just had a feeling that, whoever wrote the story just thought too highly of themselves as a writer and that whatever they came up with would be outstanding and, \"being a writer\" they knew exactly what they were doing. I got this feeling over and over for 2 reasons, first being for how dragged out the story felt and second for [spoiler]how in one of the endings, Nikolai himself says \"As a writer myself, that's what I would do\" or something like that[/spoiler], and yes not really a good reason but it was at that moment that I started having this feeling.\n\nI had been waiting for years for this game to be released, had high expectations because of how good Everlasting Summer was story-wise, but ended up being disappointed by the only thing I thought I wouldn't be: the writing.", "timestamp_created":

"english", "review": "Soo, let's start with the good things this game has:\n1. Music is outstanding\n2. Visual style does a very beatiful representation 80-90's Japan\n3. character art is on point and the sprites are animated better than I have seen in any other VN. \n\nOverall, [b]everything[/b] the player sees and hears [u]when not looking at the big box with letters[/u] is exceptionally atmospheric and a clear win of development team. Props where it is due.\n\nHowever this is a visual novel, and thus its main aspect is a story. Previous release of Soviet Games - Everlasting Summer - actually had one, which was not bad. Taken the clustefuck which was the development process of that game, authors have delivered something, which was remotely believable. It was nothing special, definetly not he best writing I have seen, but it was at least at moderate to good level, even showing some writing talent. Thus one could have expected, that the same studio, having the experience with writing big branching plots in ES, will deliver something att least on par with their previous release. And, one last Kudos, they partially succeeded. The story in itself is more believable and collected and the secondary characters including the four main girls are actual personalities. I will however remark here, that the story is a LOT shorter than the one of ES and features a lot less choices both in absolute count and in the density. Player will have at most less than [spoiler]30[/spoiler] choices depending on the path.\n\nAnd now we are approaching my biggest point of critique and an absolute deal breaker for this otherwise not bad game - the protagonist Nikolai. Directly from the start he is presented as a childish (this one is the sole understandable trait, given his age), selfish, whiny, unjustifiably aggrressive and, overall, an absolutely unbearable guy. He lacks any kind of social skills - understanding and empathy for oher characters are definetly not his forte. Problem is, he is also not some kind of sociopatic genius, who does not need other people to realise his grand scheme of things. Instead, he desperately NEEDS help from othr characters to survive, but, throughout the game, he literally makes the lives of everyone around him worse, whether those individuals are helping him, furthering their own agendas, or even showing him attraction/love. All in all, if you did not play this game and would like to imagine Nikolai - think about the worst person you have seen in your life and multiply them by cancer. \n\nThe thing is, that it would not have been such a problem for myself, if Nikolai had an ark. Something like \"A bad guy realising the errors of his ways\" or \"A spoiled child meets other people with hard lifes, who chang his view on the world\" would have been a classic approach. But no, no, no - the screenwriter has decided it would be a magnificent idea to create the worst main character and have it that way from the first to the last letter of this story. And yes, this happens regardless of player choices. Most of them reprasent a dilemma of being either jerk or an asshole - a typical \"Witcher\" kind of a choice. And even if the player is presented withc some choice, which actually makes some sense, Nikolai still finds the way to be THE unbearable guy in the room. And yes, even at the very end of the story, where there are no more secrets and all cards are on deck, the protagonist still refuses to change and stays the same right 'till the rolling credits.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, being the backer from 2017 and patiently waiting. And I still pretty much like everything that isn't Nikolai in this story. It is simple, even naive, but it could have worked. Could have...\nI sincerely wish that the money I paid mostly went to the people writing the OST, drawing the beatiful arts and animations and to the programmers who actually did a good job of making a Ren'Py game not shit. But I know very well the it is not true and that the money mostly went to the \"leader\" of the studio and also the main screenwriter, who wrote the Nikolai in the first place.

You'll have to make different choices through several different routes to see how all the disparate story lines are connected, and what's really happening.\n\nSome random stuff -\n\nDon't quit when it feels like you're heading for one of the \"bad ends\" - things may turn out bad for some of the characters, but keep going to the finish, they are good reading for the player. :)  Plus you can turn on hints if you're struggling to connect with the right girl, whoever that may be.\n\nAlso, [spoiler]there's no \"harem route\" where all the cute girls fall in love with the protagonist simultaneously, and everyone lives happily ever after.  No, that's not gonna happen.[/spoiler] :)\n\nApparently there's a [i]patch[/i].  I couldn't figure out how to make it do anything on my Deck, so I gave up.  Not sure what I missed, but there were several fade-to-black moments in various playthroughs.  I'll use my imagination and say there were boobies everywhere, plus a secret harem route.  Probably had Himitsu's angry friend in there, too.\n\nI sat through the full list of thank-yous for the \"Patience is a virtue\" cheevo and felt trolled pretty hard.  There's a lot of names.  Like, my Deck kept going to sleep.  I couldn't decide if I should keep going, or quit and leave it running overnight on my pc instead.  I must have seen a couple hours of names scroll past before it finished. :) Now, I don't know anything about the development of this game, so maybe without all of those contributors the game doesn't exist, so thank you, everyone!  But perhaps, if it's not too much trouble, could the list of wonderful people who contributed for the next game scroll a [i]tiny[/i] bit faster, please? :) Thank you!\n\nOk, this game is slightly more expensive than https://store.steampowered.com/app/331470/Everlasting_Summer/ but it's definitely worth your money.  If you're broke, you could add it to your wishlist and hope for a discount some day, but who knows when that's going to happen?  If you can afford it, go for it!\n\n---\n\nObligatory dumb review edit for the badge, 2022 edition...\n\nHey, this game is still great, but now there's a 30% discount.  Woohoo!\n\nJorge of Burgos said He didn't laugh, but you know Baby Jesus cried all the time.  And not buying this game makes Baby Jesus cry.  Don't let it happen!\n\n(\u00b4;\ufe35;`)\n\nPretty sure that's an authentic Baby Jesus about to cry emoji.

And don't get me started on the whole Catherine thing - dear developers, you can't expect player to empathise with Nick's obsession when there is not even a small prologue for player to understand this obsession. \nThe choice system is so ridiculous that you better get a guide before playing this game, otherwise some seemingly innocent choices in the beginning can lead to you to unexpected places near the end. This for instance highly demotivated me to explore the game and it's routes as I knew I would likely be getting just bad endings.\nSo did I like Ellie's route?

The game is purely about romance and as of yet there are no sex scenes/nudity in the game, but I'm sure eventually one of you perverts reading this will work to solve that problem.\n\nThe main character is an outcast with no social skills [spoiler](relatable)[/spoiler] and no desire to pursue academic success (or any success for that matter). A lot of people in the reviews seem to have criticized him for his unstable and erratic personality, I didn't mind this aspect that much, but maybe it's because I am also a scumbag who despises society just like him. The personality of the girls are of the complexity of a 7 sided rubik's cube, just when you think you have them figured out, you find out there's more.\n\nThe story of the game despite being enjoyable is slow paced and really long. The choice system in the game is structured in a way that makes it really hard to get a good ending and most endings will be bad, this is because the game is very unforgiving of inconsistent choices, making it challenging and also realistic, (cause it do be hard to get that p*ssy when chasing after 2 chicks) some people may find this aspect lame, but I think it's way better than having a cheap story with easy choices just for some sexy scenes at the end.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome and the visuals might not be the best, but they're good enough to create immersion.\n\nThe biggest let-down for me was encountering a major bug that has prevented me from getting all the endings.

Encapsulating every kind of story, I\u2019m serious. I mean books, movies, TV shows, video games. Out of all of those, Love, Money, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll is my favorite. Now I don\u2019t want to write this review for only those who have played Everlasting Summer already (if you haven\u2019t, do it. It\u2019s free. It\u2019s cringe. But it\u2019s amazing.) But I will often make comparisons. And I want to kick it off with this one: In Everlasting Summer, all of the endings contributed to a greater theme, and were all tied together (in a way). Of course LMR has its themes, but I would not venture to say all the endings can be satisfyingly wrapped around each other with one message. I was missing that aspect, but I have to respect that it\u2019s a part of what made Everlasting Summer uniquely impactful. That is not to say that LMR DOESN\u2019T take advantage of the fact that it\u2019s a Visual Novel with many endings. It very much does, in that, each ending provides different bits of information that contribute to the events unfolding outside of Nikolai\u2019s perception. That\u2019s something to love about Soviet Games. You HAVE to piece together the bigger picture.\n\nStory: As I outlined above- one of the appealing aspects of this game is the fact that you will have to read between the lines, analyze motives, and experience all the different endings to understand the big picture narrative as well as possible. Hell, you might be disappointed to know that there are not *that many* definitive answers throughout the game. (sounds familiar?) But that\u2019s a huge appeal. You\u2019re forced to come up with your own theories and develop them as you play the game. Aside from talking up my favorite gimmick, the story is phenomenal. When talking about the story though, I want to point out that there are different stories occurring in one playthrough. There is the behind-the-scenes narrative that relates to the forces putting Nikolai in danger, and the oh-so-infamous introspection from a Soviet Games main character and his relationship with himself, as well as the constantly evolving relationships with the girls around Nikolai. All of them are amazing, and I want to draw another Everlasting Summer comparison here: Nikolai\u2019s relationship with himself and his own thoughts are maybe not as compelling as Semyon\u2019s, but Nikolai\u2019s relationship with those around him are far better fleshed out and compelling. At the end of the day, this IS a dating simulator, but it\u2019s the best damn dating sim I\u2019ve ever read and in this regard, better than Everlasting Summer.\n\nCharacters: Phenomenal. I don\u2019t want to dive into how I think all the main characters are exceedingly well written (down to their backstory) or how much depth they all have (a lot) and how well their emotions are portrayed cleverly by their thoughts, words AND actions (they are). Despite some of the characters seeming annoying and nonsensical at first, every single word and action is justified by some point or in some ending. That is the most important thing. But what I really appreciate about LMR as well is that there is clever use made of side characters, and the impact they have on Nikolai. Across the character board, LMR sweeps Everlasting Summer. ESPECIALLY the side characters, who actually have depth and importance in the greater narrative. The ones that show up once or twice, and impact Nikolai\u2019s perspective in a real, impactful way. Except for one. Who is inexplicably poorly written in, and obviously a character introduced by an IndieGoGo backer who bought the \u201cmake your own character\u201d tier.\n\nMusic: No instant bangers like Blow With the Fires, and to be honest, it took me some time for the soundtrack to grow on me. I chalk that up to associating the music with different scenes in the game that have a great emotional weight in them. That happened with Everlasting Summer too. Sweet Pancakes and Strawberry Jam will start out as an okayish VN background song, and by the end of the game, it\u2019s gonna have some serious weight. It\u2019s just a shame there are no instant bangers like Blow With the Fires or Everlasting Summer that are really good to begin with, and made phenomenal by their clever placement in the game and their contribution to the experience. Again, not bangers, but I really like Satellite Dishes, Hollow, Echo Avenue and Red Miata.\n\nArt: Wow, there was some kind of art direction occurring! Unlike in Everlasting Summer! Beautiful backgrounds by ArseniXC that look familiar, some CGs that have obviously had more work put into them than others, and animated sprites (fun!). The overall art direction and cohesiveness of visual effects is pretty good, but not perfect. Just look at those pictures up there though - they speak for themselves.\n\nDecisions: I acknowledge that the previous sections have been a jerk-fest. So I\u2019ll dedicate this one to honest criticisms I\u2019ve seen. Firstly, the best criticism I\u2019ve heard from others is the feeling that the choices presented do not impact the story in a drastic enough way. There is a specific way that the decisions in this game work, and it\u2019s similar to Everlasting Summer if you played that. The way I would justify the feeling that the game is \u201con rails\u201d is that Nikolai is supposed to be a full fledged character that will take most actions on his own, and this is a visual novel so obviously there are choices that you have to make for him. Perhaps where some of the decisions are should have been re-evaluated to alleviate that feeling, but I personally do not take issue with it. Secondly, the pacing of the decisions. That is another fair criticism, in that, at the beginning of the game, there are many many decisions, and then you get put on another path where there are less choices, and then another where there are even fewer. I understand the desire for the pacing to be different, but when you come to understand exactly how the decision making and branching story works in this game, I think it can be justified. I personally appreciate the unique way Soviet Games handles decisions, you may not though.\n\nConclusion: This VN will suck you in with its immersive world building, fleshed out characters (including an MC with real depth, as aggravating as he can be), solid music, beautiful art and that guilty pleasure DreamTale dialogue. Seriously, what makes Soviet Games my absolute favorite is the fact that the main characters are developed so well by their introspection lines. You will never get such an intimate understanding of a main character\u2019s personality in any media as you will in a Soviet Games game.\n\nThank you, Soviet Games. Since I read Everlasting Summer in 2017, I had been patiently awaiting the release of Love, Money, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll. I proudly donated on IndieGoGo. And read every IndieGoGo backer newsletter in my email since I was 16! I could only afford a game key back in 2017, but if I could now, I would go for that sweet signed copy and physical art book! Love, Money, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll truly takes advantage of so many of the things that made Everlasting Summer unique and awesome, and added much more polish! Since my two favorite works of fiction now are Russian, I have decided to learn it, and I have a clear end goal for all that studying! I have almost finished learning the Russian Alphabet! Maybe if I have it down on a DreamTale reading level in the next 6-7 years, I can read Soviet Games\u2019 next release in its original language first. Seriously. Please make another one. I will seriously back it right away!

But! There's always a but... Also, this contains spoilers, so yeah.\n\nI will skip the part where while I (and many others) have been waiting for years and raised nearly $100k, the dev was [url=https://vk.com/wall209302115_44335]shitposting[/url] and playing FIFA. I will also skip the part where the English version is riddled with typos and mistakes that are not fixed, unlike the Russian script. AND the part where I was promised exclusive wallpapers as a backer, but wasn't sent any.\n\nLet's start with CGs, shall we? There is a noticeable difference as the game progresses, especially if you compare the demo and the late-game full title. Two examples that are still fresh in my mind are a flashback with Himitsu and the crown thingy, where her face is just pitiful to watch, and the scene in the warehouse in Kagome's route. In general, it's like some of the CGs were made by different people, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case.\n\nStory - I enjoyed the Ellie - Kagome direction to an extent (will talk about why \"to an extent\" later), even though there're loads of plot holes and you're still left with little to no information about what happened even if you complete all the endings (which I did).\n\nYou probably never asked why \"to an extent\", but since you're reading this, I'll tell you anyway. If you follow a fandom or the development process and have seen the comments, you might rightly guess that it's the MC's indecisiveness. Some said that \"it's just how he is\", but there isn't much of a backstory, and when there is, it's not fully disclosed, again, even on all endings completed, and as such the motivation for Niko to be like this (a spineless retard) is unknown. Maybe if I knew why, I would've seen him differently, but the scriptwriter didn't bother and from this standpoint the MC only meets pity and resentment from me.\n\nHimitsu - Catherine route is cursed with this, most likely. This inability to make decisions might fit well into El - Ka one, and in most bad endings Niko fully deserved the ending itself, but Hi - Ca... Bloody hell. In Himitsu's route he pursues Kate, in Kate's - it's Himitsu, and so even after several choices that will, from Nikolai's words, make him steer clear of the other girl, you can be sure she will appear and get in the way, and MC will be too much of a doormat to do anything about it. I will ALSO skip that Catherine appears in all 4 routes to a relatively large extent, and if you're not aware, \"thinking about Catherine\" has become a meme in itself. Phew, the hard part is over.\n\nI want to summarise the positives, as I still think this is a somewhat decent/average title. The music is absolutely fantastic, and buying the soundtrack in worth every penny, especially for those who enjoy rock and retrowave. The backgrounds are surprisingly consistent in being nice, as well as the characters and animations. Throwing away some of the CGs and the MC's behaviour, it's really good. But unless you're a fan of action with turbulent romance mixed in and loads of drama, I cannot recommend it. And if you are, there are better titles to convey that, like Ever17.\n\nThanks for reading! I have somewhat enjoyed this title, even if almost not at all, and I hope you will too if you decide to give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1661693177, "timestamp_updated": 1661693314, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763406693935394287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121369845": {"recommendationid": "121369845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134413098", "num_games_owned": 1356, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1661690921}, "language": "english", "review": "35", "timestamp_created": 1661690940, "timestamp_updated": 1661690940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.43182411789894104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121359316": {"recommendationid": "121359316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086838303", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 3966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3154, "last_played": 1662282988}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0433 \u044d\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u044b,\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438 ,\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u043e \u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435 Stopgame ,\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e \u00ab\u041f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u00bb.\n\u041f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e -

I can not NOT Recommend this game because as a game its a good product with story, art, music and characters some might like BUT...[/b]\n\nI really did not like main character, the situations & story as a whole. At the moment of writing this review I received 4/14 endings on my own playthrough without any guides or anything. ALL OF THEM ARE BAD ENDINGS. You may think I am making poor decisions but I can't agree with that. I am blaming who ever wrote the plot and designed choices. They are awful. Most of the times while I was reading all of this and making decisions I was frustrated. I was mad at main character and mad at the game based on awful decision options.\n\nMusic was fine. For example, Everlasting Summer OST & songs hit right to me and I've instantly connected with them. So far they resonate with me and I will easily recognize them. Can't say\n\n[b]Was there anything good ?[/b]\nYes, art and animation was great. Definitely quality work. There were some interesting UI concepts like rewinding. UI Design was also great. I was surprised.\n\n[b]Was I disappointed ?[/b]\nYes, absolutely! Nothing in this game connects with me. I don't want to repeat this experience again (on contrast, I would replay Everlasting Summer again). As I said, main character with all the dumb (in a bad way) situations & decision options was the main reason I didn't like the game. Story could also be much better.\n\n[b]UPD 1:[/b]\nI still haven't completed all the endings but I came to conclusion. All bad endings are really depressing but most good ones are good. Possiblly my review will stay \"Recommended\" but I have no wish to get back to the game to complete other endings :/\n\nP.S.

While a couple of scenes here and there looked unfinished and there were a few translation errors, mostly everything was polished. Particularly I'm impressed with the amount of effort they put into creating the models. Not only do side characters get their own character models and expressions, but even some one-off characters too so you're not just talking to an empty background most of the time. The music was good, good enough that when it repeats, it's not annoying to listen to. \n\nNikolai is definitely a different protagonist than those in most VNs I'm familiar with, having a distinct, stubborn personality. He comes across like a jerk at times, which can take some getting used to. Most of the characters are fleshed out, and I found myself enjoying each girl's plotline for different reasons. My first playthrough took me about ~17 hours at a comfortable pace, so this is not a short VN by any means (though subsequent playthroughs will obviously be shorter). \n\nIf you're looking for a long \"dating sim\" VN with a good story and serious, sometimes balls-to-the-wall tone, then I'd definitely recommend this.

I'm however many hours in (12?), and I still haven't reached an ending. Well, I did, but it was an early bad ending, so I reverted to save and changed my choice. I think the biggest problem with it is it's just too long. I feel like it's been going on for forever, and the plot got lost in the weeds. For reference, I'm on what I think is going to be one of the Ellie endings, probably a bad one. However, the first 8 or 9 hours I played, I was really liking it and genuinely couldn't wait to get back to it whenever real life made me take a break, so I can't say the game is bad, it just seems to get a little odd toward the end, at least the ending I'm on (assuming I've even near the end, it's hard to tell).\n\nI hope I have more to say about it as I play more. I do plan on continuing to play it, but I am not enjoying it as much as I did earlier.\n\nAlso, heads up, if you want the achievement for watching the credits all the way through, get up and do something else while they're playing. Watch a movie or something. They are quite literally 2 hours long.\n\nEdit: Finally finished it. Wow, honestly gets a lot better toward the end.

If you want to see what this studio can do producing short of Clannad level writing/story telling, go through the Ellie and Kagome routes first. There is a clear, but understandable set of problems/events that the main character goes through for these two. It's honestly the shining light of this visual novel. The real problems come when you hit the Himitsu and Catherine routes. The premise of these two routes are still really good. Where they fall short is through the decision making of the main character. I my opinion there isnt enough preface to Catherine being this huge divide in Nikolai's life. You get some context in their version of a prologue, but nothing more than a vague first love interest. It's very frustrating attempting to go down Himitsu's path but still having the main character hold such strong desire to love Catherine, without very much justification for his thoughts or actions. Thats where I believe that this game falls on its face. Theres just too much priority placed on Catherine, which gives off a forced and nonsensical nature to Nikolai's thoughts and actions. Honestly if they'd clean up Catherine's and Himitsu's routes by taking a different perspective and non pragmatic approach for Nikolai, I think this game would easily be recommended by 95% or more of the community here. Overall I still think this game is a good buy. The graphics are top notch for a VN along with the interesting art style and great music.

Long story short, this game is complete, utter garbage.   Why? Reasons stated down:\n\n1. The main character is a complete cuck, by both Russian and anime standards, leading a very prestigious life (pretty much like a king or a son of a Russian oligarch), attending a prestigious school, having almost 0 obligations other than getting his pathetic body to wake up in the morning and move it to school without the need to even learn, managing to somehow even look European despite being a Russian, having a very beautiful, and an extremely patient girl love him without being oblivious to it. All he does with the aforementioned things is just waste them and ruck up in the worst ways possible, his interactions with people, and the world can be summed up to two things: Lying and complaining. He lies to everyone, at any time, even when it's completely unnecessary, which is most of the time, even to himself, believing his own lies to be true like a real Russian. And after that he just whines about how everybody else is either cruel or too boring to grace his ungrateful self with his attention (Himitsu, Kyosuke), and then bashes Japan (in his own mind, of course, can't afford anyone to talk back and point out that he's just projecting Russian problems on them) and puts down people that care about him to feel better about himself, while willingly, without the need to do that, humiliating himself before everyone that doesn't care about him or wants nothing to do with him. Dostoyevsky tier. He does so much for them, and they don't care because they were completely ignorant of these delusions of grandeur and obligations in the first place.  Lives like a king, and does this with his life, the worst anime characters in the worst visual novels and JRPGs I've seen are better characters than him because they usually start up bad but manage to become tolerable-to-normal people in the end, also usually helping people out on their way and managing to competently do what is asked of them.\n\n2. This partially relates to the first point because it has to do with the story, but is mostly gameplay-related. The main character is unable to ever make up his mind and his choices barely matter, if you choose to not do something, he still does it afterwards because he feels bad about people that don't care about him because he wants them to care, but gets only contempt in the end. Gameplay-wise, this is boring and frustrating, story-wise, it's just unrealistically dumb. An average Uzbek in a Russian school could pull off something as hard (in the protagonist's perspective, since everything easy is a struggle for him) as not caring about a girl that does not like him, but this Russian incubator emo has to obsessively chase girls that he chooses not to chase because he has an evident attention deficit.\n\n3. Redundant, superfluous, infuriatingly dumb thoughts of the main character. Excessively lyrical, never to the point and having close to no substance virtually all the time. It's realistic for a Russian, but it's very taxing on an educated Western person to read something like this. \n\n4. The way the characters are made displays how little frame of reference the developers have for the rest of the world, or even Russia.. The protagonist and a half-Russian, half-Japanese girl (Himitsu) look European, a supposed American character (Elile) has a Japanese surname despite looking European, Kyousuke looks like exactly like a fat Kazakh I've seen on a vacation in Kazakhstan, along with Michael. The other Japanese characters look like Turks on a various range from Kazakh to Tatar to Bashkir to Russian,  All of which is completely unfitting, not a single character looks realistic for their supposed heritage. All characters act, think, talk Russian and not Japanese or Western, which would be fine if it were a game set in Russia and not Japan, but it is what it is, and it's bad.\n\n5. Blatant racism and xenophobia are clearly seen in the game as the protagonist discriminates against people of American and Japanese heritage, or seeks to demean them to feel good about himself, or justify himself. Everyone around him is bad but he's the only one that is good. It serves no narrative purpose, he can easily remain a whining schmuck without discriminating against people on account of ethnocultural background and generalizing them.\n\n6. Subtle war propaganda for the Russian state, the inevitable main storyline makes you cross paths with a girl singing in a band called \"Z FeelZ\", showcasing a clearly outlined symbol of the Russian aggression against the Ukraine, and encourages you to want to chase her and appreciate her music, cheap song sung in an unfitting and strongly noticeable Russian accent for a character that's not even supposed to be Russian. The game script, as well as the main character tries to talk you into accepting that Russians are innocent and everybody else is just out for them, which so coincidentally happens to be the same narrative the warmongering Russian state propaganda pushes on its people.\n\n7. No voiced lines. There is a lot, and I mean a LOT of effort put into irrelevant background details like animating random things, or making fitting ambient sounds, but close to nothing has been done for things that really matter, like the story, or making voiced lines or serviceable main characters, unless of course it has all gone in accordance with what was desired - a boring, stupid, annoying, racist, xenophobic depiction of how Russians perceive the outside world, filled with Russian insecurities. \nThis game should not be on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1661017264, "timestamp_updated": 1661017332, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414668262004852295", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120948833": {"recommendationid": "120948833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053250288", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2134, "last_played": 1695950958}, "language": "english", "review": "This game speaks to me on a very personal level.  While I was not in Tokyo in 1987, I was definitely a teenager in a rich kid's school in the United States - Los Angeles.  Both my parents worked for a defense contractor; one of the big, spooky ones where they couldn't talk about their work and when we traveled, we had to check in with the Consulate as both had high security clearances.  (Not gonna say which one, and they weren't murdered)  The parallels and the relation to my own life is eerie.  This game gets so much right, it is perfect and immersive to me...except when they get a few little things wrong.  Those little things in an otherwise perfect game, are a little jarring to someone who actually was around AND a teenager in 1987.  Some of the things the characters say aren't things we said back then.  Certain things didn't exist.  Other things did.  Not going to nitpick this great game because by and large I enjoyed it - to the point where I could \"what if\" My own Katty-Chan, my own Himitsu, my own Kagome, and my own Ellie-San.\n\nMy own Ellie-San was never interested in me.  Never spoke more than a few sentences at a time.  She married another rock star.\n\nMy own Himitsu, I married - and she tired of me.\n\nMy own Katty-chan married Michael, which was devastating to me.\n\nAnd I never really had a Kagome that I recognized. Edit:  Yes, yes I did.  I remember now with sadness and more than a little shame:  I never really gave her a chance (she was contrary like Kagome, which, to be fair, was kinda irritating to me at the time).  I probably should have paid a lot more attention to her and less to the other girls; maybe my life would have turned out differently.\n\nI told you the parallels were striking.  This game gave me an almost-perfect portal to the past.\n\nAlmost.\n\nSometimes it is painful to remember how stupid you were, the clues you never saw at the time, only in hindsight, and sometimes it seems like just yesterday you WERE that person.  But that was thirty-five years ago.\n\nSure it hurts, but the brilliance of this game is that it TOOK ME THERE.  And I cannot express enough how wonderful that is, with all the emotional ups and downs that go with it.\n\nEven the little touches like the VHS-like bars on the transitions and the fast-forward - awesome stuff that most people these days wouldn't realize are Easter eggs for the people who lived during that time and actually did those things.\n\nSo thank you, Soviet Games, for another hit that managed to make me cry.  The memories are still there.\n\nI've gone through all the playthroughs, but I think I'm going to go through them again.\n\nBecause memories.\n\nI miss those days.\n\nAnd it's a reminder that I don't have my whole life ahead of me anymore.  My life, my \"future\" has become history, mostly forgotten, occasionally remembered, and sometimes accurately portrayed.\n\nI can forgive the typos, some of the weird syntax issues I know come from translating Russian to English, but some of the tech moments are...jarring.  \n\nBut again, while they are on my mind, I'm not going to complain about the few flaws in perfection otherwise.\n\nGameplay is similar to Everlasting Summer.  Consequences of choices are sometimes obvious, sometimes not.  Text is verbose, but the right combination of analysis and emotion that is the hallmark of those weird late-teen school years.  Far too many \"Yup, I felt like that\" moments to even count.\n\nDunno if you will like it, but I did.  Very much.  It's my own private portal into history.  MY history.\n\nEdited 2/9/2023", "timestamp_created": 1661013961, "timestamp_updated": 1675976940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698100030422210693", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120941766": {"recommendationid": "120941766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054492233", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 265, "last_played": 1667576142}, "language": "english", "review": "My semi-adult degenerated mind was not ready to handle the complexities of teen angst.

Although the visuals and music are quite good, pretty much everything else is horrendous. Virtually every character in LMR is insufferable in every sense of the word, from Nikolai himself (ESPECIALLY him), to the 4 \"heroines\", to nearly every major side character. The story-lines are poorly paced, with several elements in each of the routes that are either introduced and never resolved, or are quickly dismissed, despite the game continuously trying to insist it's something that is important. This is also not helped in the length of the game, which, although impressive, quickly develops into a tedious slog. (Especially when a large portion of the game is Nikolai pointlessly spouting pseudo-intellectual drivel that contributes nothing or has no real relevance to what's actually happening.)\n\nAs for the driving forces of the routes themselves (the girls), they are possibly the worst heroines in any VN ever conceived. They all run the gambit from delusional to having instances of being downright mentally unstable, and have very few (if any) instances that lead you to develop any sort of connection/care about what happens to them. Even in the good endings, due to the development of the characters, the game ends up failing to evoke any sort of emotion, other than relief that it's over.\n\nAnd last, but most CERTAINLY not least, we have Nikolai. To compliment the terrible heroines, we have a protagonist that somehow, against all odds, manages to be exponentially worse. Nikolai has pretty much nothing redeeming about him.

If you've never played a visual novel, or are just a casual fan debating on whether or not you should try this out, I'd say wait just a little while. \n\nThe english translation (as well as many of the other language options, i suspect), needs a pretty decent touch-up. It's perfectly readable, but the unreasonable amount of typos and grammar mistakes can be a bit distracting. That's not a big deal with a free game like ES, but this vn is a very different beast from that one, and I think the devs need to direct some effort toward refining that aspect. They've also been pussyfooting around the matter of a patch to add 18+ content to the game. To me, and to plenty of other people, the presence or absence of that doesn't really matter all that much, the issue I think a lot of people have is the lack of consistent and clear communication about what Soviet Games intentions are when it comes to a patch. The 18+ patch for ES added a fair bit of content that was otherwise totally unavailable, and whether they are or aren't planning to do something similar with LMR, their lack of commitment isn't all that inspiring. It's a crazy time all around the world, though, so hey, no big deal.\n\nThose are the main non-story related downsides I can think of. Without going into spoilers, I'll just say that, as others have pointed out, the pacing and narration from the MC can feel a bit off at times. It's not an overwhelming, fundamental issue with the routes themselves, it's just something that creeps up on you now and then, usually in what feels like what should be the climax of a particular storyline. The synopses look great on paper, but it seems like they struggled at some points when it came to committing lines to the script. At some points, it feels like way too much. At others, not quite enough. It can sometimes feel like you know you're at the big moment of the story, where all the pieces of the puzzle are supposed to be falling together, but for some reason they just drag it out seemingly endlessly. I wouldn't go so far as to say there's a problem with filler here, but like I said, the pacing is way off at times. \n\nThe sheer variety available in the routes is what makes up for it. I'm honestly really impressed with that aspect of the VN, and commend Soviet Games for it. I've not finished all of them yet, but the ones I have finished left me feeling quite satisfied-- like I'd experienced something that was different enough from what I'd seen already to make it worth the time. Other than that, the music is great, character designs are a step up from ES, and the artwork is as beautiful and intricately detailed as ever. \n\nThis comes with strong recommendations for fans of Everlasting Summer, with the caveat that you should expect a story and experience that is a bit of a departure from it. I'm glad to have spent the time with it that I have so far, and I think this is one of those VNs that I'll come to appreciate and admire more and more as time goes on.\n\n8/10. easily a 9 with some updates for the translation.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1660620940, "timestamp_updated": 1660620940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564872562885284424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120681384": {"recommendationid": "120681384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368579644", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 1210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1165, "last_played": 1669145693}, "language": "english", "review": "//", "timestamp_created": 1660580881, "timestamp_updated": 1669145651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120669773": {"recommendationid": "120669773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442569688", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1661023002}, "language": "english", "review": "very good and enjoyable game", "timestamp_created": 1660565679, "timestamp_updated": 1660565679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479620844125747681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120662056": {"recommendationid": "120662056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138389235", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 943, "last_played": 1681989043}, "language": "english", "review": "\u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b", "timestamp_created": 1660552477, "timestamp_updated": 1660552477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120638154": {"recommendationid": "120638154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043709554", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2499, "last_played": 1693493342}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0422\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0420\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430, \u0444\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043d\u044b...", "timestamp_created": 1660511161, "timestamp_updated": 1660511161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120629115": {"recommendationid": "120629115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053913585", "num_games_owned": 882, "num_reviews": 248, "playtime_forever": 1877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1877, "last_played": 1660499795}, "language": "english", "review": "I pre-purchased the game back in April 2017 for $10.00 and I still regret doing it.

The main character is extremely unlikable, some girls you try to like but they just turn out to be way too crazy. I just don't understands who the target audience of this game is. \nAs someone who played a decent amount on visual novels in his life I would never recommend this. Poor writing partially because of way too many scenes with filler characters that don't progress the story.

After so many delays I was not sure what to expect, but god damn my expectations were fulfilled. Even though sometimes the story feels weird or ine might think Nick acts stupid and rude, I just forget about it because of the incredible emotional connections to the characters. Art is beautiful, animations truly help the characters feel more alive. And holy shit, the music is GODLIKE!!!! I can't remember another VN game with so much kickass music. I could just listen to the soundtrack.\n\nNegative aspects? Maybe I would prefer more connection about the music for the main character, a slightly more friendly points system and more hints about the 80s. I think the atmosphere of the 80s lacks a bit. Ellie's root feels a bit shorter and undertold, and bad endings are kinda... one-sided.\n\nBut these are just small rough sides.

"language": "english", "review": "Love, Money, Rock`n`Roll has been released in the worst time possible in terms of amount of people, who would like to familiarize itself with the game. And the studio`s name does make it more difficult. Russian culture is associated with fascism, occupation and destruction as were Italian and Japanese ones one day. Should I make a point that a nation`s culture is a complex entity even if it seems that this given nation is an embodiment of irrational evil? I`ll try to advocate for this game since it deserves more recognition than it`ll get.\n\nFirstly, yes, the game makes references to Russian and Japanese cultures from time to time. It would be odd, if there had been none, because the story revolves around Nickolas, russian teenager living in Tokyo in 1987. Have you heard of Dostoyevski? You can try a novel of his, you`re fond of grim Scandinavian criminal dramas. Secondly, no, this isn`t just anoher commie agitation crap. Authors occasionally drop snide comments on standard of living in USSR, its insidious agents and their methods.\n\nThe plot is pretty captivating in the first half of the game, and thrilling in the second (wherever your choices will lead you). I can recall two books that have left me with such a pleasant aftertaste after finale: Flowers for Algernon and Steins Gate. Have you dreamed of inhereting a house and a small fortune at the very dawn of your life, being attractive enough to enjoy implausible amount of attention from opposite sex? Well, there`s a fly in the ointment: you`re an orphan and an immigrant. Though, the latter is the least issue, the protagonist assimilated profoundly over many years. He could have enjoyed his school days and biochemestry (not as an elective subject), but great danger looms over him tied to his parents. Hackneyed, right? But no story should be judged by its opening.\n\nAlthough Nickolas is gifted in many ways, but in terms of emotional stability and wits he is ordinary at best. The novel strictly adheres to realism: no aliens, people stutter, behave irrational. Sometimes. Especially teens. The protagonist just loves his psedointellectual discourses. Don`t tell me that you were different in his age :)\n\nSlava Ukraini!

First i got a terrible ending about 2/3rds of the game, then i load back, played till end to get even more terrible one. But the reason i'm not recommending this is not for my salt, but simply because the choices in this game are vague as hell.\n\nLet me say this ; in most choices, literally, if the developers remove text and replace those choices with different colored buttons instead, you would have the same idea as of now, about roughly how those choices will have consequences. Hell, maybe colors of the buttons would give you a better idea about possible outcomes!\n\nI don't want to spoil, but through mid-game, of all the things you could have asked to made a choice -as a player- , the game presents a choice for a stupidly mundane phone call.\n\nSLIGHT SPOILERS WITHOUT NAMES:\n\nPerson asks Player : Do i call you tomorrow? (About some basic stuff)\nOPTION A : No, ill call you back : Results : You join a group, Person X is fine, some people brutally murdered\nOPTION B : Sure : Results : You DONT join group (why???) Person X's house BURNED DOWN (???)\n\nWho knows what brutal events happened on my playthrough because i didn't wash dishes or something? This is the only one i accidentally found cause i loaded back quite an hour or so. I also wanted to pursue Katya route but game NEVER gave me an option to go check on her or something ever. Literally most of the game, she was non existent until one point she came to say goodbye.\n\nAfter investing about 25 hours, i'm sorry but i can't really recommend this. But if you want to play it anyway, i suggest turning on \"HINTS\" at options menu to at least have some idea about your choices' influence on girls.

For the 10 dollars I paid for it during the preorder, I\u2019m satisfied thus far, but I also tend to walk into things with low expectations just by default because I enjoy the pleasant surprise I get when something really appeases my brain. \n\nFrom the beginning, it feels as if you are thrusted directly into the Catherine and Himitsu saga. Makes a bit of sense since the game has the two girls being predetermined relationships before the game begin, but I would have liked to see more integration of Kagome and Ellie. Even while playing the demo, it\u2019s hard to see how the choices could lead you away from Himitsu and Catherine in some capacity aside from a few essentially cameos of Kagome and Ellie at the beginning and a couple of appearances mid game unless you actively seek them(seeking out a route map feels fine enough in this situation imo if you are lost or desperate). \n\nNikolai is well\u2026just a guy. I\u2019ve witnessed worse protagonists in VNs and print media. He\u2019s rough, rude, quick to explode, can\u2019t seem to let things go, and sometimes lacks empathy, and while his circumstances shouldn\u2019t be an excuse for his actions or behavior, they do provide some context to them. He\u2019s a witty guy at times, and winded and over philosophical others. Sometimes(a lot of times) he doesn\u2019t make great choices, but hey, that\u2019s life as he would probably say. Honestly, it\u2019s kind of fun seeing him be a bit melodramatic with vices, but maybe that\u2019s because I, too, have a flair for the theatrics, I suppose. I do like his design though. It\u2019s not over the top, but he stands out to me. \n\nI don\u2019t really have much to say about the girls thus far, but their designs are appealing to me and I love the integration of the Live2D sprites. It was a nice thing to see when I revisited the demo a while ago. They add a bit of\u2026something to the game. Everyone has their own distinct look to them, and aren\u2019t too maximalistic in design. Same could be said about the side characters, everyone has a pretty good design without being overly distracting or out of place.\n\nThe backgrounds are absolutely phenomenal, too. Especially since there\u2019s chunks of dialogue with no sprite on screen. The UI itself is just nice too, I like it. \n\nMusic, too, was wonderful. Absolutely enjoyed it in the background. \n\nThe story is a bit, um, much sometimes while also lacking in some places. Reads fine, but sometimes it feels a bit like a rogue mystery romance AU gone wild. Or maybe even a soap opera at times. A lot of drama is happening at once and it happens very quickly. You wouldn\u2019t know it really from the title, but, things go south for Nikolai Anokhin very quickly in ways that are outside of typical teenage interpersonal drama. I\u2019m sure in the reread to get more routes, some of the information will feel repetitive to encounter, but alas, everything I\u2019ve read so far is new information to add to the canon of the story. I absolutely love the addition of having important cultural information that might not be known to an international reader highlighted in blue with a definition when clicked, especially as someone who isn\u2019t highly familiar with the culture of Japan or the USSR in late 80s or the mentioning of the occasional Russian classical literature.  \n\nI personally find the cliches and drama to be a bit more entertaining in this VN than I did Everlasting Summer, and you can tell there was a great deal of effort put into the game. Whether you find that effort to be wholehearted and worth the price is up to you. I\u2019d probably pay the 20 dollars for the game if I hadn\u2019t preordered it a while ago. Perhaps it\u2019s because I am a bit of a fool for silly teen drama with dramatic mystery overtones. It\u2019s not Riverdale level of tacky, that\u2019s for sure, but it definitely isn\u2019t for someone looking for a happy, upbeat feel good with some angst VN. It\u2019s about a teenage boy thrusted into a bunch of events he knew absolutely minimal about the details behind the scenes and having to pay the price for it, to the potential detriment of his personal relationships, some of them being romantic and messy at times. \n\nFurther thoughts to maybe be added when I complete one of the Ellie/Kagome routes or more. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1660305062, "timestamp_updated": 1660305062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550172984600067139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120487572": {"recommendationid": "120487572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030933049", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6289, "last_played": 1660856965}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n\n- Tokyo Rider\n- You can inhale cocaine from the breasts of the young lady\n- Music\n\nCons:\n\n- The game is not endless\n\nIf serious - game is not as deep as Everlasting Summer plot wise but raised in other directions (routes are huge!).

Even though it was super addictive with great atmosphere that sucked me in, there is a number of issues I'd like to tell you about.\n\n1. Choices and pacing. Normally you would expect your choices to have meaningful impact. You would also expect such choices scattered throughout the story in a balanced manner and be a driving force behind the events that unfold. However, in LMR the majority of your choices are made early on and from that point you're just a bystander - the ending/epilogue oftentimes gets more screen time than everything that preceded it. Furthermore, the choices do not impact the story in a meaningful and obvious manner. You can choose to stay at home but you will still go outside because the story is pretty much on rails. Oftentimes some minor choices that should have no impact on the final outcome will play the decisive role in it. In the end, it all boils down to a subtle point calculation which happens behind the scenes, and unlocking certain endings would be a struggle without a walkthrough. Mechanics of \"major\" and \"minor\" choices would feel much welcome here.\n\n2. Endings. Because the endings are mostly logically disconnected from your choices, getting them feels like reading different versions of the script rather than something cohesive. Ideally, different endings should help to piece the story together, and sometimes that even works. Most of the time, however, you will get 4 different explanations behind the same events based on your route, and you see the characters opening from very, very different sides. This makes it hard to understand what is canon for plot and character motivations - because they can end up super wholesome individuals or terrible monsters depending on whether you went to the bar or to the park. Bad endings are also the majority here, while a few good endings feel unrealistic, because of how much dragon killing and crazy plot twists are required to make them work.\n\n3. Routes. There are really just two, \"Himitsu - Catherine\" and \"Ellie - Kagome\". No matter which of the girls you go for you will largely face the same events and the same recurring rivalry theme between them. Even though it makes sense from the point of storytelling, it leads to you having to read through quite a lot of stuff for girls you aren't really interested in. Story-wise, one route is too much of a spy thriller and another one is too much of Romeo and Juliet, and struggles between superpowers and corporations are neither particularly engaging nor what you're likely here for. \n\n4. Characters. They're terrible. Starting from the MC who is supposed to be a 18 y.o. school boy but thinks and acts as a 45 y.o washed-up drunk. He has no hobbies, ambitions, or will to live, and the only thing driving him is his fear of being alone; and has no other way of engaging with anyone other than being a pathological liar and egoistical jerk. The girls follow suit, with each being her own flavor of pure toxicity. Engaging with them leads to being dumped by everyone, beat to death, shot, buried alive, imprisoned, impoverished or having to run away and leave everything he held dear behind - in no particular order.\n\nPlease refund me my 50 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1660295020, "timestamp_updated": 1660295020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 107, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845875382423400879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120465902": {"recommendationid": "120465902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822527759", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 119, "last_played": 1662415852}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite My steam only saying I've played 2 hours or whatnot.

People don't really seem to behave like... people. (Hilariously, the MC is described as \"throwing his hands up\" so often, you sort imagine everyone who's ever been within a meter of him having gotten slapped in the face at least once by this)\n\n- Storyline is poorly balanced between the various routes on a number of levels. \n[list]\n[*]On Himitsu's route, the storyline and the MC still seem to be focused on Catherine (actually in general the MC still seems to be a bit too obsessed with Catherine even deep into all the other girls' routes, but especially on Himitsu's route, sometimes you feel like you're still basically on Catherine's story).\n\n[*]As well, the intrigue, spy games and mysteries aren't really adequately explained/developed in any of the routes except Catherine's. And as those subplots form the background against which everything else happens, if you play any of the other routes first, you might be left kind of confused or with a lot of questions at the end. I played the Catherine route last, so I was left scratching my head on a lot of points for most of my playtime and that's actually why I played for so long since I tried to piece everything together from different routes. But even playing through all the non-Catherine routes, there will still be a lot of unanswered questions since those routes just have a lot of redundant information (at least for the spy games/intrigue subplots). On the other hand, once you play Catherine's route, you'll get a decent enough idea of most of the mystery/spy game subplots (as well as major spoilers for at least one other girl's route), meaning you also don't get the fun of piecing together the mysteries by playing through multiple routes.\n[/list]\n\n-Overly wordy and filled with rambling monologues. It's advertised that the game has over 500,000 words, but much of that is the MC's internal (or external) monologues, and it's often irrelevant to the plot and filled with annoying and not particularly deep pseudo-philosophizing (\"why do people like different colors?\"). The text could probably have been cut by 1/3 or 1/2 and that extra word count used to better develop the plot (see below).\n\n-Plot is undercooked. Despite the massive word count, a lot of the important plot moments are underdeveloped, and seem to fly by in an instant, and are not very well explained or set up. This is the case even after finishing Catherine's route. There are also significant plot holes (for example, [spoiler]it's mentioned that Catherine had a miscarriage. If that's the case, how would the MC's doubtless extremely wise and expert \"fatherly advice\" or whether or not she moved back to the US have made a difference? And yet a huge deal is made out of this in the story, as if they would have.[/spoiler])\n\nRandom minor annoyances:\n-Some of the Japanese names have significant errors - for example, with [spoiler]Akira Shinji[/spoiler], this character's surname and given name are actually both Japanese given names. Makes for a slightly annoying (or amusing) reading experience if you can speak Japanese or have experience with Japanese names. Himitsu would also make for a really weird/hilarious Japanese name, though it might be a Russian name or something, I don't know.\n\nOverall: 4/10", "timestamp_created": 1660233209, "timestamp_updated": 1660915634, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54317629337310791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120442997": {"recommendationid": "120442997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043399631", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 766, "last_played": 1669151314}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, I tried to like this game. After all, I waited the game for 6 years. Alas, the protagonist, Nikolai is so badly-written that I stopped counting how many times I facepalmed and cringed while reading his thoughts or his actions or reactions. His obsessiveness with Kate is rage-inducing at times. He himself is a very annoying self-centered brat who dares to doubt my decisions (while it's fun when it happens once or twice, the constant doubt just gets on my nerves). The girls (I haven't tried Himitsu/Kate route but I can already imagine how bad it can be) are truly disgusting. I wouldn't go into details to avoid spoilers but I doubt I'd ever be able to love a person like that IRL if I ever met them. And Kagome is probably the worst of the bunch. Or was that the point of the authors: to make the game as disconnected from the real life as possible?\nMost of the choices are very bland, super obvious and generic. I mean I wanted to hit 'good ending' with Ellie on my first playthrough and I managed it easily. When I played Everlasting Summer (the comparison here is inevitable, sorry), It took me several tries to finally get the ending I was looking for. And I cried and had some good laughs on the way there. LMR doesn't provide any of those in similar quantities. There are some good jokes but most of the time it's boring. \nI don't even know how the hell this game took 7+ years to develop. Sure, the visuals are great but the story is so bad that I just want to skip everything, get the achievements, uninstall the game, erase my memory and forget it ever happened at all.

If you played Everlasting Summer you'll probably be familiarized with a story driven game in which choices come seldom (though some times there are several in series) but affect a lot the plot so you have to be very concientious about each one leading to plenty of possible endings (most of them bad endings), which allows for the game to play with your feelings not letting you know if you made the

But in the end it turned out to be one of my favourite gaming/reading experience and I enjoyed it a lot. I tried other VNs (Doki doki, Grisaia etc.) however even though I enjoyed them somehow, they kinda failed to excite me about the story or the characters in the same way ES did. I was about to drop this genre for a while with occasional revisits to ES, but then I learned that LMR is going to be released soon (luckily for me I encountered ES relatively recently, so I didn't have to wait X years for the release of this new game). \n\nImmediatelly I tried the demo for fun, and quickly realised that's exacly what I needed/wanted to play and read. I got so into the story I was reading it until like 4 am until my gf came across to tell me I am probably retarded. I explored every possible option and put almost 20 or more hours just into the demo alone - that should be the first hint about how awesome this game is. It was way better unlike all the other novels I tried so far and the full game offers like 4 times more content just within the one chosen path. \n\nOf course this game is also way more complex and better than the original ES. It seems more mature and serious. The kickstarter money and time spent developing the story really is recognazible at first sight. CGs are no longer simple, characters backgrounds are well written. The whole story can be thrilling, is full of tension and romance with funny moments at the same time as well. \n\nI just finished the game for the first time and got Ellie's good ending. I am looking forward to explore the other girls paths and endings as all of them now seemed quite likeable and even intriguing (for example in ES I never really cared from the start about Ulyana or Miku and I just played their paths because I was a bit curious how they look like - but here I know now that I am really interested in all the heroines as each of them have their own charm and mysterious backstory. \n\nAlso I checked some of the early comments and I was surprised about the occasional dislike for the main character. I realise I am not exactly the target audience of the classic VN genre, but it always irritated me that the main protagonist in VNs is usually a completely blind idiot, who cannot understand why this particular woman is asking him to go for a naked swim together and then few chapters later is immensely surprised that the girl likes him. I get for who they are usually written for, but even so it always feels too much or extreme even. That's what I liked about Grisaia - the main protagonist kinda had some balls there.\n\n In LMR though, I liked how the main protagonist was thinking and reasoning a lot. Yes Nick had some outbursts and thought about Catherine a lot at the start, but honesly given the background of the story it makes perfect sense. He was in love with the girl, she suddenly left and he was recovering a year and a half from this breakup. And now imagine she's back - even if you would have already eyes for another girl, that would mess up with your head a lot. Also take into account the other mystery circumstances which start to affect our hero through the story and you have a textbook example of a candidate for a nervous breakdown or therapy. I still think he handled it quite well (with our help with the choices of course:)\n\nI don't want to write a novel here by myself too, so I will just highlight some other features or characteristics which I loved about the game:\n\nThe soundtrack is fucking awesome. Combination with the 80's synthwave (even more now with the Stranger things OST mania) and electric guitar rock is the ultimate combo. I truly plan to buy a guitar and learn some of the riffs for myself (I hope dozens experts on youtube will help a lot). \n\nI really like how each girl distinguishly differs from each other, but not by typical \"VN classes\" like tsundere, yandere but just by pure writing and their personality and background. Also it seems, that there is bigger rivalry between some girls more than with the others, which I honestly find brilliant. \n\nThe CGs are beatiful to look at and the animation is pretty cool too. At first it was a bit weird, but in the end I liked it more and more. \n\nIt's nice that there are actually some male friends of the protagonist as well, it looks more immersive. Also some lines from Kyosuke were the funniest moments in the game as I happen to have a similar friend into anime. \n\nEven though I know the characters are made up and it's just a simple story, you could really say the feelings you get from reading the novels are real. Like for a few days you can actually have a crush for a nonexistent girl and honestly I realised that it's fine to enjoy it, because there are just too few options for us men to enjoy some romantic content (my gf can just turn on netflix and it's full of love shows for women, but the target audience is clearly not me). \n\nAlso I don't read this to see cartooned tits, so I was not dissapointed by the lack of adult content let's say, especially when there are plenty lines and hints about characters having regular sex, so I am glad that it's not an eroge fixated only to describe some unrealistic sex/porn lines (which no one ever says during sex, maybe for fun), intercourse is just displayed as a normal part of a healthy relationship and again, I see this as a big plus. \n\nAll in all I think the story was full of plotwists, but just so balanced that it's not boring and in the same time not too crazy, so it is still somewhat believable like it could happen (well no, but it's not impossible let's say).\n\nI think it's definitely worth the money (altough I got it through preorder for like half the price - I would still pay the 20 euro without hesitation now when I know how much quality content there is) so if you are not sure, definitely give it a shot! \n\nPS. Maybe what I really enjoy about Soviet games studio's novels is that there is some European influence which makes their novels stand out among others and thus being somewhat unique, plus even the occasional philosophizing of the protagonist sometimes has something in it which can resonate within me.\n\nPSS. Of course my anime friend already found an 18+ patch on vndb (and yeah of course I am at least going to try it out geez I am not a saint).\n\nEDIT:\nAfter finishing all the routes, I have to admit, that the two main paths are seriously different, which can have it's pros and cons.\n\nPros - it's great that you are reading a completely new content, and I really liked the plot twist with Catherine's reasons for her departure and early behaviour. This path also seemed somewhat more realistic. Himitsu's romance surprised me in quality, it's really much better written than I expected. \n\nCons - Nick's behaviour is kinda different within each main path, especially during Catherine's route and to be honest now I get some of the hate for our hero - he drinks way way more here (and that comes from someone who does not mind hanging out over a beer or so) and he really argues a lot with almost everybody around him. I still stand for my words above, that it still seems kinda logical due to the circumstances, however the differences in his behaviour are truly significant in comparion to the Ellie/Kagome path. This seems to be a pity, because in my opinion the hero's psyche or whatever we want to call it should be more consistent throughout the whole novel. Also Kagome's path is well written but the main plot twist is kinda stupid to an extent, that I was not let's say dissapointed but moreover almost angry with it. \n\nIf I were to review all possible paths (not just the heroine's characters but mostly the writing), it would go like this I guess:\n\nEllie 11/10 pure perfection\nHimitsu 10/10 good mix of romance and drama\nCatherine 6/10 her background story is great, but Nick is an idiot here\nKagome 5/10 well written but main plotwist is utterly retarded", "timestamp_created": 1660120001, "timestamp_updated": 1661274714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637550175189971924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120374095": {"recommendationid": "120374095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052259269", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7073, "last_played": 1660267715}, "language": "english", "review": "I preordered this game years in advance.

Disney.\n- Crisp smooth animations and good cut-scene art.\n- Story has strong beginning and middle, does a good job of setting the atmosphere and tone for the rest of the game. Really sucks you into the world and the time period.\n- The girls are all unique with their own characteristics, you won\u2019t find the typical VN stereotypes here.\n- A E S T H E T I C - if Japanese 80s style environments are your thing, can\u2019t go wrong here.\n- Music is top notch, seriously great tracks, all bangers.\n\n[b]The Meh:[/b]\n- Translation issues (probably patched by now)\n- \"Brevity is the soul of wit\" apparently the writer didn't get this message cause dialogue can drone on and get repetitive. I swear characters have the same conversations/arguments multiple times.\n- Choices... unless you have the Russian walk-through, which you can find in 'guides', it\u2019s hard to determine which direction your character will go. The game is based on a points system, so your choices can add or subtract points from your desired ending, and it isn't always clear.\n- Sometimes the music doesn\u2019t fit the tone of the current scene. The Music will be fast paced or suspenseful, giving the indication that something interesting is about to happen, but then it doesn\u2019t. Its best just to have silence then the wrong track.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n- So, I played the Kagome ending so far and if it\u2019s any indication of the other paths, then I have some concerns. The ending of that path was... disappointing. It sort of just happened. It built up to, what appeared to be, a very interesting climax that you thought was going to go somewhere, but then it suddenly resolved itself. I don't want to spoil anything but the huge conflict literally ends with a phone call and a walk in the park. No, I\u2019m not being facetious or using the phrase \"a walk in the park\", I'm being literal. How it happened, who the new characters were, what happened to the old characters, and how they came to be there, are all left a mystery and it was very difficult to follow. Is this due to a translation issues? Does this make more sense in Russian then English? I doubt it as the rest of the game was pretty easy to follow until that point. The ending left questions that were completely unanswered and some serious plot holes: [spoiler] What happened to Akira and what deal did he make with the KGB? I thought Akira was locked up, why did he suddenly appear in the park? Why did Jun stop going after you and Kagome after the KGB took Akira? If Akira went with the KGB, why did Jun not seek revenge on you for being responsible for giving Akira to his enemies? Who the fuck is Mikhail? Were Nikos' parents actually assassinated or was it just an accident? Were his parents\u2019 defectors from the Soviet Union or were they spies?  [/spoiler] so many questions but the game would like to pretend that it all wrapped up nicely. Which is especially annoying cause I had such high hopes for the ending and hoped that many of my questions would be answered.\n- The story arc I followed also makes a big deal about your parents, spoiler ahead: [spoiler] being dead. At a certain point in the game, it is revealed that the Kobayashi corporation, Kobayashi Jun\u2019s company, could have been responsible for the death of your parents over a year and a half ago, killing them because he believed they were corporate spies sending information back to the USSR. So what does the protagonist do when he finds this information out? Well\u2026 kinda nothing. When he meets face to face with Jun, the topic is barely brought up, except to reveal that Jun believed them to be spies. I honestly expected this to be a bigger plot point, considering how big of a deal it is. The potential was there to make this into a revenge story where the protag avenges his dead parents and saves the girl or dies trying, or something along those lines; and I know it\u2019s a trope at this point, but Chekhov's Gun dictates that SOMETHING should be done with that plot device, or else why bring it up so often. [/spoiler]\n- As stated in \u2018The Good:\u2019 The girls are all unique with their own characteristics, you won\u2019t find the typical VN stereotypes here. That\u2019s a double-edged sword, as\u2026 phew, some of these girls have iiiiiiiiissues. As another reviewer said, picking your favorite girl is like picking your favorite poison.\n- The story is more \u201creactive\u201d then \u201cactive\u201d. As in, things will happen to the protagonist, and he will react to them. Very little \u201cactive\u201d planning is going on. Having a reactive story in the beginning is fine as the protag is a HS student and needs to adjust to the events of the plot, but at some point, you\u2019d expect the protag to be more active in directing the plot his way and controlling his destiny. Any time active plot decisions happens from the protag, its poorly planned, and sometimes nonsensical. Maybe that\u2019s to be expected because he\u2019s a HS student, but it\u2019s disappointing that more clever writing wasn\u2019t incorporated into the characters decisions.\n\n[b]The REALLY Bad:[/b]\nOMG shut the fuck up about Katherine, seriously, shut the fuck up. You can\u2019t make me care about your ex-gf if she\u2019s a frigid bitch every time she\u2019s on screen talking to you. I\u2019m literally almost at the end of the Kagome arc, and this fucker is still talking about Katherine.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nI recommend this game lol. I know it sounds like I criticized it a lot, but that\u2019s only because the game really sucked me in until the ending, where I was left going \u201chuh?\u201d which is never a reaction you want from your reader. It\u2019s one thing to have a bad ending, but its another thing to have a confusing one where you have to reread dozens of lines of dialogue to find out where you are and how you got there. Maybe I need to play the rest of the girls\u2019 \u2018good\u2019 endings to get a better understanding of the plot, but from what I\u2019ve seen so far, the dev should have delayed the game another month or two to iron out some story elements, and it would have been a masterpiece. This game reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 3 in terms of how it made me feel. Fantastic game with excellent story and great narrative, only to fall apart at the end because of strange writing decisions.\n\nVerdict: Solid 7/10, maybe 7.5", "timestamp_created": 1660022567, "timestamp_updated": 1660024654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569795429706573486", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120300588": {"recommendationid": "120300588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202672485", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 371, "last_played": 1660589903}, "language": "english", "review": "Visuals and music are good, but story is bad.

Going through one route was definitely an adventure!\n\nBefore I actually start this, I have to say that you should only take seriously reviews that were made with WAY more that 10 hours by the time of review. That's not nearly enough time to read adequately and finish a single route.\n\nThe writing (English translation, not original Russian):\n\nUsually characters in visual novels are very two dimensional, generic, and sometimes outright boring. In LMR you won't find these stereotypical personalities, such as the tsundere, the hard worker, and the lazybones. Each character has been created with their own in-depth backgrounds which form the characters into who they are at the start of the VN, and they can change along the way, too. A great example of this is the main character himself. Many people seem to complain about the character, saying that he's too hotblooded, volatile, etc, however anyone who has experiences at least some of what he has will understand him. His background isn't just a plot device, it formed the MC into the extremely stressed vegetable he is at the start of the game, and you see him mellow out by the end. If you don't like the complexity of characters and just want to read more VNs full of Mary Sues, this VN probably isn't for you, but it is for me. \n\nTL;DR: The characters are onions. 10/10\n\nWhen it comes to reading (it isn't an audiobook, so no voice acting), it is for the most part simple enough. However when it gets to the more philosophical parts, it can get a bit complicated, however it really isn't a significant blow to the VN. For the English translation (important to note that this isn't a big developer company full of professionals), there are some grammar mistakes and typos, but these can generally be ignored and don't hamper the reading experience much.\n\nTL;DR: Easy enough to read well for dummies. 7/10\n\nThe plot of LMR clearly developed way before its setting. Like the characters, it is a product of past events, and like the characters, it's full of layers. It's a really well crafted, detailed story that you won't get all the answers for in one sitting, and I doubt questions that aren't answered ever don't have answers due to the detail in the craftsmanship. \n\nTL;DR (somehow): The story is just as onion-y as the characters are. 10/10\n\n\nMusic:\n\nThe OST is absolutely amazing! Fantastic! Boss! Sometimes TOO good! At times I just have to stop whatever I'm doing and start busting out some moves! On a more serious note, the OST is excellent, there's an extremely wide variety of songs so you won't be listening to exactly the same thing for an hour. And you can listen to the songs in the gallery which is even better cause I love the OST of LMR.\n\nTL;DR: Read the paragraph. 12/10\n\nOk, this review is getting way too long so I'm gonna shorten it from here on.\n\nThe sound design is great, too. It organically integrates into the scenes, making the atmosphere work well. A few tweaks here and there could've made it a tad better IMO. 9/10\n\nArt:\n\nThe backgrounds are fantastic. I am a big fan of the visuals of LMR, on top of that the backgrounds are all animated! Coupled with great sound design, it really helps to make it feel like the world is alive. 10/10\n\nThe character \"sprites\" are also all animated, making them feel also a lot more alive. For those who don't like it, I'm pretty sure there's a way to disable animations in the settings. And I love the designs! They're really well made! 10/10\n\nThe CGs are also all great, the artists definitely put in a lot of work and you can tell! I am a really big fan of the art style of LMR, if you couldn't tell. Many CGs are also animated, so an even bigger bonus! 10/10\n\nMy final verdict: 10/10. Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll is an absolute masterpiece of a visual novel. It really emphasises the \"visual\" part and greatly emphasises the \"novel\" part, so if all you want is the generic VN with the predictable plot, simple characters and unfunny humour just for the horny points, this VN is not for you.", "timestamp_created": 1659956725, "timestamp_updated": 1659961674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769353866577148438", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120267159": {"recommendationid": "120267159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022674465", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 576, "last_played": 1660598232}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] The story was written a week before release.

This game was absolutely filled with love over many long years of development. \n\nI have decided to change my review after I have had 0 interest in coming back to the game.\n\nLook: This game is far from perfect. It has some glaring issues and some major differences from Everlasting Summer (for those who played). This however does not mean that it is a bad game. Some of the issues can be fixed with 1 or 2 patches, others may never be fixed. TLDR; here are the Pros and Cons.\n\nCons:\n- One of my big issues is that the main plot. The story feels like it was rehashed over and over and over again in the long years of development. While the story itself is well written, it misses the mark like it's sister story, Everlasting summer. Being railroaded down 4 different options with 0 meaningful interactions between characters with left me with a bitter taste more than a sense of satisfaction. I felt this game could use different endings that add intrigue (see the Yulya, Miku, and Seymon endings from ES). \n- Some \"cut scene\" animations do look rushed and not polished, leading to unsettling and almost hollow looking characters.\n\nPros:\n- Great Music\n- Beautiful Art for background scenes\n- Great replayability (if looking to do all endings or even just more than one route)\n- Will engross you in at least one story line for at least 4-9 hours \n- IMO convincing, believable, characters.\n- IMO great idea and story for a VN, interesting - if not crazy - story lines\n\nNeutral:\n- Atypical anime art style. I personally enjoy it, your mileage may vary.\n- English translation does have some grammatical errors, but they are easy to look around.\n- The main character is not a giga-chad. He is written with his own background, his own issues, and a whole life before the game takes place. He very much may not be a character that everyone will like. He is imperfect, along with every other character in the game.

For its seven years of development, Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll was shaping up to be lightning in a bottle. And for seven years, I was confident that LMR would rock the western VN audience. And with each devlog, which I religiously followed, this confidence only grew. CGs were showcased and tracks from the OST released, proving the skill of the artists and composers beyond any doubt. It looked as if the game would quench those years of hype that had accumulated. The chain was was proving to be very strong. \n\nFor a game that has an atmosphere so incredibly intoxicating, for a game that looks so good, has music tracks that stick in your mind, and offers so much narrative potential, the scenario writer thoroughly fumbled every opportunity to take the story to exciting places, to utilise the setups for satisfying payoff or to play with the unique quirks of the setting, and more inherently problematic, failed to have his characters embark on adventures, to change and grow and complete their goals. In a sense, it has a beginning and a middle, but no end. Aragorn rises from obscurity as a mysterious ranger, wrestles with his sense of duty and his destiny as King of Gondor, and then doesn't do anything about it at all.\n\nThe scenario writer, as skilled as he is, no matter how much introspection and monologue is served, as the most important link in the chain, he failed to capitalise on anything the scenario actually offered. Any fan could suggest more compelling ideas and exercise the full range of creative motion that the writer did not, which is why I look forward to when workshop support is released. Hopefully then, I can find a group of like-minded people to work with to realise this wasted potential one day. \n\nOverall, LMR is a great experience, with a woefully under utilised setting, charming characters, an incredible soundtrack and art that all together create an atmosphere second only to one other Visual Novel, of which almost makes up for the flaws of its narrative. \n\nThen go and play Yakuza 0 for a nice follow up.

I am not well-versed when it comes to visual novels. In fact, this is my first time encountering this developer, Soviet Games. And I am intrigued when I found out that they have a very well received game, Everlasting Summer, under their belt. \n\nIt has also amazes me how long this game has been in works. Apparently, this game has been in Kickstarter in 2016. Though I am only been aware of its existence for a few days, I am glad to know that it was able to finally see a release after all those years of development.\n\nThose background arts took me back to the good old ways of hand drawn anime style. This time around with a little bit of modern touch as they come alive/animated at some point. The characters are also fully animated during dialogues, which I really appreciate when compared to the other visual novels. They feel more alive when compared to others wherein the character are static and in a blink of an eye, changes their posing throughout the dialogues. \n\nI am definitely not yet halfway through the story, but I am eager to find out what ending I\u2019ll be achieving in my first playthrough. Please take note that there are no hidden Steam Achievements, therefore if you have taken a quick peek on them then you may already have an idea on some possible endings. Which I hope I am wrong, since I would\u2019ve slightly spoiled myself if what I\u2019m seeing based on the graphics of these achievements is what I am thinking. \n\nProbably my only gripe with this game is that there are no any type of voiceovers. I wasn\u2019t expecting any fully voiced dialogues, but some sort of voice lines that align with their dialogues would\u2019ve been such a better experience. Hearing the characters giggling, grunting, groan, etc. would definitely make this visual novel more immersive in my opinion.\n\nPersonally, I think the UI for this visual novel fits with what they are trying to do. It is not overly cluttered and the little effects they have in between are a nice touch. They even included two options for the \u2018Appearance\u2019 of the game: Classic or Immersive, with the latter adding some level of fuzziness to the screen. And then there\u2019s also two options for \u2018GUI Style\u2019: Classic or Modern, which I think only changes the settings screen as far as I know. \n\nRecalling dialogues are also easy to do. For someone like me who tends to miss click and accidentally moved to the next dialogue, knowing there is an easy way to re-read previous line is such a relief. I know it\u2019s not a big deal to some and its probably been done more often than not, but I am happy report this game contains this little quality of life feature.\n\nIn general, I highly recommend this game to anyone who are looking for a visual novel with a rich story, great soundtrack, interesting characters, and a top-notch artwork/art style. What captivated me towards this visual novel, was specifically the art style.\n\n[code]For other Anime related reviews, please [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40633543/]follow us at Discover Anime![/url][/code]", "timestamp_created": 1659881596, "timestamp_updated": 1659881636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120214961": {"recommendationid": "120214961", "author": {"steamid": "76561199074201321", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 441, "last_played": 1668683766}, "language": "english", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430!!!", "timestamp_created": 1659872541, "timestamp_updated": 1659872541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769246816635132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "120199829": {"recommendationid": "120199829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101294117", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1663202947}, "language": "english", "review": "The short version: In my opinion it's a very well crafted visual novel and fully worth grabbing if you enjoy visual novels with great music and stories. That said let me get to the long version.\n\nThis is one that I've been waiting for since they first announced it a while ago. As a big fan of Everlasting Summer I was excited to see this visual novel come to fruition, and with such polish and pizazz as well! Makes it feel worth the wait. I do hope people don't judge this one too harshly as Everlasting Summer kind of set a high bar for our friends at Soviet Games, and I feel like it might be harshly criticized based on that... With that said, I have to say I'm honestly really impressed with how it's turned out so far. \n\nFirst is the animations that I wasn't expecting, from the character movements to the backgrounds. They're fluid, give extra life to the visual novel, and honestly are just very pleasing to watch while reading. Plus all the amount of details in the backgrounds are pleasing to sweep through (at least to me since I like to look around a new area before I read more)\n\nNext is the music. I love it to put it simply. The soundtrack is honestly just full of bangers and really set the mood in several scenes. This is one area I feel is a large improvement over Everlasting Summer. Plus several of them have an apparent 80's vibe about them which I personally really like.\n\nThe story so far is fairly great as well! Lots of different options to choose from and I've seen a couple unexpected twists so far that have kept me delving further to see what would happen next.\n\nI give this visual novel high praise but I will say that the main protagonist isn't one I can as easily relate to as someone like Semyon from Everlasting Summer. This could also be because Everlasting Summer's protagonist was a lot more open ended in their thinking compared to our main protagonist Nickolai. In that I mean our choices made in Everlasting Summer more or less would be reciprocated in the inner dialogue of the protagonist compared to our man Nickolai in this visual novel. With that said, I wouldn't consider it a bad thing as this visual novel doesn't reach as far out to the obscure as Everlasting Summer did. And that likely might not even be the point of the visual novel as it is set in a completely different setting, with new people, and a seemingly intriguing story to tell on it's own accord. All in all though, I do kind of wish our boy Nickolai was a little bit more relatable in some of the choices made.\n\nWith all this said, I do highly recommend this to anyone like myself who doesn't read too far into the visual novels and just enjoys a good read with nice visuals and music to boot!

Now, that's an important information, if one tries to understand why so many people might feel betrayed or, at the very least, frustrated. The majority of players, however, can agree on undisputed quality of art and soundtrack. Writing though is where things get really spicy and complex. I believe It's been debated since the very release up until now, tons of brown sauce was spilled and whatnot, which is honestly understandable... in a way, to a certain extent. \nI have to admit that It's really hard to put many things aside for the sake of keeping oneself from biased opinions as people tend to be hard-stuck into dealing in absolutes, but my personal take is that \"the point system to get a certain ending\" very well might be a dead-end rigid mechanic for the VN genre as a whole. If we look back at the timeline of each gaming genre development, we can see how specific game mechanics got implemented and tested for survivability. Regardless of their (mechanics) significance, it is undeniably required for them to be improved, renovated, even discarded and reframed for the new iteration of projects so the given genre can evolve and bring new experience. In case of LMR particularly, I'm not entirely sure which route was the most optimal. However, it is evident to me that the more detailed and complex story you try to tell, the more brutal and limiting are the gimmicks of the point system. It gets to the point where this particular system forces its limitations and holds the plot hostage, so you're trapped in searching for bizzare compromises (honestly, can't even imagine how hard and brain-wrecking it can be). Therefore, I think the community needs to debate more about core issues with the point system and search for a better solution and alternatives rather than throwing feces at each other like monkeys, only then we might get some productive dialogue and conclusion.", "timestamp_created": 1659783661, "timestamp_updated": 1695191016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Absolutely worth it. I got to see the development as it grew from being a generic 2D visual novel to this dynamic living game. I was a huge fan of Everlasting Summer and the music and writing was always top notch! Perhaps since this isn't a Japanese developed VN it escapes the common tropes and story elements making the Soviet Games VNs just hit differently.

This fatal step leads to huge human losses and undermines the foundations of the established system of international security. The responsibility for unleashing a new war in Europe lies entirely with Russia.\n\u201cThere is no rational justification for this war. Attempts to use the situation in Donbass as a pretext for launching a military operation do not inspire any confidence. It is clear that Ukraine does not pose a threat to the security of our country. The war against her is unfair and frankly senseless.\n\u201cUkraine has been and remains a country close to us. Many of us have relatives, friends and scientific colleagues living in Ukraine. Our fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought together against Nazism. Unleashing a war for the sake of the geopolitical ambitions of the leadership of the Russian Federation, driven by dubious historiosophical fantasies, is a cynical betrayal of their memory.\n\u201cWe respect Ukrainian statehood, which rests on really working democratic institutions. We treat the European choice of our neighbors with understanding. We are convinced that all problems in relations between our countries can be resolved peacefully.\n\n\u201cHaving unleashed the war, Russia doomed itself to international isolation, to the position of a pariah country. This means that we, scientists, will no longer be able to do our job normally: after all, conducting scientific research is unthinkable without full cooperation with colleagues from other countries. The isolation of Russia from the world means further cultural and technological degradation of our country in the complete absence of positive prospects. War with Ukraine is a step to nowhere.\n\u201cIt is bitter for us to realize that our country, which made a decisive contribution to the victory over Nazism, has now become the instigator of a new war on the European continent. We demand an immediate halt to all military operations directed against Ukraine. We demand respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ukrainian state. We demand peace for our countries.

It is vital because I' ve already read some reviews where people complain because the game is not similar to ES(mostly atmosphere, storyline and characters, except MC). But of course it has pros and cons.\nCons:\n-MC. If u played ES, u can draw a parallel with Semyon. They are both brainless, and thats an understatement. While was playing the game, I just wanted to kill him sometimes. But sometimes you can put yourself in his place and understand why Nikolai behaves this way (like his frequent flings about Katherine). However all in all he is pathetic and nasty.\n-It is too much philosphy. This also refers to Nicolai, but a little bit different.\nPros:\n-Storyline is gripping. I was really astonished how authors were able to make such an intersting and complicated story. Also I was pleased that every piece shows new details of the story and after playing the whole game you can get the full story.\n-Girls. Authors succeeded to create interesing and in their own ways attractive girls. I'm sure u will find at least one u like) My personal top - Kagome, Himitsu, Ellie, Catherine.\n-Music. OH MY GOD. It is just beautiful. I have already added to my playlist two song: Not too late, Last night. Both played by Z-Feel-Z.\n-Backgrouns. A lot of work was done and I can really see it. Almost every art or backround is lovely. Animated sprites just make me happy and satisfied. Artist did their work amazingly.\n-Atnosphere. Yes, it is not as in ES and especially as for me, because I'm from Russia and I feel kinda enjoyed and nostalgic when it comes to USSR.

Guys, even if you see that you get 1-2 lines changes based on the choice you made, jsyk it will all be visible an hour-more in the game. As someone mentioned, this is the point-based system, yet I want to clarify, from what I've seen so far, is that it's not only point-based, but also there are responses in the game that matter more than just points. For example, you are following Kagome route, yet then, because you made some C R I T I C A L choice, you are moved to the Eli route(which I am struggling with right now.)\nAlso, having your comments closed doesn't help. \nI know I am biased, and I don't deny it, but please, stop being such pussies.

Who is interested in playing for the alpha male, who will protect the girl behind the school, and keeps all the girls in the friend zone for years, and also makes a romantic impression on everyone with his presence (and I remind you that we are not a fantastic dream pioneer camp, but in a supposedly realistic Japan) . Most importantly, because of this, the choice is imposed. Here is the very first one at the beginning (spoiler for the first 5 minutes of the game).\nEverything is shown in such a way that it is necessary to prevent bullying, the hero by default wants to intervene, and if you choose the option \"do not intervene\", then he will directly tell you that this is not possible and this is a disgusting act. So he tells the player that he made the wrong choice, although this should not be the case in visual novels with a choice of story development.\n\nAnd there are plenty of such moments in this novel.\n\nFor comparison, take Semyon, who did not have a special personality and background of a serious and self-sufficient person, which made him quite similar to all of us. He, if the player chooses not to interfere, would say something like \"Well, I am not a hero, so I will not look for problems, I do not need them.\" And if the player had chosen to protect, Semyon would have said \"It is impossible, you have to intervene and protect the lady\"\n\nI'm talking about the fact that choosing the right outcome, according to the player, should form not only the storyline in RPG, but also the character. Or, at least not to force and not to tell the player that he did wrong, especially with the words and thoughts of the main character, for whom we seem to be playing, but as if the author had already decided everything for us.\n\nIn any case, I recommend this game because I liked the storyline and it's quite interesting for me to read.
