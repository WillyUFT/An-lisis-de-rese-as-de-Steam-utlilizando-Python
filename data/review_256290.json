Any suggestions?) While adding a new twist of its own in the form of the timeline, skills and abilities that affect the timeline and others' place on it, and Igniculus's ability to interact with allies and adversaries.\n\nThe world's art; how can I do justice to it? To any of it? Almost every individual asset looks beautiful, with even the simplest drawn leaves looking like they're made with love.\n\nEach of these assets together, make convincing animation that captures eye and mind - and against the ineffable backdrops? The world of Lumeria, nearly ever corner, looks real - not in the photorealistic sense, mind you, but in the sense of being signature and thorough, to the degree the boundary between Lumeria and belief melts, and we could reach in through our monitors and touch the world if that absurd screen wasn't in the way; the jaded degradation of broken-hearted adulthood gone, minimal disbelief left to suspend.\n\nThe effects and changes consist of elegant paint splatters and shifting lights, combined with the hand-drawn nature of the adversaries and most of our potential allies, really seem like a children's book that never existed, of a quality that our timeline has yet to receive for any children's picture book so far, is coming to life.\n\n____\n\nThere are flaws. The denizens of Lumeria receive different facial expressions only in the talking hud; otherwise, they make no major facial expression variations, and this can be seen when exploring the overworld, when denizens leave your party and stand to await the completion of some puzzle, and during combat. Aurora and her cohorts do not wince, grin, look sad, or smile victoriously. \n\nAdditionally, the tweening on most animations is tailored very much to look like paper itself, literally attempting to come to life, with most of the limitations you'd expect. Along with the aforementioned lack of facial expressions, it's great for selling the prospect of paper coming to life, but contrasts with the vibrant and living world.\n\n___\n\nMy biggest complaint is the story-gameplay interaction features that had to be cut, particularly ones that work well for *role-playing*, in a *role-playing* game. I wanted a chance to role-play as an Aurora who refuses alliance with anyone but Igniculus and goes it alone, except for him. However, there are key story events that Aurora misses when trying this, which later words reference anyway, breaking immersion. Additionally, even if one weathers this storm, determined to make a nigh-independent Aurora, the requirement of bringing a character along becoming inevitable at no less than two points in the game. So not only are we forced to take along allies if we want the full story context, but the challenge is impossible anyway.\n\nWhat's more, one of those inevitable allies is in my opinion one of the most likable in the game - [spoiler] until this ally suddenly betrays you and is someone completely different. There is build up to this but not enough to justify it. There is no way to redeem this one - a foul denial, given how likable this one had been made. The heartbreak is achieved alright, but it is a cheap shot that feels narratively unfair.[/spoiler]\n\nLastly, the ending is the same no matter what else you do. In a game whose coming-of-age themes include Aurora deciding who she trusts and what her priorities are, it is a railroad spike to the heart that we cannot make different choices and behold different ultimate results. This even includes playing the game on higher difficulty.\n\nI am nearly fully convinced that these shortcomings are no evil of the developers themselves, but of bean counters who insisted on rushing art.\n___\n\nFor all the dire that has befallen Child of Light, it is a beautiful gem - rough, and in need of more tumbling, like those used in-game as accessories to change one's stats. It has won from me a bittersweet and heartbroken love - and if you, reader, are uncowed, intrigued, the both, or elsewise entirely, I encourage you to purchase the game - when your fear of the expense is less than the call of Lemuria's Light.", "timestamp_created": 1689802715, "timestamp_updated": 1689802715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594025909900665283", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "142416920": {"recommendationid": "142416920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083226349", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1420900379}, "language": "english", "review": "GIVE ME YOUR DATA!

The only downside is the difficulty; once you get a hold of the mechanics, you never have to use potions anymore; even with the hardest difficulty.\n\n2- I'm less into pIatformers, but the fact that you get the fly ability quite early made me enjoy thoses parts. You can fly and heal yourself pretty much at anytime (without items) during platforming and exploration, so it is really forgiving.\n\n3- I found the story not that refreshing. Nevertheless, the way that it is told in such a poetic way made it very enjoyable to read. Rubella was the perfect Harlequin.\n\n4- The game takes less than 10 hours to complete even if you wander around trying to gather all the loot. There's a NewGame+ feature, which is nice; the thing is that the combats start to feel pretty repetitive once you have unlocked the Late Game abilities.\n\n5- The graphics fit the story. Everything is quite lovely and all the areas have their own unique flavor.\n\nIn the end, if you love turn-based RPG games with refreshing mechanics and forgiving platformers, you will be delighted by this game.

Beautiful visuals are not enough to balance out the bad, cringe-y writing, long grinding for XP and bland skill trees.\n\n***\n\nChild of Light is a game with RPG and platforming elements which is charming for a while despite atrocious writing. Its important weaknesses quickly outweighs its strengths, though. It's not SO bad but, in my opinion, many other titles will give you a better experience for the time you invest in them. \n\n\nPROS\n+ Visually beautiful world with hand-drawn environments and characters. Nice enough that it pushed me past the point when gameplay stopped being interesting.\n+ Some original battle mechanics using the mouse to slow enemies or heal allies. Fun for a while. \n+ Battle music feels epic and OST carries a strong emotional vibe. \n\nCONS\n- All those strengths become weaknesses due to the incredibly repetitive nature of the game. It's not really a long RPG, but it does feel very long because of this.\n- All dialogues are written in rhymes and, in my opinion, it is really bad! Writing is contrived, unnatural and cheap. Even if I'm not a fan, rhymed dialogue can be well-written. Not this game! If you're a writer yourself or just in love with good writing, you will probably cringe a lot.  \n- Too many characters with too little differences in gameplay. About halfway through, I stopped caring entirely about the skill points I spent, since it all comes down to the same gameplay over and over, with the exception of one \"true\" mage with some useful elemental magic. Other characters' specialities were easily replicated by vast amounts of consumable items, or shared between multiple characters. \n- Simple crafting system becomes uninteresting quickly. Once you get some strong elemental \"oculi\" to slot in your weapons and armours (for damage or protection), it really just becomes a chore of equipping the right damage type for the right enemy. Rinse and repeat over, and over, and over...  \n\n+/- The predictable story is not strong enough to carry the player through all this, despite some fun moments. A nice touch here is the fact that each new character joining the party will trigger a series of introduction dialogues, one with each other character present. Those will happen one at a time after each combat encounter until the whole party had a chance to discuss with this new party member.\n\n6.8/10 Lesser than the sum of its parts", "timestamp_created": 1670848201, "timestamp_updated": 1671019541, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128357417": {"recommendationid": "128357417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188219677", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 105, "last_played": 1549486901}, "language": "english", "review": "Combat amd platforming are boring.

For the first time in a long while, Uplay didn't bring me much trouble on launching the game.\n\nI didn't play for the RPG, but to see the art, which I am satisfied with. The briefing was in stained glass style, I was able to quickly control my character Aurora, more story to be told along the road. The art in the background looks good for a game in 2014, well acceptable even limited by the graphic quality, no empty spaces yet not too complicated, everything looks natural.\u00a0\n\nThe map is rich and hard to find the border- I can almost always fly higher in the sky or down lower ground. My favorite is the sea world, though it is odd to see a boar boss waiting. I enjoyed the scene about bidding goodbyes to the party, and young Aurora and her mother at the blossom apple tree. They were well made and emotional. The music was fascinating, one of the highlights but the game still has some distance to Gris in my view.\n\nThe RPG battle part is plain, I find it highly repeated, luckily most battles can be avoided. The skill tree is basic, whoever reaches the bar faster gets to attack, I manage to attack twice before an enemy can hit me and it helps. A battle can last long, and I got level up after each of them.\u00a0Aurora can have companions to join the party, it is up to the player to finish their requests or not.

It expands on Final Fantasy\u2018s ATB system to make it more tactical and engaging instead of just a reskinned initiative system \u2014 though, in the circular nature of things, it actually bears a lot of similarity to FF4\u2019s original ATB system. I\u2019ll tentatively recommend it, but only if you\u2019re particularly interested in RPG battle systems.\n\nLike in Final Fantasy, characters all have a standard wait time between turns, which progresses in real time and is based on their speed stat. The twist is that every action takes additional time to execute, and if a character is damaged while casting, they are interrupted and set back in the timeline. Most strategies revolve around timing your attacks so that you interrupt enemies while avoiding being interrupted yourself, and there are additional abilities that can slow or knock back characters as well.\n\nWhat I consider to be the best innovation of the game is that it makes the real-time aspect actually matter: There is a mechanic where you can move the exposition fairy around the battlefield to generate special effects if he illuminates a character. This adds an element of real-time movement to an otherwise fully turn-based system, which I think is a neat idea.\n\nUnfortunately, the implementation of all of this leaves much to be desired. The firefly effect for heroes is health regeneration while the effect for enemies is slowing them down, and these two effects are not balanced at all: the healing is so minuscule that it\u2019s always a better choice to mitigate damage by slowing enemies instead.\n\nThe other thing that feels very off is that characters always travel the full length of the \u201ccast\u201d portion of the timeline, with casting time only affecting the speed at which they do so. This makes it very hard to judge where a character will end up relative to others, which is particularly bad when battles revolve around executing your actions before your opponents. I think it would have been much more logical to have everyone travel at the same rate but end at different points, probably denoted by notches on the \u201ccast\u201d bar corresponding to each tier of casting time. It would also have been nice if enemies explicitly declared their casting times instead of you having to puzzle out how your casting times compare.\n\nUnrelated to all of this, there is another mechanic I\u2019d like to highlight: Your equipment can be equipped to any slot (weapon, armor, or accessory), with different effects for each. I found this to be a clever way to get more depth out of equipment by making you think of multiple ways to use the same item. There is also a crafting mechanic where you can combine three of the same item to upgrade to a higher tier, or combine different items to create a new item with a special effect. This was interesting, though you\u2019ll fairly quickly discover all the possible combinations and from there it\u2019s just a matter of upgrading them into \u201cthe same, but more\u201d, which took a lot of the spark out of it.\n\nThe game is ultimately fairly enjoyable and still has more to engage with than a typical jRPG, but overall I felt it needed more time in the oven. I\u2019m also not sure it has enough depth to carry the whole playtime; by the late game I found myself using the exact same strategies and the battles became very repetitive, made worse by the fact there\u2019s not much enemy diversity.\n\nThe difficulty is also very weird; I played on hard mode because I find most RPGs too easy, and this was fine for a while but turned frustrating in the late game, where enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage with blisteringly fast attacks that constantly interrupt you and give you no time to recover. (Apparently, the fan consensus is that normal mode is way too easy and hard mode is way too hard, with no middle ground.) Despite this, I never used more than a handful of the dozens and dozens of consumable items the game hands you at every opportunity. Maybe if they had been instant, but when they have the same casting time as your regular support moves, there\u2019s not much incentive.\n\nAnd, minor, but the main character is weirdly weak? Statwise she\u2019s a jack-of-all-trades and therefore master of none, except for her HP which is even lower than the squishy wizard\u2019s. Even her particular niche, light magic, is mostly irrelevant thanks to equipment that makes regular attacks light-elemental. For most of the game I benched her in favor of specialists who could fight more effectively. Possibly this is intentional to reflect how young she is? But still odd.\n\nStorywise\u2026 this is one of the very few times I\u2019ll say \u201cPlay the game, skip the story.\u201d All dialogue is written in rhyming scheme \u2014 every single line \u2014 which requires everything to be contorted into painfully tortured wording because English fundamentally is not designed for that. Many scenes are borderline incomprehensible. And this might just be me, but the obvious artifice of it makes it impossible for me to take anything seriously \u2014 it feels like the characters are, well, acting out a script rather than real people experiencing real emotions. Immersion is totally broken.\n\nThe actual plot itself is deliberately cliche, though not painfully so. It\u2019s a rough adaptation of Snow White with some elements of Sleeping Beauty, reimagined as a portal fantasy.

I even wore Aurora as a cosplay so playing it again was amazing. \nThe story is as beautiful and sad as I remember it and so is the game design. I love the watercolor effect so much and the music is also wonderful.\n\nThe only thing I would complain about is the repetitive combat, which you also have to go through very often unless you deliberately avoid enemies. However, due to this, you will lose the possibility of leveling up quicker. This whole thing is just annoying sometimes, especially when you clear an area and when you return there after being elsewhere, the enemies are back again.\nOtherwise it's really fantastic and beautiful game.\n\n\n\nOne more thing... I had the game in my library for a long time and didn't touch it. But recently I got the urge to play it and that's when the problem occurred. Thanks to effing Ubisoft, it kept giving me an error and \"we're unable to launch the game\" \nAfter a bit of googling I learned that on Windows 10 it's possible that the game won't work at all. I struggled with it for a while and then I conceded defeat. I just accepted the fact that I won't be able to play the via Steam.\nBUT... then i updated my pc to windows 11 so i decided to try to install and run the game again. Now...

I am a big fan of how this game looks, from the character designs when they talk to the world and npcs. I think the only weird thing to see is the face of Aurora in the in-game model itself not the art when you open menus and see dialogues but besides that very nice.\n\n+The soundtrack is charming. The soundtrack isn't anything flashy but wow it just fits the game so well. The main track itself is filled with such emotion it's great and the battle themes don't get annoying since the battles felt evenly spaced out in this game. Aurora's theme might be the best in the whole track honestly but there are some absolute bangers. Sword of Mars hits hard to name a track.\n\n+The gameplay is really fun. I am a big fan of platforming games. I also am a big fan of turn-based games. I am happy to say when combined the gameplay itself is really fun. The platforming may not really be platforming since you are flying for like half the game but the traversal was fun. The turn-based combat with Igniculus was a fun little concept which I thoroughly enjoyed. The choice between healing or slowing enemies and not slowing enemies to time interrupts felt satisfying.\n\n+On the note of gameplay, I really enjoyed the oculi system of building characters. A very nice form of resource-management in the game choosing to sack oculi to upgrade them and in-turn taking some from other characters. I mean not every character needed 3 slots of oculi anyway but still felt nice to do.\n\n+If you kill everything on your way, you will find no need to grind at all in this game. It is an added bonus that every playable character gets XP regardless of if they were in the battle or not this way they stay relevant. Characters level up and gain stats but also they get skill points and you slot those into a tree the way you would in games like Final Fantasy X. This lets you upgrade characters further in a way you want.\n\n+The world was really well-built. The different areas actually felt different. Not just reskins or recolours but rather the designs of the different areas all felt unique. Maybe they weren't the most complex of dungeons but it didn't get boring to explore because of it.\n\n+The story was short but charming. Very simple story of witch marrying the king with ulterior motives and the king gets sick and the child has to save the world. Maybe cliche but very well-executed. This may be because the characters themselves are just a lovable bunch.\n\n+On the note of characters, all the playable characters have cute interactions with one another. The characters themselves were really unique and different from one another besides the jester siblings for obvious reasons. I enjoyed using all of them in combat and seeing their respective stories.\n\n-The characters themselves were fun to use but honestly you can get by in the game using aurora, finn, oengus and sometimes rubella if you need heals. The other characters were overshadowed in strength even if I did use them to buff or debuff opponents from time to time.\n\n-When crafting oculi you can easily make the wrong thing as it jumps to craft button as soon as something is craftable. This is especially annoying when trying to craft diamonds or even the princess stone. Might accidentally make amethyst or citrine instead of diamonds or worse make another spinel instead of the princess stone.\n\n-This game is so good but oh my god I finished everything to do side-quests and confessions and all in under 10 hours. Maybe it is because it is my 3rd time playing it but still this game could have been even a bit longer.\n\n-Why does this game need Uplay....\n\nOverall really really good game and a must-get whenever it goes on sale.

I simply could not believe it when I claimed it for free on Ubisoft Connect app but I then decided to buy here since I really loved the painting-like style, the characters, story & made me actually enjoy turn-based combat, a genre I was not a fan of.\n\nThe only downsides I see are the god awful launcher from Ubisoft that cannot remember your login info that is needed to play this STEAM game but also repetitiveness of fights. \nIn order to keep up with the progression gap, you gotta pretty much fight whichever creature you find and many of them are the same but there is a variety in enemy types and finding out their weaknesses is not immediately written to you on the screen, you gotta figure that out. I like that, makes some room for experimenting & memorization.\n\nThe upgrading system is amazingly detailed, with many stats to keep account of & also so many characters that join you for the fights, all with unique purpose & abilities in combat!\n\nThe story is absolutely amazing, especially since it's told in rhymes! Every single line is written in such a manner that it will rhyme & also has this archaic-kinda language but it's not hard to follow up on and many interactions are very funny.\n\nAgain, shout-outs to the style this game is oozing through the screen, combining 2D environments that feel like paintings with 3D characters. I do believe it is a hard feat to accomplish without making it look weird but it actually looks quite amazing. I strongly recommend this game, despite some of its repetitive nature, but every game has repetition blend into their gameplay anyways.

Blessed child of light conquers dark wicked stepmother; sorry, seen it all before.\n- Enemies become extremely repetitive.

The slots are offence, defence, and utility. You can mix and match the gems used in the slots, and there is no cost involved. The offensive gem can change the element of the physical attack, while the defensive gem and give elemental resistance.\n\nSome improvement I would like to sees:\n- see equipment (gems) in battle\n- see whole party, to drag and drop gems all from one screen\n- setting for disabling music when game in background\n- rearrange party outside of battle\n- grimoire for monsters, including their stats, skills, weaknesses, strengths etc\n- menu wheel for battles is impractical, please let us have a standard one inside a box; same with gem selection\n\nFor keyboard and mouse users, you may want to rebind hotkeys so they're easier to use:\nE to interact -> F\nQ to back out -> R\n1 to navigation left -> Q\n2 to navigation right -> E\n\nIt would be great if we could rebind the menu (Esc) hotkey, since Tab is much more accessible.\nNew hotkeys I would like to see::\n- P for Party\n- K for Skills\n- O or G for Oculi (Gems)\n- I for Inventory\n- M for Map\n- C for Confessions\n\nPotential cons, which may or may not put you off:\n- no manual save system\n- 60 FPS cap\n- requires Unisoft Connect (formerly Uplay)\n\n---{ Rating }---\n9 / 10\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2611 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2611 Beginner\n\u2610 Casual Gamer\n\u2610 Normal Gamer\n\u2610 Expert\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2611 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Great\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Bad\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Great\n\u2611 Fun\n\u2611 Challenging\n\u2610 Generic\n\u2610 Frustrating\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if you care about leaderboards\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Normal\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Bad / Generic\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n\u2610 Short (4 - 8 hours)\n\u2611 Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]\n\u2610 Many hours (20 - 40)\n\u2610 Long (40 - 60 hours) [if you complete everything]\n\u2610 Very Long (61 - 100 hours)\n\u2610 Extremely Long (101+ hours)\n\n---{ Replayability }---\n\u2610 It's a one-time experience\n\u2610 Only for achievements\n\u2611 If you wait a few months / years\n\u2610 Definitely\n\u2610 Infinitely replayable\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 Lots of bugs\n\u2610 Bugs destroy the game\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2611 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for Sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n", "timestamp_created": 1656156095, "timestamp_updated": 1656156095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117519762": {"recommendationid": "117519762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038555086", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2022, "last_played": 1404331379}, "language": "english", "review": "Atmospeheric.

The rhyming in the dialogue makes you feel like you're watching a Shakespeare play, it just works so well in this universe.

It is a story about maturing, love and true friendship. \nA story about a child that only wants to find a way home but ends up fighting for the greater good. The music and sound-design really round it up, especially the credits song. \nWith its incredible story, stunning visuals and outstanding music, Child of Light managed to gain a place in my heart.

There are a couple quirks that make it stand out. For one thing, all the equippable items are gems that you either get from killing monsters or opening chests. All your consumables are found in chests. There is no currency and no shops. If you're the kind of person that holds on to limited items and never uses them, this could be a bit of a hassle.\n\nThere are a wide range of party members, but you can only have two in play at a time. They all get xp whether or they're not in a given fight, which is nice. Every time a character levels, it gets a flat stat bonus, in addition to a talent point you can fiddle with. Each character only has one gimmick that they focus on more or less, so you have to get used to juggling party members. Need healing? Swap in the healer. Need tanking? Swap in the tank. It's pretty painless, but takes a little getting used to.\n\nOne of the main gimmicks is that you get a fairy that moves on the screen independent of your character, either using the mouse or the right thumbstick. Using fairy juice, you can either slow enemies or regenerate health for allies, and most of the puzzles in platforming center around activating things with the fairy. \n\nThere's a world map with fast travel, but I really would have liked area maps as well, as there's a lot of stuff to collect and you can easily miss things if you don't explore thoroughly. \n\nI enjoyed the graphics of the game, which were all beautifully hand painted watercolors. Also, all the dialogue is in rhyming verse.\n\nAll told, worth buying, but you might want to wait for a sale.

To pass through the levels you have to solve puzzles and combat enemies to get to the final battle and your destiny.  Aurora is accompanied by a firefly who lights her way and guides her. Along the way she gathers other companions that will help in her quests and battles.  \n\nThe art style is incredibly gorgeous and the story is well crafted and touching - it's like you are playing through a beautiful fairy tale storybook. The musical score as well is wonderful. \n\nIt is a testament to Child of Light that my daughter has played it through several times and now she is 18 she has returned to play through the story once more while she waits for university to start. \n\nChild of Light is a timeless work of art.

It's like a fairy tail brought to life. However one has to realize that - just like a fairy tail - once you've fallen into it's world for the short period of time it provides and finished it, there's nothing else left really. \n\nThe combat system is interesting and nuanced enough to save it from the abhorrent nature of most turn based battle systems, and the skill tree provides some customisation for your playstyle. It's interesting, but it's all so basic.\n\nThat being said, It's wrong to come into this game expecting a complex battling system. Where this game really shines is in its ability to just transport you for 8 hours into a whimsical fairy tale, bringing you back into the eyes of a child underlayed with subtleties of adult themes. For example, there is an encounter with a character who is upset, sitting alone, until we reach him and he reunites with his sister. Sweet, untill you take in the bigger picture and realize he was about to kill himself. \n\nGetting this on sale is the way to go if you're a grown-ass man/woman. However, If you're looking for games to inspire a younger audience through a sheer powerhouse of music, art, simple yet engaging gameplay and with wholesome yet reflective themes to build upon the young one and their developing minds, then it is worth the full price.", "timestamp_created": 1633805382, "timestamp_updated": 1633805382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "100766573": {"recommendationid": "100766573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032121266", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1115, "last_played": 1633761387}, "language": "english", "review": "Game crashes on startup for any CPU with more than 20 threads.

The side-scrolling aspect is especially fun, because you can fly. It's the perfect game for those who like to explore beautiful worlds. And beautiful it is, this world called Lemuria, hand-painted with watercolors with papery texture to boot. \n\nSo there's a lot of style in this title, but not as a means to compensate for low quality game play. That's not to say the game play is especially profound. While the exploring is fun, and the world is filled with little puzzles and a ton of loot, most of the loot has little impact on your method of play. Healing items are good for boss fights, but most of them go unused. You have a firefly friend who can illuminate different areas of the map, allowing you to find more treasures. \n\nThere's no shopping in this game, and your only equipment comes in the form of gems called Oculi, which can be crafted and combined from their different varieties. After each level-up, your characters get to choose different upgrades, which is cool, but your characters are all going to have their general strengths and weaknesses, even with permanent stat-boosters. Characters also pool experience, so the fun exploration often gets halted so you can stop and choose upgrades for these characters you never use, but might need... maybe. \n\nThe characters themselves aren't especially interesting, but I didn't look too deeply into it. Why not? Well, there's something about this game which I really can't stand. The developers decided to make every single line of dialogue rhyme. And the rhyming is bad. Almost every sentence reads like it was spoken by Yoda, causing most of the text to come out in a jumble of terrible sentence structure. I figure on every block, there's a kid rapper who could have done a better job. \n\nThe battle system for this game is pretty good. It's much like Grandia, in the way that all fighters share a time bar. Each action takes a certain amount of time to execute, which gives you and your enemies space to interrupt each other. This is all swell, but a lot of enemies counter attack when you interrupt them, others counter when you use physical, magical, or elemental attacks. Each enemy has its own mode, which you need to keep in mind. This is fun, but there are no quick battles. They all require a certain level of focus, causing you to, after upgrading your characters, forget where you're going. \n\nLooping back to the subject of elemental magic, I'm not really a fan of it, especially when you don't have all the elements at your disposal. Most RPG games have the tree levels, where everything's weak to fire, then the fire world, then the water world, and so forth, in an order you're never aware of. And this works fine (albeit lazy), so long as you're not forced to use elemental magic, and don't have to gamble on which magic to learn. \n\nThe music in this game is all right, fitting, but there are only about four songs in it. But even that's fine, since it only took me twelve hours to finish this game. Despite it's flaws, I think Child of Light is a good game. It doesn't make you do boring things, like talk to every single person in town before getting to it. The game play is immersive, with the perfect amount of complexity. Some of the battles are also pretty hard, which scratches an itch. It would have been better if they'd included some impossible fights that, in spite of your perfect strategy, require you to come back later. \n\nChild of Light's pretty good, but not really my kind of RPG. It's magical and whimsical, and more for the 90s born fairy tale fans instead of us who grew up worshiping Japanese games. I've watched Brandon Sanderson's lectures on Fantasy writing, and many of his concepts apply to all forms of media. Every story opens with a promise about what kind of experience the consumer is going to have. And if that promise isn't fulfilled, the readers (or players) will be unsatisfied. Despite its challenges, I think Child of Light is too short. It puts a lot of systems in play that are never used to their remote capacity. There are some touching moments to its story, but its resolution is flacid, and crowded with one-note, boring party members. \n\nStyle: 4/5 - Substance: 2/5 - Music: 3/5 - Fun: 4/5\n", "timestamp_created": 1632457378, "timestamp_updated": 1632457378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568743109703063965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "99612883": {"recommendationid": "99612883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115392148", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1674, "last_played": 1603675168}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sencillamente perfecto, m\u00fasica, ambientaci\u00f3n, historia...

Its heartwarming visuals, its tales of loss and conquering one's fears, its fun battle system, and its gorgeous orchestral soundtrack form a perfect combination that leaves me grinning from ear to ear just thinking about it years later.  It's a children's book, drawn in watercolor, with nonsensical rhymes and the freedom to experience it all in a relaxing way or crank up the difficulty to challenge yourself hard.\n\nExploration is done by platforming with Aurora (the main character) and interacting through obstacles/puzzles with her companion Igniculus -- both M+KB and traditional gamepad work well to use these two distinctive, yet simultaneous types of action.  As you experience this beautiful and whimsy world first as a basic platformer and, soon after, with full flying mobility, you will encounter enemies in the field.\n\nCombat is innovative but straight-forward with a mix of turn-based actions where everyone is able to interrupt the opponent's turns or get more themselves.  The simultaneous actions you saw on the field show up here again with Aurora's companion able to help slow enemies or heal your allies, while you are also controlling your fighters.  It's fun, but a tad easy in normal difficulty, standard speed settings.  It's when you increase the difficulty and crank up the speed that the combat really shines.  Interrupting and buffing/debuffing stop being just \"neat\" and they become the only way to survive, while strategizing when your allies should take action to deal with the upcoming enemy turns becomes a serious challenge.  Any turn wasted can become fatal.\n\nAnd as all this happens, a truly unforgettable soundtrack plays in the background, giving a sense of place and a focus to every scene that is just perfect.\n\nDelightful at every moment and with the right length: not too short, not too long.

If this was a review of THAT version, I would probably maybe recommend it to you, even though that one has no DLC. Here's what I think of Child of Light:\n\nI feel like they tried to mimic indie titles from around the time of its release, but with a bigger budget. The game is very beautiful, don't get me wrong, but it's not ALL that gorgeous. They had a HUGE staff compared to most indie games. However I feel like the corporate part of the abuser-racist-and-misogynistic-friendly company Ubisoft didn't let their creative team have fun making this game. This is not a labour of love. This is exploitation made to feel, sound and look like labour of love.\n\nI won't judge the story, since I played the game in Portuguese first and LOTS of it was lost in translation. The Child of Light e-book has a super cute short story, though, I suggest you check it out! (As a side note: MASSIVE kudos to the Brazilian translators and all the praise to the Brazilian voice actress, though. Translating a game that tries to pass as poetry is SUPER hard, but they did what they could VERY professionally. And the voice actress for Brazilian Portuguese did a BRILLIANT, fantastic job. Back to the actual review now!)\n\nThe whole mood of the game is very \"meh\". While the artists are very capable and talented, the world they created feel dull. I'm not here to see great technique. I'm here to be drawn into this world, I'm here to say \"wow, that is an incredible idea\", \"woah, I would never think THAT\". Instead I'm just saying \"oh, artist number 5 did a great job adjusting the colors to artist number 3's enemies, and I guess artists 9 through 12 really did make movement look beautiful\". I'm never invited into the world with just my eyes. (Side note number two: the character development is good enough. I won't review this separately, but they range from \"meh\" to \"good\".)\n\nThe composer uses the main leitmotif WAY too much. It's not that good, for starters, and it also doesn't really help with storytelling. Sure, it is connected to Aurora (the main character) and her mom, but PLEASE don't shove and reference it in EVERY OTHER AREA. Seriously. It loses its meaning. \"Oh, it's sad because Lemuria and the story are sad\", \"oh, it plays everywhere because [SPOILERS] Aurora is the rightful heir to this currently-ravished land [END OF SPOILERS]\". Well, I don't care, use it in more clever ways, then. Spice it up with something other than different orchestration. Change the tempo, the dynamics, use percussion instruments. Maybe hide it here and there subtly. Make me interested. Be clever. There are many ways to do it, but they were avoided. The composer was surely able to do a better job. I'm blaming Ubisoft, because, well, fuck them. They probably didn't pay the composer enough.\n\nOh: the game is TOO easy in casual mode and too hard in expert. The Igniculus is a great device to gain advantage in battles, but there absolutely should be another difficulty between those two. I NEVER died during the whole game. One character fell in battle three times in total (and was promptly revived in the following turn). I was never on the edge of my seat, I never felt in danger. The game is smart in teaching you how to battle, but it never throws a curveball.\n\nThe only really good thing Child of Light does is battle. The battle system is a gorgeous little thing that can be quite fun (and using a mouse-and-controller combination works beautifully. The mouse is the perfect substitute to the Wii U gamepad's touch screen). Not much to say here, it's just super good. I wish the whole game was half as good as its battle system.\n\nLastly, screw this company for shoving Uplay and Ubisoft Connect with the game. \"Oh, they gave you the DLC for 'free' when you made an account\", I DON'T WANT TO make an account and I also don't want the damn DLC, I want to sit on my chair, run Steam and then run the game. Just that. So fuck them for this too.\n\nTo wrap things up: I obviously DON'T recommend this game. Buy something else. Indie games, preferrably. If you really, really, REALLY want to play it, find a way to play that doesn't give any money to Ubisoft. I'm sure you're smart and creative enough.

Fuelled by a nostalgia for turn-based combat and old school RPGs, I gave this a shot and by the end, I was cheering for even the side characters and hated the bad guys with a fury that I didn\u2019t know I had in me. If you enjoy fantasy/turn-based RPG games, this one's for you. \n\n[b] STORY & SCRIPT [/b]: Overall, not what you wouldn\u2019t expect from a bedtime fantasy tale but with plenty of interesting twists to make it something else. Busts countless traditional genre conventions, for instance in its approach to courtly love, power structures and having a bittersweet ever after. All of this is never done cynically. Without giving away too much, I will say this game has a reality-bending aspect to it; you wouldn't expect so much for a small indie title like this one. Finally, the rhyming script doesn't work everywhere but it gives the game a lot of heart.\n\n[b] GAMEPLAY [/b]: The real-time element gives life to the turn-based combat, especially in expert mode. I didn\u2019t expect this kind of combat to make me care more about the characters but it did. Learning their different skills, crafting and equipping oculi and watching them get better over time really personalised the experience. I started in normal difficulty mode. By the last chapter, if you don't play in expert mode, the challenge factor is lost.\n\n[b] ARTWORK [/b]: Each map location is lovingly hand-painted in contrasting watercolour themes. This carries the game\u2019s ethereal aesthetic; even though Aurora is a badass warrior, she flutters fluidly around Lemuria in a delicate gown (one can do both). I can\u2019t remember how many screenshots I took.\n\n[b] ANIMATION [/b]: The few scenes that utilize 3D camera shots are hair-raising, especially toward the end. The characters\u2019 body language gives each scene added emotional depth- I found myself wincing at a character's pain just by seeing how they braced themselves.\n\n[b] SOUNDTRACK [/b]: Let me just say it brought me to tears. On multiple occasions. The music is perfection.\n\nOverall, Child of Light is a hidden masterpiece, achieving all that it set out to do (and more) excellently. Due to its strong genre elements and old school RPG gameplay, you\u2019ll either love it or you won\u2019t. I cherish every second I spent gliding in Lemuria. To me, Aurora will forever be the Queen of Light.\n\n[Cue cheesy outro music]", "timestamp_created": 1621163345, "timestamp_updated": 1621163399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "91977815": {"recommendationid": "91977815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022293302", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 689, "last_played": 1469886826}, "language": "english", "review": "In 2014 Ubisoft published 5 AAA games, which led to the humorous article 'Ubisoft Game: The Review' written by Tim Colwill. In short the article pokes fun at Ubisoft and these 5 AAA games for despite being from different franchises are all very similar in terms of characters, story, game play mechanics etc. \n\nIn the same year however, Ubisoft also published two indie titles, Valiant Hearts: The Great War and this one Child of Light. Despite both being both short, cheap indie games, I would take these two over any copy paste AAA title the company publishes.\n\nChild of Light mixes a traditional turn based RPG battle system with a side scrolling exploration including platforming and puzzle solving. \n\nWhen it comes to turn based battle systems, I feel like I am in the minority of people who still enjoy this style of combat. With many mainstream RPG's favouring more action based combat. However, I feel turn based combat can still be enjoyable as long as there is at least some attempt at innovation. Child of Lights innovation on the combat revolves around the ability to actively slow down enemies and speed up allies both before and during actions. This slow down speed up mechanic is further utilised by the fact that certain spells and abilities can be interrupted. This applies to both enemies and allies, so sometimes you will want to speed up ally to get their spell off quicker, other times you will want to slow down an enemy casting so you can get a perfectly timed interrupt. \n\nOther than the combat the game boasts fantastic, music, beautiful art work on both the back drops and characters and a general feeling that passion went into its entire design, something which has become synonymous with great indie titles of which this is one.\n\nThe story takes around 12 hours to complete, adding a few more if you want collect everything.

I have recently replayed it and decided it deserves some review, so here are my two cents.\n\nI really like the watercolor art style\nExploring the world is enjoyable for a long while\nThe dialogs tend to put a smile on one's face\nAnd the music will erase your sorrows, without a trace.\n\nApart from that, the combat gets repetetive and by the end of the game it's more annoying than anything because of the same slow animations you will see for the billionth time. There are plenty of characters to join your party but they all feel pretty much the same. I found myself using almost exlusively the jester for heals and phys dmg paired with the wizard for elemental damage. Sometimes swapping Aurora against dark creatures is beneficial but the rest of the team doesn't really add anything meaningful.\n\nThe game offers some gear improvements and crafting, but the crafting is tedious as hell and it takes a lot of time and about 7 gazillion mouse clicks to actually make something useful. I stopped bothering with it halfway through. My mouse thanked me.\n\nThe story is simple, fairytail-ish and the concept of flying and using the firefly as a mouse cursor is really neat. Optional quests involving funky characters are also a plus in my book.\n\nAll and all, it's a pretty nice game. It could use some polishing, sure, but I really like it.\n\n\nPotential buyers beware: I really cannot recommend the official version for one single reason - it does not work. U(don't)play crashes immediately and fails to launch the game.

Young girl named Aurora goes to sleep, and wakes up in a fantasy land called Lemuria, ruled by evil Queen of the Night. To return home, Aurora has to save Lemuria by bringing back the sun, the moon, and the stars.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nChild of Light is a side scroller with role playing elements. Aurora and her companions travel across Lemuria, complete objectives to push story further and unlock new areas, while dealing with dangerous enemies in combat, with occasional boss fights.\nExplore magical land by foot, or soar through the sky using your wings, to collect different confessions, discover secrets, and recive additional sidequests.\nWhile you explore you can use firefly Igniculus and his magic to light up dark places, open chests out of your reach, heal yourself and shine light on enemies to stun them for an advantage or to pass them without triggering combat.\n\nCombat itself is close to JRPG's such as Final Fantasy. Featuring similar active-time battle system, two of your teammembers can fight up to three enemies at once!\nSystem is pretty easy to get- each alive being on screen is featured on a timeline that appears in a middle of the combat area.\nTimeline is build from two sections, one is a \"spectator phase\", where you can see how battle goes and think about strategy (or help yourself using Igniculus as he is helpful here just as much as outside of combat) and second, smaller section where you get to choose your move and call it. You can switch characters, use potions to regenerate stats or perform an action. Everything takes specific amount of time- triggering defense or using potions is very quick, while most powerful attacks take longest amount of time to reach the end.\nEnemies are seperated into elementary types, and will require a use of different attacks to beat them.\nIf you or your enemies get hit in a second section, while waiting for an action to happen, this action is cancelled, forcing a character to go back in the timeline. This mechanic, if used correctly and if you will have a bit of luck, will let you win battles without taking a scratch!\nIt might sound like a lot when it comes to combat, but belive me that in game it's pretty easy to get and you shouldn't have any issues with figuring it out. Especially as game features good tutorial for it!\nAfter done combat you get experience points, if you collected enough you level up granting you a skill point available to spend on skill trees, plus sometimes you gather potions and/or ocuilis- magical crystals you can equip for your characters to grant them additional bonuses!\n\n[b]Pros and Cons[/b]\nEasily my favourite part is dialogue. Game takes inspiration from many poems, with majority of the dialogue being portrayed through rhymes delivered in ballad form. A rather uncommon element in games, which here with the fantasy setting works wonders.\nAdd to that beautiful watercolour art style achieved thanks to UbiArt Framework Engine, and optimistic, romantic soundtrack composed by B\u00e9atrice Martin, also known as C\u0153ur de pirate, to get one fantastic presentation.\nAll those elements pretty much motivate to explore and make it very pleasant, dosen't matter if you travel through the spider infested caves or fly across the sky.\nAnd when you don't explore, engaging yet easy to get turn based combat will keep your interest!\nPlus it's worth mentioning that Child of Light to spice things up offers even occasional puzzles and platformic sections where your flight is affected by wind, or lava.\n\nI've had a little issue with difficulty. Game offers only \"Casual\" or \"Veteran\" modes, lacking good middleground that could balance the combat.\nAnd skill trees could be a bit...smaller. Even for Ubisoft standards it's too much.\nWith each character having over 70 skills available seperated into 3 paths, amount of them is simply overwhelming and forces you to grind if you want all of them.\nIn first few hours after every single combat you recive a skill point, raising a question of \"Why so many skills is there?\".\n\n[b]Playtime, replayability and other gamemodes[/b]\nChild of Light takes 10-15 hours to complete, depending on how much you will explore and how swiftly you will make through the combat.\nGame allows you to continue playing after credits roll if you want to grind your characters or finish any side quests left, giving it additional replayability!\nIt features cooperation mode where second player can control Igniculus, to help in combat and exploration.\n\n[b]Additional information[/b]\nUbisoft Connect is required to launch and play this title.\n\n[b]Final words and conclusion[/b]\nI would welcome a teased sequel-prequel with open arms, but with Ubi changing their gaming approach like a wind I doubt that will happen, unfortunately. They probably forgot about it anyway because last time they teased it was back in 2018 when CoL hit Nintendo Switch.\nJust like with Valiant Hearts, even if you are not a Ubi fan I suggest checking out this title.\n\nChild of Light is an excellent game, with superb visuals and soundtrack, enjoyable gameplay and well-written story.

This game isn't a huge departure from that, and is not comparable to classic Final Fantasy & Legend of Heroes games, for example, but its a professional product & well worth the purchase. I enjoyed it. \n\nIt's glaring flaw is the dialogue, which for me, fell flat from beginning to end.

This is a \"gentle\" RPG, with platformer and puzzle elements. If you explore forward, you'll generally complete the quests, and if you're familiar with RPG turn-based battles, you won't find a huge challenge here. At times, it can feel like an RPG for children. However, these aren't criticisms, and the game manages to be thoroughly charming and enjoyable. It is often stunningly beautiful, and I like how often you level up -- you don't feel like you're grinding it out, fighting the same monsters just to level up. You also don't get lost, looking for some random item that's not in an obvious place and constantly going back and forth to the same locations. In fact, the game prompts you wonderfully, so you don't miss things. The end result is that you can relax and enjoy exploring this beautiful world and constantly progressing.\n\nThat said, the turn-based combat has a few twists, including a timing mechanism (similar to some Final Fantasy chapters) and using your firefly companion to help, which adds another touch of real time to the fighting. Also, only two can fight at any one time, but you can swap them out during combat. And even the combat manages to look pretty!\n\nI often find there to be too much dialogue in games (especially RPGs), and this is no exception. However, because of the way the game prompts you, describes open goals in your inventory pretty clearly, and generally puts things in front of you, you rarely miss important things if you skip through or forget what you read. Also, the central narrative is pretty surprising and cute. One complaint: the characters speak in rhyme, and this can get annoying -- but like I said, feel free to skip through and enjoy the beautiful exploration.\n\nIt's a shame this game isn't more widely known or praised. It's a classic. If you enjoy visually stunning and hand-drawn material, and if you want a game to be several hours long without being frustratingly hard, this game is a great fit. :)", "timestamp_created": 1613278681, "timestamp_updated": 1613289599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563007235527038574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86583060": {"recommendationid": "86583060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019905993", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 204, "last_played": 1613965346}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an indie masterpiece!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1613259459, "timestamp_updated": 1613259459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86530149": {"recommendationid": "86530149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081578620", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 567, "last_played": 1613208986}, "language": "english", "review": "unique", "timestamp_created": 1613209668, "timestamp_updated": 1613209668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "86014886": {"recommendationid": "86014886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002759061", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2952, "last_played": 1423313549}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fine, but it didn't make a lasting impression on me with the gameplay or storyline.

I only had to replay bosses a max of three times I think.\n\nAn easy recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1606271175, "timestamp_updated": 1606271175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558359622955322266", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79737935": {"recommendationid": "79737935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986972660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 959, "last_played": 1649012178}, "language": "english", "review": "i like you can turn into a bird\n", "timestamp_created": 1606190160, "timestamp_updated": 1606190160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "79585535": {"recommendationid": "79585535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049211839", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1231, "last_played": 1528774479}, "language": "english", "review": "Did not enjoy the RPG mechanics or the flying around.

Quite poetic and artistic!  The watercolor style is simply charming.  The game is very simple:  Move, fight to get experience and objects, get some dudes to have a strong gang, learn how to boost their fight performance based on their abilities, explore the world, find secrets, complete quests, and beat the bad guys.  \n\nThe fighting style resembles Pokemon fighting somehow and the characters interaction is very Japanese-visual-novel-style.  \n\nHowever, it is a very easy game, might be a little boring for hardcore gamers, but highly enjoyable for those who like quests and exploration, might be excellent for kids too.  \n\nSpecial Warning: Take care to go everywhere or you will end up like me ...completing the game without 2 of the main characters in your team, in my case Tristis and Genofeva.

Paired together, music & visuals really give you that unique vibe the game is going for.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay is really good, the battle system in particular is surprisingly tactical. It starts off as a classic JRPG's ATB, with characters waiting for their turn to play, and the ability to swap your teammates in-battle (think Final Fantasy 10 for those who've played it). \nBut to that you add the possibility of interrupting enemies before they can perform their actions, and being able to delay the ATB bar of a chosen enemy in real-time. That means you always have something to do, even when waiting for your turn to play. \nEach character has a unique set of abilities that makes them better suited to dealing with a certain kind of enemy, or a certain situation, which means you'll have to use each of your teammates at the right moment to win.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThis is a sort of fairy tale, and the story goes hand-in-hand with the visuals and the music.

This just seems to be a below average JRPG (turn-based game).\n\nWhile I am not exactly an expert on JRPG's, I do know that the standard party size for most JRPG's is 4. Generally speaking,  the party consists of the tank, healer, physical DPS, and magic DPS. In Child of Light, your party can only consist of 2 characters while in battle, but you can switch out characters at any point during your turn without wasting your turn. This effectively removes the need for a healer or tank. After all, if one of your characters takes too much damage, then you just switch out to one of your other characters. You can also rely on level ups to fully heal your party. You don't even have to have any strategy for this (e.g. skip normal encounters so that beating the boss will always level you up). I fought every enemy I encountered and never back-tracked in order to grind, and I leveled up like every 3 battles. So you really don't have to worry about the damage your party takes.\n\nThis means you never really need to build your characters for defense, just offense, which severely limits the customization potential of your party. You simply have to find out how the character can do the most damage, and put your skill points in that direction. This isn't even that hard because every character can only go in 3 linear paths in their skill tree. The best path is often fairly obvious. E.g. for a mage, do you want to go through the skill tree path that gives a 30% passive damage boost to all his spells or a better melee physical attack? \n\nTo be fair, JRPG's are not just about offense and defense. They're also about the status effects. However, there are very few status effects in this game, and even fewer status effects that you're going to want to use. I would say 80% of the stat boosts I used were either increasing the speed of my characters or lowering the speed of the enemy characters. The other 20% (usually boss fights) involved giving a damage boost to the most effective DPS for that boss or a status effect which stopped my party members from getting any negative status effects. So like 4 status effects\u2026.. That's not a lot.\n\nIt should also be noted that there's no loot/equipment in this game. Instead, you get gems which you can socket into 3 places (weapon, armor, accessory) which gives you various passive benefits. You can combine gems to form bigger gems that provide bigger bonuses. Unfortunately, the bonuses that these gems provide are so minimal (e.g. -20% physical damage) and so unnecessary (because the game isn't that difficult/complex to warrant you needing those gems) that I was never excited to get new gems. In the beginning, the main benefit they provided was to change the elemental damage of your physical attack (fire, lightning, and water). This was fairly useful since some enemies are weak and/or resistant against certain elemental attacks, so this can be a significant damage boost. However, you never have to actively change your gems because like I mentioned, you can change your characters at any time. So as long you have 2 party members with fire, lightning, and water damage each, you're all set.\n\nThe RPG elements in this game are simply far too shallow. I never got a satisfying feeling of building the perfect party in order to deal with any challenge I would face. That just leaves the combat as far as gameplay is concerned, and while it is admittedly kind of interesting, it gets boring very quickly. All characters, players and enemies included, take action based on a speed system. You can always see where any character is in the order of turns. When it's the character's turn, they decide what move to make, and each move takes varying degrees of time to cast (short, medium, long, very long). If a character takes damage while channeling a move, they'll be \"interrupted\" and fall back on the timeline and have to wait to perform a move all over again. You can also use your mouse to slow down one enemy's speed. It was fairly fun in the beginning mastering the system and being able to take like 10 turns in a row as I consistently interrupted a boss's attack. However, it got old fast because I fundamentally used the same strategy over and over again:\n\t\u2022 1 enemy (including bosses): Constantly interrupt them. If you do it properly, they'll maybe get 1 or 2 attacks in for the entire battle. Easy as hell.\n\t\u2022 2 enemies: Prioritize 1 enemy to kill using the characters most effective to kill them (e.g. physical or magic damage and fire, lightning, or water damage). They should die in like 2-3 hits without getting even 1 attack off. Then kill the last enemy who should be easy to kill.\n\t\u2022 3 enemies: Use a move to slow down all enemies and re-apply it if needed. Prioritize 1 enemy to kill and swap around party members (i.e. because you'll likely take a few hits since at 3 enemies, you can't effectively interrupt all of them) until it's dead. Proceed to use the strategy for 2 enemies and then the one for 1 enemy.\n\nThere's a story, but I didn't really care for it. You play as a little girl who's on a quest to return to her father and save him from an evil queen. Along the way, you'll meet your party members who have various side-stories themselves. The problem with the story is that pretty much all the stories are self-contained. The side-stories baaaaaaarely have anything to do with the main story at hand (apart from \"the evil queen caused this bad thing to happen to me. Please help me fix this bad thing\"). So it's like you spend 1 hour focusing on 1 story, then 1 hour on a completely different story, etc\u2026 This means I simply did not get attached to any of the characters and therefore did not end up caring what happened. I'll admit that the little girl you play as is cute, and it's cute how everyone talks in rhymes, but that's about it (i.e. I'll admit the characters and the story are cute).\n\nIn conclusion, there's just very little to sink your teeth into with this game. The RPG elements are really shallow, the combat gets very repetitive very fast, and the story is all over the place and at best it's the standard \"defeat the evil villain with the power of friendship\" story.", "timestamp_created": 1597713542, "timestamp_updated": 1597713551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74423171": {"recommendationid": "74423171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098137485", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 25, "last_played": 1595350548}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably a good game, sure looks like it, but I never got past trying to set up the Uplay launcher.", "timestamp_created": 1597610824, "timestamp_updated": 1597610824, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333343267440796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74317540": {"recommendationid": "74317540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400767617", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3238, "last_played": 1585369251}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is beautiful and I love it.", "timestamp_created": 1597445693, "timestamp_updated": 1597445693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "74071415": {"recommendationid": "74071415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156820753", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1141, "last_played": 1656848624}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n- Awesome music and stunningly beautiful graphics.\n- Fluid movement control when exploring, with a lot of treasure chest for exploring and some side quests to do. \n- Good battle system.

It goes back deeper to an earlier phase in my life. That warm feeling from times past when one of your parents read you a story from a picture book. In that wondrous state of almost falling asleep and being most impressionable for mood shifts in mom's or dad's voice.  Sometimes you cackle from laughter because something silly pops up. Sometimes you gaze at the beautiful drawings of hyperrealistic worlds where the grass is greener than green and the sea bluer than blue. Those otherworldy places where magical creatures (talking animals, fairies, trolls, ogres) look so different and yet so much like ourselves. Those magical places that throw difficulties and opportunities to a princess that can leave everything behind in her flight upwards. Sometimes you notice a sense of dread or sadness which feels out of tune with the innocent story that is being told. Not seldom was a night's sleep wasted over a story that inadvertently touched on more serious subjects like failure, fear, loss or even death and decay. \n\nBeing a thirty-something I occasionaly re-experience the joy of picture books through reading them for younger family members. For a vivid reader like myself it's a humbling thought that a good story doesn't need much to be gripping, as long as it knows how to strike the right chords to trigger your own imagination. I felt a similar joy while playing 'Child of Light' (2014) as a coming-of-age story of a princess who is blossoming towards maturity in a far-away land. Her journey both epic and small at the same time. I especially love its simple aesthetics as a blend of 2D- and 3D-animation and how the levels are designed with all these small visual treats. There's always something going on in the fore- or background like creatures flying around or weather elements and light effects filling the screen. All so vibrant and lively. Maybe the best part is the soundtrack by B\u00e9atrice Martin/Coeur de Pirate, whose usage of choirs make it feel that there is all the more at stake in Aurora's inner battles. Genuinely moving at times. \n\nGameplay-wise, the game offers enough tactical options for crafting with elementals or (re-) equipping your characters to let them have the upperhand in battles. Due to the large variety of side-characters, you have many different approaches how to go into a fight. Though I'm not a big fan of skill grids, and I did feel that a large portions of the game become repetitive because it had me swapping through menu's. Another small gripe is that once you get further on the skill grid, you find that future attacks are either stronger versions of those you already have or they affect more enemies at the same time. The variety really comes with the amount of playable characters and not so much from their individual skills.\n\nThere's much to love about how 'Child of Light' (2014) taps both into the simple, innocent joy of being a child and the bittersweetness of lost youth.

Child of Light is a simple turn-based RPG game. Although I am not into turn-based games in general, I enjoyed this one very much.\n\nFirst things first, the art is just absolutely stunning!! It's unique and simple, yet effective. Along with the amazing soundtrack (especially the ending song omg!!) they compensate for the shortage of narration throughout the story for me. The story itself with the side quests are basic and nothing unique about them. Nonetheless, I found myself attached to the characters until the end. The ending was kinda rushed but I was fine with it.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple. The timeline idea with firefly helping you in real-time was a nice touch differentiating it from other turn-based games. The crafting and leveling systems are easy to understand too. Maybe my only issue with the gameplay is how you get some of the characters late in-game. There is not enough time to experiment with them unless you're grinding. Also, there is not an option to select your party before starting any battle. Although they make up for this by not penalizing party changes mid-battle, but still I found it annoying.\n\nThe game has initially two difficulties: story one and expert. Just that. Nothing in between! I found that strange. The expert mode is challenging and sometimes irritating, especially if you're putting your skill points blindly as I did early in-game XD. But once you figure out the roles of each character in your party and how to utilize their abilities effectively, the game becomes much easier.\n\nAlthough some of my comments above, the game is worth playing especially since it's a short one.

I personally enjoyed playing it, as the game mechanics were fairly simple to learn. It reminded me a bit of other favorites of mine, yet I still found it original.\n\nThe plot isn't groundbreaking, but it had enough charm to keep me hooked. I personally think the story's main strength is its world-building. It's very unique and contains just enough depth to be believable.\n\nThe art and the music are what make this game stand out. I couldn't get enough of guiding Aurora through all the beautiful watercolor backgrounds. The music can be a bit repetitive, but each track individually is gorgeous. I could listen to the soundtrack all day. Excellent for setting the tone of the game.\n\nThe only major downside for me was the dialogue. Someone decided that all the characters needed to speak in rhyme, and everyone else went along with it. Unfortunately, this was not executed well. Many of the rhymes feel forced and unnatural. As a result, some dialogue feels as if it comes out of nowhere, and other lines don't make any sense at all. I can see how some people feel that it's a necessary part of the overall atmosphere, though. I just wish more care had been put into crafting the rhymes.\n\nOverall, I think this game is very enjoyable. If you like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, I think that's a good indicator that you'll like the game.\n\n-------------\n\n(Side note: don't buy the DLC. I only bought The Golem's Plight, and that was because I had a few more cents to spend, it was on sale at the time, and I thought it would be fun to have an extra character. You'll find hundreds of oculi in the game, so you won't need to buy any more with real money. The skin packs might be nice if you like the character designs, but you won't need the spells either. There are other characters in the game who already do a good job of casting those same spells. Even the Golem is debatable, as he's not a much better fighter than other characters and he doesn't add much story-wise. Don't buy unless you can think of a really good reason to.)", "timestamp_created": 1589549330, "timestamp_updated": 1589549330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "69129534": {"recommendationid": "69129534", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104678341", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 820, "last_played": 1589475901}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautiful picture-book, bedtime story, poem of a game.

It is not deep or complex. However, there are likeable characters and some good emotional moments as well.  \n\nThe gameplay combines platforming with traditional turned-based JRPG style combat and levelling. \n\nIt is very competent in both areas. The game has a nice thematic level design and a simple but effective battle system. \n\nHowever, many other games excel far greater individually in each aspect, GRIS as an artistic platformer, for example, while the majority of JRPG\u2019s have more complex battle and levelling systems. \n\nCombat is easy even on harder settings and doesn\u2019t demand the strategy or grind that most JRPG\u2019s require. The platforming elements are slightly more difficult than the combat but still fairly easy overall. It is in the platforming sections where the game shines the most. \n\nThis game is at its best when taking in the music and soaking in the setting whilst exploring the world.  \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for groundbreaking gameplay or a gripping storyline Child of the Light will disappoint you. \n\nOn the other hand, if you have had a hard day and want to put on a beautiful, calming and relaxing game to chill out too, Child of the Light will be exceptional for you.\n\nAdditional notes \n\n- Exploring every area and doing every side quest takes around 25-30 hours. \n- The DLC is rather pointless and unnecessary to purchase.\n- Saving is done by a regular autosave feature; there is no manual save option.\n- This game requires you to install and log in via Uplay.\n", "timestamp_created": 1586461209, "timestamp_updated": 1586461209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66951104": {"recommendationid": "66951104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380409280", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 562, "last_played": 1651362931}, "language": "english", "review": "amaezing bakgronds. hair is coolio. bery poetic. gaem is godlik. me like. me love gam.", "timestamp_created": 1586432245, "timestamp_updated": 1586432245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66950368": {"recommendationid": "66950368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081798926", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 522, "last_played": 1588132501}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple yet fun an engaging", "timestamp_created": 1586431267, "timestamp_updated": 1586431267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66844720": {"recommendationid": "66844720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271428660", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1586291431}, "language": "english", "review": "Soothing music, adorable graphics and cute characters with occasionally hilarious dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1586291520, "timestamp_updated": 1586291520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "66837793": {"recommendationid": "66837793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235546988", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 293, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 961, "last_played": 1586281273}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Consigue parecerse a un cuento cl\u00e1sico gracias a una gran est\u00e9tica de dibujo y una historia t\u00edpica de bien contra el mal.

While the story starts out weak it picks up later on and I got really engaged by the mid-section. Aurora as well as her companions kind of grow on you and you almost feel sad when the campaign ends. Not everyone will like it, especially with some of the weird dialogue early on, but I did (eventually). Though the highlight of this game has to be the soundtrack. Whether it is peaceful ambiance during exploring or blaring orchestra during boss fights, it all sounds wonderful. Art style is nice with very pretty drawn characters and levels. It is possible to play as two players when one controls Aurora (via keyboard or gamepad) and the second controls Igniculus \"the firefly\" (via mouse or 2nd gamepad). While moving the firefly precisely via gamepad is possible it is much more effective to use a mouse. This promotes having a second player around but also pushes solo players towards mouse and keyboard too. I tried both styles and while jumping is better via gamepad I preferred the accuracy of the mouse to move the firefly and once you get flight you don't jump at all. There are the only two difficulties and to truly engage with the combat system you need to try the harder one. And if you have the DLC and/or uPlay unlocks it is [u]really[/u] recommended to play on Expert because Casual difficulty becomes too trivial. That being said, I really dislike the timeline in combat and how it works. Sometimes it seems your character gets to go first only to be interrupted by the enemy who jumped in front of the queue. This is my biggest gripe with the game - the visibility of player/enemy turns. I got through it without lowering the difficulty but it sucked out the fun from some encounters. The combat itself is otherwise fun and I ended up using just about all companions for various fights. So while there was some frustration, defeating tough enemies still feels rewarding. A cool indie gem I didn't like at first ... but ended up enjoying a lot in the end!\n\n*Note: The local-only co-op can be circumvented by using Steam Remote Play Together.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] [u]uPlay unlockable DLCs:[/u] Confessional (map), Defense Dust (boost item), HP Dust (boost item), Magic Defense Dust (boost item), Magic Dust (boost item), MP Dust (boost item), Oculi (items), (3x) Defense (potion), (3x) Glow (potion), (3x) Lull (potion), (3x) Quicken (potion), (3x) Strength (potion), Cynbel Art Stack (wallpapers), Mathildis Art Stack (wallpapers), Rambert and Erin Art Stack (wallpapers).

No objection from me there.\n- The art style is quite unique. Might not be your cup of tea, but I personally quite liked it.\n- Managing the active time bar during encounters provided a fresh perspective into turn-based combat.\n- Talent tree galore. And it's meaningful too, as you won't be able to just take every single skill in a regular playthrough.\n- Liked the Oculli crafting and equiping system.\n- On Expert, it offers a good 20-24 hours of play.\n\nThe Cons:\n- The plot/story was typical fairy-tale story with very basic messages. Nothing wrong with that really, but don't expect anything insightful or groundbreaking.\n- The 2-character party is extremely limiting. \"-all\" spells are pretty much useless if you're just changing the support who casted it immediately. I think the team really should've balanced it around a 3-man party and go with that.\n- The difference between Casual and Expert is quite big. Especially on bosses. I did my playthrough on Expert from the start, since the alternative was \"Casual\" (I thought that meant \"Easy\" when, in fact, it's \"Normal\"). Some bosses and mini-bosses took between 5 and 10 minutes. Moreover, you will likely need to grind around 5 levels worth before trying to face the last two bosses.\n- Like I said above, game's about 20-24 hours on Expert (depending on how much you're willing to grind) but offers no reason to replay.

The combat system is pretty leveled out, you have a timer bar at the bottom, and your skill give you a time frame (Instant, Short, Medium, Long, Very Long) and your marker will move accordingly. You can interupt foes if you hit them while they are \"Casting\", as well as counter attack from both sides. Your little light friend also helps you in battle by slowing down your opponents, giving the players a small healing buff, or collecting \"wishes\" around the arena to heal and refill its bar.\n\nThe only thing, and I mean the ONLY thing, I have to complain about is how different the main character looks from the game itself. She is a 3D model, while all the mobs, other NPCs and background are all 2D. Except in dialogue scenes, where she is drawn in the same style as the rest. She seems very out of place, but I guess thats to drive home that shes not of that land. A little off putting at first, but eventually you get used to it.

Now, the game obviously isn't perfect, i bought it at the autumn sale, and honestly worth every single dollar, the DLC's in general are pretty useless, except for the golem and the Aurora\u00b4s skins ones, those are pretty decent, the other just give some gems that give you an early handicap. The game can be completed for the first time in 15 hrs maximum, i spent 38 hrs wich i used to complete the first run, the new game+ (both in expert mode), reseting several times to experiment some builds and team comps and obviously to enjoy it more, now i let you now the pros and cons:\n\n+ The art is simply charming, with all the watercolor vibes and the smooth palette you got an unique experience\n+ The sprites in general are good created, every one has an unique vibe and unique desings (The capillis for example)\n- Not all the sprites are drawn in the same way and that bothers (for example Aurora is like 3d drawn, her teamates are drawn in a 2d complex way, and the other characters are like copy pasted there in 2d)\n- Some sprites has minor glitch in their animation (Cordelia beast form or Aurora\u00b4s final form for example)\n\n+ The interfaces and the game in general are simple without unnecessary information or complex  mechanics\n+ The game has an ability tree mechanic that spread in 3 (and short) different ways for every single character\n+ Also has a power up like mechanic called oculli that consist in combine certain types of gems to upgrape an especific attribute (there's 9 differents gems so isn't difficult to understand it)\n\n+ Has an in-game colectionables that give to the game some extra to do\n- Remember this is an Ubisoft game so obviously there\u00b4s  bugs: the counter of the chests in the map is very fragile, if  you open a chest an inmediatly open another, the second one doesn\u00b4t enter in the chest counter and if you are a perfectionist you'll have to reset the entire game\n- Same for stardust counter\n\n= Doesn't have steam achievements\n- The Uplay reward thing is buged AF so even if you complete the achievement and redeem your price or appear randomly in your game after 20 hrs or doesn\u00b4t appear\n\n+ Has a very casual gameplay\n= The difficulty isn't challenging even in expert mode is pretty soft, if you die, you apear right before the battle \n\n+ The soundtrack is magic\n\nI mentioned the things that i considered important, honestly the game has very cool things that it will be better if you explore yourself, so if you like the casual and simple turn-based RPG, i highly recommend this one, i hope you give it a try and let this game amaze you like it did it with me, see ya. <3", "timestamp_created": 1579595835, "timestamp_updated": 1579596160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739542186260223389", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62159754": {"recommendationid": "62159754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092313524", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 3029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1779, "last_played": 1667160129}, "language": "english", "review": "Child of Light is a turn-based RPG fantasy game that follows a young girl named Aurora. She wakes up in a strange land and must work together with those she meets along the way to defeat the evil that is plaguing the land. I finished the game in about 30 hours (this includes my new game+ playthrough as well - So I'm guessing my first playthrough was somewhere around 15 to 20 hours?)\n\n+Charming fairy tale based story\n\n+Well-suited soundtrack and effects\n\n+Beautiful and creative environments/visuals and world building\n\n+Great character and enemy designs\n\n=(+?)No achievements or steam trading cards (I personally saw this as a plus because it was refreshing to just enjoy a game without having to worry about extra things)\n\n=Need a Uplay account to play it (this is a neutral for me because I didn't have any problems with it myself though other people have reported issues)\n\n-The style the characters are drawn in aren't consistent throughout the cast (there are a handful of sprites/models that seem out of place with the rest of the characters and environments). This is disappointing to me because I feel like the sprites/models that are different would've looked so much better in the style the rest are in. It's also a little immersion breaking.\n\n-The main antagonist, Umbra, has a glitch with her talking sprite where you can see her bald head glitch through her own hair during text transitions. This may have happened elsewhere, but if it did, I didn't notice. Umbra's glitch is glaringly obvious and is also immersion breaking.\n\n-Some of the lines in the rhyme/poem format felt a little off or forced. For the most part it worked, and I can understand occasional issues considering just the sheer amount of dialogue they had to put in this format. So, really this one isn't a big deal, but I just thought I would mention it anyway (I enjoy the concept regardless).\n\n-There are times where Aurara's skin seems unnaturally yellow (like an almost-as-saturated-as-the-most-saturated-part-of-her-dress kind of yellow) - especially her face. It seems to only be an issue of the early game version of her though. I can't go into any more detail on this because of potential spoilers, but yeah, doesn't look the greatest sometimes in the beginning.\n\nUltimately, I really enjoyed the game. I know it looks like I had a lot more to say about the negatives of the game, but that's really just me being nit-picky about visual issues for the most part. These are all just minor things that, although don't really ruin the game, could've been better. The game is still well-made and a wonderful experience. I recommend giving it a look (on sale if you feel like the minor things I mentioned are worth that to you).", "timestamp_created": 1579565714, "timestamp_updated": 1579565726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "62053751": {"recommendationid": "62053751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066619398", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 816, "last_played": 1579411104}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is art.", "timestamp_created": 1579384621, "timestamp_updated": 1579384621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61881181": {"recommendationid": "61881181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091967825", "num_games_owned": 882, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 67, "last_played": 1441507858}, "language": "english", "review": "Mediocre at best, there is nothing to highlight, generic story, characters, levelling and battle system are ok generally, but if u look for a good RPG this is not it", "timestamp_created": 1579085339, "timestamp_updated": 1579085339, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.45283016562461853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "61840554": {"recommendationid": "61840554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026631655", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1579005238}, "language": "english", "review": "This game requires uPlay, which could have been annoying, but at least now it is properly integrated with Steam unlike a few years ago, and so it is no added hassle.\n\nThis could have been a great puzzle platformer.

For example, many maps are quite empty and lack landmarks which made you lost, especially for some quests which requires you to find something early in the map. Unless you have the memory of a superman, you'd either search every corners again or look online for walkthroughs. The battle system is similar to final fantasy, it just feels somewhat annoying, as you can't see enemy hp, also gets interrupted a lot.\n\nThe skill system and gem forging systems are also more confusing than it should be, also you can't see what your skills do during battle, you'd have to remember that. Also you have like 7 to 8 characters but you actually only use 3 or maybe 4.\n\nThe dialogues are lengthy and sometimes irrelevant, and sometimes using a strange \"ancient grammar\" while other times just normal, I think it would be much better to have dialogues in regular grammar while just having the poetic grammars in poems etc.\n\nThe story line is pretty empty and sometimes I feel that the insertion of the flute music into the story line is quite forced.\n\nAnyway if you enjoy a beautiful game with nice music and sceneries.

From the aesthetic of the game to the engaging take on turn-based combat this game captivated me enough to play two normal play throughs plus a New Game Plus play through. There are four aspects to the game which I will discuss that my personal recommendation stands on; story and dialogue, the graphics, the soundtrack and the combat. Please note that I will be keeping this review as a personal story of myself with the game, I suggest you look at other reviews for more in-depth details regarding mechanics as you will not find that here. \n\nStory/Dialogue:\nThis game is a fairy tale through and through, from the story to the rhyming narration and dialogue. This is arguably the weakest part of the game as I have seen reviews that point out how the constant rhymes can be annoying towards the later end of the game. However for me personally this take on story telling not only drew me into the world, but made me laugh, smile and tear up; providing a charming narrative which I have yet to get tired of. \n\nThe Graphics:\nI will not comment much on the graphics of the game as it is clear to see the distinct style that Child of Light offers is one of its draws. It drew me into the game and I have no regrets about my purchase or the requirement of a Ubisoft account (something at the time, I did not have). All I have to say regarding the artwork that this game is, is that it compliments the fairy tale aesthetic of the game and filled me with awe and wonder as I ventured into new areas. \n\nThe Soundtrack:\nFor anyone considering to purchase this game or even those who don't have an interest in games like this, I suggest you listen to the soundtrack. The beauty of the main theme exemplifies the appeal of the environment and the child like fascination with this remarkable fairy tale. The ambient music encourages you to adventure through the wonderous environments. The frenetic combat and boss music filled me with energy as I sought combat to either further the story or for a way to strengthen my characters. The piano is the key centrepiece of the soundtrack and is enchanting bringing you further into the game and the world it is set in.\n\nThe Combat:\nWhile some might be turned off by turned base combat, the way in which Child of Light engages the player through the ability to control the pace of combat adds another level of tactics to what otherwise would be simplistic combat. But this addition removed the monotony of combat and I actively grinded levels in order to experience more of the innovative take on turn based combat. \n\nAs with any game it is not perfect, however, this game not only helped open my eyes to what games could be as well as being a way I could use games to make me feel better in not just a relaxing way, but also an emotionally fulfilling way. I kept this review personal to me because the story of how this game brightened my mood best conveys my recommendation for this game and I am thankful for the creators for making a game that always put a smile on my face.", "timestamp_created": 1577100456, "timestamp_updated": 1577100456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60210434": {"recommendationid": "60210434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145102434", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 120, "last_played": 1451804532}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked Child of light.

Basically, it's the story of a princess which is emprisoned in her dreams and tries to escape from it. During her journey, she's granted different magical powers like Fairy wings.\n\nThe battle are pretty strategic, because good timing can lead the enemy not even being able to attack.  There's also a gem crafting mechanic which allows you to buff your stats in certain regards, like stronger resistance to Earth attacks. By the way, while we are talking about elemental attacks, there is some kind of counter-system which is similar to Pok\u00e9mon but not as fleshed out. \n\nFor the price which is asked, the game length is pretty good in my opinion. There's some replayability if you want to catch all achievements which are on some side quests. Sadly, an announced sequel of this game was cancelled for a reason which remains unknown as far as I know.\n\nI would love to see more games of this kind, but apparently the market for it is kinda small I assume due to Ubisoft decision to cancel a sequel. The DLCs are not really worth it, they just give early game buffs and a different skin to the character. The other DLCs which grants you gems is not worth it all. They're just consumables you get automatically in the game, it just speeds up the experience which kinda destroys the purpose of this game, namely admiring the beautiful scenery with fun but not very difficult combats, at least on the normal difficulty.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty good too with some calm piano and orchestral scores.\n\nFinally, I would say that if you like casual RPG games and excellent art design, I would recommend this to you, especially on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1576860382, "timestamp_updated": 1576966806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723780274391174316", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60167426": {"recommendationid": "60167426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063400329", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1103, "last_played": 1570219005}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting concept and art style, but unfortunately after almost 20 hours of trying to get used to the combat mechanics, I just ended up finding them tedious, and not very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1576843201, "timestamp_updated": 1576843201, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "60146663": {"recommendationid": "60146663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323650189", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 994, "last_played": 1606428797}, "language": "english", "review": "These are the kind of games I crave.

It is worth it, more than worth it. I will say even full price is worth it. \n\nI've had never known that this game is turn-based. I was only interested in it because I like these indie games with beautiful artstyle, music etc... In fact, I almost hate turn-based game. However, I didn't refund Child of Light, because the combat is actually quite good, interesting and very challenging. Easy to get used to but hard to master. Based on the very basic turn-based gameplay, they added it a timeline with a small \"cast\" line at the end. Each combatant in the field can only start his/her action when they reach the \"cast\" line, and then they need to go through that line to finally do the action. Each character has their own speed and there are 4 speed types for action: quick, medium, long and very long. Combined together, the time for you to go through that \"cast\" line will be very quite different depends on your character on the field and his/her action. This is very important because if your character got hit when casting, his/her will be interrupted and pushed back on the timeline. There are 2 ways to prevent this: using defend (action) or unstoppable (either elexir or spell from characters). With this system, you can also cheese your enemies if you hit them during there casting phase to intterrupt them as well, especially with Igniculus, your dear firefly. You can use Igniculus to slow enemies on the timeline or heal your combatants on your field (only one at a time). By using Igniculus, you can prevent enemies from acting and/or allow you to multiple action in a row without worrying about being interrupted. Note that Igniculus has a mana meter and using any of its ability will deplete it. As the fight get longer, you will have less chance to use Igniculus (you can refill that meter as well).\nYou can change your combatants on your field in your turn without losing it, so u can switch to another character if one yours on the field is being low on health and you can't heal him/her or if you want to focus on enemies weakness that some of your characters can exploit. Talking about weakness, every enemy have their own strength and weakness. However, the game never tell you that so in order to achknowledge them, you have to get in a fight, attack for some turns and then flee (instant, free and 100% success.) Or you can just search for them on the internet :s (I won't judge you for doing it, especially on expert mode which is brutal).\nThere are oculli (gems) and potions you will find while playing. You can't buy them, so the only way to find them is exploring. open chests and winning fights (they drop randomly at the end of each fight). You can also craft ocullis if you already have some in your inventory. 3 same ocullis in same quality will result in 1 higher tier of that oculli or you can mix 2/3 ocullis together for a unique oculli (again, must be same quality). The best oculli of all is Princess Stone and during my playthrough, I could only craft 2 of them. Oculli have different effects when apply to each slot (there are 3 slots, one oculli when apply to a specific slot will have different effect and diffrent occulis have diffrent effects as well). Based on enemies during your fight, you might want to change your occuli loadout (must flee to do so). This will happen very frequently so you need to get used to it. \n\nNow, about what bring me into this game. Child of Light has beautiful soundtracks and good story (generic, but good nonetheless). Both of them will start off quite low and only begin to grow into you stronger later on mid game and become very good (music), interesting (story) during late game. The final boss fight music is absolute epic and phenomenal, meanwhile credit music is beautiful and emotional. \nAlso one thing I didn't know about this game is that this game use rhyme instead of normal lines, completely. Every single line, dialogue, narrator etc... are rhyme. I'm not a fan of rhyme so at early game this really annoy me, but later on I get used to it. If you like rhyme then considering this aspect because the rhyme in this game is beautiful. \n\nFor an RPG game, of course there will be some sidequests. Fortunately, there are not much in this game and most of them will just reward you will occuli, potion or stardust (a consumable that permently increase a specific stat on whoever you use it on). Note that sidequest doesn't reward you exp. \n\nIf you play this game just for the artstyle, music and story, play on casual mode. Expert mode is no joke. I played 1st playthrough on expert because I didn't expect it to be that hard. Enemies hit like a truck, have tons of health and they also have some very annoying strength/weakness. I mamaged to keep my game on expert but it was literally hell. Every fight is intense and you will have to bring your A-game most of the times. I raged quit during some boss fights as well. But of course, winning a difficult fight is indeed satisfying.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good game. 9/10 for me. No bugs/glitches/crash. \n\nP.s: Fuq you Ubisoft. I exchange your Ubisoft club rewards but they are nowhere to be found in the game. Not in my inventory.

Maybe can get to people who are very emotional, otherwise it feels a little off, but not bad. Everything is in rhymes, simple ones at that. It's all together more on the lighter side - emotional and humor wise.\n\nArt 8/10 - The art is beautiful. The style is unique and kinda looks like animated paper art. The backgrounds have a lot of details and you see the love the Artist put into it.\n\nCharacters 5/10 - Just like the story, very simple character designs. You won't dislike them, but you won't grow attached either. When one leaves your party your first thought would probably be ''Oh, I just leveled you though ToT''. Character Development isn't really the case here, but this one is focusing mainly on the playing experience rather than Story and Character.\n\nGameplay 6/10 - The gameplay is easy, Puzzles are pretty simple and you don't really need to think much to solve them, as they are pretty self-explanatory. The RPG elements are decent, not the best and not the worst. I personally enjoyed the fighting. It's a turn based system but rather than just simply that it depends on a timeline that you (unfortunately also your enemies) can manipulate. With Oculis (you can craft those) you can add certain stats to you and your party. \n\nOverall Impression  7/10 - You can easily breathe through it in one session (I took 13 hours and discovered about 90%) It was enjoyable to me and I'm sure that if you look for something lighthearted, this is a good go-to. I don't recommend farming for Oculis in this game though, very tedious and not really necessary. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1568708268, "timestamp_updated": 1568708268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "55116898": {"recommendationid": "55116898", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977450814", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 416, "playtime_forever": 883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 883, "last_played": 1568513798}, "language": "english", "review": "This game blew away my small expectations and is probably the most underrated RPG game I have played this year. \n\nThe battle system is probably the most interesting where its turn-based combat but they throw in the notion of a timeline split between \"wait\" and \"cast\".

It's a beautiful game to look at with a fable like art style.\nSometimes I just like to explore a level to see the background scenery with all the little details the developers put in.\n\nYour playable characters all have a unique skill tree and a backstory with a special side mission associated with them, like the loyalty missions of Mass Effect. All your characters receive XP even if they are not fighting, and since each have a unique set of skills, each fill its own niche in a fight. Example: Finn is an elemental mage, useful when enemies share an elemental weakness. Your main character is a balanced magic swordman with anti-dark abilities.\n\nThe combat system is based around a timeline, with several mechanics to manipulate and interrupt the advancement speed and executions of the skills. You play with two characters at a time and can swap them at will during the character's turn. The starting position on the timeline is semi random with bonus if you 'ambush' the enemy in the overworld. There is enough variations with enemy weaknesses/timeline that you can't spam the same strategy over and over to quickly finish a fight and you have to think on what to do, especially if you are underleveled for an area. This added spice keep the combat from feeling too repetitive.\n\nEach character has three slots, and the equipment is in the form of crystals called 'oculi' that can be combined to have different effects. Example: a ruby add fire damage as weapon, but fire resistance as defense. I advise looking for the crafting table online and not discover the combinations yourself if you want to get to the highest tier equipment as the highest tier item requires basically all the oculi you can collect in a playthrough to craft.\n\nThe story is not particularly unique with many cliche, especially the plot twists. I still enjoyed it because of the unique characters you get to know along the ride. The ending was satisfying for me. It took me about 10h to finish the game and I'm a completionist. You can probably finish the game in 5h if you rush it.\n\nIn short, this is a good game if you are looking for a 5h to 10h linear fairy tale story game with beautiful art presentation and unique characters.", "timestamp_created": 1567926143, "timestamp_updated": 1567926143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54983382": {"recommendationid": "54983382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004390913", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1896, "last_played": 1567747756}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautiful game with a fun story.

When you touch an enemy, the action shifts into a turn-based RPG system, where you will select commands and manipulate a gauge that controls your party\u2019s turn speed.\n--- The main game can be completed in about 20-30 hours (depending on skill and if you decide to 100% everything). \n--- There is a new game plus system if you decide to go through again.\n--- Supports either keyboard or controller inputs.  Controls are very responsive.\n\nGRAPHICS: \n--- Looks sharp and runs nicely on my system, which is 5 years old. As usual, visit any game's Steam page to ensure your system can handle it.\n--- The art style is reminiscent of a story book or watercolor painting.  Animation can seem a bit stiff in some of the character movements, but nothing too jarring or offputting.\n--- Runs buttery smooth with no lag or hiccups whatsoever.  \n\nSOUND:\n--- Great symphonic score to accompany the action.  Generally mellow tones for the 2D platforming action, and more dramatic tones for the battle phases.\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n--- A UPlay account must be created and active while playing this game.\n--- Certain DLC items can be unlocked by earning UPlay coins, which are acquired after performing certain achievements\n--- One achievement appears to be dead (the one you get for trading stones with a friend online; the online system is now gone).  Keep this in mind if you\u2019re an achievement hunter.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n--- I found this to be a lot fun for what it was. I picked it up for less than $5, and couldn't be happier with my purchase. \n--- I went through the game twice, but don\u2019t think I\u2019d return again anytime soon (unless the dead achievement is somehow obtainable one day).   \n--- Recommended for those folks who love platformers and classic JRPGs.\n", "timestamp_created": 1567287624, "timestamp_updated": 1567287624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491969943046569824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54887593": {"recommendationid": "54887593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122639911", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1001, "last_played": 1521341940}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, can be played continuously, not boring.

From the reviews a few years ago, I had thought this might be a universally appreciated game, an aesthetic and gameplay experience that was moving and uplifting. But as I'm playing it, it definitely feels uneven in what it delivers. More importantly, it's definitely oriented toward a younger demographic than I expected. I would have adored this game when I was thirteen, I think. (No slam, of course---I love deeply the games I played when I was that age.) \n\nFrom the get-go, there are a number of underwhelming elements. The writing, in particular, is distractingly poor. There's a fun conceit that everyone speaks in couplets and the occasional quatrains, which should be great---only the poetry is really low-quality. There's more to poetry (even whimsical poetry!) than rhyming! I'm really, really tired of developers getting that the art should be phenomenal, and then treating the writing and elegance of story-presentation as an afterthought. It's like wearing a dress and then going out in sneakers. \n\n\"If you don't let me pass this day / I will turn you into clay!\"  would be endearing if at least *some* of the poetry by the narrator or wise characters has *some* understanding of meter or beautiful phrasing. But it's ALL just awkward prose with two rhyming sentences in a row. Oof.\n\nThen the story itself is not great. For some reason, there's an over-story about 1895 Austria, which, before I bought the game, I was like \"hey, cool! That's interesting.\" But in fact, it's not integrated into the story or art in any way. There's no sprinkled German words or names, the fantasy art doesn't seem particularly Austrian-inspired. Instead, it creates a lot of distance between the world Aurora is trying to return to, and the one she is in. This is one of those inelegant joints that prevents this game from feeling like a completely smooth package.\n\nCombat was okay, although also not quite right. For the first five hours, even on the hardest difficulty, I could win every battle almost immediately by surprise attacking and then mass striking them. The bigger disappointment was the lack of RPG elements: There's no meaningful choices for your characters. You level up a 'branch' that orients your stats toward strength or magic or defense, but doesn't really change your gameplay or unlock new skills. (One branch unlocks: Strike I, Strike II, Strike II (all), Strike III. Boring!) Passive skills are meaningless, like one that gives a measly 10% chance of counterattack. It's one of those games that *has* crafting, inventories, skillpoint trees, but for all intents and purposes isn't really an RPG. In the end, combat always felt a bit scrunched, and I didn't quite get a sense of what the combat wanted to be.\n\nThe art was good, and the main theme is beautiful. However, Aurora herself is kind of dreary and obtuse. I did enjoy, though, that the game gave up on platforming after the first hour -- an unexpected breath of fresh air from the Metroidvania ability-drip for map exploration.\n\nAnd then, of course, the technical things. My cheap laptop (which can play Total War: Warhammer on low just fine) could only play this game on 800x600 resolution. I buy these games in part because my computer can run them, and it was dissappointing the lack of optimization or graphical options. And then, of course, you have to install a bunch of Ubisoft junk in order to play this of UPlay -- not something I feel enraged by, by annoying, nonetheless.\n\nSo, in the end, if you're looking for one of this indie gems, this probably isn't it: This is dependent on age, or love of artistic concept. Which is fine! However, if you're looking for a gentle, beautiful, relaxing, whimsical, children's-story-esque platformer, give Trine 2 a try first.", "timestamp_created": 1561900895, "timestamp_updated": 1561954037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499003082513809204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52418703": {"recommendationid": "52418703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023444802", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1568, "last_played": 1520434790}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1561898362, "timestamp_updated": 1561898362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "52377177": {"recommendationid": "52377177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056021119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1266, "last_played": 1444648283}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not usually into platformers, but this game was different.

It should be considered as \"a work of art\", rather than just a game. This game does so many things right that it's hard to find a place to start talking about it.\n\nChild Of Light takes place in a beautiful, watercolored looking world where characters speak in rhymes(except one, but I'll get to that). It is a coming of age story that has a fairy tale feeling all around it, with our main character Aurora pulling a sword from a pedestal within the first minutes of the game. Even though it looks like it's a platformer at the beginning, platforming aspects soon disappear and a 10 hour long RPG journey begins.\n\nThe characters are charming, lovable and, most of the time, adorable. Their personalities and banters are a joy to witness. My favorite was easily Rubella, who always failed to speak in rhymes. It usually infuriated other characters, who tried to fix her. There are many playable characters filling different roles such as tank, healer, physical dps, magical dps, buffing/debuffing etc. You can change characters on a whim during fights. The combat system is ATB, with a twist. As your character's icon gets to a spot on ATB bar, you give them a command. If they are attacked before they execute that command, it is canceled and they are put back on the bar. You can also use your cursor to slow down enemies and heal your allies during combat, which makes it very interactive and never boring. It is an easy game however, even on hard mode I scarcely felt in danger. \n\nSoundtrack is among the finest I've had the pleasure of listening. Most of the time, music in games can't catch my attention, and I have to listen to them afterwards to appreciate them. But even on the title screen, this game's soundtrack captured me and never let go. It creates a magical atmosphere as it is accompanied by gorgeous graphics. Aurora's hair is animated so wonderfully that you can just stand there and watch it as a beatiful piece of music plays in the background. Character sprites are as good as the world itself, which is quite a feat.\n\nI can talk about this game for hours and still can't express how dazzling and fascinating it is. I just hope I can convince you to give it a shot as it is totally worth every cent you can spend on it. It saddens me so much that we will never see a sequel(real or spiritual) to this hidden gem.

Out of all of the games in the bundle, none left as much of an impression on me as much of Child of Light did. Far Cry lasted longer, Watch Dogs had unique elements to it and South Park was hilarious. But none of them stuck with me.

I felt like I was floating through a water-coloured dreamscape, which, if I wasn't careful was as dangerous as it was enchanting. The melodies were poignant and struck a chord even with someone as heartless as myself. It was clear Aurora was a lost child, but as she explored, the music gave way to a tune of hope as she found allies to alleviate the loneliness.\n\nChild of Light has fairytale elements, what with the whimsical rhyming between the characters and narrator and the colourful cast who can tag along, should you choose to help them.\n\nIt offers a turn based combat system, with the ability to knock back or interrupt attacks. This requires careful planning of turns, where you consider the risks of pulling off a flashy move, if say the enemy has a chance to go before you and cancel out the attack altogether! It is reminiscent of Grandia 2 and for me, makes the combat highly enjoyable. And if you are into the ol' skill trees, the also game boasts an expansive array of skill options for the cast.\n\nMy parting words to you all?

Aurora is a young princess in Austria during the late 1800's who finds herself banished to the mythical realm of Lemuria. To return home, she must traverse this surreal place and help the many beings that have been affected by the Evil Queen. In return, they join her party and lend Aurora their strength on her mission to return home. \n\nStylistically, the game is very nice both visually and musically. Aurora's flowing red hair stands out against the illustrated backgrounds and characters, and the musical score is a mellow combination of string and piano that accentuates the lullaby feeling surrounding the story. This is only compounded by the fact that (almost) every character speaks in rhyme, as well as the generally floaty nature of the movement in the game.\n\nMechanically, the game is neither especially complex nor overly simple. The combat is turn-based, but the active party only has 2 slots so the variety of choices available at a given moment feel a bit lower than the typical 3-member setup. This is combined with an initiative timeline where players can interrupt enemies if they strike them just as they are preparing to attack, and vice versa. Each character as well as Aurora has 3 paths of skills to improve on, but these paths don't really intertwine with each other so the process of leveling becomes very straightforward as you try to max out one path to make sure each character is at least focused and useful, so every character has only a handful of skills they ever need to use. \n\nRather than equipping weapons and armor, every character has 3 slots for gems called Oculi. Combining 3 Oculi of the same color makes an Oculi of a higher level, while combining 2 Oculi of different colors creates a different kind of Oculi. Since the effectiveness of the Oculi change depending on their type and what slot they are in, experimenting with the different types of Oculi and figuring out which ones most fit your play style provides much of the games depth and long term strategy.\n\nGrinding is easy, since you can easily blind enemies with Igniculus' flare and sneak up on them to initiate an ambush. Most of the time combat comes down to whether physical combat is good enough to handle things or if it's necessary to bring out one of the few characters with decent magic attacks to exploit specific vulnerabilities before settling into the groove of interrupting enemies and slowing them down using Igniculus' light. While things are noticeably tougher on Hard than on Normal, even then Child of Light is rarely frustrating or overwhelming. \n\nOverall, Child of Light is a 2D RPG with a clear focus on storybook style and a dreamlike story. Good for a dozen hours of exploratory play and simple turn-based combat, and recommended for anyone who enjoys a good lullaby and can get over the protagonist being a fairy princess.", "timestamp_created": 1550899440, "timestamp_updated": 1550899440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49118237": {"recommendationid": "49118237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125867141", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1614679243}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful fantastic fascinating", "timestamp_created": 1550663451, "timestamp_updated": 1550663451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49061753": {"recommendationid": "49061753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075799843", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 809, "last_played": 1459983338}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful, moving and addicting", "timestamp_created": 1550440296, "timestamp_updated": 1550440296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "49023367": {"recommendationid": "49023367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083429124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1380, "last_played": 1551384891}, "language": "spanish", "review": "hace poco me lo termine, hace tiempo que no jugba un juego tan bueno, realmente me estremecio todo mi ser desde el inicio hasta el final, gracias a todos los que trabajaron para poder brindar tal expectacular experiencia", "timestamp_created": 1550299019, "timestamp_updated": 1550299019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "48977216": {"recommendationid": "48977216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198251960124", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1000, "last_played": 1550095581}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, i think this is a piece of art.

You play Aurora, a young girl who falls ill and wakes up in dark kingdom of Lemuria, which she needs to free from evil Queen of Night, Umbra. You travel first by jumping and then flying, while solving puzzles with use of your elemental friend Igniculus, a helpful little guy that is also your mouse icon and whom you can use to make light, blinding enemies so Aurora can pass them, cast shadows on objects, open floating boxes and activate mechanisms through mirrors.\n\n In combat, you have a modified turn-based fight with two members of your party facing up to three enemies. The order is dedicated by how yor characters move on the timeline and you can use Igniculus to slow enemies down. Each action you choose takes time to execute so if you're not careful enemy might get a hit on your characters while you're executing an attack, interrupting it and pushing your character back on the timeline. There is an extra number of mechanics you need to keep an eye on, including elemental resistance and vulnerabilities based on what crystals you equip to characters or which enemies will counterattack if you interrupt them using magic, physical force or both. The fights can be challenging even on easy difficulty if you are not careful. There is a number of ways to make them less challenging in late parts of the game, with characters like \u00d3genus -a party tank who attracts enemies to himself - or Norah and Genovefa's abilities to paralyze your enemies. However, while they might become a necessity on the harder difficulty, they can make the game too easy on the lower and one of the game's flaws is lack of a middle difficulty level. You either play it as a casual player like me, who wants to enjoy the story and atmosphere more than battles or as a hardcore gamer for whom it's not fun unless every charming party member gets punched to the bring of their life by each encounter. A middle ground would be much welcome for players who wish for best of both worlds and find hard mode to suck as much fun out of the game as they do think easy mode is too easy in late stage.\n\nThe cast of characters is incredibly charming. Aurora is a brave little girl with a big heart who rather realistically just wants to go home to her father and Igniculus being her loyal sidekick. On their travels, they get aided by a number of characters that show quite a lot of awareness of typical rpg archetype and lack of fear towards playing with them on the creator's side. Finn, both a wizard and local equivalent of a dwarf is, despite his beard, a scared teenager who needs moral support. While Robert, the resident archer is as far removed from typical rpg take on the character as possible, not only being a giant bipedal mouse but also a shrewd businessman whose main motivation turns out to be love. It's just two examples out of a rich and very sympathetic cast. The creators know their fantasy and know how to deliver old tropes and archetypes in a way that we either find interesting or can accept. Most genre savvy players would figure Umbra's identity as far as chapter one but the reveal is played as twist for the main character, not for the players, coming off as just an extra to a twist people were less likely to see coming.  And even including the antagonists I need to say that at no point have I found any character annoying. \n\nIt might be in part because the game's entire story is delivered in rhyme, giving it very charming, kid-friendly feel. It fits seamlessly with stunning graphics of this imaginative, fantastic world that evoke style of a children's book and a climactic soundtrack that, while limited is full of enchanting piano and violin parts as well as epic battle themes (complete with chanting chorus for boss battles) that never grow tiresome no matter how much you hear the same track. It really feels like a fairy tale the story is obviously inspired by and on easier difficulties I would recommend it to any gamer with kids - it has good morals and everything to get a kid fascinated as a good fairy tale would and you can easily play together, with one of you controlling Aurora and the other controlling Igniculus.\n\nThe only other flaw the game has is the post-ending gameplay. You can continue roaming the world after finishing the game, which feels out of place. It clashes with the effort put to make the game feel like a storybook with a definite end and even undermines it somehow. Child of Light is a focused story that does not offer much in a way of post-game content. Unless you didn't neglect some sidequests or need to collect all the confessions - pieces of lore floating around on sheets of paper in the wind - there is really nothing to do. Combat at this point becomes too easy, as you are so powerful you can kill all enemies in many areas with single strike and leveling your characters is sooner than latter gonna turn into a grind. The only appeal of playing after finishing the story for me is to appreciate the beautiful world and let it become your soothing, feel-good game to relax. It feels like Ubisoft tacked it on the last minute out of, I don't know fear otherwise people might say they made an indie game and an actual story and not a \"Triple A experience\"?\n\nNonetheless, Child of Light is a game with amazing atmosphere, wonderful style, charming characters and story that makes you feel like a kid tucked in your bed when mom comes to read you before sleep, but might also be a challenging experience for veteran players.

The greatest strength is definitely the presentation, the art style and the character animations. It\u2019s definitely a beautiful game. The RPG mechanics are simple, but that\u2019s perfectly fine, without complex mechanics. There\u2019s a leveling system, 2-character parties, skill trees, some crafting and the regular ATB mechanics, with some focus on timing and interrupting actions. Definitely gets the job more than done. There\u2019s even a helper that you can assign to a second player if you wish. The game is a bit short, but there\u2019s plenty of collectibles scattered, some secret areas and some side quests. And, as long as you don\u2019t avoid the enemies, you never need to grind on the normal difficulty, which is also pretty nice. There\u2019s even a new game plus mode if you want to replay the game with more abilities. The enemies scale, but you\u2019ll have more weapons in your arsenal this time, since you can fill all the skills trees by the end. The story is good with some twists and the characters enjoyable. Another thing I really enjoyed was the music. It\u2019s beautiful during exploration and epic during battle, especially bosses. It\u2019s a great little gem.\nHowever, I had issues with some decisions made by Ubisoft. One party member is locked behind paid DLC, and the other ones are overpriced for what they offer. Get the Golem Plight Pack, and maybe the Light and Dark Aurora Packs, which offer some skins if you want. But don\u2019t bother with the other 4, they\u2019re mostly a waste of money. While Uplay ran smoothly, I had 2 issues: you can\u2019t get an Uplay action anymore since a light online function was shutdown, although I managed to unlock it through Ubisoft Support. And secondly, for some reason, none of the Uplay rewards unlocked in-game. Seriously, just save the points and use them somewhere else if you\u2019re not bothered by having everything unlocked on the Uplay platform.\nBut despite these annoying decisions and issues, it\u2019s still a great game.

Sometimes you get up from the bed to take a peek inside the book, to see the gorgeous watercolored pictures of the princess, her friends and other characters.

Come on guys, it's designed that way. I don't want to spoil it out here, so let's just go with \"you are going to have fun if you are able to appreciate fairy tale tropes\".\n\nLet's talk about gameplay a bit. It's a mix of a very simplified metroidvania with turn-based jrpg style battles. There is an action meter (like in Grandia) instead of a mere turns order. There is also a nice gameplay mechanic allowing the player to affect the speed of the enemies' turns. That alone gives enough tactical depth to gain an advantage even in the situations where you weren't really supposed to win due to underleveling or bad team composition.\n\nI've played on the Hard difficulty. I found it not really \"hard\" by the jrpg standards, but without any grind during playthrough, I actually had some difficult moments. Overall, I think that the balance is quite good and if you have some experience in jrpgs, you should be fine with Hard difficulty.

If you want a good puzzle platformer you're better off playing a castlevania game, a metroid game, ori and the blind forest, and so on.\n\nAs a turn-based RPG, the game has a handful of the usual things you would expect -- elemental weaknesses and strengths, spellcasting and interruptions, haste and slowing turn order, gemming and gear customization and so on -- but It doesn't do anything particularly new or interesting with those mechanics.  And I think it's hampered by having only 2 slots for characters in combat at once.  You can swap party members instantly on your turn with the swapped-in character immediately getting their turn.  So you can get use out of your different characters... but there are so many characters with overlapping abilities I never found the need to use each and every character.  And mroe to the point, having only 2 slots means you're basically competing to get 2 turns while your enemy often gets 3, which does add some challenge but feels cheap in doing so.\n\nStory-wise and art-wise, I give the game props for successfully feeling like you're inside a children's fairy tale, with rhyming or near-rhyming dialogue (for most of the game) and watercolor backgrounds.  I will complain that the sprite for the main heroine is rather on the ugly side (kind of super-deformed with a big head)... well, actually all the sprites are pretty lackluster, but the backgrounds are beautiful, and the character profiles in the dialogue windows are pretty, though perhaps not especially expressive.  As for the characters themselves, it's a really short game with a whole lot of characters, so none of them get a whole lot of time.  Sidequests will give you a bit more, and you get some banal after-battle interactions between your previous characters and a new character after picking him up.  I think it would have been better, given the length of the game, to have fewer characters, or to have choices between which character to take, and branching dialogue paths based on which characters you got (like what Square did in secret of mana 2, for instance).\n\nLet me also address the multiplayer mode of this game.  You can have a second player handle the firefly for you if you want, but mostly the game is setup in such a way that you're only ever using the character or the firefly at any given moment, and there's never a need to use both simultaneously.  You can slow enemies during the rpg battle phase of the game by sparking the firefly on them, and this is practically a necessity for bossfights with especially speedy enemies, but the timebar freezes while you select actions for your characters.  So you are either using the firefly or you're selection options, not both simultaneously.  Likewise in the puzzle platforming parts of the game, you are either solving a light puzzle with the firefly, hitting a switch with the firefly, or navigating the screen with your heroine.... there really aren't any moments where you need the character and the firefly each doing something independently.\n\nSo all that said, I wouldn't recommend this game highly.  Maybe if you really like games of this type and have already beaten the really good ones, and this is on sale.... but otherwise, meh.

Also, I've really attached to all of them! Each one of them was totally different and had unique personality. Child of Light has of course some downsides, f.ex. the same melody that we hear almost all the time starts to irritate at some point and maybe if producers gave a voice to characters it wouldn't be so monotonous for longer period of time.

But you'll also find lots of metaphors in the game about which you'd have to think twice as an adult.

She meets a firefly named Igniculus, who guides her through the game and stays by her side, teaching her how to fight and so on. She learns about the Queen of Light becoming missing from this world, and how darkness has risen, while being shown that her only way out is to restore the light to Lemuria.\n\nThrough her journey she meets a wide variety of colourful characters who are absolutely blooming with personality as she ventures to save the light. The story has a very charming tone when it comes to progressing and areas, it's amazing at conveying the mood and creating memorable areas, characters, and music. \n\n[b]Characters -  7 out of 10[/b]\nThe characters you meet over the course of playing Child of Light are filled with lovable and unique personalities galore. Jesters and rhymes, (or at least trying their best to.), odd friends, mice, and everything nice! The majority of the characters in Child of Light are very memorable designs, though some came up a bit shoddy at parts, lacking development or that little 'oomph' you might need to get a character to hit perfect. But overall, the characters in this game were lovely as can be.\n\n[b]Gameplay - 7 out of 10[/b]\nThe gameplay of Child of Light is a platformer mixed in with a time-based RPG (Where characters take their turns after a certain build-up bar has passed, for example.) The combat in this game is very enjoyable and smooth, with few bad designs here and there. Though not every game is perfect, almost all of the unique bosses and enemies were pleasant and satisfying to fight.\n\nThe exploration in the platformer segments of the game was usually enjoyable, though some segments came up shy, where there were either minor movement bugs, or places that were just far too frustrating to traverse through. Though overall, I enjoyed Child of Light's combat much more than most of the recent RPGs.\n\n[b]Content - 10 out of 10[/b]\nThe game might not be huge (I'd say it takes around 13 hours or so to do everything) but it's an amazing experience to play through. The amount of hidden little things you might find, on top of the beautiful art style, make you want to always be looking around once more! There is a lengthy story and lots of quests to do, areas to explore and enemies to encounter.\n\nMajority you'll do in this game will be related to the main story, so you likely aren't going to miss much when playing through. I think every area in this game is worth admiring, every line of dialogue is beautifully written, and the battling and adventure feels satisfying.\n\n[b]Post Game/Replayability - 8 out of 10[/b]\nThis game is definitely one I'd play through many times over after a long break. This game is definitely a memorable one, and a worthwhile experience even if you know how the story goes. I've personally played through it thrice on console, and once on Steam. With such charming gameplay and designs, it's hard not to want to re-admire Child of Light a second, or even third time. Child of Light doesn't exactly contain post-game content, due to almost everything being done in the normal game.\n\n[b]Overall - 9 of 10[/b]\nChild of Light gets a fantastic rating from me, with almost every part of the game being a masterpiece and unique, it's hard not to almost give is a 10/10. I believe that, despite this game being several years old, still lives up to the current games of the genre as well, and is definitely a suggested pick-up for RPG lovers! The game isn't extremely difficult either, so it's fairly easy to casually enjoy as well. \n\n[b]Rating Chart[/b]\n[1 - Terrible] [2 - Awful] [3 - Very Bad] [4 - Bad] [5 - Okay] [6 - Average] [7 - Good] [8 - Great] [9 - Amazing] [10 - Excellent]", "timestamp_created": 1541758230, "timestamp_updated": 1541758230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45652642": {"recommendationid": "45652642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199590659", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 512, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 801, "last_played": 1535258689}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best RPGs I've played. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1541502937, "timestamp_updated": 1541502937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45599320": {"recommendationid": "45599320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302196571", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 1096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1541241166}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1541242104, "timestamp_updated": 1541242104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "45598044": {"recommendationid": "45598044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115716026", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1460, "last_played": 1622257436}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a beautiful and enchanting game.

Player plays as Aurora, who wakes up in a dream-like island called Lemuria. After following sequence of events, Aurora gains the ability to fly, allowing her to further explore the world in search of collectibles scattered across the island and to save Lemuria from darkness.\n\nTogether with Igniculus (cursor), Aurora can choose fight (on contact with) or flee away (using Igniculus\u2019 glow to blind) from the dark creatures roaming around the island. Aurora will be able to recruit NPCs into her party to further aid her in combat. Successful combat will allow Aurora and her party members to gain experience and level up. Each ally, Aurora and her party members, have their own unique skill tree, ranging from elemental to supportive to status inflicting abilities. Crafting system also allows Aurora and her party to gain better passive stats and elemental abilities.\n\nStory is very well conveyed through its water painting art, voiceover narration, pleasing audio, and rhyming dialogue between the characters. It feels very relaxing to just float around the land getting lost and voluntarily get ambushed by the dark creatures. However, the turn-based combat system might take some time for players to get used to and could be frustrating to deal with.\n\nI\u2019ve played the game in casual mode and health resources are infinite, but spawns at a slow rate, which means that I do not have to worry much about health when it comes to combat. However, decision making during the turn-based combat is still crucial as I do not want to take damage or prolong my battle unnecessarily. During the turn-based combat, Igniculus can assist Aurora and her party members by healing an ally, or by slowing an enemy down, making the enemy attack at a slower pace while Aurora gains the advantage to intercept her enemies\u2019 attack. Decision making is still required as Igniculus\u2019 glow is limited and has to be used sparingly and at the right moment.\n\nThere is also replay value in the New Game Plus mode after completing the main game. This is for players to collect missing collectibles for achievements and/or to build stronger party members through leveling and crafting. Game is recommended for those who wants to immerse themselves in a casual RPG driven by a simple princess story.\n\nDo take note that in order to play this game, Uplay application and account is required.

I was also playing it on a computer that had a hard time running it, and the detailed backgrounds made for a pretty glitchy experience, which frustrated me.\n\nHowever, I quickly got bored of the storyline.

Here were a couple of things I really loved:\n-The battle system (the timing/interrupting enemies' attacks was usually very fun)\n-The art style, of course. Beautiful watercolors everywhere you look!\n-Quick \"cutscenes\" with interactions between new party members as you acquire them. Because these were SHORT (just a few seconds each, really) I could enjoy them without them destroying the flow of my gameplay. Tales of Symphonia could have learned something here.\n\nOn the art style--it was beautiful, but to echo a review from somewhere else (Kotaku?), I wish those beautiful big open areas had more stuff to see or interact with in them besides enemies. They felt kind of empty. Even though the flying in this game is fun, once I moved more quickly I think I stopped soaking in the areas the same way I did at the beginning or in a game like, say, Hollow Knight.\n\nStuff I wasn't a fan of:\n-Overly simplistic plot. Well, actually the plot isn't too bad, but the main issue is that it is made to sound fairly silly because of...\n-EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN VERSE. The intent was to give this the sound of an old-fashioned fable or fairytale, but unfortunately some of the poems are so bad, or the rhymes so predictable, that the game began to take on the spirit of Dr. Seuss. Even in Alice and Wonderland (with some lovely silly poetry), the reason why Tweedle Dee's rhymes work is because they're counterbalanced against someone who doesn't speak that way (Alice). It would have been great if some characters spoke in verse (e.g. Rubella, the trader village) but not everyone. When you get those \"secret notes\" written in regular prose, it's like a breath of fresh air: \"Ah, at least ONE character in this game [even though I never get to see them] doesn't sound pretentious or silly!\"\n\n======SPOILER-Y JOKE BELOW=========\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n-\n(At a Very Serious Moment in the plot)\n\"Oh, no! The flood waters rise!\"\n\"Yes! Soon, they could touch the skies!\"\n\"The water could go over your family's heads.\"\n\"If it does, they'll all be dead!\"\n\nShould I with mangled syntax talk\nOr to the village of Trader Mice walk?\nAlthough some players me will loathe\nI think by golly, I'll do both.\n\nAnd so forth. Still a fun game. I'm glad I played it in easy/normal mode instead of hard mode! Hardest boss for me: the griffin, for sure. Final boss was surprisingly easy. (Thanks for letting me \"run\" and change my equipment, game!)\nI don't think I'll be replaying this one, but it was worth the $5 or whatever I paid for this game on sale!

This game is love <3\n\nIt's kind of a grown-up fairy tale, narrated in rhymes and with turn-based battles.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nIt's about love, power, betrayal, friendship, hope, despair and lots more. We are playing the little princess *cough* i mean Aurora on her way back home to help her diseased father. It's a long, interesting and touching journey full of danger.\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\nLovely, all of them. It's very easy to fall in love with quite every member of the cast. They're very lively and colourful and we can always see how they feel during dialogues. Each one with their own strengths/weaknesses in battle.\n\n[b]Skills[/b]\nWhat would an RPG be without a skill system. This one is quite interesting and easy to understand. All characters do level up simultaneously, no matter which ones are in the actual battles. Most of the skills require 1 skillpoint - you get 1 with each level up.\n\n[b]World[/b]\nIt is beautifully hand-painted, very rich for exploration and offers many different beautiful and creepy locations. All in all, this game is an art gallery.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nAwesome and extremely fitting. There's a whole bunch of different songs, suitable for every situation. From different instruments, chorus to orchestra is everything there to send you shivers down your spine. Expect different themes for different bosses aswell.\n\n[b]Battles[/b]\nThe best turn-based battle system i've ever seen (including FF's). It's easy to learn, but difficult to master. There are many aspects during the battle to have an eye on, that can make the battles (especially the boss battles) very challenging. On the other hand, the own well-timed and devastating attacks feel very satisfying.\n\n[b]Animations[/b]\nThey are perfect, on the map and especially during battles. For example, whenever Aurora gets hit, she loses her crown and puts it back on her head. Very lovely detail in my opinion.\n\n[b]Other mentions[/b]\nThere is fast travel available. Aurora will be able to fly. No useless items. Autosave, very often. Little crafting system.\n\n\nUbisoft might have messed up sometimes, but they totally hit the bullseye with this masterpiece. It's a Gem i woundn't know to compare with any other game.

Visually it's very stimulating and well put together, and I love what they did with turn based combat. The fact you can effectively skip every random encounter using your firefly helps keep the game fluid and non-repetitive, while letting you pick and choose when and where you grind. \n\nThat said, I can't recommend all the way. The writing is pretty bad. Using rhyme for all dialogue is ambitious, particularly couplets. It drives the average person mental to write a full 14 lines let alone an entire game of rhyming dialogue, and you can tell where it's being stretched thin or becoming lazy. Moreover, the fact that it rhymes makes you very aware of when the metre doesn't work or match which is quite off-putting, and overall it's a tiring way to tell a story. On top of this I feel like a lot of opportunities to make the world and characters interesting were missed. We know the bare minimum about who we meet along the way and the story doesn't grab you, it's quite predictable and childish not just in spirit, but in execution. At times it feels like the story was just an afterthought, when it could have been used to flesh out the characters and the world they live in. \n\nIt's hard to figure out who this game was made for. Can't help but think it's a bit too strategy heavy for a child but for an adult the writing is at points insultingly basic.

The characters in this game are wonderfully illustrated and animated, with dynamic personalities. \n\nWhen fighting the conflicts in this game, they've done a great job to make the enemies balanced and a new challenge every time, where you get involved in learning which type of moves work well on which type of enemies. I like how although the rules are very rock, paper, scissors style, the creaters of Child of Light have managed to create more types than the classic three, and involve other mechanics in the damage calculation as well (does the enemy have magic resistance, or physical attack resistance, or can you only attack them from range?). These are all creative ways to add depth to an otherwise static fighting style, so good job done there.\n\nOutside of the regular storyline, the game keeps you working on your Occuli as well (little gems you find around the world that you can collect and combine) so that you can add buffs to your character or your attack in game. The Occuli are quite common to find, but to create the top tier Occuli will take you a while, making the game not a quick and easy two hour interactive story. \n\nYou can usually choose to take a fight or avoid it, but the character levelling system motivates you to take new fights all the time so you can work towards learning a new move in the development tree or permanent buffs for your character. The moves can be upgraded, as can every other stat on your character. There is a variety of characters you can play with as well, each one with their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nAll in all, Child of Light is a beautifully illustrated and animated game with a captivating storyline and great dynamic character arcs. I've had a wonderful time playing it and I fully recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable visually pleasing story to play through.\n\nI hope this review helps you decide whether it's for you or not and if you do get it, have fun! :)\n\nps.\nIf you love poetry, then you'll love this, as almost every bit of story is written as poetry, and even some breaking of the fourth wall when some characters don't understand how to rhyme, it's beautiful.", "timestamp_created": 1524910688, "timestamp_updated": 1524910963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41710219": {"recommendationid": "41710219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134330598", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1674460541}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely beautiful.

I really enjoyed this game and I would play through it more if it let me play the way I want to. Short enough for a casual player, but if you want to fully enjoy the New Game+ you might be disappointed.\n\nI played through one time in about 15h doing all side quests but decided that I didn't want to spend the time on NG+.\n\n[b]GOOD![/b]\n\nBattle system is absolutely solid. A lot of turn-based games might as well be automated. Not here. On Expert mode I was constantly switching characters, changing my elemental damage, micro managing resources, and still died a couple times.\n\nThere are two mechanics that make the combat great. First, you have a \"turn bar\" that's exactly like Chrono Trigger's except after you pick a move it has a Cast Time. If you or the enemy are hit during the Cast Time you lose your turn. The classic method of focus firing is no longer valid. Even against bosses you'll need to interrupt their supers while managing adds and not losing turns yourself.\n\nThe second thing is the light system. Your mouse controls your light which can slow one enemy's turn bar. This compounds with the interrupt mechanic, but can also be used as a heal. You are constantly deciding whether the slow or the heal are more important. Very fun.\n\nInstead of gear you have the Oculi system. It's basically Diablo 2's gems but more effective, more effects than just elemental damage and resist, and you can freely unsocket out of battle. I really liked managing my Oculi gems and being able to swap them based on the setting, although the final boss kind of spits in your face by not allowing you to swap before battle.\n\n[b]Okay.[/b]\n\nSkill trees are pretty standard. Each character gets three and you work toward capstones. You can complete almost 2 full trees by the end of your first playthrough.\n\nThe story didn't really grab me and the rhyming dialogue draws out what is already a very talky game.\n\n[b]Really bad![/b]\n\nNOTHING is skippable. Eventually you get the story, dad is dying need to go home, evil lady bad. Everything else is filler and only half the text can even be sped up and none can be skipped. Characters will incessantly banter between battles preventing you from managing your skill trees. I was fine with it for one playthrough and really wanted to do NG+ so I could get the highest level Oculi gems but the second I found out I couldn't skip anything I just quit.\n\nWhen will devs learn? We know you worked hard on your story but for god's sake if we've ALREADY PLAYED THE GAME let us skip it!\n\nOh, also there's a subtle thing that causes your cursor to move on its own sometimes (in combat). Whatever idiot programmed that thought it was cute should be dragged behind a truck. I thought it was my mouse and cleaned it twice before I realized the little light bulb cursor character was moving on his own.\n\nIf you like turn-based RPGs you'll want to play this one. It has a nice story for kids and I would gladly do another playthrough if I could just play the game instead of watching hours of custscenes and dialogue again.", "timestamp_created": 1524496749, "timestamp_updated": 1524496749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "41644475": {"recommendationid": "41644475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198814476404", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 745, "last_played": 1555683556}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with a unique story.

Narrada a trav\u00e9s de unos muy originales di\u00e1logos, ya que intencionadamente riman todas las frases a modo de poes\u00eda, la historia no es demasiado interesante. Llena de los t\u00edpicos clich\u00e9s de luz salvadora en oposici\u00f3n a la malvada oscuridad, la trama se desarrolla a buen ritmo, pero nunca generando un gran inter\u00e9s, salvo algunas peque\u00f1as revelaciones. Conoceremos diferentes y variadas regiones en Lemuria, donde nos encontraremos con variopintos personajes, algunos de los cuales se unir\u00e1n a nuestra misi\u00f3n, siendo controlables durante las batallas. Destaca la evoluci\u00f3n que iremos apreciando en Aurora a medida que avanza la aventura, desde una d\u00e9bil e insegura ni\u00f1a hasta una joven poderosa y con gran confianza en s\u00ed misma.\n\nEl juego se desarrolla en scroll lateral pudiendo desplazarnos libremente por los escenarios, ya que nuestra protagonista adquiere la capacidad de volar en los primeros compases de la aventura. Una de las caracter\u00edsticas m\u00e1s originales del juego es que con el stick derecho podremos controlar el movimiento tambi\u00e9n libre de ign\u00edculus, un ente que nos sirve a modo de linterna viviente, para activar algunos interruptores, curarnos, recoger tesoros o para distraer a los enemigos. De hecho el juego proporciona la posibilidad de que un 2\u00ba jugador se una y sea el encargado de controlar a ign\u00edculus, ya que durante las batallas tambi\u00e9n puede participar apoyando a nuestros guerreros y frenando a los enemigos.\n\nUna parte importante de las mec\u00e1nicas jugables es la superaci\u00f3n de los escenarios en s\u00ed mismos, ya que contienen peque\u00f1os desaf\u00edos plataformeros. Desde r\u00e1fagas de viento, pinchos y compuertas que obstaculizan nuestro paso hasta lava, rayos y gases t\u00f3xicos que nos bajar\u00e1n la barra de vida r\u00e1pidamente. En cualquier caso es bastante sencillo encontrar el camino a seguir y la superaci\u00f3n de estas trampas, ya que siempre podemos curarnos f\u00e1cilmente, sea gracias a ign\u00edculus, algunos arbustos iluminados o tirando de las numerosas pociones que acumularemos. Habr\u00e1 peque\u00f1as pruebas donde tendremos que depositar cajas sobre interruptores para levantar compuertas o peque\u00f1os puzzles donde tendremos que jugar con la proyecci\u00f3n de sombras que genera nuestro amigo ign\u00edculus seg\u00fan su posici\u00f3n espacial y los objetos que ilumine. Estos desaf\u00edos aportan variedad al t\u00edtulo, aunque no son muchos y son demasiado sencillos de resolver, resultando un mero pasatiempo y no demasiado inspirados. Algunos de estos desaf\u00edos se encuentran en rutas opcionales que nos llevan a obtener alguna recompensa, como potenciadores o coleccionables.\nEl juego contiene tambi\u00e9n 11 tareas secundarias que nos encomendar\u00e1n algunos habitantes de Lemuria. La mayor\u00eda consisten en localizar alg\u00fan objeto concreto y entreg\u00e1rselo a la persona adecuada, eliminar ciertos enemigos o alcanzar alguna zona oculta.\nLos enemigos siempre se encuentran a la vista en los escenarios, por lo que podremos sortearlos si no nos apetece entrar en batalla, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n podemos intentar sorprenderlos por detr\u00e1s para comenzar con ventaja el combate. Hay buena variedad de enemigos, tanto en su apariencia como en su comportamiento en batalla y vulnerabilidades. Algunos ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s resistentes a los ataques f\u00edsicos, otros vulnerables al agua, otros m\u00e1s centrados en apoyar al resto de enemigos, etc. Lo com\u00fan en juegos de rol cl\u00e1sico.\nLas batallas son combates por turnos muy simplificados. Podemos manejar a dos aliados a la vez, mientras que podemos enfrentarnos hasta a tres enemigos simult\u00e1neamente. Podemos ejecutar diferentes tipos de ataques, algunas habilidades que iremos aprendiendo y mejorando, hechizos, usar objetos de apoyo o de desgaste para los enemigos, cambiar de guerreros o defendernos. Un medidor a modo de barra se va rellenando seg\u00fan la velocidad de cada personaje hasta que nos permite seleccionar el siguiente comando y a medida que se rellena la \u00faltima parte de la barra se ejecuta dicha acci\u00f3n. Para los enemigos funciona de igual manera. Las batallas suelen ser bastante f\u00e1ciles, y la mayor estrategia radica en averiguar a qu\u00e9 elemento es vulnerable cada enemigo y en tratar de interrumpir las acciones de nuestros enemigos, lo que se consigue atac\u00e1ndoles justo antes de que se llene su barra de acci\u00f3n. Tambi\u00e9n tratar de que los enemigos no interrumpan nuestras acciones. Solo algunos jefes finales nos har\u00e1n utilizar hechizos de apoyo as\u00ed como objetos curativos, teniendo que estar m\u00e1s concentrados en el combate para medir bien nuestros pasos. Estos jefes suponen retos interesantes, adem\u00e1s de que tienen dise\u00f1os curiosos y variados.\nTodos los personajes ir\u00e1n ganando experiencia, subiendo de nivel y mejorando sus atributos, as\u00ed como adquiriendo puntos que desbloquean nuevas habilidades y mejoras en un \u00e1rbol de desarrollo particular de cada uno. Cada personaje tiene sus fortalezas, debilidades y habilidades especiales, aunque no est\u00e1 muy conseguida la utilizaci\u00f3n de un aliado concreto con cada tipo enemigo. En general Aurora es el personaje m\u00e1s vers\u00e1til y eficiente de todos.\n\nLos di\u00e1logos son muy simples, y es que con la intenci\u00f3n de crear versos con cada frase, resulta complicado poder trazar conversaciones interesantes as\u00ed. De forma particular me result\u00f3 bastante cansino leer todos estos di\u00e1logos a modo de poes\u00eda interminable. Al principio resulta gracioso y muy original, pero a la larga creo que no est\u00e1 totalmente conseguido y puede terminar desesperando a m\u00e1s de uno.\n\nEl apartado art\u00edstico es la principal fortaleza de Child of Light, creando hermosas estampas en todos los niveles, pareciendo en ocasiones un cuadro en movimiento. El dise\u00f1o de escenarios est\u00e1 muy mimado y detallado art\u00edsticamente, pero tambi\u00e9n desde el punto de vista jugable. La mayor\u00eda de escenarios ofrecen mucha verticalidad, lo que hace de la exploraci\u00f3n algo divertido y profundo, encontrando varios caminos, cuevas escondidas y tesoros ocultos.\nOtro punto fuerte destacable es la BSO, con unas piezas musicales muy trabajadas que suenan estupendamente en combinaci\u00f3n con la belleza de los escenarios. Hay buena variedad de ellas, m\u00e1s tr\u00e1gicas, alegres o emocionantes seg\u00fan los escenarios y los acontecimientos de la historia.\n\nEn general Child of Light es un buen juego de plataformas y rol, muy ligero en contenidos y mec\u00e1nicas jugables, lo que hace que pueda ser jugado por todo tipo de jugadores. Peca de ser excesivamente f\u00e1cil y simple, al no profundizar mucho ni en su vertiente plataformera ni en los combates. No encontraremos un verdadero reto de ning\u00fan tipo y es relativamente sencillo pasarse el juego sin morir ni una vez o un par de veces a lo sumo.\nCon un gran apartado art\u00edstico, un dedicado trabajo a la hora de crear poes\u00eda de cada di\u00e1logo y una BSO que no deja indiferente, el juego derrocha personalidad, resultando una mezcla de estilos no muy vista hasta el momento de su salida en el mercado. Una historia demasiado b\u00e1sica, llena de estereotipos poco originales y personajes muy diferentes entre s\u00ed, pero nada memorables y bastante predecibles. Se hubiera agradecido mayor variedad en las habilidades plataformeras o en los desaf\u00edos y puzzles, pero en cualquier caso el juego no decepciona y cumple ofreciendo un bonito cuento de superaci\u00f3n y maduraci\u00f3n.\n\n7\u20198", "timestamp_created": 1517708128, "timestamp_updated": 1517746308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592592597007751465", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39824818": {"recommendationid": "39824818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108507092", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1090, "last_played": 1518272867}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing ... 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1517688147, "timestamp_updated": 1517688147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "39803668": {"recommendationid": "39803668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028822808", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 655, "last_played": 1517541210}, "language": "english", "review": "A fairy tale come to life.

There's a backdrop of an eerie darkness that pervades the feel and tone of the game but it never outdoes the absolute delight and beauty of the amazing and varied environments. \n\nThe game itself mostly playes like a side-scroller but without any platforming challenges. Most of your time is spent exploring the different landscapes of lemuria and leveling up your party in JRPG active time battles similar to those found in the Grandia series. I would go as far as to call this system a callback to Grandia because every action you take and every status ailments that happen during battle affect just how far or how behind you are in a set timeline. Once you reach the end of that timeline you'll be prompted to take any action you desire and the same goes for your enemies. It's a very amusing system that puts player agency front and center even though towards the end of the game it starts to show its relative shallowness.\n\nYou can level up your characters using gathered experience points. There isn't much to write home about it though. There aren't that many exciting upgrades and most of them are simply buffs to your HP, MP or speed in the battles.\n\nSecondly, the game's writers probably can't write a decent story if their life depended on it. New characters join your party left and right but there is no noteworthy development of the plot or their motivations. Everything plays out just as you'd expect and you can see the single twist from a mile coming. On top of that, the already barebones story is told all through rhymes; and boy do most of those suck pretty bad and serve more as a detriment to the story than helping it feel any more authentic. There's some kind of meta story going on behind the curtains of the fairytale but they're only found in secret notes you find floating around and don't really add to the story one bit. \n\nThirdly, the sound design and music here are masterclass. I loved listening to the title track and ending music as well as everything offered in between. There are even awesome little touches inside the menus. Serious kudos to the sound staff involved. \n\nI don't need to go on about the aesthetics of the game because they are probably some of the most beautiful sights and sounds you'll experience all year. It all looks like a moving watercolor painting and I couldn't get enough of all the gorgeous sights all over Lemuria.\n\nThe game takes around 12-15 hours to fully complete (counting side-quests) depending on your pace. Even though the story and the rhyming gimmick are probably the weakest parts of the game, I was thoroughly satisfied with the battles and the overall beauty on offer here. You can choose to play on a more difficult setting but it simply drags out the battles for too long and the need for level grinding is simply not worth the effort imo.\n\n[EDIT] It's no wonder I forgot to mention the most boring and unnecessary part of the gameplay: The Oculi crafting system. You basically find different colored stones (Oculi) with various sizes from chests and quests and you can craft them into bigger ones by combining them using a crafting menu.

The watercolor art is inherently gorgeous, and there are many screenshot-worthy areas. The landscapes, settings, and characters are all so well created, and hair animation is also on point. I haven't played many turn-based combat games, but if you get into the game and actually try to avoid damage/wail on your enemies, it can get pretty intensive. The combat is not a complete walk-in-the-park if you set the difficulty level harder. \n\nBecause the story is fairytale-esque, I wasn't riveted by story. There was at least one good plot twist, but overall, the story felt more of a guide to where to go to gain experience. I actually enjoyed battles even though I'm usually heavily motivated to play a game because of story. I also liked the skill system and crafting of occuli/buffs for your characters. While you won't be on the edge of your seat, the rhyming dialogue is cute, and there are a few funny quips here and there.\n\nI bought this game discounted, so although I wasn't completely satisfied story-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the ambient music, artwork, and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1514073798, "timestamp_updated": 1515297473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38592752": {"recommendationid": "38592752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262761935", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 445, "last_played": 1466983853}, "language": "english", "review": "it's so motherf\u00a334g poetic", "timestamp_created": 1514058535, "timestamp_updated": 1514058535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38448444": {"recommendationid": "38448444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119655650", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1173, "last_played": 1513779832}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE IT\nPros\n- beautiful art style\n- beautiful soundtracks and ending song\n- fairy tale \n- adorable princess protagonist\n- the interactions among party members\n- all narrated in rhyme (or it's a con if you dont like it)\n\nCons \n- the combat is repetitive, might be boring after playing for a while\n- dlcs-golems and especially auroro's skins that i could not stop myself from buying them", "timestamp_created": 1513756189, "timestamp_updated": 1513756189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586040019989013672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38439720": {"recommendationid": "38439720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087236284", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 888, "last_played": 1612351307}, "language": "english", "review": "*one itty bitty spoiler warning*\n>be me playing game\n>find Aurora really cute\n>suddenly Aurora becomes an adult\n>( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1513720503, "timestamp_updated": 1513720503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458052873611450195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38340041": {"recommendationid": "38340041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042655059", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 145, "last_played": 1510573161}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Precioso artisticamente, jugabilidad similar a un juego de rol, combates por turnos (Tiene algunas mecanicas innovadoras) Recomendable jugarlo si tienes tiempo y ganas, una historia bastante buena, recomendado.", "timestamp_created": 1513394210, "timestamp_updated": 1513394210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "38336680": {"recommendationid": "38336680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208576788", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 727, "last_played": 1513380242}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely puzzle game!

It's a very relaxing game with humorous characters and a lot of places to explore. The game allows you to fly after Chapter 1 or so, and I won't really call it a platforming game, but it's definitely worth the buy.\n\nPros:\n-Unique battling system (sort-of like a turn-based system which involves manipulation of a timeline which you use to interrupt the enmies' attack charge. There's actually a lot of things to take note of during a battle)\n-Wonderful visuals\n-Text is conveyed interestingly, with everything in rhyme\n-Basic storyline, but well planned out nonetheless\n\n\nCons:\n-Battling can get slightly tedious\n-Everything is in rhymes, which makes the text a bit hard to follow at times\n-First time I opened the game, some text and the timeline was missing. If you don't see it, restart the game.\n\n**Just finished the game update (SPOILERS?)***\n-Ending feels quite rushed\n-Game is actually pretty short, but it's decent for its price, I suppose\n-No additional content post-game", "timestamp_created": 1511493315, "timestamp_updated": 1513184616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37226079": {"recommendationid": "37226079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014667310", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 298, "last_played": 1481840883}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es pulento", "timestamp_created": 1511478644, "timestamp_updated": 1511478644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37223109": {"recommendationid": "37223109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019391869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 929, "last_played": 1579590426}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing games for more than 20 years, with many fond and cherished memories, but I can definitely say the most magical moment of my gaming life was when I played Child of Light with my 6 year old daughter.", "timestamp_created": 1511477348, "timestamp_updated": 1511477614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855437815189361572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "37193975": {"recommendationid": "37193975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991208382", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 508, "last_played": 1511468599}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not sure what there is not to like in this game.

It's one of those games I was pretty split on but after thinking it over I just don't think an RPG can get a recommend from me based on these elements alone. Child of Light would have made a great story-rich platform/adventure game and I know Ubisoft can make good games that fall into that category (looking at you Valiant Hearts) but this doesn't do so well as an RPG in my opinion. \n\nI found the battle system tedious and mostly unoriginal. There are a few attempts to spice it up by adding in an interrupt system and an ally you can use to slow your enemies or heal your allies but it never really drew me in. The interrupting either slowed things down because I couldn't do anything or made the fight a breeze because the enemies couldn't do anything. The character development is pretty standard fare. There is a skill tree that is fairly limited and a rune system that involves combining gems to make more powerful versions. I was constantly spending time in the inventory trying to craft what I needed, equipping party members, and then starting the whole process over when I progressed into the next area. That's about it as far as the RPG elements in the game go. It all started to feel like a chore towards the end, which is a bit too far off since the game runs out of steam early on.  \n\nAs I said up front there are some great visuals and music in the game, as well as a decent story.

Combat is interesting and highly skill based, especially towards the end of the game; the monster damage ramps up slightly faster than the HP does, so theres a lot less room for bad technique. Power-leveling isn't really necessary if you don't avoid combat throughout the storyline, although I did feel the need to bump myself up 5 levels on the higher difficulty setting to buffer the sheer damage monsters do (1/3rd to 1/4th your player health per hit). \n\nSome things could use some work; many of the \"item\" buffs are lackluster and/or barely useful, and by far the most important stats and abilities are those that affect the time bar. Pretty much the only viable tactic is to focus on abilities that knock the opponent back down the time bar or outright remove them from combat, as at the higher levels the speeds are so fast it's very difficult to actually pull off an interrupt. CC and damage mititagion are absolutely vital to finishing the game.\n\nThe skill trees really don't do much to add spice to the character as far as playstyle; each character has a particular role in mind by the devs, and that's how they play regardless of how you build their skill tree. The Healer heals, the buffer buffs, the DPS does DPS, and the \"Tank\" doesn't have enough health to really tank, plus his \"Taunt\" ability doesn't block AoE attacks so really he's just DPS.\n\nLuckily, the game allows party member swaps without penalty. For myself, it was really hard to break the concept that when it's a character's turn it's not just their turn; it's really ALL the character's turns. You can swap that character out for anyone who has the most effective ability to use for that specific turn. Once I started doing that though, the combat ran much smoother, although buffs are per-character and really don't jive with swapping out party members on-the-fly.", "timestamp_created": 1509808185, "timestamp_updated": 1509808566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532467544078826904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "36200362": {"recommendationid": "36200362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031440161", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 77, "last_played": 1417750243}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to like the concept and the art.

Yet, the game could have made the player dive into it step by step while advancing (of all things the side story), but instead hecticly throws it around - you get too much of it, too fast.\n\nThe 2nd thing is the actual combat: it's round based and works fairly well overall - if only some little obstacles were not around. Fully hit characters are interrupted in their attacks and have to pass on their current move, why is that? The combat mechanics with the light whisp also seem totally unnecessary and overloaded, which makes the fights turn into a mess of denying enemies, being interrupted, healing/reviving your buddies and maaaaaaaybe attacking one or two times.

Sus combates... Son excelentes, pues es por turnos, donde hay casteos y diferentes ataques con respectivas velocidades que bien puedes seleccionar una habilidad que tarda en ejecutarse o un ataque r\u00e1pido para interrumpir el casteo de tus enemigos. El juego posee objetos t\u00edpicos de estr estilo... Regeneradores de vida, man\u00e1 y aumentos por turnos, y brillos... \u00bfQu\u00e9 son esos brillos? Mejoras permamentes para tus personajes en sus estadisticas (vida, man\u00e1, defensa f\u00edsica, def. m\u00e1gica, ataque fisico y m\u00e1gico, velocidad en los turnos, probabilidad de critico y probabilidad de evasi\u00f3n. Tiene un sistema de niveles clasico... \u00c1rbol de habilidades que se dividen en tres ramas... Con la diferencia que si le das una buena jugada... Puedes tener todas las habilidades y pasivas. Tambien tiene un sistema de crafteo bastante simple, pero \u00fatil el Oculi, donde podemos hacer piedras y reafinarlas, para asignarlas ya sea como mejora ofensivas, defensivas, aumentos de estadisticas o algunas pasivas extras, pero no te emociones, pues solo pueden llevar tres cada personaje. Tiene la opci\u00f3n de NG+ al terminar el juego, por lo que conservas todas las estad\u00edsticas y objetos como brillos, piedras y pociones.\n\nHablemos de sus gr\u00e1ficas: \nEs un deleite visual... Te sentir\u00e1s en un cuento, porque lo parece, es tan simple y hermoso, cada detalle y animaci\u00f3n es perfecta. En serio, las animaciones est\u00e1n bien cuidadas y con detalles como si cruzas cerca de unos animales del fondo, reaccionan a tu presencia. Las animaciones de combate son excelentes y satisfactorias, el nivel de detalle es increible.\nPero esto es un arma de dos filos... S\u00ed, ya te dije que todo est\u00e1 animado TODO... Eso consume recursos, por lo que el juego es disfritable a 60 fps, no menos, por lo que debes tener los requisitos recomendados, pues gr\u00e1ficamente el juego no se puede personalizar. \n\nBanda sonora y narraci\u00f3n: \nSimplemente fant\u00e1stico, supera expectativas y su banda sonora es simplemente perfecta. El juego la \u00fanica voz que tiene es la de una mujer (en lo personal, prefiero la versi\u00f3n de consolas pues tiene el audio latino y los textos var\u00edan), que suena en contadas veces, el resto... Es un cuento que tienes que leer, si no aprecias el arte de las letras, de una vez descarta este juego se tu lista, debes tener aprecio por la poesia o literatura para que disfrutes el juego complemente, pero ojo jugarlo tampoco te har\u00e1 un fil\u00f3sofo ni nada, solo te har\u00e1 disfrutar mas del juego y ya.\n\nLos pros ya te los he dicho en cada secci\u00f3n.\n\nLos contras, pues aunque sea mi juego favorito, he encontrado todos sus fallos, creo.\n\nSin personalizaci\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica.\nA menos de 60 fps, el juego se descalibra con los sonidos y anotaciones.\nSin variedad en NG+.\nHistoria lineal y con un \u00fanico final. (Te dar\u00e1 cuenta si solo te pasas el juego con aurora nada m\u00e1s)\nDLC sin sentido. (Los tengo todos, y creo que los unicos que deber\u00edan estar a la venta son las skins, hay uno que agrega otro personaje, pero solo agega un poquito de lore)\nEl precio creo que no esta muy acorde ahora mismo, pues el juego ya sali\u00f3 hace a\u00f1os.\n\nContras personales:\nNo sacan la secuela!!! Por favor ubisoft, deja a los malditos rabbids y denme otro child of light!!!!\n\nRecomendaci\u00f3n de compra;\nSi tenias en la vista otro juego compra ese juego. Si tienes apenas el dineronpara comprarlo, mejor espera a las rebajas. Si te sobra dinero, adelante, compralo cuando quieras, espero que lo disfrutes.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n... El juego es recomendado al cierto p\u00fablico que le guste leer. El juego es hermoso y deber\u00edan jugarlo todos, pero si eres alguien que prefiere pegar tiros o jugar juegos \"Hardcore\" (no mis ni\u00f1os, Dark souls, no entra en categor\u00eda hardcore) creo que no te gustar\u00e1, a menos que tengas ganas de algo diferente a tu rutina de video jugador. Espero que les haya servido y disfruten igual que to este excelente juego.", "timestamp_created": 1506142324, "timestamp_updated": 1506142324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "35138162": {"recommendationid": "35138162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989541197", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 5776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5550, "last_played": 1508110661}, "language": "english", "review": "I mostly play this game on the couch with my Nvidia Shield.

So, they give you a light that you can put in front of the enemy's face and they can't see you, so you can pass through them without fighting. SO what's the point of the game? Yeah... I didn't get it. You stay stuck in the scenery trying to find something interesting, and just find some \"puzzles\", that are really easy, I don't even know if that should be called puzzle. \n\nSo, if you wanna buy this game, I strongly recommend you to test before... I would like have tested before buying... :/\n\nAH, and the sound of the ghost is SO ANNOYNG!

Exploring the landscape reminded me of the best illustrated storybooks I devoured as a small child. I wouldn't just read them again and again, but I'd also study the tiny details. In the visual story telling of Child of Light, background characters or far-off scenes, paint a picture, in water color style, of a larger world built on a mythic scale.\n\nA nicely employed gimick turns your cursor into a firefly, an elemental spirit that you can use to interact with the environment remotely. The glowing blob acts as sort of a Swiss (well, Austrian, since that's where Aurora hails from) Army knife by lighting up dark areas, blinding opponents and even healing you and your companions.\n\nAs Aurora, you assemble a motley crew, some of which are more complex or interesting than the others. These characters often have exchanges that do not include Aurora and add more depth not just to the companions, but also to the greater story and their larger world. So much of Child of Light is about growing up, letting go of the past, good or bad, and letting it die so that the new can be born and the future embraced.\n\nIn addition to the various folk you encounter along the way, there are quite a few enemies to trounce. Strangely, your growing team of comrades, each with their own special skill trees, is always limited to one representative at a time on the battle field. There is facility for switching characters out, but I found it cumbersome and the fights generally easy enough not to bother with trying to stack together too many buffs or debuffs by swapping in different guys.\n\nThe combat, though adequate, is one of the two stumbles in Child of Light. By use of your cursor's blinding ability, it's possible to skip many of the fights; however, I wonder if the boss fights might be much more difficult without grinding out some experience. The fighting revolves around timing, how long a wind up takes and interrupting enemy attacks. It's not a bad system, but it feels conventional and focuses on violence as the only solution.\n\nA game like Renowned Explorer's Society (as an example) employs a tactical rock/paper/scissors that allows for victory by charming or frightening/intimidating foes, as well as by beating the crap out of them, if you so choose. I think Child of Light could have benefited from a variety of minigames or some other challenge that would allow for alternate forms of advancing your character's growth and the story. It's not that I don't think that Aurora shouldn't fight; rather, limiting so much of her interaction outside of towns to fighting misses opportunities for more story telling. There are a variety of well drawn and interestingly animated bad guys, but only the bosses get any lines.\n\nThe other stumble, this one on the story-telling end, was in the choice to write the thing entirely in verse. Many reviews pan the game solely for the endless rhyme and the resulting awkward language. The game must have been a nightmare to translate. I often find even one character the speaks entirely in rhyme to be exhausting in most games or stories, so I worried that having the whole thing written that way would spoil the experience.\n\nSince I expected nothing from the poetry, it surprised me by working, if only in fits and starts, here and there. Putting all the narrative, the dialog, and even the exclamations and interjections, into rhyme was an ambitious undertaking. I applaud UBIsoft the effort, but felt that the relentless poetry detracted, if only mildly, rather than added to my overall enjoyment of the game. YMMV\n\nI was surprised by some genuinely touching moments in Child of Light, as well as some subtle visual story telling, backed by restrained, but sweetly, sadly haunting music. It used its fantastical characters as metaphors for facing the challenges that we all face in growing up and, eventually, becoming parent to the child. Poetry aside, Child of Light is a memorable, imaginative and satisfying fairy tale.", "timestamp_created": 1504088127, "timestamp_updated": 1504088127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491400480270385742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "34554432": {"recommendationid": "34554432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026810843", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 764, "last_played": 1503930506}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Enorme juego.

Very nice that you can switch between them mid battle.\n- Each character, including your own, has different skill trees. You can choose to play your characters in different ways.\n- You are accompanied by Igniculus, a glowing ball of light. I enjoyed that he can be used both in and out of combat. In the overworld you can use him to blind enemies you want to avoid. In battle, he can be used to slow down your enemies\u2019 actions or heal yourself.\n- The turn based battle system has a twist where you can interrupt your foe\u2019s actions depending on your timing. This makes battles more interactive and skill based. \n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- I don\u2019t really like that opening the game on Steam forces you to use Uplay as well. It\u2019s not such a big deal though.\n- I didn\u2019t find the game particularly difficult or challenging. \n- Segments where you must fly a lot can be dull. The game is quite slow paced. \n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nUbisoft often gets a lot of bad press. I agree that Ubisoft has made numerous mistakes when developing and releasing games, but Child of Light is well made and pleasant to play for the most part. Child of Light not a personal favourite, nor will I play it again any time soon, but I think that the positive aspects of the game outweigh the negative ones. If you are unconvinced, I suggest you try the demo before buying the game.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Although this game is already 3 years old, I still very much have wanted to make a review of this game. Also, English is not my main language, so sorry if there is a grammar mistake or something sounds weirdly redacted.\n\nPersonally, I liked everything from this game, though I know there are some aspects that might not be as liked by others, and it is completely understandable. Let's get into that.\n\n- The story: It's not the most outstanding aspect of the game, but it's not something terrible that brings the whole game down either. It's very confusing if you do not pay attention to the dialogue of the characters, and that isn't always too easy since the narration in this game is always \"poetic\", which isn't bad but can really get unclear or confusing. It's the way that everything is written in a verse that makes the story interesting, because it somehow makes it pleasant to read or listen to. If you have trouble understanding poetic elements such as metaphors, then I highly suggest paying attention to the dialogue if you don't want a confusing ending.\n\n- The characters: The character design is one outstanding element in this game, they really reflect the fantasy theme the game features, and each one of them have their very own interesting backstory. The characters is one thing that you'll remember after playing the game.\n\n- The gameplay: It is fairly balanced, there's nothing that will be incredibly overpowered, and if there is it's because you're probably not preparing yourself enough. This is not simply a turn-based game, there is also a feature in the combat system which is a meter that indicates the order in which all entities in a battle will perform an action in every turn, which is a really cool mechanic in the game. The combat system allows you to use 2 characters at the same time (of course you can also swap them out with others). It might sound weird, but if the 2 characters that are currently in the field are dead it counts as game over, even if you still have other alive members in your party. This is actually pretty great because it encourages you to play strategically and swap out between characters when you need to.\n\n- Role distribution: Each playable character is highly different from one another. You have your all-round class whose stats vary depending on how you build their skill tree; you have a mage that excels in magic damage and magic resistance who also has access to elemental attacks; you have several supportive roles, but each one of them offers different supportive abilities (heals, revives and status condition defense / provides buffs to allies / provides debuffs to enemies); you have your high-reward high-risk class who can dish out a lot of damage, but is also pretty squishy, its higher than average crit chance and dodge chance makes up for that; and finally you have your tank class with considerably more health who is all about taking the hits for the team.\nWhat does this all mean? You're never gonna feel a character exactly the same as other, which means they have good gameplay design.\n\n- Other features: This game has something called Occuli, which basically are fragments you can give to your characters to boost a specific stat or add a little tweak to their resistances and attacks. I like and dislike this feature at the same time. The game hardly gives any explanation on to how they work or what even they are for. You constantly rely on them, which isn't necessarily bad but I can understand why some people might hate that.  \n\n- The music: Last but not least, the music. If there is anything you slightly didn't like from the game, the music will surely make up for it. I found myself repeteadly listening to the soundtrack after finishing the game. They fit the scenes and ambients in which they play.\n\nDo I highly suggest this game? Absolutely. If you like turn-based RPGs with interesting characters, music and combat mechanics, then this game will not let you down.

The oculi system in the game is a great mechanism for complicating battles and making you think strategy. Without the proper oculi to give you an edge, certain battles can be hard to win, but the wrong ones can put you at a disadvantage. Really, the only less than positive thing I can say is that the story (especially the ending) feels a bit rushed. The whole world is scattered with lore, and it sort of feels like this game was designed with a much longer, more complex story in mind than what it was eventually actually given.

Regardless, if you like fantasy worlds, gorgeous art, unique characters and a meaningful story with turn-based battle mechanics and plenty of opportunity to explore the world, I would highly recommend.

The graphics are amazingly beautiful, the soundscape is marvellous and there is a pretty little story going on. Oh yes, I heard so many positive reviews about this game \u2013 basically everybody is enchanted by it! But I am not.\n\nAs a player, I do like lovely art in a game and of course a good score brings it to life. In this game all this just was wasted: the gameplay itself was so boring that I didn\u2019t enjoy exploring the beautiful world after the first hour or so. You just basically walk (and later fly) around pretty aimlessly. You can find treasures, carry out little quests and do some fighting alongside the main storyline. And the fights were the worst, because they were painfully manual and boring. Same thing over and over again. Thank god you didn\u2019t actually have to fight that much if you didn\u2019t want to. Because oh yes, there were battles everywhere.\n\nUsually I\u2019m all for exploring and doing all the quests and finding all the items. This time I just wanted the experience to end as fast as possible. This time I didn\u2019t do all the side quests and didn\u2019t find all the items and didn\u2019t fight almost any battles. I just didn\u2019t want to bother. I\u2019m sad to admit this, because this game had so much potential.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the music. It fit perfectly well to the game world. It was as pretty as the graphics in the game, it created lovely atmosphere. Piano and violin sounded so beautiful in the score. But it was getting very repetitive: after some time you just got very numb about it. It didn\u2019t offer anything suprising or new. The same thing just went on and on and on\u2026 And the same thing you could say about the whole game.\n\nSo, in conclusion. I do understand why so many are enchanted by this. It has a good combo of things and it is not a game with horrible quality. Sadly this just wasn\u2019t a game for me.

The gameplay is interesting, everything is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing, and the story is fairly well done. However, a few awful missteps made me immediately drop the game with zero motivation to ever finish it. \n\nMy major issue with the game is a spoiler, so if you wish to play through the game unspoiled, I will just say this: Story is important, but not when you absolutely punish and cripple the player for no reason if they make certain choices. \n\nHere is my complaint put more specifically:\n[Spoiler]Some time into the game you gain access to the protagonist's sister, Norah. She is my absolute favorite character in the game, and I quickly made her the 'Leader' of my team, running her in every battle and pouring all of my resources into making her as strong as possible.\n\nIt occurred to me that there might be a mod or some setting that allowed you to change your in-game character to one of your party members, so I did a quick google search to see if it that was possible. What I discovered is that further into the game, Norah betrays your party, becoming unplayable for the rest of the game. While this was not only very disappointing from a story perspective, as I really liked her character, it was [i]completely unacceptable[/i] from a gameplay standpoint. I had poured almost all of my resources into her first, running her in every battle, making her the strongest (and highest leveled) member of my team and only using the leftovers on the others. I was playing on the highest difficulty, and I was doing extremely well. When she leaves your team? You lose [i]everything[/i] you put into her. There is no compensation. No way to get her or your resources back. Just \"Woops, guess you shouldn't have leveled/geared that character huh?\"\n\nAt that point I dropped the game. In my mind that was an incredibly stupid move on the developer's part, to suprise you by removing one of your characters with no warning, causing you to lose all of the resources spent on them. I doubt I would've been able to complete the game with the rest of my team as they were. You may say \"You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket\", but there was no reason for me to believe that the player would be subject to such an underhanded move, and nor should there have been.

There is always to option to grind a few levels if they do become to difficult to beat and I had to do that for a few of the later bosses but in general I felt I did not really have to grind in general.\n\nThe story had my interest but was just a typical fairy tale-esque.  It is not challenging or thought provoking but it services the game well and flows well.  All the writing is in rhyme and I personally found it cute and neat but at some points some of the lines were stretching.

The last end of the bar is the 'casting' phase and is crucial: This is where you choose your spell/attack/defense, with some things having a longer cast time than others.

I didn't fight every enemy I saw (you can easily avoid trash), so the boss fights were extremely challenging, in a really really fun way. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1490820519, "timestamp_updated": 1490820519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "30788537": {"recommendationid": "30788537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016572015", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 824, "last_played": 1687285390}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, sort of short.
