The vibrant, chaotic hellscapes and the downright ludicrous character designs are a delight to behold, assuming you've got the stomach for an onslaught of over-the-top visual insanity.\n\nThe gameplay, while not revolutionary, is a heady mix of platforming, shooting, and exploration, all tied together with a satisfyingly bonkers drill mechanic. There's a gleeful sense of empowerment that comes from turning demonic baddies into gory confetti with your trusty, customizable drill.\n\nBut where 'Hell Yeah!' truly shines is its unapologetic commitment to sheer lunacy. From the outrageously bizarre boss fights to the shamelessly juvenile humor, this game revels in its own absurdity. It's a madcap carnival ride through hell, complete with explosive penguins and a chainsaw-wielding psycho bear.\n\nSure, it's not going to win any awards for its depth of storytelling or groundbreaking mechanics, but for a raucous, devilishly good time, 'Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit' is an unapologetically gleeful romp through a realm where the only rule is 'the more ludicrous, the better.'

I love my old sega games but ever since Sega got out of the console business\u2026 they just can\u2019t make a good game if their life depended on it. Every time Sega releases a game it\u2019s mediocre at best and unplayable at worst. \nEven, Yakuza https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0/ , a series I love, is plagued with sega trademark gameplay design choices that almost ruin the whole experience.\n\nSo, when you see a game about an undead rabbit, riding a chain blade with guns killing creatures of hell, you just know that if anyone could mess up such a concept, it can only be Sega.\n\n[h1] That name though\u2026 [/h1]\n\nI think I\u2019m wise enough to know that if someone\u2019s trying way too hard to sound cool, they probably aren\u2019t very cool at all. This game wants to make you think it\u2019s cool from the very title screen. \u201cHELL YEAH!\u201d, it\u2019s only because of this name that I\u2019ve put off playing this game for so long (the negative reviews helped too). \nSega was trying really hard to make this game sound cool, and just like most of their game, it faded into obscurity just like all other niche games they make.\n\n[h1] Demonic prices don\u2019t bathe with rubber ducks [/h1]\n\nOur story takes place in hell. The prince of hell, a skeletal Rabbit named Ash, is a vicious but respected ruler. However, one day he gets caught by a paparazzi having a bath with a rubber duck. This picture is released on the web and exactly 100 residents of hell see the picture and start calling him a \u201cp****\u201d.\nNeedless to say, Prince Ash doesn\u2019t take kindly to such a post, so he sets out to do the only logical thing: kill every one of those 100 demons and erase any trace of anyone ever knowing that he likes playing with rubber ducks. I gotta admit, I do like such silly storytelling.\nYou\u2019ll move from area to area, killing demons until you kill enough to move to the next one. You can\u2019t really miss out on any of them either but thankfully you have a radar that helps you locate them.\n\n[h1] Started off really well but slowly started to degrade[/h1]\n\nWhen I first started playing the game\u2026 I actually had a lot of fun. The game starts off as a decent 2D action platformer but as you progress,  you get power ups, new moves and a world map, so it kinda shifts into a metroidvania but, well, you don\u2019t really need to go back and collect things, so it hardly feels like one.\n\nAnyway, you will start the game with just the ability to jump but pretty soon, you\u2019ll get your first weapon: the chainblade. Simply hold the mouse button/controller trigger and mow everything down in your sight. It\u2019s a lot of fun\u2026 or at least it was.\nSoon after, you\u2019ll come across a shotgun and a machinegun and the game will start playing like a twin stick shooter. The chain blade will only be used to go through walls from then on\u2026 see what I mean about Sega ruining good things?\n\n[h1] Loose controls and enemies draining your health fast [/h1]\n\nEven though you won\u2019t notice it at first, the controls in the game are really loose. Jumping works well but everything else just kinda feels all over the place. When you learn wall jump, the game tells you to hold the jump button when you attempt to do it, however, it seems to not work when you need it the most. Apparently some walls can be wall jumped and some can\u2019t.\n\nYou do have a health bar in the game, but it may as well not even be there. They should have just replaced it with 3 hits, or something, because that\u2019s how long it usually takes to die. Also remember that chain blade? Yeah, it pretty much stops working on enemies once you get guns and if an enemy touches you it\u2019ll just drain your health. \n\nWhile dying isn\u2019t a huge deal thanks to a good checkpoint system, it\u2019s still frustrating to do boss and mini-boss fights over and over again, especially when it comes to the next mechanic.\n\n[h1] Micro games [/h1]\n\nThis next part was a roller-coaster ride for me. While you have trash mobs around the game, the main goal is killing the 100 individuals that saw the incriminating picture. Each one of these 100 enemies acts like a mini boss or a large boss of sorts. You have to damage them enough until their health drops to 0, however, when this happens, you also have to play a micro-game for the finish.\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Ware-were, you\u2019ll know what these are like. These are games that you literally have seconds to complete.\nAt first I thought this was pretty cool. You have to mash a button or wait for the right time to press the button in order to do an execution. Kind of like a \u201cFinish Him\u201d in Mortal Kombat https://store.steampowered.com/app/976310/Mortal_Kombat11/ . \n\nHOWEVER, unlike finishers in Mortal Kombat, you don\u2019t really have a choice here. You have to do these finishers in order to kill the enemies. If you fail them, and you will, you\u2019ll lose health, the mini boss will gain some back and you\u2019ll have to damage them again and pass the micro-game again to truly kill them.\n\n[h1] Search and destroy [/h1]\nThis was basically my \u201cQuit moment\u201d in this game. During a mini-boss fight, I drained the guy\u2019s health to 0 and then got the infamous \u201csearch and destroy\u201d micro game. In this micro game, you have to move your mouse/control stick to control a crosshair. You have your entire screen to locate an odd smiley and shoot it. Unfortunately, you only have 3 seconds to find the odd one out. \nAfter failing 15 times at this mini-game, I went online and noticed that other people had trouble with this. \n\nSo, let me just sum this up: I\u2019m unable to kill a mini-boss because it requires a finisher that\u2019s gated by a badly designed micro-game. \n\nAnd that, my friends, is why this game sucks\n\n[h1] Should have been fun but it ended up just being frustrating [/h1]\n\nThe thing that really frustrates me about \u201cHell Yeah!\u201dis how this could have been such a nice game if the developers just stopped and said \u201cMaybe we shouldn\u2019t put so much stuff in our game!\u201d. Honestly, I can\u2019t recommend this game to anyone. While it\u2019s sound good and looks good, it\u2019s anything but good when you actually start playing it.\n\nNext game: Hellblade: Senua\u2019s Sacrifice\n\n[h3]If you liked my review, feel free to follow my curator group.

And what an amazing game this is. Although the game is pretty short, I'd say 6 hours long if you're fast and 10 hours long if you take your time, it's still an amazing experience, the visuals are absolutely beutiful, stunning and timeless, and the humor is funny too, at times I laughed out loud at some of the jokes. Like most people say, the gameplay/difficulty is very casual (I think it's a good thing) and not too challenging. Also the game is very nice in the aspect that it doesn't force you to grind for dumb and unfairly hard achievements if you want to 100% it. The achievements are very easy to get and you will get them all without even trying to get them, just by playing the game. Playing the game, it's obvious that a lot of love and care went into making this game. I literally shed a tear at the ending credits. I definitly recommend it to anyone, escpecially on a sale, if 12,99 euro for a game that lasts ca. 6 hours is too much for you.

There is a bit more to do past what I have done and I am at least thankful they didn't force that upon anyone with achievements. That said, I will not be going back and doing the extra missions.

I struggle to think of any part of the game I liked. To make my point, let's just go through the list.\n\nGraphics/Artstyle: Lurid colors and screen shaking, vomit inducing animations. Character and monster designs that came straight from the margins of a textbook, doodled by a bored elementary school kid. The game revels in mindless gratuitous over the top cartoonish violence, complete with buckets of blood, entrails and viscera. \n\nNarrative/Writing: The game attempts to be edgy, reckless and \"cool with the kids\". Or at least what writers imagined kids to be like back in 2012.  Writing abandons such unnecessary concepts as plot, character development and generally making sense, and gleefully buries the player under the avalanche of bad puns, fourth wall breaks, unnecessary dialogue snippets, ran-dumb jokes and pitiful one-liners. And for all the murderfest, all the violence, all the huffing and puffing with the insults that characters sling at each other, the Prince of Hell is too scared to drop an f-bomb. Can't have that in my good Christian game.\n\nGameplay: Floaty controls. Forgettable enemies. Abundance of infantile QTEs/Fatalities as a crutch for unsatisfying gameplay. Dedicated button to zoom out because otherwise you will keep falling into spikes. On that note, a lot of spikes that kill with a touch and send you back to the last checkpoint. Infrequent checkpoints that for some inexplicably reason can respawn you with a sliver of HP. Pointless unlocks as most weapons work similarly to each other. \n\nAudio: Other than the credits song every track sounds like something you're find by searching \"free generic [genre] music download\".\n\n\"Hell Yeah\" may be fun for some people, who are into the over the top, abandon cartoon violence, but even then isn't worth full price.

Hell yeah!\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Satisfying finishing moves on mini-bosses\n- Useful minimap\n- Unique boss fights\n- Varying gameplay in some areas\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Some bosses are tricky to beat\n- Useless island features\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you are looking for a stress-reliever game, buy this game.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Graphics[/h3]\n[b]Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit[/b] is filled with 2D, cartoonish characters with the addition of foggy and lighting effects. The use of both effects makes the characters look softer and blend well with the background, especially with the background that is portrayed in a more realistic style compared to the characters. Some objects still retain the same 2D look although the terrain and walls are looking more like 3D in 2D plane with the lack of black outline and the use of shadows.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story isn't the main point of this game. Some dialogues act as fillers or tutorials and can be safely ignored if you choose to do so. The only important story is the cutscene at the beginning and end of the game, which also doesn't mean much in the first place. Despite the meaningless story, the game doesn't offer a skip function for the dialogues. This tends to give some trouble when you are repeating some boss fights since you have to read the same dialogues over and over again.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nExploring the area and killing mini-bosses are the core of this game. The game starts just like other platformer games where you have to explore the whole area to reach the boss room. Some parts of the area are locked and can only be accessible by defeating some mini-bosses, which are spread across the entire zone. Luckily, you don't have to worry about finding them - the game has a very useful minimap to help you find whatever you want, whether it's a healing point, the next boss location, or other important features that will be unlocked later in the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407345193 \n\nAlthough most zones have the same mechanic, some will require you to play by a certain rule. One zone requires you to clear some area without using your weapon, forcing you to either use a turret or utilize the environmental hazards to kill the mini-bosses. Some zones will also change the game into more of a shooter genre, where you control either a rocket or submarine and explore the area to defeat the remaining mini-bosses. These varying mechanics add more variety to the game and makes it not too repetitive.\n\n[b]Combat[/b]\nThe game is packed full of combat scenes, and it doesn't disappoint. Over 100 mini-bosses are spread across 10 zones for you to beat, all with different attack patterns and methods to beat. Although most enemies can be defeated with your guns, some bosses are trickier to beat, requiring you to either use the environmental hazard or the new mechanic that is exclusive to that zone. However, although the game will give you some hints on how to kill these unique mini-bosses, some hints are not clear enough, causing confusion as to what to do.\n\nKilling mini-bosses is fun and rewarding. Depleting the mini-bosses' health will trigger a minigame which you must complete to kill the mini-boss. There is no correlation between the minigame and the mini-bosses - you need to do some ridiculous actions such as answering a silly multiple-choice question, squeezing the enemy by smashing the Space button, or the others before the killing scene kicks in. The game will show the killing scene in [b]Danganronpa[/b] style afterward, connecting the ridiculous minigame with the killing in a hyperbolic way. Although the game has different minigames at first, the same minigame will be reused later on, reducing the satisfaction of killing them.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407344789 \n\nThree unique bosses will be spread across some zones for you to beat. These bosses are tougher than the mini-bosses and can be a bit bothersome at first, especially if you are not good at platformer games. Learning the attack patterns is vital in defeating these bosses, and if you are good at the game, you also can try to defeat them without losing any health. To be honest, defeating these bosses doesn't feel satisfying compared to the mini-bosses since there aren't any cool killing scenes at the end of the fight.\n\n[b]Missions[/b]\nThree missions are available to take in each zone and finishing them will net you some rewards. The missions are usually divided into four types: killing enemies, reaching the goal, collecting coins, and performing tricks. While the first three are simple enough to beat as long as you keep on trying, the last one is not keyboard-friendly. You need to reach a high altitude and turn your analog stick to perform tricks. Due to the control scheme, it makes the \"turning the analog stick clockwise\" to be \"pressing the WASD button in succession\" on the keyboard, making the command to be harder to execute. Moreover, the instruction tends to not be clear in this regard that I couldn't complete one mission because of this.\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the game in 9h and continued playing the DLC content for 1.5h. The rest of my playtime is spent in farming the death achievement, which doesn't take long since I already died a lot from playing the DLC content. The game was easy to beat, to the point that you just need to charge your way in most of the time to defeat the mini-bosses. There were some areas, especially the boss fights, that require some skills to beat, but that shouldn't give you too much trouble, especially since the game provides a lot of weapon upgrades and buffs.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2407347762 \n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nThe game has an island feature where you can take your defeated mini-bosses and force them to work for you, giving you some in-game bonuses in return. However, I hardly got any bonuses before I finished the game and it turns out that the bonuses aren't much use either. Moreover, it took some time and effort to assign the mini-bosses to work that it doesn't feel rewarding to do.\n\n[h3]Specs[/h3]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\nTo be honest, I didn't expect much from this game, especially since it was an old game that I never heard about. However, the game turned out to be a great stress-reliever, and it works wonders with the easy-to-play and satisfying gameplay. It might have been designed to be played in short bursts, but I have finished zones after zones without realizing it. It's all thanks to the finishing moves that show up after defeating the mini-bosses, and I couldn't stress enough how satisfying it is to watch.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1614260544, "timestamp_updated": 1614660387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752985000610351563", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "87369698": {"recommendationid": "87369698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086105951", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 532, "last_played": 1609373263}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es divertido y con buenos toques de humor.

lies soley with its gory style and silly humor.It's layered into the gameplay, the story and everything else and if it's not enough to get a smile out of you the flaws will overshadow your experience.\n\nThis game is a best described as a cross between a metroidvania and Warioware. Your objective is to hunt down and kill 100 specific monster defended by theirs own unique mechanics and microgame. It's a combination of platforming and puzzle solving as you find each monsters weakness and splatter its innards all over your screen.\n\nBut with so many mecahnics it does fall into the \"Master of none\" feeling fairly The controls are floaty and imprecise, the balance is 100% out whack and the end game starts repeating mechanics and coming very close to outstaying its welcome. It leads to an uneven experience of I'm having fun to crashing into a wall repeatedly as you try to decipher the designer's joke to make progress. Visually the polish is all here, but mechanically it's just not.\n\nIt ends up a weird balance of a highly casual game with a low difficulty level that spawns into a highly casual game with enemies that one shot kill you despite owning all the health power ups. It's not a hard game, but it seems to randomly forget that. Casual laughs turn to random \"SCREW YOU GAMES!\" and then go back to laughs.\n\nBut even with my frustrations, I genuinely enjoyed the experience. When my bunny spawned into the world of his own personal hell I smiled ear to ear and danced my way to the next stage.

I think I got this game as part of a bundle, or it might've been a free giveaway from Sega for something or other, can't remember. \n\nHell Yeah! is pretty unique overall. It's a mish-mosh of many things, but I think the safest way to describe it is a 2D action platformer with Warioware-style minigames. I don't really know what it is about games made by French developers, but from the ones I've played or at least watched (OFF, EYE: Divine Cybermancy), they feel really unique and/or experimental. Hell Yeah! definitely joins them as an experience. \n\nWhat I personally liked about Hell Yeah!'s dialog and presentation is that it felt like something straight from the period of time between 2005 and 2009 where websites like Newgrounds and SomethingAwful were thriving and 4-c-h-a-n was just exiting its infancy and all of those communities were producing original content. It's crass, over the top, nonsensical, feels a little like a Flash game, and is pretty damn fun.\n\n[h1]Some positive things that stood out to me about Hell Yeah! were:[/h1]\n\n- There wasn't a single mechanic that went either lightly used or completely unused. Even things as minute as zooming out a little bit were used as boss defeating/puzzle solving mechanics.\n\n- The weapons were fun and varied and there weren't any hard limits on when the player could use their weapons.\n\n- There were lots of nice silly customizations for the player to buy and slap on Ash and his blade-wheel jetpack.\n\n- The environments allowed for some gameplay mixups: underwater levels had Ash in a submarine with torpedos and bombs, the space level had Ash in a spaceship, etc.\n\n[h1]Some negative things that stood out:[/h1]\n\n- Any time Ash was on foot was absolutely miserable. Double jumping and wall ricocheting couldn't make any of the on-foot segments fun.\n\n- Some of the side missions are either unintuitive or just plain not fun (for those who played: the motocross missions in the casino, the \"race the monster spirit\" mission in the factory)\n\n- \"The Island\" is useless. \"The Island\" is a gameplay element where the defeated minibosses can go perform odd tasks to serve Ash, like getting the player more money or health, or an unlock. In practice, the time it takes for any of the bonuses to accrue is really slow and by the time I was done with the game, got basically no mileage out of it.\n\n- There's considerable backtracking and we as players don't get a teleport feature until the game is just about halfway done. I personally just liked exploring so it didn't feel too much like backtracking for me.\n\n- I felt strapped for cash until around the halfway mark of the game, where I wanted to buy more health or upgraded weapon levels but there wasn't much to do except go find a miniboss or some treasure. I think the side missions can be repeated for cash, but I inevitably found myself loaded with cash after the halfway mark.\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts:[/h1]\n\n- The finishing move minigames \"lasted\" a surprisingly long time in terms of enjoyment. I started getting bored of them by the high 60s/mid 70s kill count on minibosses, and that's already about a third of the game.\n\n- When you beat the final boss, stick around through the credits to see all the pictures. It's kinda humorous and the segment was a tell that the Arkedo team had a lot of fun bringing Hell Yeah! to life.\n\nHell Yeah! ran me about 8 hours. It's got a few DLC missions that supposedly tack on another 3, but I don't think I'd play them, honestly. This game is fine to play once and I wouldn't pay $15 for it. Maybe $10, but it goes on sale for $3.75 and that's a steal for 8 hours of goofy gorey fun.", "timestamp_created": 1594451644, "timestamp_updated": 1594491875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "72110038": {"recommendationid": "72110038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054393567", "num_games_owned": 765, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1226, "last_played": 1500137045}, "language": "english", "review": "You are the lord of hell but a paparazzi leaked a photo of you with a cute rubber ducky.

When some intimate pictures of Ash make their way to the Internet, Ash decides to find the one responsible, by killing every other inhabitant of Hell.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very reminiscent of classic platformers like Sonic, though rather than trying to finish each level as fast as possible, you need to find and kill specific monsters in each zone in order to progress; the game also has some metroidvania mechanics, as doors get unlocked after a certain number of monsters killed, and you can also get upgrades that allow you to access previously locked areas. The main appeal of the game would be the minibosses; killing them isn't as simple as shooting them until they die (or slashing them with your spinning saw), and once you bring their health down, you need to play a minigame in order to finish them off in a gorey explosion. While a cool mechanic at first, as you progress through the game it becomes increasingly annoying: if you fail the minigame, you get hurt instead, and some of them give you a very limited time to pull them off. Not to mention that draining the bosses' health down is a challenge to begin with. As you progress, you may acquire different weapons and upgrades from store, which is kinda cool to have more variety, but by the end of the game, I kept using a single weapon.\n\nWhile the levels themselves (and the general aesthetics of the game) look pretty good with a cartoony style, the design itself isn't very good. There's many spikes scattered across some of the later levels that are a one-hit kill, not to mention other deadly traps. More often than not you'll end up dying not to a boss, but to one of those traps, and considering how scarce checkpoints are in some levels, you might lose a lot of progress when you die (the game does save each time you kill a miniboss, but when you die, it takes you back to the location of the last checkpoint).\n\nI can say I enjoyed the game's soundtrack, in particular a couple of the songs. The aesthetics, as I mentioned above, are also very good, as are the references and jokes sprinkled through the game. However, there are many issues that I've mentioned and detracted from my overall enjoyment, which is why I can't recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1592797723, "timestamp_updated": 1592797723, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586370706558227539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "71156428": {"recommendationid": "71156428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333270493", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 223, "last_played": 1592793143}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Parece un juego hecho con el humor de un ni\u00f1o de 9 a\u00f1os.

There are also many death spikes which can kill you in one hit (another complaint).\n\"Minor\" enemies, or should I say wandering enemies suffering from autism, don't even attack you, they are placed in certain areas or just go back and forth on a platform so you hit them when you jump or fall down. The worst of all is that after you kill them, they just respawn when you sway only a little from the screen they were in.\nYour saw in useless except for drilling. It could have been removed without impact on the game (did you think you would use it to slice through countless enemies ? silly you).\nAiming a gun while jumping is annoying with a controller, you have to use a mouse and keyboard.\nEvery monster you encounter is a boss, yes, a freaking boss or mini-boss (it doesn't matter) around every corner.. and when (or more precisely if) you get its heath down to zero, you have to finish with a quick time event which is mostly illogical and the game gives you next to no time to think and react, and when you fail, you are penalized by removing a large chunk of your health.\nCheckpoint placement is horrible. Don't get me started.\nThere are supposedly 3 health \"upgrades\", each of them is a one time purchase that gives you 100 points of health to your CURRENT LIFE only, like seriously ?!\nI only played up until mission 3, I didn't finish it.

Este es tu juego.\nA pesar de sus virtudes, por su corta duraci\u00f3n recomendar\u00eda comprarlo cuando est\u00e9 rebajado para amortizarlo completamente.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1584703960, "timestamp_updated": 1584703960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65385481": {"recommendationid": "65385481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198438189198", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 593, "last_played": 1584696111}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little time waster.", "timestamp_created": 1584696509, "timestamp_updated": 1584696509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65338507": {"recommendationid": "65338507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198952978189", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 205, "last_played": 1587758022}, "language": "english", "review": "Your a rabbit kicking monster butt what more could you ask for,if you said comedic writing then it got that too and good gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1584635324, "timestamp_updated": 1584635324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "65159797": {"recommendationid": "65159797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242981506", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 383, "last_played": 1584379261}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No me gustan demasiado los juegos estilo metroidvania, este es uno de los pocos que he jugado y, ha diferencia de los otros, no me ha cansado.

Again.\n\nYou know how in Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, there's a system where, after depleting a boss's health bar, you need to use the stylus on the DS touch screen to draw a special symbol, to actually beat the boss? What if, instead of drawing a symbol, you had to complete a bizarre, Warioware-esque minigame to trigger the boss's defeat, which also plays a unique execution animation for every boss? It'd be AWESOME, that's what.\n\nIn Sonic the Hedgehog, you have these spring platforms which bounce you upwards, right? Well, in this game, they're green butts that you bounce on, and make fart noises when you do.\n\nThe gameplay is sorta Metroidvania-esque, but not truly. Most of the time, your character drives around in a sawblade contraption, armed with heavy weaponry. That's pretty ridiculous. There's a surprising amount of unique artwork and animations - every boss/mini-boss has a unique sprite, and a unique minigame (with a couple repeats), and a unique death animation. There's also a bestiary that keeps track of each one. It's got a great sense of humor, with references and shout-outs to plenty of other media, which I always appreciate. The music is catchy, the graphics bright and colorful, and the gameplay enjoyable. There is a lot of gore, but it's in an over-the-top, cartoony way. Like Tom and Jerry, with buckets more blood.\n\nIn short, it's one of the most ridiculous games, with one of the most ridiculous plots, I've ever played, but it's highly enjoyable and polished. You can tell while playing it that the developers really cared about it, and knew what they were doing.

In Hell, souls are doomed to eternal torment over minor squabbles. When Ash discovers that tabloids have posted compromising pictures of him with his favorite rubber ducky, seven worlds and over one hundred monsters are no match for his wrath. While Ash might look like nothing more than bones and a cape, he is infact the Prince of Hell. His arsenal is comparable to that of the average Contra or Metal Slug. He also tears through both earth and adversary alike while riding a giant buzz-saw.\n\nWhen you stack a bunch of awesome-sounding things on top of one another, you expect something truly incredible. However, after I completed the game, I only felt indifference. My blood never boiled, my (lack of) muscles didn\u2019t tense up, and I never once gritted my teeth. In fact, I felt like I never played a videogame. Hell Yeah! is more like a series of interactive events. There is some platforming, a bit of shooting, but all that manages to stick out are the dozens of minigames and QTEs. Maybe I\u2019m taking the wrong approach. Perhaps Hell Yeah! is actually an adventure game, where aspects such as challenge and replay-value aren\u2019t necessary. Wait... that sounds like a lame excuse, doesn't it?\n\nProgressing through Hell is quite simple, kill enough monsters and doors will open, which allows Ash to move on. Killing these monsters doesn\u2019t always require bullets or explosives. Occasionally, heavy objects have to be dropped on their heads, or their death is the result of some puzzle-solving. When a monster is depleted of its health a mini-game follows. Succeed and the monster dies, fail and Ash takes some damage. The way I see it, now the well has been sufficiently poisoned. More than anything else, I hate QTEs and by extension mini-games, especially when they\u2019re required just to kill something.  Every time a mini-game is successfully completed, Ash finishes the monster off in some grand fashion. It is kind-of like playing Mortal Kombat, except you have to use fatalities to win. Seeing these finishing moves is neat the first time, but they repeat and can\u2019t be skipped.\n\nWhen Ash dies, he\u2019s kicked back to the last checkpoint. While Hell Yeah! couldn\u2019t find difficulty on a map, a bad checkpoint is liable to be the cause of most deaths. If Ash takes a lot of damage in an area, that\u2019s going to carry over to the next checkpoint he triggers. This can be frustrating, especially since this game has rather sloppy controls. Yeah, since Ash\u2019s sweet ride is essentially a wheel; that means there is going to be a bit of sliding around. This makes jumping over spike-pits more trouble than it should be. There are a couple instances where Ash has to run around sans weapons and wheel. Maybe the wheel should have just been dropped altogether. Ash is easier to control when he\u2019s not driving a vehicle. \n\nExploring each world leads to the acquisition of money, which can then be spent on new guns and upgrades. This money can also be used towards the \u201cpimp out your dead rabbit\u201d. A fair amount of my enjoyment with this game has come from finding and purchasing new hairdos and helmets for Ash.  Some of the purchasable weapons like the shotgun are pretty cool, but the rest I struggled to find a use for. \n\nThere is little in the way of extra content. Side missions can be done for a little more cash and wigs. Also, all monsters that Ash kills are shipped off to The Island. Here they are put to work on various tasks for Ash\u2019s benefit. Unfortunately their labor really wasn\u2019t any help to me. By the time I completed the game, no discoveries were made, and all the monsters had done was cooked something that restored 30 points of health.  On the bright side, it is slightly entertaining watching these fiends walk around.\nWhere Hell Yeah! excels is in the audiovisual department. The worlds are vivid, surreal, and diverse. All of the monsters are unique and creatively drawn. The music is fantastic and the sound-design is great. I would almost recommend playing through the game, just to see and hear everything firsthand. Ultimately this makes for a fine experience, which is suitable for an adventure game.\n\nWith a title like Hell Yeah! there\u2019s really only one word I can use to describe it: in-offensive. This is the type of game, where all of its note-worthy aspects, require the least amount of effort to appreciate. This isn\u2019t like a fighting game, where someone would spend hundreds of hours practicing and training just to understand the depth it can hold. Actually I can\u2019t even say that this title would be comparable to other platformers like Sonic Generations, where at least some skill is required to attain a better score. Finding enjoyment in this game is tied to your expectations. If all you want to do is a burn up a weekend in a charming but shallow adventure, then by all means give this game a go. If you\u2019re looking for something that you\u2019ll actually want to replay and get better at, I could point you towards thousands of games that are better than Hell Yeah!\n", "timestamp_created": 1565723197, "timestamp_updated": 1565723197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595799446105957031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "54564796": {"recommendationid": "54564796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067361915", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 865, "last_played": 1565519340}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una sorpresa maravillosa.

And it's all done with an edgy cartoony humor.\n\nThis game is a bunch of cool ideas mashed together in a way that isn't broken or anything that severe, but it is uninspired at best and incohesive at its worst. Like it was made by a committee, or commissioned to a talented team that just wasn't in the mood for doing this. It checks all the boxes but with a minimum effort to call it done.\n\nI can see where they were going with the humor and style. It's like Max from Sam&Max, but not as funny and endearing. It's has over the top violence like [choose one of the infinite examples] and it has its moments. I  particularly enjoyed the shark missile from orbit while playing classical music. But it was the only moment that its over the top violence made me smile.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting in theory. The worst problem of the game, in my opinion, is that mouse+wasd works for levels designed for mouse+wasd, not for typical platforming. This is where the game design starts to fall apart. I like aiming with the mouse but it really doesn't seem all that relevant in how the enemies and levels are designed. Sometimes enemies are slightly above you, or moving above, and mouse aim makes sense. But it's not fun to play with my left hand and only occasionally moving the cursor to shoot something that is usually directly in front of me. And then the game goes as far as to take the guns away on certain levels, effectively making my right hand useless. And I swear, some parts of the game require some serious platforming skills, designed to use your right hand on arrows and left for jumping, or a controller. Meanwhile we have to play tricky platforming with only our left hands.\n\nNo, the mouse aim thing does not click with how the rest of the game was designed. Maybe during prototyping the game it was a traditional platformer with shooting in four directions with a dpad and the devs decided to jam in mouse aim and tweak the rest of the game (poorly). This is my best bet. Games designed from the ground up with mouse aim and platforming don't suffer from the problems I'm seeing here. Games like Abuse focus more on combat and movement is simpler compared to traditional platformers in order to balance the workload of movement and shooting.\n\nAnyway, do I recommend playing Hell Yeah? Hell No! ok, maybe 'hell no' is a bit too strong but I needed to say that. It's more of a \"meh, I don't think so\".\n\n\u02d0ftlslug\u02d0", "timestamp_created": 1562248667, "timestamp_updated": 1562528977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0,

Also, you're the prince of Hell, you know, the afterlife. Killing enemies makes about as much sense as you think.\n\nThe presentation is definitely one of the game's strong points. The absurdist Hell setting with single line backstory enemies complete with WarioWare-esque minigames and ridiculous death animations certainly give a game a strong identity. Unfortunately, the game does feel as though it spreads itself rather thin. There are 100 main enemies you have to defeat albeit no where near as many special death animations, some designs end up being pretty bland overall. The music also ranges from disappointingly mediocre to hilariously bad.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay does not really hold up compared to the presentation. The game is in essence a linear platformer with shooting. Most of the game is played on a sawblade drill with an attached jetpack and heavy weaponry (don't question it), with some pure platforming segments as well as some vehicle segments. There is enough gameplay variety to hold up a 10-hour game but none of the gameplay styles are executed very well.

Both of these end up getting quite annoying as you soon realise what this game is all about.\n\nAt first I really enjoyed the overall style and the death scenes of the bosses, which seemed unique at the time. The problems became apparent quite soon, as the game turned frustrating because of unskippable dialogue, a mess of a map that becomes quite hard to navigate making you lose track of where and what you were doing and even switching weapons became a clunky and tedious process.\n\nSome levels felt straight up unfair while others were boring, this was emphasized in the bonus levels where they were either mindless challenges or nigh impossible ones for whatever reason. You cannot change your settings and sadly the controls can suck a lot for some minigames, which can mean life or death in some scenarios.\n\nThe credits were unskippable and the jackpot achievement was a complete waste of time.

That should tell you everything.\n\nThe main issue that I found was... it's boring, actually. It's not that it's too easy or too hard, or they don't give you enough or too much to do, Hell Yeah! just isn't fun. Like they forgot to work the hardest on the thing you do the most of: just moving around.\n\nSo, it's just a pretty typical sidescrolling platforming metroidvania. There's a Farmville kinda mobile game attached to it aside from the running and shooting, which just seems kind of weird. You press WASD to run around and if you press spacebar you do this weird extended jump, I think it's meant to be some kind of jetpack (according to the game) but it feels like you're just jumping really high since you don't have a 'jetpack meter' or whatever.\n\n'Ash' (the skeleton bunny you play as) controls okay, but he's a little slippery and as I said before it's not really very fun moving around. You don't get any sense of momentum, you accelerate up to your maximum run speed in about half a second. It's not bad, it's just a little off.\n\nThe guns, at least the ones I should stress I saw in the first thirty minutes, are pretty boring. You get a rocket launcher and a machine gun, nothing special and they don't really sound or feel good to use, they don't sound chunky like they should. Also, I noticed the machine gun seems to be firing whole bullets... maybe some Cave Johnson magic. Considering the oversaturation of effects elsewhere I'm also a little disappointed you don't drop spent casings with every shot, it'd be a nice little touch. Your guns don't recharge their meters (guns don't have ammo counts, just a recharging meter) unless they're out which kind of means instead of doing your utmost to burn through all your ammo reserves by cycling through each one you might as well pick whichever does the most damage and just... wait.\n\nEverything to do with graphics and visuals is busy as all hell, to the point where sometimes you just sorta look at the screen and go \"uh, what am I looking at here?\" and while that doesn't bother me too much now I feel like it'd probably get on my nerves after a while. I played almost the full 30 minutes without realizing what my health bar was, since there's no explanation of anything on your HUD and it's somewhat unconventional (your HP is this weird zigzag down the left side of the screen, like Harry Potter but less obvious).\n\nIt's sad though that I actually think the game looks pretty good. Like compared to some of the indie trash being pushed out today it makes me wonder where everything went so wrong. Hell Yeah! is actually pretty reasonably polished, maybe something to do with SEGA publishing but I have no idea (how did they con SEGA into this?)\n\nUltimately, Hell Yeah! kind of feels like a Newgrounds game. There's no positives about that, not really. Everything about it is 'retarded' and I can't think of a word that represents the sensation this game gives me better. This game is retarded. It is as stupid and dumb as possible and appeals to the audience exclusively on those merits. Everything about it is dated, sort of like the Gex games, but not quite as charming.\n\nPlease buy anything that isn't this with your $15.", "timestamp_created": 1559668104, "timestamp_updated": 1559668104, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50888185": {"recommendationid": "50888185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168003995", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 247, "last_played": 1558980897}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like arcade games you'll like this game!", "timestamp_created": 1558968697, "timestamp_updated": 1558968697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "50659356": {"recommendationid": "50659356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067139267", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 557, "last_played": 1557939975}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute and fun.\nIt's refreshing when platformers take risks and try new things instead of repeating the same old formulas.

Its first and biggest problem is its controls. They feel slippery and imprecise and mae the platforming harder than it has to be. It also visually diverse, but has the qaulity of a basic flash animation. The cutscenes after killing an important enemies get in the way of gameplay and making the game feel like it stops dead in it's tracks for them. And the humor feels somewhat forced. The gameplay is decent, but nothing to write home about. A tad too repetitive, with encounters feeling a little too samey. And the combat is a little underwhelming. The parts where you have to figure out how to kill the enemies without weapons are pretty solid though. But soundtrack is solid, and works very well. And I don't say this to demean the game, but my favorite part of the game is the credits. Not because I hated the game that much, but because the credits feel like it displays the passion of the devs, and is generally pretty charming.

It really could have been a great game, but there are way to many design flaws. First, the controls are floaty and platforming does not feel satsfying at all. Second, there is no depth to the game, everything is very surface level. The weapons, while different, all perform about the same and you rarely ever find a situation where you should use one weapon over another. This makes all the upgrades feel irrelevant. Third, adding to the the surface level depth, \"The Island\" is a big waste of time. At first glance it looks really interesting, with all of the different locations, but after 2 minutes messing with it, you realize everything there could and should be condensed into one tab. It is really a shame too, because there a so many art assets in this game. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe art assets. I actually really enjoyed the art style. It has 100 unique monsters, tons of detail in each of the levels and there is a lot of cosmetic character customization. This bothers me a lot, since visually, the game really does pop out, but of course, without solid gameplay, the art is just wasted. I feel like they wanted to do some sort of \"Pokemon\" theme with the way that you can collect the monsters you defeat on \"The Island\" but maybe budget cuts forced them to simplify it. Lastly, I found the humor to be servicable; a little bit childish, but funny enough. \n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game, especially at the current $15 price tag. If you are really interested then I would say wait for it to be sold at $2 or less. Ah, and one more thing. There is not an option for the sound... why would you not implement that?

Once you see the plot, you quickly understand this game is based around humor. Simple mechanics and controls that are made for the 360 controller. They keyboard controls are [b]terrible[/b]. I would consider playing with a controller an absolute must.\n\nGameplay is pretty straight forward. Platforming with smaller enemies to kill and various obstacles in your way. To progress in the game you must kill the \u201cbosses\u201d (there are 100 of them). I put bosses in quotes as they are easy to defeat. After you drain their health, you have to play a short mini-game. These games are funny and usually last 5-10 seconds.\n\nYou get money for killing bosses and for collecting the random jewels and skulls. This can be used to buy weapon upgrades, life bonuses, new hats, etc. This does get a little repetitive in the last 25% of the game, but was still enjoyable due to them not being too tough. \n\nYou get a good progression tracking system. The full map will show how complete each level is, how many monsters are left and how many side missions remain. Also, there\u2019s a radar on your HUD that shows where the next monster (boss) is for the current level.\n\nOne strange area is \u201cThe Island\u201d. This is where the bosses go after you defeat them. They can work on getting you any one of 4 rewards that transfer to your campaign. A boss can get sad or angry after working for a bit, so you have to send them to their appropriate places to become happy again. Even for this game, it\u2019s bizarre why this even exists.\n\nThe controls need some work.\n-Twitchy movement with small controller stick input. I died from this numerous times\n-Wall jump tied to holding \u201cA\u201d button which is also the jump button. This leads to bouncing off a wall when you just wanted to double jump up to it normally.\n-Jumping and trying to shoot at the same time is awkward.\n \n\n\nEven with the cons listed, my first sentence in this review still stands. It\u2019s a fun game. It was clear to me that this was built to be played to the end and enjoyed. Certainly recommended, but the asking price is a bit high. \n\n[b]6/10[/b] Above Average", "timestamp_created": 1532704317, "timestamp_updated": 1658015713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524793386459350586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43639549": {"recommendationid": "43639549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063287059", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 226, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1532077157}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1532078104, "timestamp_updated": 1532078104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43615823": {"recommendationid": "43615823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262626587", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 376, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 612, "last_played": 1595728492}, "language": "english", "review": "What is Hell Yeah!: Wrath of the Dead Rabbit ?\n\nI was really conflicted about my overall thoughts about this game, I didnt know if I would recommend it or not, I wasn't 100% sure of the final verdict but after a few thoughts I had I came to a conclusion, I do not think that Hell Yeah! is an actual good game overall that does most of its stuff pretty well or introduces something unique, its decent/average, it tries to have a humor but I felt it was pretty weak, despite having a nice artstyle which Imo looked very detailed and just made the game look beautiful as hell, I never felt interested into the world or characters they built here, most stuff, even the story felt forced, the main point should be the gameplay and for a while it was good, they built here a fine gameplay loop but it gets repetitive too easily ill explain that below...\n\nHell Yeah! is a simple 2d platformer game with decents ammount of action and a few backtracking elements that reminds me of a few metroidvania games but its not really a full metroidvania, you get different levels that you can move through teleportation devices and your objective is simple, you have 101 demons to kill in order to show youre some sort of badass demon villain, to do this you have this buzzsaw vehicle that has a jetpack and different guns to use, the game has a decent ammount of guns but most of them feels the same, theres no different tactics when it comes using them and every demon was already easy enough, its not like they posed a threat or change of style during the fights, all you do is shooting them until they HP reaches zero and a minigame games which is either something simplistic as controlling a bus avoiding crashes or QTEs, since its repeated 101 times through the game and many minigames are reused it get so old, repetitive, overused and boring, this game would have benefited if it was slightly shorter, I felt that the gameplay overstayed its welcome they even try to introduce a few new mechanics or one-time ideas to keep it fresh but all they do is fuck the pacing of the game up, we even get a completely worthless management minigame here that you barely have a reason to use at all, the game has some underveloped ideas and a mentality of throwing many stuff at once on a wall to see what sticks on it, the result at the end is just a decent but troubled game that can be fun in some occasiations, considering I got this game for free from one of SEGA's giveaway packs which came with a bunch of other games and I had a bit of fun and theres a few qualities here mostly the soundtrack, art style and the first half of the game I had more satisfaction than frustration which was pretty present through my playthrough however if you manage to get this game during a sale when it reaches a very low price then Ill be fine recommending it to you otherwise stay away because there are better games out there to play when it comes to the 2d platforming genre.", "timestamp_created": 1531966512, "timestamp_updated": 1595793083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284441947937012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "43539375": {"recommendationid": "43539375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015233683", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1531634288}, "language": "english", "review": "An okay newgrounds game.

You can see a hell of a lot of creativity went into it, from the 101 unique monsters and the art which is great throughout. The music is also good, though repetitive. The writing is quite funny, with a tone that comes across as \"knowingly edgy\"... but nearer the end you wonder if it's actually that knowing. \n\nThe gameplay is the serious weak link and the game really falls down because of it.  Each monster seems to have their own unique minigame but as you progress you see that is not the case, and every 5 or so monsters are defeated the same way. Tracking down each monster becomes pretty tedious, and there are only two real boss fights. Platforming difficulty feels artificial because of the awkward, slippery controls and physics, and one-hit-kill spikes which are a cheap-and-cheerful way to ramp up difficulty. Those spikes will kill you more times than any of the monsters.\n\nBeating the game yields the incriminating photos you were tracking down, which are creative but not funny enough to pay off. The DLC and post-game content takes the form of more missions, which I didn't have the heart to complete because I couldn't stand interacting with the control system any more. \n\nReviewers generally decided this game was all style and no substance, and they're about right. I'd probably recommend watching a speedrun of this game rather than playing it, so you can witness the great art and music without the tedious gameplay.

I only have 0.4 hours of play so far but will be playing more for sure as I only stopped playing due to dealing with real life today. : )  In getting back to the game let me say the bosses are fun and while they have a mechanic to finish them off that some might not like I find it refreshing.  Many games I have played lately have not been like this and variety in everything life really is important.  You got to keep things fresh.  Hopefully from what I have seen thus far from the game will continue til the end as this definitely added something different to what I am playing right now.  I do recommend this game for sure.  As for what I paid for this game I do not recall.  I also can't remember if I got this in a bundle or not.

Or enemies. the music doesn't get your blood pumping: it doesn't even really register. the environments aren't threatening, nor are they campy. they're just... uninspired. \n\n...if anyone who made it happens to read this, and to any potential buyers, too:\nI think you had a great idea here, I really do. But the problem is you never took the gloves off. It should have been... well, METAL. Head banging, blood spurting, gore-smashing, iron-clashing, riff-djenting, METAL. It should have been brutal. That doesn't mean it has to be unhappy: you can totally do funny and delightful METAL. But it needs to have teeth. heart. soul. and while I'm sure you put a lot of effort into it--because I can see the overall product is well polished-- it feels like you were holding back out of fear of getting an M rating or something. ...embrace the M rating.

Hell Yeah is just passable.\n\nIf you don't care whether you support DRM that may repeatedly force you online for re-validation; or make games that use it eventually cease to work for all legitimate owners; or you only care about this particular piece of software then it's safe to ignore the preamble & \"score\" of this review. I believe the rest of its contents are fair criticism.\n\nBuying any of Sega's products, even older ones that lack that DRM like this one does, will support the inclusion of said DRM in future products.

The bosses in the game are just weird in their appearance. The levels vary. The game has a very direct and partially dark humor that I couldn't get in touch with much. Killing a boss forces the player to perform a finisher, otherwise the boss restores some health and the character receives damage as if hit. Those finishers may be something new and unique but imo they weren't required and not making them optional but forcing them on the player was a mistake, especially since they get repetitive after some time. Devs: Just because you think a feature is cool don't force it on the players. They may not like it, they may not always be in the mood for it, allow the players to decide how to enjoy the game more.\n\nMixed feelings on the controls. Imo using one button for two distinct actions (jump & wall jump) led to an inaccuracy of what action is to perform and accidental mistakes as result. The character also tends to slide a little until stopping which led to falling down numerous times for me. Should imo slide only at high speed but not anymore when at walking / slow running speed but just stop.\n\nThe enemies require a certain approach to be defeated, which the player needs to figure out to succeed. This can lead to being stuck. An example for this is the boss \"Irish\" who requires the player action of zooming the view / camera out to kill the boss. Another example are the smoking creates in one of the other levels that require to shoot the smoke so that it catches fire and damages objects above it, even through the ceiling. The game doesn't make that clear. Enemy projectiles also tend to come from off-screen and most often can be fully evaded. Yet player projectiles are deleted once the leave the screen and thus always have less range then enemy projectiles and are unreliable to hit if being mobile and I guess that was a design decision to make sure the player doesn't snipe enemies from the corners of the screen. For boss fights there rarely may be situations in which a boss becomes immune to damage. Games like Megaman had the *glows red* indicator to make that clear. This game just doesn't give any hint for any immunity on / off. You have to know and guess but it's only a very minor issue. Enemies may also move inside the level's terrain sometimes, rendering them unkillable as they can't be hit while inside the terrain.\n\nIn the game world I sometimes had trouble realizing that some of the darker objects weren't just background objects but actual movement blocking main world objects.\n\nThe economy to upgrade gear and buy new stuff is about gathering coins and gems. Aside from that money can be gained by boss kills, missions, slot machines and \"the island\", with slot machines breaking the economy: I made so much money there that I didn't have to worry about anything for the rest of the game.\n\nA strange economy, research and upgrade objects is \"the island\": Bosses you defeat are sent to that place to work for you. You can assign them to 1 of 4 tasks but what these actually do to which effect / degree in the game I haven't figured out yet because this feature isn't explained at all and any bit while also not being accessible from within the current game. Instead to access \"the island\" you have to quit your current game, go to the main menu, access \"the island\" from there to make your settings and then you can continue with your regular game. Imo that made it into the game too late and lacks an actual use.\n\nWithin the levels there are reusable checkpoints. Usually autosaves also happen after defeating a boss but not always. This leads to issues:\nIf dying after gathering money / items from hard to get areas and before being able to save that'll have to be done again. Because checkpoints are sometimes very far away and there are enemies and obstacles to avoid to get to them that can be burden just for saving progress.\nAnother issues is with boss fights where saves didn't happen and repetitive, unskippable dialogue and after succeeding forced finishers again.\n\nI finished the game and all it's missions in one run and I doubt I'll be playing it again. While I didn't dislike it I also can't say I really enjoyed it but that it's been one weird trip. What kept me playing were the game's core mechanics that worked but imo other games I have are more enjoyable at that. If I could I'd give this game a clear mediocre rating but with only the decisions of recommended or not remaining I wouldn't recommend it even though I didn't encounter any bugs and it's well playable.\n\nIssues for me:\n-double binding of wall jump & jump (one other button pressed to make use of wall jump would've been more accurate)\n-unreliable projectiles: player projectiles being deleted off-screen\n-broken economy (slot machine)\n-badly integrated \"the island\"\n-lack of explaination where it was necessary (camera zoom out; how to access \"the island\"; what anything on \"the island\" does or any progress or anything there)\n-instead of making the character invulnerable for a very short amount of time after being hit the character remains vulnerable and is pushed back a large distance, leading to unavoidable being hit chains at times\n-projectiles don't accelerate with the player's movement\n-weird bosses instead of functionally interesting bosses (most of the time)\n-forced finishers\n-no \"skip\" for dialogues\n-some weapons are just the same as others and aren't really needed (should be upgrade paths of one weapon instead of carrying very similar ones around)\n-clunky save & healing mechanic (sometimes had to run back a large distance just to gain health back and/or save); manual saves every x minutes and a slot regeneration would've done much to combat this\n-a lot of new gear but aside from wall jump (only usable in areas with gear restriction) no new / advanced character abilities\n\nGood:\n-no bugs encountered\n-most often level design and soundtrack\n-core mechanics work\n-upgrading makes things interesting\n-the game allows to figure out how to deal with enemies (but should tell if it's not about combat and explain all non-combat things)\n-good key bindings (aside from that jump / wall jump double use)\n-tendency of weapon mechanics but sadly not fully eplored\n-map (but should show items within explored areas)\n-teleporters to avoid huge travel distances", "timestamp_created": 1500684786, "timestamp_updated": 1500685283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521056711673736572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33661804": {"recommendationid": "33661804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006037597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1294, "last_played": 1485914288}, "language": "english", "review": "A sorely underrated game full of charm and cartoony gore.", "timestamp_created": 1500508171, "timestamp_updated": 1500508171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "33625611": {"recommendationid": "33625611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113014119", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1398, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 877, "last_played": 1500367289}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell Yeah!

Want to win that race in Factory? Not as long the green goo fountain activates as soon you reach it, or the platforms are in the opposite side at the start, you just need to have the luck to get everything so you can cross at the start, otherwise your opponent (who is a ghost) will win 95% of the times.\n\nThe game shows care and laziness in some parts of the game, you can see they clearly did a great effort about the monsters, giving them stories and things, the visuals are really well done as I said, that was a great part of the game.\n\nIn other hand, the luck factor and the occasional BS death or falling in spikes is about as much challenge this game is going to give you. Every monster/boss is easy, their AI is really basic, altough there are a lot of weapons there is not any difference between them but fire rate, damage, ammo and design. The grenades are seriously OP \n\nI hate how this game relies so much in Quicktime Events to the point that is literally a core mechanic of the game.

First and the thing that I disliked the most is how long some of the animations took to play. The game feels like it is designed to play fast and fun, but the flow is slowed way down for the kill animaitons. Second, there are many instant death traps. This means there are many times you could spend quite some time collecting coins you need to upgrade and buy more weapons, only to hit a spike while still at full health and instantly lose all the progress. This mechanic should not be in a game like this and made the game way less fun. Given everything about the game I feel the first part of the game is decently fun and could be a 7 or 8 out of ten, but after playing through the rest of the game I would have to say it is a 3/10.\n\nTL;DR - The game starts out fun but gets old fast.

I was not sure if I could enjoy an action platformer that looks like Mario Bros. from the 1980s. It looks like an interactive cartoon movie that requires plenty of jumping and jumping skill are required to advance in this game. I do not play many action platformers. After playing the first zone for a little bit, I felt like I could slowly enjoy this game.\n\nThe basic theme of the game centers around Ash, the protagonist rabbit. He is the rabbit prince of hell who finds out that photos of him romancing with a rubber duck could be made public on the Hellternet, hell\u2019s version of the internet. There are 100 monsters who saw the photos, leaving Ash with one choice: kill them all. The story takes place across 10 zones, but there are restricted parts of zones so that you can defeat a certain number of monsters so that doors can explode to give you access to more of the zone.\n\nThe zones are diverse enough and rendered in 2D environments. Zones include a casino, ruins, museum, volcano, a spaceship, etc. While there is a lot of jumping, you will face monsters very frequently. Monsters are of varying personalities. Some indicate that they are bored, some are hanging out with friends, and some are downright nasty. Each monster requires a strategy that is not straightforward. You must study the environment to understand the strategy that is required to defeat each monster. Many of these monsters are much larger than you are. You move around with a jetpack and drill to navigate spikes, walls, and various traps. The drill can be used to kill bugs, but they usually are no good against the largest monsters. For example, you must figure out how you can lure a monster to an area where slime can be dropped on him for the kill. The ten zones are graphically colorful and eye candy in 2D. It looks like a kiddie game with a sense of humor.\n\nDefeating each monster usually leads to a minigame that must be completed properly to finish him/her off. Since there are way less minigames than monsters, they get repetitive. One minigame requires you to answer a trivia question and another requires you to powerlift a barbell so that your rabbit become large enough to kick the monster through a goal net, resulting in gibs that splash all over the screen.\n\nWhen you are out of the game you can visit The Island, a private property of Ash that is used to enslave every monster you defeated. The benefit of every monster working on The Island is that they will give you gifts such as more health, more cash, and surprise items. They work in the harbor, the mines, the lab, and the manor. Some monsters will show unhappiness or anger, so they must be sent to the beach or the tower to take away their unhappiness or anger. You can zoom into the beach to see defeated monsters play a game of volleyball, which I found amusing.\n\nAs you explore the zones, there are plenty of coins and jewelry to collect and they are important for buying items from the stores. Items include upgrades for your firearms and various skins for customizing Ash. Skins include hats and bike outfits. Upgrades to the drill occur throughout the game, but they can only happen by progressing through the story. There is a lot of backtracking in the game. when you finish one of the later zones you will realize that you must return to zone 1 to defeat more monsters so that you can continue to open later zones in the end. This backtracking can feel like a little bit of a drag, but there is a teleport system to make your backtracking less tedious while you analyze the teleport system\u2019s simple map.\n\nThe control scheme I used for this game was WASD for directions and the mouse for firing weapons. The jumping can be awkward and frustrating, especially when wall jumping. Other times a slight mistake in a jump can lead to instant death. I got used to the mouse/keyboard scheme with enough practice, but some may end up preferring to use a controller. The jumping gets more frustrating in parts of zones where you lose access to all your weapons and jetpack.\n\nThe weapons in the game are your basic ones such as a revolver, shotgun, grenades, rockets, flamethrower. There are a few unusual ones like a holy water. However, I did not find much variation in how much damage they do. The ammo does not actually run out since they only require recharging to fire again.\n\nI found Hell Yeah! to be more fun than I thought it would be. Despite the sometimes-frustrating jumps, especially where Ash had no weapons or jetpack, I enjoyed the gameplay enough after adapting to the mouse/keyboard scheme. I also enjoyed the variety of settings in each zone, especially in the casino and in the spaceship while shooting asteroids, bugs, and monsters. Hell Yeah! is not a classic action platformer game, but it is a decent one by Sega and Arkedo Studio.\n\nMy Score: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1493918975, "timestamp_updated": 1493918975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675506055355072021", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "31495359": {"recommendationid": "31495359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043346855", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 614, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 28, "last_played": 1534213575}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game - it's clear that painstaking effort went into delivering a tantalizing experience on all levels.

Now let me just divulge here, not only does it FEEL good when you're the one cranking out the punishment on those, pic-stealing, no-bad (no-good doesn't really cut it here, does it?) laugh-at-the-dead-bunny-prince-of-hell-Demonfaces, you'll also have A LOT of rage to deal with when you FINALLY DO. This is ONE, ANNOYING, platformer-shooter-and-the-devil-knows-what-else! You'll get frustrated. Trust me. So when you finally DO get to duke out that over-the-top-excessively-brutal-style-punishment, it will feel SO, SO, OH SO GOOD!\nOh. Right. The game...\nWell. It's over the top. It's a big barrel of laughs that (unfortunately) gets old sooner rather than later. (Once you've seen the first repetition Monster Death, leave the game for a while and come back at it when you've just about forgotten about it. It'll help with not getting bored with it. That's probably why they added the ah.... other thing in the game...)\nThe controls are VERY wonky to learn. Probably because once you FINALLY think you've got it down, you get to a part where you have to do it differently. All in all, I had a blast paying the game, I really did, but I got to feeling trapped more often than not, doing the same kind of thing over and over again, WAY too many times. The only real reason I think I said \"damn it all\" and finished it was that the levels and bonus stuff got SO hard it actually motivated me to get it the hell-bunny over with! That being said, I laughed my A## off almost every time I FINALLY killed one of them, (mostly because it got REAL hard in the end to keep your cool and adjust to whatever button combination or task you had to perform to get that AWESOME finishing move.)\nI'm not gonna do numbers here, because for what the Devs were probably going for, The Controls, The Graphics, The... Everything about the Game is probably as close to perfect as they could get it. And it works. It's not gonna win GOTY but DAMNED it's a funny ride to go on once in a while, especially if you're feeling frustrated and want to take that out on some dumb looking monster with a finishing move you'll remember laughing at the most akward of times. If nothing else, people will ask you what you're laughinh about and you'll have the unenviable task of trying to explain the, um... - plot.\nBut all that aside, the game is gut-bustin' Fun and Old-School-Hard to Play.

I hate it so much.\n2. hate when you get hit, he jumps quite a bit in a random direction. most the time it will be right into the enemy. \n3. There are some things that, if you touch them, you instantly die. that's total bull shit. \n4. When it saves sometimes, what ever your health meter is at, that is what your meter will be when you respawn. \n5. why arent there random places to get a bit HP? you have to go all the way back to the well, to get it.\n6. this may be just for me bc I couldn't figure out how to change controls. on the gamepad, it was difficult to jump and shoot at the same time. have to use my right thumb, pointer, and middle finger at the same time.\n\nso, the pain in the ass part is a combination of some of those. Like, finally killing a monster, then fail the mini game, he gets hurt and flings himself into a spike that kills you instantly. wash and repeat\n\nThat was more than I thought it was but I really did enjoy the game.

You can use the mousewhell as well, but it cycles too fast to be precise and more often than not you end up on the wrong weapon doing that.\n- 100 mini bosses (apparently), each with a checkpoint before the unskippable cutscene and dialog introducing the mini-boss so if you die (and you will a lot while you figure out the trick to each) you get to watch the cuscene again, and again...\n- No weight to the weapons.\n- Zoomed in very close and your weapons can't fire beyond the edge of the screen.\n- Leaps of faith that can result in instant death.\n\nIt's a fun enough concept, and I actually like the mini-games after each boos that some others complain about, but steer well clear unless you get it for free.

The story is silly and filled with cartoonish gore. So not everyone will enjoy its weirdness. With its cartoonish direction, the graphics are great. They're bright and colorful. However, these colorful graphics are often too bright. Another problem with this is that everything (background and foreground) is bright and colorful making it difficult at times to distinguish what is dangerous and what is friendly (you may have to play it yourself to know what I mean...). And now Hell Yeah!'s biggest problem... platforming. It's really hard to defend an action platformer when platforming isn't tightly controlled. Controlling the jetpack buzzsaw isn't terrible. But it's slippery... It's floaty and too sensitive. This makes for some frustrating moments.

Red fire. Some spouting red fire hurts you, even though it's lower opacity, thinner, and generally less visually imposing. Bosses will roll over you and spawn huge walls of fire. But actually, the fire is purely cosmetic; it won't damage you. All this is in the first level, which is red in the foreground and red in the background.\n\nI want to illustrate in the above point that the game's style COMPLETELY CONFLICTS with good game design. This happens everywhere. To have continuous, smooth animations, the game has to play in a weightless, floaty way--torpedoing rockets from your gun poof with a small purple cloud tweening and fading away (accompanied by a low-mixed sound effect), making it hard to tell if shots land. Your melee attack is signaled by a fade-in, fade-out blur SFX of white-blue against a usually gray-and-red-speckled sawblade. A pop-up appears to tell you that you can't saw into metal enemies, but a metallic sound effect doesn't play? Lol.\n\nTHE CAMERA IS SO ZOOMED IN with SUCH PLAIN, WIDE LEVEL DESIGN that you can snipe the first boss (and many other monsters) offscreen without even seeing their sprite. I assume that's to make the art look nice even at low resolution? It's pretty ridiculous.\n\nThis has all the elements of a good game but FEELS awful to play unless. Floaty, unsatisfying gamefeel and animations, unclear visual direction, low speed. It plays like a Newgrounds game. Trash.\n\nAlso, the humor was dated when it released and hasn't aged well. It's got this Happy Tree Friends forum member mix of lolsorandum and satire-less edge, like a newspaper headline's \"THE PRINCE IS A PUSSY\" in the opening cutscene to motivate the main character. Characters speak in tired, meme-like phrases and re-explain jokes immediately after they're delivered. The tutorializing character is an octopus Gir with a moustache and tophat.\n\nIn particular, Ash COMPLETELY breaks character to politely greet the first boss, and like... It happens over about 12 dialogue balloons. It's not delivered quickly enough to be irreverent and drags down the pace. The joke doesn't have the satisfaction of being humor built on characterization (at every other point, Ash is a rude loudmouth). Its humor is so bad you can write essays on how each joke doesn't quite work.\n\nIt's not comfortable being gory enough to delight in ultraviolence with its cartoony blood and slime splatters. Its uber-macho monster designs featuring overly-detailed lips, wrinkles, uncanny proportions, etc fail to be consistently creepy-cute. I don't know how it pleases anyone.\n\nThe SEGA costumes are cute, though. SUPER cute. Ever wanna play a game as Oppa-oppa riding one of the wheels from a pair of Jet Set Radio skates?

It plays well.  It's relatively fair in punishment for failure.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a repackaged Warioware.  There's a main game, then all of a sudden everything changes for no reason.  Mechanics are completely forgotten about, your character controls completely differently, and everything is suddenly based off of timed buton presses that you really can't prepare for.  Worse yet, sometimes pressing the buttons on screen leads to failure, and you eventually learn not to follow the instructions (looking at you chewing game that only requires two button presses).\n\nI think the game is interesting, and it has the potential to be genuinely fun.

I took it for an action platforming game, which is only partially true. There is a lot going on here; shooting, exploration, mini-games, Quick Time Events ([b]QTE[/b] for the sake of this review), and probably the strangest collection mini-game I've ever encountered add up to a pretty solid title that is pretty good even if it isn't quite perfect.\n\nThe story is nonsense, I won't go into it too deeply but it is pretty ridiculous. The MacGuffin here is twofold; find embarrassing photographs, return a bunny ruler to his throne in Hell. The writing is highly amateur, and while I enjoyed some of the jokes I found myself speeding through a lot of the inane dialogue and bland humor.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes there is plenty to do and like, even if it's pretty uncomplicated. Levels are very linear, solving them really doesn't take a lot of thought or exploration. There are a LOT of bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. After a while it gets daunting, mostly because of the QTEs that come with every single boss and mini-boss in the game. This wouldn't be as bad if the controls were better, but I will get to that in a moment. As the bunny you have a wide arsenal of upgradable weapons you will inevitably have to use, and while some of them were useful, none of them felt especially creative; guns, bigger guns, or automatic guns for example. You are able to fire these weapons except for some of the stages that take all of your weapons away or thrust you into completely different kinds of play, such as when you pilot various crafts throughout the game, man turrets, or are forced to navigate entirely on foot and unarmed. Checkpoints are plentiful, this game expects you to die and really doesn't punish too severely for it.\n\nThe controls felt loose and very slippery. I used a game pad for the most part, but even a keyboard and mouse couldn't help the sense that I was sliding a bit when I moved around. This is especially problematic on certain stages where instant death will happen if you can't pinpoint very precise jumps. There are bigger problems; every boss and mini-boss has a QTE, and there are a lot of them. The problem, is that some of these are not game pad friendly, one of them in particular didn't appear to work with the game pad at all, I had to resort to using the keyboard to complete these QTEs, and while that's not a big deal, it's worth noting that the controls here are just not the greatest. Another consideration are that the controls themselves are very awkward, especially with the game pad. I read a lot of comments in the discussions about this issue, many people suggesting that using the best way to play were the mouse and keyboard. If I could do this all over again for the first time I would have probably gone with their advice.\n\nVisually the game is a bit of a throwback to 90s platforming games. Colors are bold and contrasting, giving the game a very vivid appearance. The areas and characters were well drawn, though some were also part of the humor, which means I didn't find all of them very funny or interesting, but there were a few that made me laugh. The screen can seem little busy at times, but beyond that the game looks really good. I wish more games were not afraid of this aesthetic; rich bold colors are a welcome change from a lot of the drab or subtle tones many games rely on now.\n\nMusic and sound effects are generic to good, some of the sounds seemed like stock sound effects. The music had all kinds of things happening that I found kind of interesting, and really amusing. The kiddie song on one of the stages was suitably saccharine, even hilariously twisted considering the stage and what was happening, while other songs were parodies, including one that sounded very curiously like the original Star Trek theme. The rest of the game is loaded with tracks that range from rock to thumping beats, and while they could be repetitive at times they were never really annoying. Actually the music overall was pretty good, and again some of it was a throwback to 90s platforming games I used to enjoy when I was a kid.\n\nOverall a good game with a lot of things to see and do. Not much of a challenge, but not the easiest out there either. I hope they consider making a sequel, and if they do I hope they will try being a little more creative with their game design.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Big Arsenal of weapons\n    [*]Catchy music\n    [*]Visually well designed\n    [*]Wide variety of level options\n    [*]Mini-games and collectibles are unique and amusing\n    [*]You get a lot for your money\n\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Awkward game pad controls\n    [*]QTEs get old\n    [*]Some lame writing\n\n[/list]\n\nA fun game with a few weak points and some control issues.

The music is often so bad that it's good and you never feel like you're seeing the same scenery over and over again.\n\nOverall, Hell Yeah is an easy recommendation for fans of oldschool platformers or oldschool run and gun games.

Haven't and don't intend to try with KB/M. Hitboxes are solid, almost everything is made obvious to the player, it functions as advertised. Mostly. Some of the jump physics are a little weird, but usually more in your favor than against.\n* Joyfully nostalgic platforming. In many ways, I'm reminded of Jazz Jackrabbit, and if I didn't know any better, this game is paying some homage to it. The floaty jumping mechanics, aiming, variety of weapons, goofy humor, and the protagonist (anti-hero?) is, well, also a rabbit. \n* Weaves quick time events and platforming pretty seamlessly (though some of the animations could use to be shorter). The animations for beating said events are over-the-top and fun to watch, but mostly only for the first time.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n* Deaths are very forgiving. This is kinda cool since you'll likely Sonic-the-Hedgehog-style your way into some traps getting caught up in the action. Fortunately, the game gives you a neat function to zoom out (and simultaneously pause) with the right bumper on the controller, dunno what it is for KB/M, but it's a nice feature to let you formulate your next move.\n* No variety in difficulty. It doesn't really need it though I guess, the difficulty is pretty balanced.\n* Fourth-wall-breaking, light-hearted and occasionally raunchy humor. It mostly falls flat to me, but that's subjective so I can't knock it. It's like Disgaea level humor, if it were just one-liners and no voice acting.\n\nCONS:\n* As a result of the first two neutral points above, replay value is practically non-existent.\n* So much happening on screen that we see two issues: first, it's often difficult to tell what's an enemy, a trap, or a piece of the foreground/background, unless you're frequently stopping to take in the scenery. Second, there are framerate stutters, but they're infrequent and don't really hinder gameplay *too* much unless you're making a precision jump at the time.\n\n\nTo conclude, might be worth picking up on sale for platforming nostalgia.

While I may not be the most appropriate person to talk about Halloween, since we don\u2019t celebrate it in my country, I tried to choose a title that\u2019s more related to our \u201cD\u00eda de los Muertos\u201d (Day of the Dead), our national holiday that embraces our joy for life, the cult and nostalgia for our departed ones and also\u2026 to poke fun at death.\n\nPrecisely, that\u2019s what Arkedo\u2019s Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit does, poke fun at death, hell, and some other spooky things on the way. While French developers, Arkedo, might be long gone as a studio after a financial bankruptcy (should I dedicate a Mexican D\u00eda de los Muertos \u201cOfrenda\u201d perhaps?), they certainly made games that were appreciated in a special way by some people (like Nervous Brickdown or Big Bang Mini for the Ninty DS).\n\nA RESURRECTION FOR A PLATFORMER? \n\nFor a start Hell Yeah! is a platformer, a genre that many thought dead but that\u2019s been slowly coming back thanks to the necromancy of retro gaming. You control Ash, hell\u2019s current underworld ruler, who is trying to hunt down some of his minions that are threatening him with releasing compromising photos to the public. As fun and weird as the plot sounds this translates into comedic and bizarre interruptions or mini games that appear as you progress though mazes in the underground, perhaps this is a double edge sword, cause while some of us SEGA fans might fall into the gag and follow by, some others might get desperate trying to know what\u2019s going on, because the game is not very intuitive in explaining these \u201con the go\u201d mechanics. For example, some bosses require to aim and shoot as a mini game, but some people might not get how to do it, cause the game does not do a very good job on explaining so or that it is part of a gag.\n\nFor most, the game has a lot of fun to offer, but also requires to master some skill, since the controls require you to switch between sticks to aim for certain parts or to zoom out the screen to aim and hit some enemies.\n\nSOMETHING FOR THE SEGA FANS\n\nThe game has a lot of fanservice for the average SEGA fans. As you progress in the game you unlock SEGA Character themed add-ons like JSR or Shinobi hats or items, you can also equip your attacking wheel with more weapons or features. There are also other fun hubs like your own island were you send your defeated enemies and punish them as it must due!\n\nA KILLER OST AND VISUALS TO DIE FOR\n\nThere are 2 things that outstand in this game, its vector based visuals & character designs and its amazing OST. The vector artwork shines so well in this game and allows you to enjoy the aesthetics no matter the resolution, specially in PC, Arkedo did a great job. The OST is something to enjoy on its own, even if you don\u2019t buy the game you can still download this awesome score, it has something for almost everyone, from lullabies to hardcore punk, and every tune fits perfectly in the game.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis game is fun and enjoyable, but might not be appropriate for the narrow minded player. While its true that pretty visuals and a good OST are not all in a game, the title lacks of some areas to be polished like a more polished gameplay and controls.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Amazing visuals and OST\n+ Fanservice for the SEGA fans\n+ Fun times and fart-type jokes\n\nCons:\n\n\u2013 Not for everyone\n\u2013 Requires control skill\n\u2013 Lacks of explanation for some mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1471770421, "timestamp_updated": 1471770421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597803890705108643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "25030951": {"recommendationid": "25030951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963046020", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1471693085}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast and short review:\n\nThe game is about a Rabbit that is the King of Hell and got some nude pics robbed.

Gr\u00e1ficamente tiene un bonito estilo 2D muy cuidado, con diferentes est\u00e9ticas bien marcadas y personajes muy bien animados, muy fluido todo. Es muy agaradable a la vista vaya.\n\nEn cuanto al gameplay, los controles son geniales, responden super bien y r\u00e1pido. El control es sencillo pero efectivo y tienes muchas armas diferentes a parte de la sierra principal. Adem\u00e1s el personaje tambi\u00e9n es personalizable y hay desbloqueables tanto de aspecto como de armas y objetos.\n\nTiene tambi\u00e9n misiones secundarias y algun modo de juego extra aunque lo m\u00e1s destacable es la campa\u00f1a, el resto son a\u00f1adidos que est\u00e1n bien para mirar de vez en cuando como el modo isla. Es m\u00e1s una gracia que otra cosa xD.\n\nEl juego en general no es muy dif\u00edcil, las plataformas no son la principal dificultad en este caso, si no los enemigos y averiguar como matar a cada uno de los objetivos ya que cuando se va avanzando ya no ser\u00e1 tan facil con algunos como usar tus armas. Tiene bastantes cosas orginales en su desarrollo y formas de matarlos, y sobretodo mucho humor genial.\n\nComo negativo solo le veo que peca de repetitivo, siempre se hace lo mismo y los minijuegos para matar a los enemigos se acaban repitiendo, algunas variaciones en algunos pero se repiten. El desarrollo siempre es igual pero los diferentes lugares y algunas cosas que van a\u00f1adiendo como el magnetismo o un lugar super yupi (los que hayais jugado ya lo sabeis... y que m\u00fasica m\u00e1s pegadiza!!!), hace que haya alguna variaci\u00f3n al avanzar.\n\nDe duraci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bastante bien y cumple, y no se alarga m\u00e1s de la cuenta como suele pasar en estos juegos. Si quieres hacerlo todo si que puede alargarse un rato m\u00e1s pero no tiene tanto tampoco como para hacerse demasiado m\u00e1s largo.\n\nSonido genial y m\u00fasica chula con tema pegadizo incluido xD. En resumen, juego muy recomendado a los amantes de los plataforma o este tipo de juego y que os apetezca algo de humor desenfadado, sin mucha historia (que podr\u00eda haber tenido algo m\u00e1s la verdad).

All in all, good package for the price! \n\n7/10 stolen nudez", "timestamp_created": 1466717254, "timestamp_updated": 1466717254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23725522": {"recommendationid": "23725522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094425011", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 420, "last_played": 1466228999}, "language": "english", "review": "Should you get this game for the full price?

The worst part is the constantly forced, awful dialogue, that tries to be funny but ends up being cringey and making you hate the characters. The art style is its strongest point, but that's all the game really has to offer. \n\nAt $15, I just can't recommend this game.

Either you use a pair of sticks (Yes BOTH sticks) to move yourself (The Left Stick) and aim your guns (The Right Stick) which means you'll often be either not moving to avoid hits, or you'll be moving and not firing, or you use the keyboard and mouse to move/attack, which I haven't tried yet but it sounds about as logical as a rabbit ruling hell and losing his seat of power to bathing with a rubber duck.\n\nThe opening cutscene doesn't actually run properly, with audio issues galore and sounding like the teacher from the Charlie Brown movies trying to tell a story, while the visuals are static and chopping at best. My machine must not exceed the necessary minimums enough, but even then, there's no reason for it to have no way to go below 1024 x 720 while playing. And there are monsters who can kill you almost instantly, and you have to muddle through their taunting dialouge over and over again. Speaking of which, the respawn time for the monsters is about as long as it takes for them to disappear from the screen's view, so be prepared to kill the same three guys over and over again as you move four inches forward.\n\nNot only are the controls pretty bad for the gunplay, but there are sections that require you to use your circular blade to dig through the ground. THis would be fine if it weren't finicky at best, holding down the right trigger while shifting the stick around to dig can sometimes leave you in stupid positions or not breaking the blocks you want to, but then we get to the jumping. The jump button is a simple press/hold of A, but the height you'll hit is RANDOM. Sometimes you go high, sometimes you go low. BUt often times, you just go straight into spikes, into an enemy you don't want to touch, or under a falling block that kills you. Oh, and Spikes are instant death. For no reason other than to screw you over.\n\nAll in all, I didn't pay anything for this game, and I want my money back. Don't waste your time on this steaming turd.

This game is not good, and it is quite the example of false advertising. In fact, I'd rather go to Hell than be forced to play this game again. \n\nThis game appears to be targeted to the \"I'm 14, I play Five Nights at Freddy's and I'm so edgy and random lolz rawr XD\" crowd. Everything revolves around this motif. The protagonist is a cartoon skeleton rabbit that shoots his way through a Hell, flled with more cartoon animals. The artwork looks like doodles in a notebook, and the sound effects and music do not particularly fit with the theme and the concept. Listening to \"The Crunge\" or \"D'yer Mak'er\" on repeat for a few hours is a far more fitting soundtrack. At least the memebers of Led Zeppelin realized how ridculous these songs are, which maes them enjoyable. The game developers, however, lacked this self awareness. The unskippable and repititive dialogue (more on that in a moment) is filled with bad one liners and attempt to be funny. You know when an adult tries to be relatable and cool? This game does exactly that. In fact, I'm surprised that Hillary Clinton hasn't used it as part of her strategy to reach out to millenials (this is not a political post please don't attack me Valve mods).\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is marred by several serious flaws. The controls are incredibly awkward, and they somehow feel both stiff and slippery. It feels like someone coated the character in cold butter and threw him onto an ice skating rink. I know that WASD is not great for platformers, but it still is so strange. The rabbit has trouble dodging objects in mid air, which is something you need to be able to do well in order to advance in this game. He also seems to slide after you let go of the movement keys, which has gotten me killeed multiple times. \n\nI tried using a controller, as the game promised controller support, but guess what? IT DIDN\"T WORK. I even tried it with multiple controllers, so I am sure it is not a problem on my end. With a controller, I couldn't jump or shoot. These are the two things you need to be able to do in order to play the game. I tried remapping the buttons in the options, but it wouldn't let me. This false advertising irritates me, and I'm suprised at how many games keep doing it.\n\nSpeaking of options, the option menu is absolutely pitiful. There are two options from what I remember. These are very basic keyboard remapping (no controller for you, peasants) and the option to change the sound from stereo to mono. That's right, no opton for changing the graphics settings. The game runs at a constant 720p, and upscales to your resolution. It already looks strangely upscaled on my 1080p screen, so I'd hate to see it on a 1440p or 4K monitor.\n\nThe action in the game is very mediocre. You get to choose between a variety of weapons, such as a sawblade, a rocket launcher, grenades, and assault rifle, etc.. The only problem is, however, the game restricts weapons to specific enemies. This only raises the question: WHY EVEN HAVE WEAPON VARIETY IN THE FIRST PLACE?! It's a pitiful attempt at diversity and longevity that I cannot appreciate. The whole gimmick with the bosses is that once you defeat them, you get to play a minigame to watch a gory death animation. These come in two varieties. You get to mash a button, you you get to hit a button at just the right time. These animations are reallly just glorified quick-time events. The horse is dead far before this game stops beating it.\n\nThese issues are made even worse with the fact that there is no post hit invincibility. If this was just restricted to a certain game mode, I'd be fine with that. But, ths lack of protection makes the bad controls even worse. You can be bounced all around the map and quickly go from 250 to 0 in a matter of seconds. It is downright infuriating how cheap this game can be because of it.\n\nThe godawful cutscenes are another issue. I mentioned that they were repetitive and unskippable. I stopped paying attention because every dialogue feels the same. Ash is a teenage punk, and talks back to authority figure because he is so edgy. It gets old quick. Also, you can't skip them. You just have to mash the mouse in order to go through as quickly as possible. There isn't even voice acting. IT's just reading. I don't mind reading, but if I wanted to read, I would grab a book. Also if you die during a boss fight, which you most certainly will beause if the garbage controls. you will often be forced to go through the dialogue you just read again. This is so annoying, and I hate it when developers don't fix this issue. No one wants to read your stupid text bubbles again.\n\nOverall, the game tries to be something that it's not. It tires to be a cool, edgy game with a unique feeling and concept, but it falls flat on its face with boorish storytelling and incompetent implementation. In fact, it eerily reminds me of Shadow The Hedghog. Both games star male animal protagonists that shoot and kill their way through dark, gritty, yet cartoony settings. They each have notoriously bad controls and serious game design issues. To give it that extra touch of cringe, both were published by none other than SEGA. You'd they they'd learn after their first try at such a game. Overall, I give it a 4/10. Maybe I'm just being too critical. After all, it is only a SEGA game that I got for free.\n\nHowever, if you are one of those 14 year olds I was talking about...\n\n10/10 edgiest game I've ever played\n\nCRAWLING IN MY SKIN", "timestamp_created": 1464661654, "timestamp_updated": 1464661654, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472004592418670654", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23295510": {"recommendationid": "23295510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999337717", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1464630932}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell Yeah! is... complicated. There's a large cast of enemies with unique (often disturbing) designs, each with their own little tidbits about them and name, there's very few repeats and recolors amongst them. The game itself is energetic, chaotic, and every stage will usually add something new to play with. On top of that the game plays well. The issue is that there's a lot of components in place that MAKE a great game it's just the execution ultimately makes Hell Yeah! mediocre, but still memorable enough to garner some sort of affinity - either postive or negative.\n\nSo let's start with the design. Hell Yeah!'s plot is essentially \"compromising photos get out that undercut the ruthless and cruel nature of the Prince of Hell, Ash (which is you), 100 monsters saw it so 100 monsters (and the so-and-so who took those pictures) have to die, go get 'em tiger.\" As soon as you get into it, you'll notice how brightly colored and animated literally everything is. It's VERY difficult to pay attention to everything and Ash moves pretty quickly meaning you'll likely run into things. As nice as all the animated things are, the fact that the background is as alive as it is most of the time, it'll be difficult to spot the various traps and shots going your way. Meaning you'll die, a lot.\n\nAsh attacks mostly through use of his giant saw-wheel-jetpack which can drill and shoot. You won't really be drilling much unless to kill simple enemies who get too close and to drill through certain rock formations. As soon as you hit zone 2, drilling enemies is overall a bad idea and is replaced by shooting them. Soon after that you realize that with the proper upgrades, you can have your guns drill much more effeciently for you (hint: buy the shotgun and missile upgrades, you'll rarely need the gun later in the game) meaning that drilling isn't that great. Same thing for a dash upgrade which requires you to stand completely still to charge before going forward a rather pitiful distance. Great for drilling certain structures but ultimately very niche and you won't be using it much because - again - missiles and missile type weapons are better for drilling. Finally, certain enemies can only be shot and killed from certain angles so you might be jumping and shooting a lot, which is hard given that you have to aim with the right stick (if you used a controller like I did, as the game recommends) and jump with the A button. Which is really awkward. Meaning you'll die, a lot.\n\nFinally, the game is cluttered with somewhat invisible checkpoints at moments where the game decides it's important to save your progress. If you die, you lose everything you got from before you activated that checkpoint. Typically there's a checkpoint after killing one of the many monsters and through important stretches. But these are numerous enough to be useless at certain points and agrivating when they don't come up after particularly difficult stretches of a level (I'm looking at you underwater zone 3). So if you go through a long maze-like area, grab a lot of money which you need for upgrades and better weaponry, and then get killed by a boss or by the level itself and have to grab it again. Even better, the game will record how much health you had at the checkpoint, meaning that you can respawn in a difficult area only to be severely handicapped until you find a health station somewhere, often much too far away. As if to remedy this there are items you can purchase that will temporarily aid you and boost your survivability until death but these are even RARER so they're never really useful even when you find one of the few shops. Killing a monster also requires beating a short mini-game each and every time, some are difficult some aren't, and they all increase in difficulty as time goes on. There's enough variation that they aren't annoying features, but what is an annoying feature is that failing them recovers some of the monster's HP and takes away a scaled chunk of yours, depending on how far into the game you are. Meaning that you'll die- you catch my point yet?\n\nMost of this review has been negative, but I don't want to take away the fact that I am recommending this game because despite these flaws it's still very entertaining and unique. Well, as long as you can tolerate the emo cute theme, I liked it so I was fine with it. There's a lot in here that makes it feel bloated, but still not to the point that undermines what this game does effectively. Exploration is encouraged and fun, yet restricted from a linear path that you HAVE to take. There's a little management game that you can play with defeated monsters in the background, but the rewards are pretty much worthless and there's very little interactive elements to it. Weapons are unique with their own abilities, but are typically beaten out by its upgrade or weapons you can buy from the shop. Levels and stages are unique so you can't guess what'll come next, but there's no real feeling of progression as every level is disconected. Defeating monsters is cathartic and a large majority of them are absolutely horrifying and wonderful, you can see the love put into them, but the minigames make some more annoying than difficult and pad out every fight.\n\nReally every thing this game does right is hindered by another element. But it still tried to do these things and they almost worked, it's really really close. To me that's what matters and that's why I recommend it.

It tries to tell a lot of jokes, and will often spend time relishing in it's own punch lines, but for something that wants to be edgy and over-the-top I mostly just found it really boring.  The humor is akin to a second-rate Saturday morning cartoon.  If that's your thing, more power to you.\n\nFor me it was just a mediocre platformer that never really got me excited. It's basically a Metroid-vania game where all the upgrades systems feel roughly identical and neither the platforming or the combat get fleshed out enough to allow for skillful play.  Most of the deaths I got felt very cheap due to the camera being too zoomed in on the character (environmental awareness is crucial for a good platformer).  It's very frustrating to lose a lot of your health to some cheap enemy placement and have to backtrack past your last checkpoint to an earlier health station.  Bleh!\n\nThey also include some Wario-ware style mini-games when finishing a boss and the game just doesn't have the comedic timing or punch to make those as spectacular as the developers probably intended.  Mostly it just adds to the frustration when you lose your last bit of health to their \"LULZ, SO RANDOM\" style finishers and have to restart the same friggin' checkpoint again.\n\nNot technically poor or especially bad, just doesn't stand out as a platformer you should be spending your money on.", "timestamp_created": 1464412648, "timestamp_updated": 1464412648, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494773536920547485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23217414": {"recommendationid": "23217414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255430692", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 161, "last_played": 1495760892}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a 2D platformer about a devil rabbit named Ash, who is literally the prince of Hell.

No, i'm being serious. The photos already have 100 views, so Ash decides to go to kill all 100 Monsters that may or may not have viewed them.\n\nThe controls are very simple, it's a Metroidvania style thing. At the start of the game, you get a cool saw-jetpack thingy and are able to jump higher and drill through walls and kill enemies. You'll eventually get cool stuff like guns and missiles! I prefer you use a controller, preferrably the Xbox One controller, because it's a bit better than using a keyboard and mouse.\n\nYou kill a monster by, yes, depleting it's energy. When you deplete the bar, you enter a Wario-Ware style minigame that's really fun to play. You can fail sometimes, y'now. Your health is in the form of energy.

I enjoyed my time immensly back then and felt like diving in again in this colorfull Metroidvania adventure about the bunny Prince of Hell Ash and his quest to destroy 100 monsters who saw emberassing photos of him. The plot is so unbelieveably simple and doesn't take itself seriously at all, which adds to the visuals aswell.\n\nThis time i also enjoyed my time with Hell Yeah, but not quite as much as when i used to back then 4 years ago when the game first released. The gameplay is smooth as butter, the gunplay is great and it feels great to explore the lands and be on the hunt for the next monster. Also the soundtrack is still really great, fits the levels fantastically and that one song in the Cute World is still stuck in my head because how catchy (yes i know it's cheesy as hell) it is.\n\nHowever, there were two things that bugged me a little while playing the game and made me notice that the game feels a bit 'old' even if it just came out not to long ago. First of were the graphics, were it felt a bit...odd to me. Some of the animations are a bit too cheap, downright 2 frames animations and looked quite laughable at times (especially the Guitar killing thing where the hands stretch the Monster, that looked really awful). Otherwise you have some nicely drawn, whacky cartoony characters which are with a few exception all pretty well drawn. I generally like Ash's design alot.\n\nSpeaking off the finishers, these happen every time you kill one of the 100 Monsters you need to hunt down. Allthough there are many finishers with unique animations and how you perform them, they repeat themselfs  often and they get old rather quickly, with no option to skip. This can be pretty tiresome watching the same thing over and over again with no chance whatsoever. Most of these finishers are references to some pop culture media, which brings me to my next big point, the humor.\n\nThe humor is a mix of basic \"lol gory and butts and cursing\" and pop culture references. It really is nothing big, and even though it made me laugh alot back in the day, it didn't even really made me chuckle once on my new playthrough. It's just a shame because i thought the games humor would hold up a bit better after just 4 years of age. Luckily the gameplay and overworld art make up for it.\n\nStill, i find Hell Yeah! a pleasurable experience and find it sad that the developers, Akedo Studio, disbanded in 2013, which also kills the hope for a sequel.\n\nAs for a recommendation, the game is pretty short and rather easy. After completion there is not much to do really, the unlockables are not worth it, the missions are lame and \"The Island\" is trash.

There are some cosmetic gifts you can try to find and some simple side missions but they're not very rewarding themselves.\n\nPlaying with both a KB+M and a controller are both doable. During some segments though it's far more ideal to use the mouse for the faster aiming since for some reason using the right analog stick for these particular sections is incredibly slow whilst the mouse is as fast as you move it.\n\nThis game likes to emphasize about its loads of violence & gore but it's hard to take seriously since the entire game's animations look like something I'd see in a mobile game. With its groan-inducing humor and cartoony artstyle though I guess it shouldn't entirely be taken so.\n\nThe main goal throughout the game is just to platform your way through extremely standard maps to find and kill special monsters so you can unlock doors where you're to platform and kill more monsters so you can unlock more doors to do the same thing and eventually fight a boss, which itself is a part of the special monster pool. The special monsters are basically the keys to unlock doors when they're dead and for most of them it's an incredibly tedious process since the method for taking them down are usually either shoot them down or grind them down with your sawblade. Afterwards, as their HP reaches 0, you have to go through this Warioware-like minigame each time. If you fail the minigame you take loads of damage and they remain alive so you'd have to hit 'em a small bit [i]again[/i] to get their HP down enough and do the minigame [i]again[/i] where upon actual victory, you'll be treated to an unskippable slideshow-esque Adobe-Flash-like cutscene of a kill. Because there are loads of these special monsters in the game you'll encounter the same minigame and cutscene again and again, so even if you're a fan of the eye-rolling humor in the game they'll lose their appeal. As I got bored of seeing the minigame's reused cutscenes I tried alt+tabbing to another window for a bit and apparently it pauses the entire game sort of so the cutscene itself would just hang there until I went back to the game where it'd finally continue the little slideshow.\nWhile much of these monsters are tedious to kill there are quite a few that get pretty clever in terms of finding the method of killing special monsters but these mostly appear at the later half of the game. At these times the game turns into a puzzle platformer sort of.\n\nNearly all weapons have unlimited ammo as they constantly recharge themselves. I never found myself using all of them since I didn't particularly need more than but a few. \nIf you're using a controller, trying to use the sawblade and a gun can get confusing. By default you press RT to drill with the sawblade but to shoot your guns you have to aim with the right analog stick and then press RT. I found myself drilling accidentally when I should shoot too many times.\nFor some wad of a reason anything that's even mostly off-screen is invincible. You can shoot in their direction but if you can't see them you can't hurt them no matter how big of a target they are. This becomes a serious problem against enemies that require you to move a lot to evade anything that'd hurt you. It's as if your fired projectiles disappear from the game as soon as they leave the screen.\n\nCheckpoints aren't the best and are made a little worse plenty of times when they're right before a cutscene of sorts where characters speak. Each time you die at these times you'll have to go through the cutscene over and over again. You can't skip these dialogue things entirely so all you can do is mash NEXT until it's all over each time in case you'd rather not go through all that again, and even that's still slow.\n\nIt's a simple game overall with humor for the lowest common denominator but I definitely don't think it's $15 worth for little content.", "timestamp_created": 1463537746, "timestamp_updated": 1463831512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23023438": {"recommendationid": "23023438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189441727", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1515680346}, "language": "english", "review": "Good f*cking game!\nMore play this game ,more you want play it!", "timestamp_created": 1463417726, "timestamp_updated": 1463417726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "23018677": {"recommendationid": "23018677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249171378", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1463399721}, "language": "english", "review": "11/9\n\nRemoving Kebab with axe-chainsaw-missile-pulse-energetic-rifle.

The only reasonable reaction \u2014 of course \u2014 is to kill everyone who has seen those embarrassing pictures.\nDeveloper Arkedo sets Hell Yeah's morbid humourous tone from the very start of the game. What follows is a surprisingly good 2D platformer.\n\nOn his journey to kill every single one of the 100 monsters fallen in disgrace, our hero rabbit visits various areas of hell, ranging from a casino to space. The game is packed with comic like brutality; exploding enemies, blood fountains and grotesque finishing moves.\nOn first sight, Hell Yeah seems like one of those gag games, that aim to be taken with a pinch of salt and don't really try to be good games at core. I'm talking about the likes of Br\u00fctal Legend or Goat Simulator; games that wouldn't be enjoyable, if their mechanics were stripped off their context. But after finishing Hell Yeah, I feel like I should give up on that prejudice towards gag games.\n\nHell Yeah takes typical platformer mechanics, like wall jumps, moving platforms and Donkey Kong Countryesque cannons, and combines them with guns, which can aim in 360 degrees, and a buzz saw. That core mechanic itself is functional \u2014 precise jumps were a bit tricky though, because there's next to no acceleration and only one movement speed (the directional input is binary and there is no run button).\n\nSteady variety is what makes the game fun in the end. You can play on gambling machines in the casino. There's a part where you operate a submarine and you can shoot rainbows, that bounce off of walls, somewhere else.\nFinishing moves are a source of variety too. The monsters don't have individual moves, but more than 25 different finishers are included in the game. They are occasionally really creative and particularly show of the games polished visuals. All of them start with a short quick-time-event or mini game, making them clearly more interesting than most games finishing moves, but bottom line, they still get old after you see the same animation the third time.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I was positively surprised how much bang I got for the time invested. Every mechanic and idea is used for a short amount of time and then dropped for something entirely new. Take the rainbow gun I mentioned earlier. You get the gun play three or four different situations with it \u2014 which all require the gimmick, that shots bounce off walls \u2014 and then you never see it again.\nOn the other hand, the short innovation cycle leaves no room for any of the mechanics to grow complex, which again, fits the far from serious visual and narrative style of Hell Yeah.\nIt's a cool game. It cracks the jokes, shows off some crazy ideas and ends before it gets repetitiv. Play this with a friend and a few bottles of beer and I bet you have on or two great evenings.\n\nRead more of my reviews at:\ntheguygaming.com", "timestamp_created": 1462084831, "timestamp_updated": 1462084831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22727288": {"recommendationid": "22727288", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980319540", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 971, "last_played": 1639323489}, "language": "spanish", "review": "DIVERTIDO Y ENTRETENIDO.........", "timestamp_created": 1462037910, "timestamp_updated": 1462037910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22691782": {"recommendationid": "22691782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975957833", "num_games_owned": 3244, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 552, "last_played": 1461865017}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Del lat.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit you play as the prince of hell, who was photographed secretly by paparazzi while bathing, now you go on a quest to find all 100 monsters in hell who have seen your nudes and exact revenge.  Gameplay wise I feel like it sits in a place in between platformer and twin stick shooter.\n\n There are a variety of weapons and tools to use in your quest including but not limited to, Rocket launchers, mini guns, grenade launchers, giant buzsaws, shotguns, and lazers. After defeating each monster to finish it off you are brought into a variety of WarioWare type minigames to get that final hit. if you fail the boss heals a little and you have to do it again. While not complex the finishers were pretty fun, in my opinion.  \n\nThe game has a lot of stuff in it to do, you've got customizations to collect, weapons to purchase, and even an island where you keep your monster friends who do jobs for you (slave labor).

No.  Not really.  Its a fun little game with a lot of personallity, but from my own experience, the game is frustrating in the controls department.  This game is not good for a platformer, which you have to do a lot as you get farther into it.  The controls just aren't made for platforming, its really slippery, not to mention the jumping isn't even jumping.  Its hard for me to describe.  The \"jump\" is this weird jetpack-like thing, except you go from 0 to 60 in less then a second, and is very hard to be percise with.  The combat is very...  Okay, nothing revolutionary, but not bad at all.\n\nThats just when you get you're primary way of dealing with enemies.  There is a level which is mostly on foot, during which you rarely have any weapons to deal with threats.  You have a double jump and a wall jump while on foot.  Double jump, good, wall jump, bad.  Wall jumping in a game like Megaman X (a very good SNES game) is good.  However the wall jumping in this game is automatic as long as you hold the jump button against a wall.  It makes the whole thing frustrating.  I just wanted to rapidly mash the jump button like in Megaman X.\n\nSo, gameplay-wise I think it works decently, just lackluster and frustrating from time to time.  The biggest issue I've had with this game is crashes.  Everytime I play this game it crashes.  Its happens when I enter or exit boss doors, and when I enter new levels.  Thats the only bug I've encountered during my time with this game.  Overall, its a decent game, but with the constant crashes I cannot recommend it.\n\nEdit: Added the second paragraph about the on foot controls.", "timestamp_created": 1460289252, "timestamp_updated": 1460289836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22335034": {"recommendationid": "22335034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099925944", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 140, "last_played": 1460284538}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell yeah !\nThis is the best game ever !", "timestamp_created": 1460278426, "timestamp_updated": 1460278426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517204344272613525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22330649": {"recommendationid": "22330649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048707278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 368, "last_played": 1461019178}, "language": "english", "review": "Not the most challenging but pretty fun although some what dull", "timestamp_created": 1460254126, "timestamp_updated": 1460254126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22325456": {"recommendationid": "22325456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131473480", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 222, "last_played": 1460238621}, "language": "english", "review": "One of best games I've ever played in my lufe, Recomended", "timestamp_created": 1460230924, "timestamp_updated": 1460230924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "22324526": {"recommendationid": "22324526", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993763184", "num_games_owned": 1218, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 31, "last_played": 1672046176}, "language": "english", "review": "Just started playing this game, so I don't have a thorough review.

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit[/b] is a zany comedy action-platformer where you go on a bloody rampage as a skeleton bunny, fighting to regain your throne as prince of Hell while armed with drill (more like a ring blade) and a huge variety of improbably heavy weapons. I won't go into details because humour constitutes the game's greatest value but [b]Hell Yeah![/b] will keep you amused for a couple of hours, or for about 25 to 30% of its overall content. It's just the sort of product that makes me apprehensive of \"comedy\" games; past the initial chuckle you'll find that there's very little in the way of content.\n\nStill, I'm giving [b]Hell Yeah![/b] a Thumbs Up because although I was apprehensive of its many questionable design decisions, I've found nothing too offensive during play and the shock humour DID succeed in making me laugh. Design decisions such as mapping jump to a face button, aiming to the right stick and firing the right trigger; it [i]seems[/i] cumbersome to do everything at once but there is enough leeway preventing you from getting frustrated. Or like holding jump for a floaty \"jetpack\"-like super jump. You dread the moment where you'll have to \"float\" just underneath a set of ceiling spikes but such a situation never occurs.\n\nThere's A LOT of material to go through so you're certain to get your money's worth, except that it does get repetitive after a while. [b]Hell Yeah![/b] makes an earnest attempt at providing as much monster variety as possible but inevitably, monster patterns and executions loop around and the game turns into a slog. You gain about a dozen different weapons but little to no difference in strategy. There's even extra value in the form of post-story extra missions; but they usually involve [i]platformer racing[/i] or killing a certain amount of enemies within a time limit.

So let\u2019s start off with the story, it\u2019s silly and fantastical to the nth degree, I loved it. It\u2019s so off the wall zany that I had a blast with it and the crazy characters both friend and foe. The many worlds of hell are super varied and imaginative from the neon night club to psychedelic dream world I loved every one of them.\n\nOne particularly favourite part of mine was the huge amount of fatalities there were when taking down the 100 individually created enemies. They are all unique and die in a huge variety of bloody messy cartoonish ways. The vast arsenal of pure destructive weaponry was also another highlight, not feeling the magnum switch out for the flame thrower or one of a half dozen missile launchers, my favourite is the shotgun a must buy when you play.\n\nNot everything is great though, the controls are very tricky to master and even when you get the hang of them they still mess you up from time to time. The DLC missions on a keyboard or almost impossible and took me a few frustrated hours to complete. The in game dialogue is also much more miss than hit with no laughs at all from me the whole play through. The ingame options are also pretty much non-existent with no audio options or graphic changes of any type present.\n\nThat being said this game is a lot of fun and I would recommend giving it a go for a few hours of entertainment. If this is on sale pick it up and try not to think too hard as you splatter demons on mass on your one bunny crusade through hell.\nOne final note, I know I said it before but play with a gamepad, the keyboard is not good and will lead to a lot of frustration with the precision platforming in some sections and virtual missions.\n\nHave fun \u02d0MMForFun\u02d0\n", "timestamp_created": 1458180470, "timestamp_updated": 1458180470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21878972": {"recommendationid": "21878972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118273560", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 201, "last_played": 1643486943}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it, it takes hats from tf2, adult humor, and some nice graphics and throws them all in a  blender to make a smoothie that tastes amazing.

You play the rabbit Ash, the Prince of Darkness. Your mission is to find 100 zany monsters in the depth of Hell to recover incriminating pictures of yourself. The story is completely bizarre and thematically fits the game well. \nThe whole thing plays like a comic book come to life and the art is the main selling feature by far. Cartoonish violence and gore abound as you travel different parts of Hell, each weirder than the next. It works well.\n\nUnfortunately Hell Yeah! suffers a number of suicidal gameplay choices that kill the fun, especially as you progress into the game. Tragically most of these are extremely easy to fix if the developers had the inclination to do so.[olist]\n[*] Platforming in this game simply doesn't feel right. it feels incredibly 'floaty', as if the force of gravity changes throughout your jump. Imagine jumping against a low ceiling. Instead of your character immediately falling upon contacting the roof, it just hangs in the air and lands at the same time it would have if jumping in open air. This can lead to imprecision and frustrating deaths.[*] For a game that requires a lot of shooting, the inability to jump, shoot, and aim easily on a controller is utterly unforgivable. Here are the key binds: R trigger shoots, A jumps, and R-stick aims. Just try it right now, grab your controller and try jumping with A and aiming at something with the R stick. Your thumb effectively needs to use the R stick and push A at the same time. The easiest way around this is to simply allow the player to rebind jump to one of the shoulder buttons, but [i]the game does not allow any rebinds of controller keys.[/i] I had to play the game half with a controller for platforming sections, and half the game with a keyboard for combat. No reason this should be the case.[*] As mentioned, you have to kill 100 unique monsters throughout the game. While these are a highlight, they all must be finished off Mortal Kombat style. After depleting its health bar the old fashioned way, a Wario-ware style minigame pops up that you [i]must[/i] win. Fail, and the monster revives [i]and[/i] you take damage. While the finishers add to the overall game, the need for what is a complicated and even punishing QTE is not. There are some mini-games that are far harder than the monsters themselves (looking at you Hide and Seek).\n[/olist]\n\nI have other less important criticisms. New weapons aren't unique enough, difficulty progression isn't really there with regards to combat, and an entire side-game called Monster Island feels wholly unnecessary.

I don't remember buying it. \nThat said, this is BY FAR the best 2D platformer I have played in over 10 years.\nIf you are reading this review, that means you have at least seen the art style, and you are interested.\nIf you are interested, you will definitely not regret purchasing it.\n\nThis is just pure platforming fun. It is everything great about the classics, with modern visuals, and a bit of a more mature theme for those of us who grew up playing the classics. There is a very minimal tutorial that actually sort of pokes fun at people needing a tutorial, or maybe at games these days thinking people need a tutorial for everything. The levels are well designed, and there are some tricks to learn to overcome challenges. The bosses are fun, and bring a sense of nostalgia as well, having faced similar boss mechanics is so many classic platformers.\n\nI don't know what some of these people are complaining about with this game. I see really nothing wrong with it at all. If I had to nit-pick some fault, I would have to say it can sometimes be annoying trying to stop on a dime, the character tends to want to walk an extra step or two when you stop. The best way I have found to couter that is to turn backwards and tap the reverse direction. You could also stop early and let him go, but I find that reversing works best for me. As for input, keyboard and mouse works best for certain situations that require you to aim and shoot while jumping across platforms, but the xbox controller works well enough too. I typically use the xbox controller and never really have a complaint. Only once I got a little frustrated with a boss fight, it was hard shooting while dodging his attacks, so I switched to keyboard and mouse, and beat him first try that way.

Now you can!  This is the strangest tale about a bunny in Hell since Matt Groening started drawing.  \n\nHell Yeah! is a platformer (shooting type), which feels like a slight throwback to Sonic The Hedgehog in areas (especially a casino level).  I say slight because the similarities are superficial.  As a platformer, it is not the best, and far from the worst.  The design is good enough to be a fun game. \n\nWhere the game really shines, though, is the creativity of the design, but that is not without criticism.  You will quickly forget that you are in Hell, and there is no logic to the levels or encounters.  It's as though the designers put whatever was on the top of their heads and said \"that's cool, do that\".  It gives the design a random feel, overall.  I don't say that as a bad thing, but the Hell theme gets lost in the craziness of it all.  Awkward ideas like healing from blood showers become commonplace very quickly.  \n\nThe game has a major overreliance on unlocks and minigames.  Fighting a monster opens a Mortal-Kombat-esque finishing movie, which is done by playing a minigame before performing the fatality.  These are very simple games that are extremely easy, often parodies of other games like Guitar Hero, but they are not always clearly explained and have very short timers.  There are sections of the game which require specific costumes to pass, which can be confusing when there are between 100-200 masks to go through.  There are sections of the game where gameplay changes entirely, with different vehicles or losing your wheel, these are practically minigames in themselves.  None of which are fully realized enough to be a full game.  \n\nThe major sin of a bad platformer, of course, is poor controls.  Tight controls are what separates great games from bad ones.  This game has almost good controls, but the issues that it does have make the game frustrating, and are very apparent in the side-missions.  You continue to move after you stop moving sometimes, rolling off of ledges or into obstacles too easily.  The jetpack isn't always reliable, though when it works it is useful.  The worst problem is with getting hit.  Most classic platformers had the sense to give a player slight immunity after getting hit, not for easy playing but because the consequences for getting hit can be catastrophic.  This game sucks at that, and is a good example of why games like Mario were made like they were.  A single hit throws you back without control, where you can immediately get hit again and start bouncing around like a pinball with limited movement.  When this happens, you can still move, but the results can be unpredictable.  When one-hit-kill osbstacles are present, the game just becomes frustrating.  \n\nThere are a variety of weapons and cosmetic unlocks for the game, which are accessed as rewards, or through the in-game shop (not real money, fortunately).  The guns are interesting, but you can pick one you like and use it for most of the game, there is not much reason to switch weapons around.  The shop quickly becomes irrelevant when you get enough money, which is plentiful, and you buy out the store.  At that point, you still collect money, but why bother?\n\nFor all of its faults, though, it is a fun platformer and an easy game to get 100% achievements on.  Not awfully difficult, and not awful.  It certainly is worth it just for the craziness of it.\n\nYou're a fancy bunny.  Together we're happy.  You will be my honey.  We'll never be lonely.

Lo jugu\u00e9 con teclado y responde genial, as\u00ed que imagino que con control ha de ser igual o mejor.\n\nPuntos negativos: No hay muchos. El m\u00e1s claro para m\u00ed es el hecho de tener tantos sombreros para desbloquear, que nunca se terminan. Me faltaron, por lo menos, 30 sombreros.\n\n\nEs un buen juego que hace tiempo quer\u00eda probar y Sega me di\u00f3 la oportunidad. Lo recomiendo. Y mucho. Tal vez no por el precio que figura en Steam, pero con alg\u00fan descuento o de alg\u00fan bundle, vale la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1456460925, "timestamp_updated": 1456460925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510494530200958252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "21467800": {"recommendationid": "21467800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139252755", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 375, "last_played": 1585740309}, "language": "english", "review": "Tired with all these games trying too hard to be dark serious gritty philosophical?

is a game about the prince of hell, trying to discover who took a picture of him playing with a rubber ducky while taking a bath. The picture is then sent out and 100 monsters have seen it. Your goal is simple. Figure out who took your pictures, and make your minions pay. You do this by jumping around and slaughtering said minions of hell using both your giant wheel of death, and a wide range of weapons, like Bazookas, Miniguns, and Grenades.\n\nHell Yeah! is a game full of charm, and every main monster you slaughter is greeted with a fun mini-game that upon completion gives you an insanely well crafted animation of you destroying the monster, ranging from the Invaders shooting rainbows at it, to a satellite shooting a laser down from space to obliterate the creature. A lot of the charm also comes from the great writing, which also teases some of the cliches that come with a platformer, as well as the fact that the game never takes itself seriously.\n\nThe level designs all feel varied, and the game also introduces tons of little mechanics that give you a sense of variety beyond just jumping and running, such as jumping into a cannon to shoot yourself around the level. The minions you kill are also varied in style and attack. Some enemies will require you to just go up and attack, taking them out quickly and efficiently. Some may require you to solve a small puzzle or discover some element of the stage that can interact with them, possibly harming them in the process. Through it all, fighting these enemies never feels like a chore due to the large amount of killing animations, and varied ways the game requires these enemies to be taken out.\n\nThe game also features several bosses, while the bosses so far have hearkened back to a normal playing style, they don't feel boring or out of place. They're all varied in mechanics and provide more humor as the main character and the boss banter a little before combat is initiated.\n\nHell Yeah! is a well crafted metroidvania style action-adventure platformer filled to the brim with great humor, and comical gore that's perfect for anyone. The achievements are also easy and great for any Achievement Hunter (or player) who wants a break from a serious game to net a quick 100%\n\nIf I had anything negative to say about the game, it would be about its length. It only took me 8 hours to beat and collect all of the achievements. The length of the game is slightly alleviated by having hats and wheel skins for you to collect, as well as the Virtual Rabbits DLC which is supposed to provide a few more hours of entertainment; however, these don't completely shift the weight off the games length, but it does at least provide some replayability.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1456334692,

Ash, the Prince of Hell, definitely wants to protect his image. The game packs plenty of jokes and copious amounts of blood. It's also built like a metroidvania, but at the same time, doesn't feel like one.\n\nAlso, there are a number of problems with this game that interfere heavily with the fun experience of slaying and collecting monsters. Let's start with those problems first before going into what the game does right.\n\n[b]The Issues[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The game resolution seems to be 720p and is upscaled to any higher resolutions. This gives it a blurry look which is unpleasant. I was able to look past it because the gameplay kept me engaged until the other problems revealed their final form.\n[*]There is a slight momentum to Ash's movement which causes the game to feel clumsy. This can result in unintended falls if landing on the edge of a platform or slipping since angled surfaces cause Ash to automatically slide down. \n[*]The wall jump in this game is Hold A and bounce off the walls type of deal. This kind of button assignment creates a frustrating number of incidents that result in bouncing backwards when you're just trying to platform normally with the double jump where if you hold A for each jump, you gain more height.\n[*]There are some trial and error sections and blind jumps with the latter being rare. \n[*]When you die, any conversations or camera pan movements that highlight an area of the map are reset and play again. And again. With each and every death. This is one of the most annoying things about the game.\n[*]The checkpoints are not the greatest.\n[*]Monster slaying minigames can kill you if you're not quick enough to figure out the gimmick. Most of them are ok. Others are annoying.\n[*]Very barebones options menu.\n[*]I didn't like the sections where weapons are taken away as much, especially since you lose the rocket (wheel) jump and have to deal with the wall jump.\n[*]Aiming can be difficult and when jumping around at the same time.\n[*]You don't explore for hidden items. It's mostly a finding cash type of deal to spend in shops.\n[/list]\n\nHell Yeah! has good points too. I liked the silly customization. The humor seemed fine to me. I liked the monster descriptions. Drilling through things felt pretty good. The visual style looks good. Some of the monster slaying mini-games are fun or over-the-top (some of them are repeated). It has a weird management meta-game. Finally, the action portion seemed just fine and the weapon variety is there to support it.\n\nI can only recommend this game to people that have more patience than me for trial and error.

The game is silly but not in a bad way at all. The protaganist is an unlikely \"hero\" set out to exact revenge on his enemies who have publicly embarrassed him due to his love for \"Duckies\". The levels are crisp and detailed. The controls are tight and easy and simple to learn. The objective is to detroy all the monsters in a single level to open up the last door to the boss before moving on to the next area. The game is not serious at all and it is obvious from the short introduction during a new game and it finds several ways to make you crack a smile along the way. The only downside is the length of the game which is purely based on your level of skill with platforming. Players who are familiar with the game will find themselves having a good laugh and breezing through under 10 hours or so and others may find it a bit harder to purchase every unlockable and find every secret.\n\nIt may not be the blockbuster title you're looking for but this is definitely a game you should grab if you see it on sale!

S\u00f3lo intento valorarlo objetivamente)\n\nCosas que s\u00ed me han gustado:\n- Los di\u00e1logos son verdadero oro, 10/10. La traducci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n magn\u00edfica, de las pocas ocasiones que no me he arrepentido de jugar en espa\u00f1ol.\n- El estilo art\u00edstico y los dise\u00f1os (especialmente el de Ash) son buen\u00edsimos.\n- El gancho inicial es alucinante, los primeros minutos te agarran y no te sueltan. Primera impresi\u00f3n brutal.\n\nCosas que no me han gustado:\n- Se llega a hacer algo repetitivo y parece que pusieron tantos enemigos s\u00f3lo para hacer que el juego durase m\u00e1s (las horas que un juego te dura no son indicativo de calidad!!!). Esta impresi\u00f3n la recibo especialmente cuando los minijuegos empiezan a repetirse continuamente, y los dise\u00f1os de los enemigos van cada vez a peor.\n- Al final terminas tambi\u00e9n con demasiadas armas de las cuales usar\u00e1s 2 o 3, ya que la inmensa mayor\u00eda son mejoras de las que ya ten\u00edas, y hace que cambiar de arma sea un incordio, incluso usando los n\u00fameros del teclado.\n- Las zonas parecen bastante inconexas y si no fuera por los indicadores de objetivo no sabr\u00eda qu\u00e9 hacer. Los escenarios son laber\u00ednticos y en ocasiones si no usas el mapa es bastante f\u00e1cil perderse, ya que hay muy pocos puntos de referencia.\n- Las mec\u00e1nicas del jugador (me refiero a serrar y disparar) no me dieron la impresi\u00f3n de que encajaran entre s\u00ed, y muchas veces de hecho parece que se olviden de que tienes la sierra porque casi todos los enemigos o son inmunes o es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil simplemente dispararles. Ocasionalmente aparece alg\u00fan enemigo con el que s\u00ed que debes usar la sierra, pero son la excepci\u00f3n, y teniendo en cuenta que la sierra da bastante la impresi\u00f3n de ser el arma principal, no estoy seguro de que deba ser as\u00ed.\n- El argumento es bastante meh, no esperaba nada y a\u00fan as\u00ed acab\u00e9 decepcionado. El final ni siquiera me dio sensaci\u00f3n de clausura.\n- La isla al final no sirve para mucho.\n- La m\u00fasica encaja pero no destaca demasiado.\n\nIgualmente est\u00e1 guay, me arrepiento de no

It's such a shame that such a good art style got attached to such a crap game.\n\nHere's how the game plays out: awkwardly platform your way through some beautful level, with gorgeous animation, collecting coins, and find an enemy. Wear down his healthbar with your generic platformer gun of choice (such thrilling choices as, rockets, or machinegun, or flamethrower) When his HP hits zero, play an unassociated warioware microgame (Click on the shark not the missiles lol im so random guys) and watch a tragically poorly designed XTREEEEME deathblow play out, that you cannot interact with. (in this case fire hundreds of missiles until your enemy explodes into copy pasted giblets). Then the game incredibly slowly scrolls to the door that killing that enemy opened, (which can be multiple screens away) shows it opening, then slowly scrolls back. Repeat until you find a boss. Watch the boss throw projectiles at you while you wait for your gun ammo to regenrate. Kill the boss. Microgame. Thats it. \n\nThere's a facebook like subgame of assigning enemies you kill to \"Toil away in the HP mines\", and a shop that you can spend currency on to upgrade your weapons in a linear \"make shoot harder.. durrr\" way. The entire game falls back on it's \"extreeeeme and edgy\" personality, even the damn \"quest\" dialog does it. (Which by the way, has such great quests as \"Kill Kill Kill Kill\": Kill an enemy to unlock a door)  \n\nIf this kind of irreverance sounds fun to you, go for it; Besides the great art, that's all this game is.

The graphics are all super saturated and vibrant and you never know what to focus on, and the level layouts are that unsatisfying, Jazz Jackrabbit-esque platformer layout where you just kind of meander around a stage until it's over instead of progressing in a meaningful path. The controls are insanely floaty, like uncomfortably so, and the game's got no gamefeel to speak of. There's no impact from any of your attacks or jumps or anything, it just all feels weightless and weak. The music also just kind of drones on; it's white noise at worst, tiredvideogamemusic.mp3 at best.\n\nThat being said, some of the art assets are really nice looking. The HD sprites are appealing and some of the character designs are decent.

If you find a metaphor in Hell Yeah's relentless assault on your eyes and sanity, it's only because it's about to get dropkicked by an angry demon rabbit riding a giant spinning death blade with a jetpack on the back.\n\nThis is one of those games where the design process didn't involve whiteboards and long discussions, but some chemist's secret stash being ground up and dripped into the artists' eyeballs. You're Ash, disgraced rabbit prince of Hell, on a quest to kill 100 wacky monsters who saw paparazzi photos of you playing with a rubber duckie in the bath. That's as sane as Hell Yeah! ever gets. It's a game where firing shark missiles is all in a day's work.\n\n Hell Yeah review Hell Yeah's drillable rocks look delicious. You'd eat that at the funfair.\nGetting to your enemies is relatively standard platform fare, with the twist that you can often drill through obstacles, boost jump around the place, and acquire different weapons. Actually killing your foes, however, involves playing Warioware-style microgames such as stealing honey from a suspicious bee to unleash an appropriate fatality move, which might be having a dinosaur bite their head off for you.\n\nIt's the chaos of Earthworm Jim in the levels of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, with a little Ren and Stimpy/Invader Zim (delete according to age) thrown in for good measure. Gags and minigames repeat more than they should, but still survive the repetition of gags and minigames repeating more than they should, which both gags and minigames do.\n\nThe action itself, while enjoyable, soon lets things down. While Hell Yeah! is a fantastic looking game, it's one that paid more attention to looking good than playing great. There's so much going on most of the time that it's often hard to take in and get a proper read on the levels and what's going to hurt if you run straight into it.\n\nMore routinely irritating are the controls, where double-jumps, skids and simply being knocked back by enemies will often frustrate you. You want an Xbox 360 controller for this one. You could play it with a keyboard, but only in the same sense that technically you could fly if you flapped your arms hard enough. Either way, prepare for unhelpful checkpoints, and the irritations of repeated cutscenes and similar hold-ups soon being promoted to fully-fledged annoyances. They take the shine off the chaos rather than the fun out of it, however, and you soon return to the forward momentum Hell Yeah! needs.\n\nThe game's obvious enthusiasm carries it over these bumps in the road, and if you can forgive, you can easily forget in the race for the next bit of insanity. Hell Yeah! is no platforming classic, but it's cheap enough to be worth a punt if you like the idea of its craziness, and crazy enough to get your money's worth long before the end.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n72/100\n\nHell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit\nGory, beautiful chaos, if a little frustratingly rough behind the scenes.

For times like this you can turn to Hell Yeah!, an unapologetic cartoon gorefest about finding and dismembering demons. There\u2019s a story to it, but really you\u2019re on the hunt for blood and money, the money there to let you buy more bloodletting implements. It\u2019s about what I expected on the surface, but what I didn\u2019t expect was a surprising amount of variety in how I would be executing my foes.\n\nYou are Ash, the bony, lupine heir to the throne of hell. Some dickhead demon decides to snap some pics of you in a compromising position, and you\u2019re out for revenge. Not just revenge against the photographer, mind you, but against every demon in hell that knows what you look like naked. That comes to a nice, round 100 demons to murder, scattered across ten sprawling districts of hell. Some clever platforming and puzzles will get you within striking distance of your foes, and a quirky minigame will finish them off. The more demons you kill, the more of hell\u2019s doors that will open to you and the more tools you\u2019ll have to traverse levels, ultimately leading to the mastermind behind your embarrassment.\n\nOn the surface this is a platformer, one that flirts with being a metroidvania without ever really opening up enough to commit. Ash controls normally when on foot but for most of the game he\u2019ll have some infernal sawblade-jetpack thing that makes his jumps extremely floaty and his touch deadly. Early foes can be dispatched just by grinding on them with your blade but later ones are armored or electrified, prompting the use of a wide range of upgradable firearms. The sawblade can also drill through different types of hellstone, with more added to the list as you progress. Levels are huge but mostly linear aside from alcoves stuffed with cash, though as you gain new powers like dashing you\u2019ll open up access to new parts of previous levels. They start out as brimstone hellpits and prisons but progress to Sonic-esque factories, casinos, and more.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even touch on what I find engrossing about the game, despite being a solid foundation for a platformer. I mentioned minigames, and I wasn\u2019t kidding; to finish off every one of the 100 demons on your hit list, you have to pass a WarioWare-style game. Examples including timing button taps to rev your sawblade, sniping a demon through a scope, playing red light, green light with a mechanical beehive, and picking a rabbit egg out of a dinosaur nest. The elaborate kills are related to the minigame as well, like the dinosaur nest one conjures a giant egg that hatches a T-rex that bites off the unlucky demon\u2019s head. Every single one of these encounters is different and exciting, and some can even be a little tricky to grasp in the few seconds given.\n\nWhat gives the game even more variety than that is the fact that every demon is a unique character that calls for a different approach to kill. Early on you can sawblade or shoot most of them but soon you\u2019ll encounter ones with shields, ones you have to drop things on, ones that hide in underwater mazes, ones that man turrets that have to be turned back on them, and more. No matter how far in you get you\u2019ll still be seeing new enemies with new gimmicks to defeat, and they all have their own models and animations and backstories. Even better, dead demons get sent to The Island, which is a side area where you can make them work to provide you bonuses. You ARE the king of hell, after all!\n\nIt\u2019s all wrapped up in an absolutely lush, vibrant art style that borders on garish most of the time. Few platformers are this bold with colors and cartoony designs, but Hell Yeah! leans into it with its wonderfully animated characters. The soundtrack is more than up to the task and includes some fine selections for the shop and boss tunes. Really it\u2019s a big, bright, messy, silly game about demons killing demons, and it revels in every aspect of it. There\u2019s no deep plot to follow here but there are tons of secrets to find and a whole world of kooky characters and hilarious ways for them to die. And when you\u2019re in the mood for some therapeutic slaughter, you really don\u2019t need anything more than that.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

I like this idea but to be honest, I went there once or twice... only because there is achievement for doing it. Too bad it's just a game for one time.  I don't think so after beating and unlocking everything I will ever back to it. There is also DLC for more missions but I'm not sure if it's worth getting. I wish that Steam had a something more than just a positive/negative review system, because I can't recommend it for everyone, and also I can't say it's a bad game...

The game feels like it was made for the 360 controller, so I never played with the keyboard.\n\nThe game has low system requirements, so it should run well on most computers. For me it always stuttered for about half a second each time while auto saving, but this was the only issue I encountered.\n\n[h1]Main review:[/h1]\nHell Yeah starts off with a story just as wacky as the rest of the game. You play as Ash, the skeleton bunny prince of hell, who has gotten private pictures of him bathing with a rubber ducky leaked, so to not seem like a weakling, you have to kill the 100 hell monsters who have seen the pictures.\n\nThe game itself is mostly standard platforming. You jump around, avoid obstacles, shoot stuff and navigate the levels to get to the 100 monsters. Each time you encounter one, and get its health down by shooting it or using objects in the environment (depending on the monster) you will get to play a mini-game for a chance to land the killing blow. The mini games are often just matching the right button(s)/get the timing right, but there are a few other ones. There are a lot of different ones, so each one isn't used more than 3, maybe 4 times.\n\nYou get to upgrade your health and weapons, and some levels have vehicles: in one you control a submarine, and another one a space ship, and the game turns in to a twin stick shooter. This was quite a nice change of pace.\n\nWhat the game does best is all the wacky things happening:\n[i]\n*Killing a monster by lifting weights, turning in to a super sized muscular bunny that kicks the monster into a soccer goal so the net slices it up? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482545\n\n*Starting in hell, but after a few levels placing you in an overly cute world, with background music with lyrics, where a woman with a French accent sings \"You're a fancy bunny - Together, we're happy\"? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482634 \n\n*Low on health, health bar reads \"F**K\"? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474286510 \n\n*Shop with rap music and a bunny robot clerk, bouncing lowriders in the background? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=474286379 \n\n*Get the controls reversed and the game writes \"LOL\" at the screen, troll style? Check.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473482603 \n[/i]\n\nI really enjoyed all these things, and I realised that for me, I didn't come back for the gameplay, I came back for all the wackyness. To come around a corner, hear the muffled rap music indicating a shop nearby, enter and hear the full \"Money, money gold!\" rap parody. The music in the game is very enjoyable and well done.\n\nOne design choice I didn't like is that after you stop moving, your character \"glides\" a bit, which makes it really hard to make certain jumps. You get the jump just right, but when you land at the very small platform, you glide over the edge. This makes the controls not feel very \"tight\". Combine this with the level design, which has the checkpoints maybe 3-5 minutes between, and some sadistically hard jumps with insta-death spikes if you miss your jump, and I guess that this will send quite a few gamepads airborne and lead to rage quits. When you repeat the same 3-minute section for the 10:th time and have to play it all over again, yet another time. You also have to rewatch any \"cutscenes\" that appear during that section.\n\nI'm no pro platformer, so there were sections where I had to try many times to get it right, and even though I have lots of patience, I was close to quitting a few times.\n\nSo, I wouldn't recommend this game only for the gameplay. It's fine but it has its drawbacks. If you think you would appreciate all the crazy stuff happening, and can ignore the annoying parts, you're up for a good time with Hell Yeah!", "timestamp_created": 1435923405, "timestamp_updated": 1435927126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758872151374816895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16757833": {"recommendationid": "16757833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049783473", "num_games_owned": 639, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 44, "last_played": 1435489339}, "language": "english", "review": "The sonic references are real.\n\nHow to play this game:\nDon't touch stuff.\nThink fast.\n\nI've never played a game with as much WTF in as this.\n\n10/10 WTF's", "timestamp_created": 1435488344, "timestamp_updated": 1435489419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502487540245056152", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "16631802": {"recommendationid": "16631802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997631907", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 626, "last_played": 1360483200}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and funny platformer/shooter.\n\nIf you like the humor of Disgea and the combat Metal Slug, this is right up your alley.

It has its flaws, I'll get to that, but it has so many killer merits that it is just a pure pleasure to look at and especially to play. How a great game like this gets a 64 metacritic rating displayed and a truly awful game like house of dead ice skating ninjas gets a 79 displayed is dumb. Metacritic and the dimwit reviewers they combine are all ran by blindfolded monkeys banging on keyboards. This game is easily a 75 or higher. It can get absolutely frustrating at times but with a little effort you will get by. With practice, every ass is totally kick-able.\n\nOne of the most wildly creative games I have ever seen. It has great graphics with everything within a level pleasing to look at. The art direction is really creative. The real gem of this game is how you kill the main enemies. You go through the game and your goal is to eventually find and kill all 100 special monsters. Once you whittle its life bar down, it shows a screen where you do a brief mini-game to finish him off, ranging from tapping the A button (I'm using a wired xbox 360 controller, a controller is highly advised) to matching up a symbol or answering a question. After that, it shows a really hilarious kill animation. One had me do a little driving mini game where I avoiding things on the road for a little bit with a semi, then the kill on the special monster was a giant semi smashing into it then backing over it about 20 times. Another had a satellite shoot down a kill beam and a NASA control voice counted down from 5 and it destroyed the monster. There are a bunch of different ways and they are all cool to see. But of course there aren't 100 fatalities, one for each boss. There are much less than that so you will be seeing repeats of fatalities but, for me anyway, they mostly never get old.\n\nHouse of Dead Ice Skater Ninjas is a pass. Pass it and play this. I am mentioning that game because at the time I had just beat that game right before I started playing this one. This game is a lot of crazy fun so you can forget garbage indie games like that. Loving every minute of this game. Besides this games (minor) flaws, I can overlook them because of how wildly fun it is and how creative the whole thing is.\n\nGood work done here, 8/10\n\nPS \u2013 TAYLOR SWIFT IS SO FKING HOT!!! she wont return my calls =(", "timestamp_created": 1414397822, "timestamp_updated": 1481351606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.372456490993499756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12639176": {"recommendationid": "12639176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055964948", "num_games_owned": 908, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1414318663}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you have epilepsy?:\n\nYes: Buy and play this game, you will no doubt have the medication to ease seizures already.\nNo: Go get some anti-seizure medication first, then buy and play this game.", "timestamp_created": 1414318854, "timestamp_updated": 1414318854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520366251468658447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "12637914": {"recommendationid": "12637914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054803370", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1000, "last_played": 1414310899}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this game!

Both meet very high standards in most areas.\n\nEverything else is proved to be an underwhelming experience.\n\n You go about killing some \"mini bosses\" to unlock doors for bosses. If the idea of mini bosses excites you don't get your hopes up too fast. They have one attack pattern, are easily killed, although sometimes you must kill them without weaponry. \n\nWhen you get them to low hp, a mini game starts. The mini games have a lot of variety which ranges from tapping one key, catching falling stars, to tapping several keys at the same time, all placed in an awkward position (e.g. x+v+spacebar+e). The mini game you are given decides what will be the killing animation, which are all silly. What they do have in common is that they get boring quickly and can't be skipped. Some minigames have a timer so if you are not quick enough to read the instructions you will lose the minigame and actually take damage, potentially killing you which is highly annoying.\n\nThe platforming itself is mundane at best and worst, although you do get to fly with a spaceship, pilot an aircraft and drive a submarine. But even those things didn't offer a big enough relief from the overall boredom I was feeling. The most annoying thing in the game happens when you get hit: Similarly to oldies like Ninja Gaiden, you get knockbacked when you get hit. The damage immunity after the hit doesn't last long enough, so it is possible that the enemies play ping pong with you, you get knocked back into instant death spikes, or lose half of your hp because you got knockbacked into a wide boss and can't escape without getting hit a few more times.\n\nIf the beautiful background and fitting music is enough for you, by all means, this game has one of the the best I've seen.

I got it in a bundle of software in which I was only interested in a couple of titles, but thought, \"What the hell?  Looks corny.  I'll try it out.  I'm in the mood for something different.\"  This game surprised me with its take on the platformer genre - almost as if it's making fun of other platformers.  It was refreshing after playing through an FPS like Far Cry.  Elements and influences from other platformers like Metroid and Castlevania are clearly evident, but there's some Mario and Rayman influence in there too.  The game looks like it might be something made for kids, yet is decidedly adult oriented in its use of language and blood/gore, so one has to keep this in mind if in doubt whether on not they should get it for their kids.  Also, it sways drunkenly in difficulty between super easy and fantastically frustrating.  Instructions are sometimes in lack of abundance for accomplishing a mission, but for the most part they're thorough enough.  Certain parts are easier to play with a controller (like a lot of platformers) rather than keyboard and mouse, but others are much easier the other way around, so I found myself switching back and forth on occasion, which is a new experience for me on a platformer.  I completely recommend it, however.  I've had a lot of fun with it, and the dark humor in it made me laugh.  The story is ridiculous, nonsensical, and frankly HILARIOUS - again, a refreshing break from other games that I play.  As for price, I dont know that I would pay $15, but I got it cheap through Humble Bundle and it was worth every penny that went to it there.  If you happen to find it on sale, it's worth a buy, and I hope you find it as refreshing and funny as I have.

Today, I installed this game to try it out, because the DLCs were on sale... Well yeah, finished the game in 1 sitting of 5-6 hours with 100% achievements. I have to say it was addictive, even though if it was pretty short. Also, the game was very easy, I did not get stuck for more than 5 minutes on something.\n\nThe graphics are just plain nice, the game has an intense amount of gore and the soundtrack is awesome. There's alot of old video games reference in this game, the characters are well done and they have interesting personalities, the game has alot of bosses ( Around 100 or 105, ) the level design is good and it's an amazing platformer. The game had some humor too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it has it's bad points too:\n\n-Double jumping sometimes makes you wall jump, which can kill you.\n-Sometimes you can reach places you shouldn't have reached that early, so you either need to die or have a hard time backtracking through that part.\n-Somewhat short.\n-The same ''Fatalities'' are re-used at least 4 to 6 times each, there's still about 20 though.\n\nOverall, yes, I definately recommend this game.

The cutscenes for killing monsters are cartoonish and enjoyable at first, but gets repetetive after a while.\n\nColourful candy graphics.\n\nNothing in it has sense, though there are some lame atttempts. Like, when you kill monsters, they appear in your monsterpedia to bring some joy in the game by giving you scraps of information. You control a rabbit full of killing desire, but nothing else. Lousy attempts at comedy are the only ways he can surface anything in the game about himself, and that's it.\n\nThere is nothing to complete here whatsoever. Everthing you can get is straightforward along the path, and sidetracking is next to impossible. The weapons in game are uninteresting and you get them in bundles, instead of making it more fresh and funny to gain them (like for instance, take them from a corpse, or a secret compund, or some plot giving event, form the weapon from soemthing). The characters used in game to help rabbit, are episodic and at the end of it dissapear completaly (Nestor, the giant eyeball thing is more of a decoration). Shops are put in rare areas, the last area doesn't even have a shop I'm afraid, making player to relocate himself for whatever reason before the final battle.\n\nThe game mechanics are the ones that get the biggest blow. Using the pad its pretty much impossible jump and shoot anything due to lack of thumbs on your hands and index fingers. Enemies can shoot you from a great distance without problem, whereas when you try to shoot them, even when they're just pixels away from you main view, is impossible. The save system is just damm annoying. Its kind of hard to go anywhere in the game, once someone decides you can respawn with almost 0 HP, granting you eternal pain in the ass of finding any way to replenish your HP, which are scarce (either buy in shop, or find fountain or island).\n\nAnd speaking of Island, I know its an in-game mini feature that shouldn't bother needlessly... but why does it have meat factory? Its purpose is to give our chap 30HP a bite, replenishing it.  What's the point of giving your character 30HP when you have mx 550HP and enemies hit you for 120 HP a hit? Its like toying with player.\n\nThe ending of the game is terrible. Let me just say: the mid fighting long non-skippable dialog is annoying, and the fact that after the final fight there is no after story for ash (did he got back his pictures at least? What about future himself?) leaves player craving for bloodlust. Judging by the game's title \"Hell Yeah\". you'd think people care about grand entrances in game.\n\nAll in all everything seems like a bad case of Castlevania clone.\n\nPro's:\n\n+  candy graphic\n+- many weapons... repetitive design and bundle gift\n+- killing minigames!... which after a while get boring and you wish they were not there\n\n- non-skippable cutscenes\n- quirky controls\n- save games that wants you to spend eternity dying looking for save spot\n- childish brutality mixed with childish humour = bad taste\n- most anticlimatic video game end ever,", "timestamp_created": 1395505208, "timestamp_updated": 1395505467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499638110399246216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9593565": {"recommendationid": "9593565", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982630781", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1395490855}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a quirky little almost-Metroidvania-like platformer that doesn't require too much skill to get through. You spend most of the game riding around in a spinning blade wheel (that doubles as a jetpack for limited flight) and fire various weapons to take down 100 bosses and all the little minions that get in your way. But there are segments where you pilot other ships with their own special weapons and even run around on foot without any weapons. The real selling point is the WarioWare style \"microgames\" you play once you've depleted a boss's health. They're all pretty easy and the end result is usually the same, but they're a fun little reward for your work.\n\nWith so much variation in the gameplay, it's a shock and a shame that it all ends up feeling so repetitive. Despite the large amount of boss microgames, a lot of them play similarly (stop something that is moving in a specific spot, press/mash specific keys/buttons, etc.). Add on the fact that there's far less than 100 of them and you'll start to get tired of them near the end. The special vehicles are a little bit of a letdown too with a couple of them playing exactly the same. Finally, outside of a few special cases, most of the weapons act essentially the same. To make matters worse, the shotgun is so overpowered and can blast through walls you normally have to drill... it's hard to justify using anything else once you buy it.\n\nThat being said, I'd still recommend this game.

About a year ago I played the demo for Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit. I thought that it was simply mediocre. The final game is a complete mess. Level design is incredibly odd. Platforms just seem to be strewn randomly all over the game with no thought put into their locations, making the areas incredibly awkward to travel through and the slippery controls don't help. I was constantly falling off of platforms, often landing on top of enemies or instant death spikes. Navigation only got worse once I got the wall jump. Most of the time when I tried getting onto a platform, I would brush up against the edge of it and the wall jump would launch me to the side, usually into enemies or instant death spikes. The visuals are incredibly drab consisting of red, red, and more red. There might be some blue or purple put in every now and then, but it doesn't make the visuals any more interesting. The music is always either utter garbage or completely forgettable. I wouldn't even classify it as atmospheric, as it never enhanced any of the areas. The dialogue is just awful. Characters are given little to no personality, the jokes are never funny, and are often pointless, and the set up for the story is just stupid. Photos of the Prince with rubber duckies have surfaced on the Internet and 100 monsters have seen them, so the Prince has to go kill them. Who thought that was a good idea?

aside from transport and some enemies, it is USELESS. infact, trying to use this awesome weapon will usually KILL you. great job.\n\ndo you know what this game REALLY is? its a shooter. its aplatformer where your cool weapon is pretty much useless, and your standard fairly boring guns and rocket launcers are your main weapon. sorry, i meant gun. as the rocket launcher is fiarly useless to be honest.\n\nyou have to kill 101 creatures to beat this game. most bosses are incredibly easy, and the game even boasts backtracking in order to get them all. it is not hard to kill some, but others are ridiculously hard. the difficuly very much spikes, but only once did i find myself clapping at how ingenious it can be.\n\nthe best weapon you can buy quite easily for around 7000 and it is Holy water, because it is SO strong and fires SO fast you wont even have to bother.\n\non the topic of aethetics, this game looks great. it sounds pretty decent too. the story is... ignorable. death-wise, not only is there an achievemtn for dying 100 times - but there is also the one way which you will die almost every time. teeny teeny instant death spikes that you just happen to land on. great.\n\nall in all this game is very easy with some boring bits and some ludicrously hard bits put in designed JUST to annoy you. also - checkpoints? very very few, including heals. so if you fall on that little spike be prepared to spend the next minuet figuring out how to get to the creature again, dying in about three seconds, then coming back. i do not reccomend this game for completionists, platformers, people with low patience/high blood pressure or anyone looking for an involving story/plot/dialoge/characters or gameplay. if you like shooting and dont mind dying a LOT, then play this.\n\nCOMPLETIONISTS NOTE: its not too bad, but when one of them is to get 777 on a slot machine  then i hpe you have patience. i dont reccomend it because to be honest, you'll just get bored or tired or frustrated.", "timestamp_created": 1394835728, "timestamp_updated": 1394835728, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577420532703399658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9468473": {"recommendationid": "9468473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083107180", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 316, "last_played": 1395072276}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW just WOW.

The characters and monsters are hilarious and it's so rewarding because when you kill certain enemies, you get a really funny killcam or like KO thing where your attack just goes crazy and OTT!

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is I guess an action platformer with puzzle elements. \n\nIts an enjoyable experience clocking in at around 4-6 hours depending on whether you go for 100% of the achievements. Its a very easy game to perfect, so if you're looking to improve your completion rate and its in your library play it. \n\nThe graphics are cartoonish. yet work well with the game and atmosphere. Hell Yeah! is split up into different worlds, all as colourful and imaginitive as the next. Your objective is to kill the monsters(mini bosses) in place, there are also main bosses and a final boss. Your main way of getting around is a spinning wheel with spikes on it. You also have an assortmenet of weapons like machine guns, RPGs, shotgun, etc. You can customise your characters look and wheel, these customisations are just cosmetic but they're humourous. \n\nThe story of the game is also quite entertaining where Ash(protagonist) has pictures taken of him in the bath and called out as being a pussy so he goes on a search for said pictures. The soundtrack on the game works well with the game and further immerses you into the game, where each world has its own track in place. \n\nThere are some negatives and they're that the game even at 5-6 hours does slightly drag some of the monsters you have to kill maybe could of been removed. When you kill main monsters(mini bosses) you have a little mini game with a death animation. There are only a certain amount of death animations and mini games and where the mini games don't get annoying the kill scenes do and they break immersion from the game itself. \n\nOverall though the game is enjoyable its worth a look for a couple of pounds/euros/dollars but there are better action/platformers on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1393114963, "timestamp_updated": 1393114963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561813592910766602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "9060031": {"recommendationid": "9060031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021252434", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1223, "last_played": 1617319899}, "language": "english", "review": "epic , cute , awsome , wierd, speciell.. ah whata hell....

The platforming is mediocre at best. Half of the time, it can be difficult to see what exactly is dangerous and what isn't, something that's immediately obvious from the first level where you, the so-called Prince of Hell, walk through flames without harm, except for those ones, which look virtually identical, especially in Hell which is composed of fire. Those flames will damage you, except for the ones that don't, got that? The story seems to start halfway through, like I missed a few levels or something, but no, it's just bad writing, the one consistent thing throughout the entire game. The jokes barely raised more than a weak smile at their best, which is rare. Landing a jump can be about as pixel perfect at times as Super Meat Boy, which would be okay a) you didn't slide everywhere like the ground was made of ice and b) if the levels weren't cluttered with useless junk as, unlike SMB's clean visuals, the cartoonish graphics throw everything but the kitchen sink into the background, foreground, every ledge, every trap.\n\nSpeaking of SMB, let's talk about respawning. How fast could you respawn in SMB? Instantly. Do you know why? Because a game in which you die that amount would get infinitely frustrating if you had to wait even a second to keep playing. Now, Hell Yeah is a game in which you can be stunlocked and die in just a few seconds as punishment for missing one of those pixel perfect landings or making a small error with it's clunky feeling controls. How long does it take to respawn? Well, the boss that made me just quit the game killed me in a method that took about five seconds before I actually died (I can't move or do anything during this period of time), another second or two for the death screen, another three seconds to respawn and then made me [i]rewatch the boss's unskippable introduction cutscene[/i]. This happens [b]every time[/b]. And because of the previous platforming issues, I have died quite a number of times on this boss.\n\nA previous boss required me to kill it with its own trap. Except how you do that is such a screwup of game design, I actually went into the next area searching for a way to kill it, killed an entirely different boss which was so painfully simple (make it run into a wall) and then had to go back to kill the first one. The way back was guarded by spotlights which signalled another unavoidable, stupidly long death. They were easy to avoid on the way down, but the way back up was hampered by the awful controls and the fact that these spotlights haven't even got any form of pattern to them. One of them literally stopped and zigzagged across the tiny platform I needed to get to for over half a minute. When it got off, I immediately jumped up, only to find the spotlight suddenly rush back to see me and I die. Again. And respawn at the bottom. Again. When I finally got back to the boss, I found how you were meant to kill it and immediately found another checkpoint (the one thing this game mostly gets right) so I didn't have to climb up the tower of doom again. I jump up to the trap to set it off and have it track me to target the boss. I mess up, die, that's fine, my bad. I start again, jump up... and immediately die to the trap because, for no reason whatsoever, it's set up in a different way this time. It pointed in a random direction every time I respawned, half of which were instant death because of the stunlock meaning I get thrown immediately into another source of heavy damage.\n\nThe writing is boring, with no reason for anything other than your Facebook pictures got leaked or something, I feel like all of my motive was in a prequel game to this (if there is one, I'm not actually aware of it). The jokes lack any punchline half the time beyond \"lol, the skeleton rabbit is naked, isn't this amusing? Why aren't you laughing? Maybe I'll tell it again three more times, that should get a laugh!\" Everything wants to kill you for some reason, except the times they don't but you want to kill them for some reason. When (if) you do kill a boss, you get \"rewarded\" with a minigame, which are either stupidly simple, annoyingly finnicky, QTEs or simple \"mash this button until you get RSI!\". At first I was okay with it as it looked like each boss got its own unique game, but when they started repeating, my interest dropped further.\n\nDo not buy this game. It's not worth \u00a39.99 ($14.99), it's not even worth picking up on a sale.

According to Metacritic, the game's average score is a 69; while it's range has varied from a 4 to an 8 out of 10. More on the later:\n\nIn the game, you're tasked with killing over 100 unique enemies, think of them as 'mini-bosses'. They're scattered throughout the world, in order to proceed in a map you have to kill a set amount. Along the way you gain weapon upgrades and progress through a loose story that might as well not be there. The maps are big, and while they have branching paths, you're always gently led to where you have to go next. So it's kind of like Metroid, but MUCH easier. You're NOT gonna get lost.\n\nThe stuff that contributed to its bad score: 1.the controls. They work, but don't expect to platform, aim, and shoot simultaneously and have an easy time at it. 2.The mini-games. Each time you get a unique enemie's health to 0, you're presented with a mini-game you must complete to finish them off (think 'Warioware'). Each game brings a unique death animation. It's cool, until you realize there are 100 enemies, around 20 games, and each death is 10-17 seconds long. It can get repetetive; but I found the games to be varied enough so that it never got tiresome. \n\nOverall, I'd say its a game that OBVIOUSLY had a lot of love put into it and it oozes a unique style. While it's a little on the easy side, there are very few side missions, and the mini-game novelty (and death animations) wear off a fifth of the way through, its still worth a purchase if you want a decent platformer; 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1379769542, "timestamp_updated": 1511467659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "6278370": {"recommendationid": "6278370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062748440", "num_games_owned": 6176, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 225, "last_played": 1427635344}, "language": "english", "review": "~Hell Yeah !

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit is a modern day take, and parody, of classid 2D platform games.  I found it very entertaining, with fun gameplay, impressive visuals (seriously, the aesthetic of this game is incredible, it looks really good), and lots of beautiful, gorey, gratuitous violence. \n\nHell Yeah! sports great controller support, a nice soundtrack, and really reminded me of Jazz Jackrabbit in a way - it's the closest game I've ever played to it, and it really took me back.  If you've ever played Jazz Jackrabbit (if you haven't go play it now) you'll immediately see the resemblence, and you'll be reminded of a game Epic would have made had they had the resources modern day game creators do.  It has snappy load times, great optimization, a *huge* amount of customizable hats and skins for your character to unlock and find, and lots of weapons at your disposal to destroy your enemies with.\n\nThat said, it isn't a perfect game - the controls aren't very tight, they're actually pretty \"floaty\" (in a bad way), and dying can make you feel at times that it wasn't your fault, but rather the controller or keyboard.  It's not like Super Meat Boy where you know it was you and not the interface.  This, coupled with the fact that the respawn locations can get pretty far away from each other towards the later part of the game, can cause for some aggravating gameplay mechanics, where you're backtracking through stuff you've done 10 times before and keep dying at the same spot because you couldn't stop on a dime like you wanted to.  The game also doesn't have many options (graphical or otherwise) to set, it's really plug and play, and you can tell it was designed for consoles as well as the PC.  I couldn't even remap my buttons properly.\n\nBesides those negatives, Hell Yeah! is a riot.  There are fun little minigames every time you kill a \"boss\" monster, but they do repeat themselves (there's 99 monsters, so this isn't too bad, as there is a large variety of the mini-games and they're all grapically pleasing and end with a huge explosion of blood).  There's also a section of the game called \"The Island\", and it's where all the \"boss\" monsters you've killed go to hang out - it's a neat little feature as you can micromanage them to earn you extra money, life, and special rewards like new hats and skins for your character.  I did find it a little weird you had to actually quit out of the game and go back to the main menu to access this area, but, as stated before, the game is optimized well so it wasn't a huge issue.\n\nIn conclusion, Hell Yeah! is a funny, fresh, current, and hip platformer that has a great aesthetic style.  I enjoyed it, although found it tedious at times.  Had it had better controls and a few more tweaks here and there this would be a must-play, but unfortunately as it stands it sits at the middle of the pack.

I kept with the trusty machine gun for most of the game. The cartoony graphics were reasonably well animated, but all the colors looked kinda washed out.
