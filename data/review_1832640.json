The graphics and animation are amazing and there is voice acting as well. Stories are fascinating. Each girl has their own story and world to learn about as you clear each Match 3 level. \n\nWhy all the negative reviews then?\nWell, the first Mirror game contained a lot of 18+ content. *** scenes, or any nudity for that matter, are nowhere to be seen in the sequel, and naturally people are confused and frustrated as to why they did this. I remember in the very early stages of development, like the first chapter wasn't even done, this game had nsfw stuff (though it was a very long time ago, hopefully, my memory is right). I'm not entirely sure why either but another review said that the new publisher they are with would not allow the game to have 18+ content. They certainly did switch publishers but not sure how true the rest is as I don't have any source. Due to this misunderstanding, they offered refunds through their own site they quickly made which many people found sketchy and people started calling it a scam, which wasn't true at all. \n\nSo who's to blame here?\nWell, I think both sides messed up in a way. The developers honestly should have just used a different name. Imagine buying a game called Uno 2 but it turns out it's not a card game it's a FPS. Yes, Mirror 2 is still a match-3 game but they know dam well that's not the main reason people bought the first game.\nThe gamers buying the game are to blame as well though. This game did not include the 'adult warning' tag that every NSFW game on Steam has so it does have a clear indication that there's no adult content. \n\nI think people [b]massively[/b] overreacted to this whole thing though. The game is by no means bad. In fact, I think it's actually incredibly good and definitely worth the measly $2 it asks for. But because it doesn't have nsfw content people demand refunds and are review-bombing it. \nFirst off, if you're willing to spend money on an nsfw game, you almost positively have money to spend and $2 is like nothing to you.\nSecond off, an initial review bomb is understandable, but why is it [u]still[/u] getting mass negative reviews? The people who left negative reviews in the past several months either don't look at the store page at all or just want to hop on the hate train for funsies.\n\nI was honestly shocked and a bit saddened when I heard the dev company went bankrupt. If this happened to EA or Ubisoft I'd be cheering but a small indie company? Nah. You guys are f***** up. The company 100% could have made more nsfw games after this or hell, they maybe could have made a nsfw patch for this game after they completed it. Now the chances of them making a comeback are slim and would probably take years if they could. \n\nFeel free to comment if I'm missing vital information or something is incorrect.", "timestamp_created": 1700263099, "timestamp_updated": 1700263099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636480391025543213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "150047217": {"recommendationid": "150047217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084004771", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 663, "last_played": 1675060848}, "language": "english", "review": "All the negative reviews this got is just horny boys being pissy.\n\nIt's a decent casual puzzle game with beautiful visuals and some light storytelling.

In my opinion, I believe the largest business mistake they made (that ultimately led to them going bankrupt) was under-pricing the game. I know that's not gonna be a popular take, but the truth is, that game development is expensive and when you consider the high quality, polished end product (even if it's not technically finished) and the fact that they sold over 4 million copies and could only cover a little over a third of their operating costs (according to their bankruptcy statement), the price being charged wasn't high enough.

I also liked how good the animations for some of the bigger flashier moves played out when your opponent used a \"signature\" move/ability during the \"match three\" puzzle game!\n\n-Island Waifu dress-up, picture taking, free exploration simulator was a very nice addition; you play the story mode of the main game to learn about the character and then you can go the Mirror 2 Home portion of the game with that character!\n\n\nI have only two negatives with the game:\n\n-The lack of H content.

I was surprised to come back and see it  had overwhelmingly negative reviews and that the development company apparently went bankrupt. A lot of people called it a scam and so I figured I'd give it a look after so long and see what the fuss was all about.\n\nThis review is from a brief look into just one chapter of the campaign since I wanted to see what made it a \"scam\".\nReview:\nThis game is  a match-3 battler where you attack, heal, get mana, and overall try to match 3 to win in each match. You can buy upgrades between chapters and overall it's just good fun. The presentation is pretty to look at, the gameplay is solid. The story, while brief, was nice to run through with multiple endings depending on the choices made throughout the game, encouraging replayability.\nOverall, yes, you are getting MORE than 2 bucks worth of value out of it.\n\nEdit: It also has a pretty good Slay the Spire inspired challenge mode.\n\nControversy?\nSo why all the negative reviews if the game is just 2 bucks and is fun on its own? As far as I can tell there are 2 reasons.\nReason 1: A sequel to an adult game which drops the \"adult only\" stuff.\nThis is just a dumb complaint. The game does not have an AO tag. A lot of people are pissy about the 2 dollar stupid-tax they had to pay for not connecting the dots. That's on them. Some people might argue that they could reasonably expect a sequel to an AO game to have AO content, but THE. TAG. ISN'T. THERE. Everything else is a dumb excuse.\nReason 2: Shady company practices\nIDK what to think about this. Refunds on a 3rd party site? some claims about giveaways that might have been fake? Claims that the company is collecting and selling player information, which they've outright denied, making it a \"he said she said\" kind of deal? It does seem like someone handling the company wears a dunce cap on the regular if they've gone bankrupt, and it'd be interesting to hear the story from a developers' point of view. And not just someone on the forum whose source is \"trust me bro, i was totally on the dev team\"\nAs it stands, we have the final post from the devs and, if nothing else, they admit to being stupid. Take from that what you will, but my understanding is that MOST of the controversy and hate comes from people wanting an AO game and throwing a collective tantrum when they didn't get it.\n\nOverall:\nFor 2 bucks, yeah, get it. I'm enjoying it so far and will continue to play some more. I hope the devs land on their feet and continue with a different project under a different name with similar concepts. The game is FUN. The aesthetic is GOOD.

tried to enjoy this game, besides all the ''Scam'' thingy everyonr yelling about.\n\nLet's be honest game is pretty cheap, in steam games with hentai stuff for the same price offer you puzzles in most cases.\nThis one beign a child of Mirror 1, does not include sexual content and instead offers just interactive stories with 3 in a row segments and minor storylines (choices).\n\nI will describe the game based on these factors\n\nSo as the 3 in a row game it is good, has some strategy build into it, not as much as in mirror 1 (this one caught me with gameplay rather than porn)\n\nAs interactive story I can't say it is good, strange I will say, things just hapen cuz they hapen, any sort of dissagreament leads to fighting with woman opponent (everyday stuff I guess)\n\nWhat I found really cringy is that devs said that it was not intended to make zorgen hapen in game, but I can clearly see some moments that it was intended at the begining, like constant moans in close interactions and really open costumes\nwhich just make no sense otherwise, click the mouse in the right place (like it was in the mirror 1 snu snu moments), paid bikini dlc's\n\nIf I could, I would rate this game grey like middle but this is not possible\n\nGame have some issues but it's not awfull at all\n", "timestamp_created": 1677815190, "timestamp_updated": 1677815190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50,

At least the stories are going to be good, right?\nThe stories will be good, right?\n\n\nThe writing of this game's story is very incoherent (especially the ones added later), the twists happen so fast they just makes me feel cringe. The cliches doesn't help either. For example, [spoiler]The lonely vampire girl almost gives up her life because she can't turn back into human is suddenly (and I mean SUDDENLY) turned back into human at the end, for the sake of a happy ending. And guess who made her stay there by herself and wait for someone to save her? The protagonist's grandfather![/spoiler] Such original and amazing plot.\nI wouldn't mind cliches if the visuals and SFX are well made. While the visuals look great, however the voice acting feels weak, and for some reason the sound effects e.g. hitting desk, footsteps are delayed that I am unable to immerse myself into the story, as the problems are so blatant and just ruins the viewing experience.\n\n\nThey \"took away\" the sexual content, and now the story quality dies with it too. Yes, this game is dirt cheap, but the question of whether you should buy this is a definite no. While you get what you pay for, this is just a waste of time.

You\u2019ll have some skills, items and upgrades to unlock with the gold you win after each battle. \n\n[b]First of all, you should know that the reason the game was massively downvoted was because, unlike the first game, it isn\u2019t an Hentai game as its backers expected and they felt betrayed, BUT it\u2019s still a good game for its price. So it\u2019s sad that the evaluation is overwhelmingly negative.[/b]  \n\nThe game offers around 3 hours of short stories in the story mode, all with different characters, set in different worlds and with several different endings. The game also offers a roguelight mode similar to Slay the Spire, with different types of events and where you\u2019ll also get relics and gold to spend in upgrades. This mode has a lot of longevity with lots of upgrades to unlock and three difficulties to choose from.\n\nThe graphics have improved from the first game, and now the game is 3D with beautiful scenarios and characters, but some things stayed the same, namely the large and bouncy breasts and the revealing attires, that sometimes interfere with the story, but without any kind of nudity. Some of the sounds also also unnecessarily lewd with a lot of moaning.\n\nThe gameplay stayed more or less the same, bury fury was replaced with MP that can be used on items that have a cooldown (that replaced the old power ups that could only be used once). Overall, we could have more skills and items in the story mode, as it seems we have less than in Mirror. Something that bothered be was how we have to start over each time we start a new story, what you unlocked doesn\u2019t stay unlocked, so you end up playing with the same skills and items most of the time \n\n[b]Achievements:[/b]  \n[b]How many:[/b] 1 Achievement.\n[b]How much time:[/b] Around 10 seconds. Game has +3 hours of content.\n[b]Game difficulty:[/b] Easy (story mode) and Hard (Challenge Mode).\n[b]Achievements\u2019 Difficulty:[/b] Effortless. Just open the game to get the achievement.\n\n[b]Overall opinion:[/b]  \nMirror is a lewd match 3 game that doesn\u2019t deserve to be massively downvoted. It has better graphics than the first game, better gameplay and the stories aren\u2019t disturbingly filled with perversion and taboos. \n\n\n[b]Join and follow my group [u][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/42556190-Ribbon-Hunters/] Ribbon Hunters[/url][/u] for more suggestions and reviews of easy indie games to get all the achievements.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1672440254, "timestamp_updated": 1672440254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497180908918380737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129655741": {"recommendationid": "129655741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072031519", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 503, "last_played": 1691078677}, "language": "english", "review": "Bruh all those negative reviews are from coomers who got upset about this game being more of huniepop 16+ editon and didn't got adult content. Also developers did let all of you to do refunds. I actually myself love this game and I don't mind that there is no 18+ content. The game itself functions pretty good and for 2 euro there is enough content at the current state. It is a bit unique since it has new integrations (like a mini game like OSU kind of gameplay) at some points of the story. In my opinion this game doesn't deserve current game rating. But even if it does then I guess I enjoy bad games?! \n\nJust to summarize this whole game is like 3D visual novel where you can choose the path in each story with match 3 games to progress further. There is also like a separate photo mode where you can take photos for every currently available main female characters.

negative criticism as it has been getting since they announced the game was going to be a 16+ rated game. \nHowever!

We all know why most people played the game.\n That being said, There is of course an expectation that this game will be following in its footsteps.\nWhen players start up the game in the first chapter with the \"R18\" DLC. We get a very suggestive opening with one of the characters. This alone has to make players believe that its intended to be a adult game and that we just haven't gotten to that part in development. \n Many updates later and even more suggestive moments giving players all the more reason to believe that this game will indeed be a adult style game.......We get the announcement that it will be a 16+ Rated game. \nNow as far as the quality of this game... for what it is....a simple Match 3 puzzle game with very impressive visuals. It is great so far what they have done with this. Character design...VO and the stories they go into....there is a lot of effort here.So I do think this game as a 16+ rated puzzle game is worth $2.99 for sure! (even as an early access title)\n But the manner of how they released this game and almost being coy with the content of the game in the beginning.

I forgot to tell you those sisters are quintuplets.\n\nThe plot is easy to follow. A guy, Fuutarou Uesugi, nerdy, poor, solitary, gets a job as the tutor of a group of quintuplets who are near to fail the school. This group of girls, Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba, Itsuki, named in order as they came to this world, hate to study and even more dislike the tutor. After some time, these girls begin showing affection towards their tutor and their surroundings starts to change. The only problem, this kind of plot could be seen absurdness and filled with excessive banality, boring a selected group of anime followers.\n\nBut that hardly matters. This group of characters is funny and genuine. In the beginning, you can feel the show as the classical, generic harem where the guy likes and love all the girls. However, in this series, the guy only cares to study and do not see the quintuplets as friends or even more as candidates to have a relationship. I do not think that passed his mind (in the manga is in the same way). The quintuplets have a different personality forcing Fuutarou to take different decisions to deal with each of them. This contrast creates refreshing chemistry between the cast and keeps the whole crazy story spinning, this thing is never boring. As a positive point, I am glad, the adaptation followed the manga and they do not change anything of the plot, so I am hoping to see a second season in the future (it was announced).\n\nThe quintuplets have a very different personality; for example, we can observe a clear contrast between Nino and Miku. The latter is shy, dedicate, charming, not social while Nino is very social, extrovert, direct, bossy and probably most of the spectators could end disliking her. The same happens with the other sisters, Ichika, the eldest and the one who tries to keep the group harmony, Yotsuba, filled with excessive energy and who cannot say no as an answer and finally Itsuki, the hard worker and stubborn sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the art and sound are fabulous. For me, the art quality is one of the best of the season and I want to praise the creator, the animators because the quintuplets have the same silhouette but with some changes in the hair and the accessories they create different characters. If you pay closer attention to the character design, they will look the same boosting the effect. The sound and voice acting are perfect. The sound appears in the precise moments and it fills the scene. The characters' voice is contrasting and complements the personalities. The OP and ED are good. However, the OP is fantastic because it shows the voice contrast between the quintuplets and has a good rhythm and interesting lyrics.\n\nMostly, \"Gotoubun no Hanayome\u201d is just fun, for Fuutarou to become a better person and starts caring for others outside his family, for the quintuplets whom evolve and begin to experience the love path. Together, they create a cheerful and enjoyable comedy where this group connects between each other and their world expands hilariously.", "timestamp_created": 1670828208, "timestamp_updated": 1670993008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47752806544303894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128385856": {"recommendationid": "128385856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199024370664", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1647967607}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ridiculously bad, under the banner of 18+, but it is a shitty galgame, whoever buys it is an idiot. mirror 1 is still a good game but 2 is complete rubbish", "timestamp_created": 1670789576, "timestamp_updated": 1670789576, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128379044": {"recommendationid": "128379044", "author": {"steamid": "76561199029041104", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 955, "last_played": 1678516291}, "language": "spanish", "review": "si", "timestamp_created": 1670782322, "timestamp_updated": 1670782322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128369766": {"recommendationid": "128369766", "author": {"steamid": "76561199178894286", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1658466877}, "language": "spanish", "review": "no hay tetas", "timestamp_created": 1670772642, "timestamp_updated": 1670772642, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572531819343566895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128361239": {"recommendationid": "128361239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198240735", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 465, "last_played": 1657347217}, "language": "english", "review": "mdzz,cnm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1670763985, "timestamp_updated": 1670763985, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128335930": {"recommendationid": "128335930", "author": {"steamid": "76561199169752393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78, "last_played": 1657347298}, "language": "english", "review": "financial fraud", "timestamp_created": 1670729702, "timestamp_updated": 1670729702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128328085": {"recommendationid": "128328085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137343794", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 98, "last_played": 1654657330}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1670718481, "timestamp_updated": 1670718481, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128313464": {"recommendationid": "128313464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162201762", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1647067209}, "language": "english", "review": "Guess I'm glad I didn't continue playing it, it was as I feared.

After seeing it, the old bustard decided to strike while the iron was hot, and opened a second brothel, but it was still being renovated, and there was only the first floor. The hall can be entered, and the brothel has not been installed yet, so the procuress began to collect money for whoring. The money charged was twice that of the foreign brothel next door. However, based on the reputation of the previous brothel, the clients tolerated it and paid a lot of money to support it. The first floor only provides services for chatting with you, and you can also ask prostitutes to accompany you to read books. It is impossible to get approval or something. Just like this, while collecting double money, you only provide services that are neither salty nor bland. Earning a lot of money, the procuress is posting notices and photos at the door every day, the content is probably how the decoration of the second floor is progressing, relying on the appetite and the word-of-mouth of the first brothel, the clients still pay for it, the newcomer There are also a lot of clients, but after a long time, everyone is a little anxious. As a result, one morning, the clients want to continue to support the brothel business, but they find a new notice hanging at the gate, saying that this shop will not do skin business in the future. Well, I didn\u2019t do skin and meat business before. When I opened the store, I didn\u2019t explain it so that everyone misunderstood. In fact, what I want to do is the No. 1 elegant academy in Beijing. The service on the first floor is all the services. This store is to provide girls. The service for you to accompany you to study, the customers think, hey, the last brothel opened by the old bustard is like this, but the previous family read pornographic books, after reading it, the approval can still be clear, reading pornographic books is just a feature It\u2019s just a flirtatious thing. The customers shouted that they were cheated and asked for a refund of the whoring money. I am too lazy to run around for this money, the second brothel (oh no, it is an elegant academy) that was once crowded overnight is so deserted that even the dog does not go there, and the passers-by just spit in disgust, the old bustard opened the brothel first Making money in the flesh business and then relying on the reputation of the flesh business to tantalize the appetite.

I'm down for either they just have to actually make that decision commit and be honest with their customers moving forward.\n        That being said I would like to congratulate the devs for making a genuinely good looking game.

escenas algo mas provocativas de lo que juego habitualmente y no le doy rese\u00f1a a todo tipo de juegos, solo los que considero buenos juegos [/b]\n\nel gameplay ya sabemos que es un match-3: es decir, un juego estilo candy crush o gardenscapes pero lo que atrae el juego no es solo el gameplay que si sino algunas historias que se van desbloqueando con el tiempo, me gusta eso!

The animations, character interactions, and fleshed out features all look gorgeous. I am a very big fan of the first game, and while the R-18 content was a big component of that, I truly felt compelled by some of the stories presented through the medium, and I would hope that this game might be able to follow more closely in its predecessors footsteps. Those who felt scammed are totally justified for feeling so, even I had hoped to see some content fleshed out in that way as well.

As a result, those looking for a deep, story-driven experience may be disappointed, but those interested in fan service may still enjoy the game.

"review": "A good tile matching game. It contains multiple different short stories featuring different characters and worlds. Beyond that there is a rogue-like type mode which allows you to adjust the difficulty to your liking and lets you \"squeeze some more juice\" out of this game, so to speak. The graphics are quite good and the character designs are nice. No outright nudity but characters can still get everything but their underwear blown off. There's also a kinda tacked-on mode where you can walk around as the characters and pose them and such. This mode has Steam Workshop support.\n\nThe negative reviews are because coomers got scammed out of a measly couple dollars. I think it was fair on their part to assume this game would be straight up hentai based off the previous game. HOWEVER, I have been following the development of this project since the start and I don't remember seeing the developers explicitly say this game going to be 18+. And when the steam page was revealed I noticed it did not ask for age verification or warn about explicit content. So I didn't expect it to have any. Though I was kind of expecting to see an optional DLC or offsite patch with full nudity pop up at some point but it's whatever. Maybe one day COPIUM\n\nFor what it is, it's worth the price. It's a lightly lewd tile match game with a bit of replay-ability. Don't let the negative reviews dissuade you too much. Those people paid for this game assuming it would be porn but it seems the devs did not plan for it to be.

Actually, they are just minorly shown to you through cutscenes and lines like \"It's been a year since then.\"\nAll I really need is an excuse to interact with cute anime girls, but then, developing those relationships on screen would literally increase the amount of interactions with cute anime girls, which would make it even better.\n\nI'm not joking. The first character's story, Leah, is literally about trying to befriend her to know what are her intentions, since she seems to be a succubus and could be a threat for the world. But that development in the character's relationship is not shown to the player. Only slightly hinted.\nIf the devs made the story bits with characters more predominant in the story mode, showing more of that relationship they want so badly to shown developed, guess what? The [b]PLAYER'S[/b] relationship with the characters would also be changed.\nNow that I've written this, I can see the problem more clearly. Player and Characters relationship are not developed enough. Insane how we figure stuff out by just writting ideas into a notepad. So yeah, that's what I wished for more. Which is pretty much [b]more interaction with cute anime girls[/b].\n\nThe Match-3 Combat is still the same, so it's still solid. And this time there's a rogue-lite mode... which I think requires some balancing. Or maybe I didn't abuse Radiant Gems enough... which does show some unbalancing in its difficulty. Haven't played it enough though, but it's a huge step forward on providing more of the Match-3 Combat.\n\nAlso, I kinda wanted to read the in-game stuff, but everything's too small to read. Come on devs, give some extra options for the game, like increased font size and anything else really.\n\nNow, I understand the review bombing the game is receiving.\nA lot of people were expecting actual sex mechanics like the previous game, which is understandable. And now the devs are saying that that is not going to happen.\nIf that wasn't planned, that was the devs fault for not communicating it properly and the review bombing is totally fair. And they are giving refunds for that but, for what I've read, not through Steam's refund system. I would avoid that, that's weird.\n\n[strike]-And also, so far, I would actually not be bothered if there was sex mechanics on the game, different from the first one[/strike]. I think the biggest problem of the first one for me is that it was just too rapey. Everything was just an excuse to forcefully have sex with the girls, or most of them. But, in this game? That's not the case since there's no sex mechanics in the first place. So instead, it's just interacting with cute anime girls wishing  there was actual sex stuff on the game.\n\nBut then, can I not recommend the game if it is exactly what I expected the first game to be? A minorly lewd game with cute anime girls. We'll see as this game progress in its Early Access. For now, sure. But bear in mind that it does have problems: like DLCs. Literally too many DLCs. At least I won't bother with that Home mode, where I'm sure people would spend [b]A LOT OF TIME[/b] on, if it had sex mechanics on it.\n\n[b]PS[/b]: Ight, so I decided to get some achievements in the first game for... reasons. And to do so, I had to play through some of the sex scenes, which I fucking hated. Even with my girl Hill, I just can't. So I'm striking the part that I say I would not be bothered about that, because, I think I actually would be. So yeah, keep this Ecchi. Don't need to cross the line.\n\n[b]PS2[/b]: BANKRUPTCY? Well, that's not that surprising. Really unfortunate to be honest. I wonder if there will ever be a game like this that will actually finish development, with no Hentai bullshit, get that shit away from me, thank you.

Then again, this is still early access so my hopes are still high for a proper sequel. As of now, the game feels completely different than mirror 1 did. If you're here looking for a sequel for mirror 1, as of right now, you'll be disappointed. If you're here looking for a wholesome story game that happens to use a matching system, I'd recommend this to you. I, as a proper mirror 1 enjoyer, preordered this game back when there was only one story, and I was kind of disappointed by it. Now that I've come back to the game, and seen all the new stories I have to say the storytelling quality has definitely gone up from the previous releases. A little disappointed in the choices, but I can't really complain, cause mirror 1 did this sometimes too. Though, I feel like if I had a golden pistol that kills anomalies I should have the option to shoot the succubus-fox-girl or if I was possessed by an ancient taoist demon I should have the ability to stay possessed and take over the town or what not. <- I got kinda confused on the OSU-type mechanics though. The dragon story I got pretty confused with, and I was kind of disappointed in the interrogation scene. If this was mirror 1, she would have been kidnapped and strapped to a table with the main character grinding her bones with a circular saw but i understand that's a little much to do in 3d so its not all that important to me. The story was a little short, but I only did one ending, the war ending, so maybe it's longer if you help lynn find her notes. Lani and Rita I have not done yet, but when I do I will update my review.\n\nin conclusion: as of right now this game is not a mirror sequel, however it is a good game by itself. A little lacking in the world building department though, I got confused a little bit on a few stories because the world was not properly described. It would be nice if I had some reference to start on so I had an understanding of the foreshadowing in almost every story. On a scale of 1-10 gotta say its about a 6 or a 7, looking forward to where the developers will take the game next keep up the good work. \n\nAs to the people who negative review this game because there's no nudity, go touch grass, go outside, get some vitamin c honestly. do you really need to have 18+ scenes to enjoy a good story? Plus, it's 2$ and they only sell your personal data to the Chinese government <- which is BASED, by the way.\n\nIf you want to discuss anything about the game I will turn comments on so we can communicate about it.", "timestamp_created": 1666767051, "timestamp_updated": 1666767051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496780842542648315", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "124387233": {"recommendationid": "124387233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266666008", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 81, "last_played": 1664229189}, "language": "english", "review": "Where is my adult content?

If you want to buy this game, just save your money and get Mirror 1 instead( If you don't have it already) or Just go on Itch.io for some good H-game( I recommend you try out Once in a Lifetime by caribdis ).

The title \"Mirror\" is just too heavy for this game, when the news that the game don't have NSFW content, it lead to majority of users including me cannot recommend the game to the others. And the developer announce don't have NSFW content after 6 months, providing improper way to refund the game does not help.\n\nIf the developers would like to focus on 16+ contents, better use title which is not same with previous product, changing the title to something like \"Mirrorverse\" is a better way, as it have some character which comes from \"Mirror\", but players can know this game is not same as \"Mirror\". Also, developers can work with Valve and see any possible way to refund with Steam, there are a similar game \"Cyberpunk 2077\" also doing this when lots of users think the deliverable content is not what they want.\n\nIn my personal opinion, it will be much better to bring the NSFW content to the game, no matter using DLC, fan-disk or mod, this will be the best way to make the reviews become positive, and bring back the reputation of developer and publisher. If the developer really give up to take an action, then \"Mirror\" will becomes a title that represents poor quality, dissatisfaction, which is really a pity.\n\nLast but not least, I am starting to play the game, which is good for a game in this price range, but I have to say, I buy the game is for the adult content, story will not be the first place. If I want to buy a story-rich game, I would buy other games instead of this, and many players are not interested the genre of this game, which is a bad choice if developer want to make a high quality game, creating a JRPG is much better than match-3 games.

So i bought it without any hesitation. Not wanting to play the game on early stages I decided to leave it for later, but then i noticed that it has no +18 tags on Steam. I thought that devs will add it later, or maybe make a +18 DLC. However, after months of waiting, devs announced that the game will be +16. \n\nThe problem is that i only bought this game for hentai. So i feel like i got scammed:\n- There was no clear indication that the game will/wont have hentai in it \n\n- I bought it soon after it went in early access, now, i can't request a refund through Steam, cause it's been months since i bought it\n\n- Devs said they will refund the game, but only on their third-party website that requires you to login throught your Steam account. I'm not willing to share my Steam account credentials to Chinese devs, who have already failed it's audience. Besides, according to other people's reviews, they also request other information for a refund like receipt, Alipay account which i dont have, etc. (Can't confirm this since i didnt log in with my Steam account on their website)\n\nI didnt play the game itself, so cant say anything about it (I kept launcher open for 0.3 hours to be able to write this review). So if you are here because you are interested in a match 3 game - you can try it, due to it's low price i think you wont regret buying this.

He told me to try it and l refused cause l saw Mirror was a 2018 game. And till l find out Mirror 2 release this year, l was a bit excited. Frankly speaking, the only reason l bought Mirror 2 is because it is a 18+ game... l have played Mirror 2 for 9 hours. l didn't skip any plot, cause l kind of wanna see what it's like without 18+ DLC. Well, for a game only cost a few bucks, what do you expect? The plot is really just so so. And after l find out the developer say Mirror 2 is only 16+... well, l feel cheated. But l do learn a lesson from this, l will never  ever buy any early access game form now on.

is not 18+ i quickly wanted to say my share about it.\nIt's true that the late notice about the game being 16+ felt a bit like a kick to the dick, but i would say that it's not the main reason for the commotion right now, i feel like it was advertised like a sequel of mirror 1, and obviously it's nothing even remotely close to that, the storytelling has a very different approach that may not be as effective in my opinion, the stories go in the same direction as the first, very different but with an underlining that they are all connected in some way, wich i find preatty neat, but it really does not pack the same punch. To end it all i gotta say that it has still some amazing stories with some amazing characters to match, both in design and personality, but if you came here expecting a sequel of mirror this is just not that tipe of game, better luck elsewhere, but if you came here for the plot well you are in luck.\nAs i said before it does have a different approach then the first one so it may not be your cup of tea but it still has some amazing stories that make the price of it a good fit in my opinion.\nSo overall i would say that it's a nice game just not the sequel we expected or even deserved.\n", "timestamp_created": 1665150205, "timestamp_updated": 1665150205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498261779546737671", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123482564": {"recommendationid": "123482564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339073128", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 49, "last_played": 1643466220}, "language": "english", "review": "scam", "timestamp_created": 1665146462, "timestamp_updated": 1665146462, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123481414": {"recommendationid": "123481414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867829207", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1660234945}, "language": "english", "review": "Overwhelmingly Negative", "timestamp_created": 1665144461, "timestamp_updated": 1665144461, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123477110": {"recommendationid": "123477110", "author": {"steamid": "76561199168598538", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 601, "last_played": 1662080458}, "language": "english", "review": "Junk games, manufacturers quickly shut down, really think that players are willing to play consummation.", "timestamp_created": 1665136020, "timestamp_updated": 1665136020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511930584907531738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123475360": {"recommendationid": "123475360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097248804", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1655962186}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a genuine sequel to Mirror, this is not the game for you", "timestamp_created": 1665132241, "timestamp_updated": 1665132241, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520087718963623047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123474559": {"recommendationid": "123474559", "author": {"steamid": "76561199099538219", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1647686374}, "language": "english", "review": "A fucking fraud is what NJICO is, a fucking fraud", "timestamp_created": 1665130577, "timestamp_updated": 1665130577, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501692056655883789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123473761": {"recommendationid": "123473761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042589714", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 439, "last_played": 1678525401}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow i'm really confused. As of now, this game is at 2% positive reviews in the recent reviews, 46,000 people.\n\nSo I guess the first Mirror was an 18+ hentai game, and everyone is upset this game doesn't have that content. Which sure, I guess that does make sense and is understandable.\n\nYet, all this negativity for fairly high quality game that is only 2 USD? Every time I look at the page it's on sale as well making it even less. I don't even play puzzle games much at all anymore, yet I did think this one was nice enough looking and interesting enough to keep playing for a while.\n\nIt's just kind of disappointing that despite the pretty high quality of the game vs. the cost, everyone is dunking hard on it for not having 18+ content. This kind of review bombing just seems inappropriate to me.\n\nI hope the devs keep working on this, it's a very nice game despite all the negativity IMO.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665128730,

I got a lot of enjoyment out of the original so it was an insta-buy for me when they announced the early access for this game. It was so cheap that I also decided to buy almost every single piece of dlc that came out after to support the devs only for them to announce now that it will be a 16+ game, no porn. Way to betray the people that made the original (and this one) such a success guys! Excellent business move!\n\nNow, they DID announce a refund program. However... it is through a 3rd party website that requires you to log in with your steam credentials. Now, it's probably fine, apparently this is somehow done through steam and your credentials are not leaked (I think ProtonDB does the same) but I'm not savvy enough to know for sure and the money lost is not really worth the risk. So I guess I'll stick around and see what the \"12 stories\" are about (writing is not awful but nothing that great either). What I do promise is that I'm NEVER buying anything else from these devs again unless this becomes what 99% of people bought it for: an 18+ porn game.\n\nI'm editing this cause I realized what the worst part of this is: There are several interactive scenes (especially in the first  story) that are clearly meant to be sex scenes but have placeholder scenes instead: There's a \"thermometer\" scene that's obviously meant to be a blowjob, a \"back massage\" that is obviously meant to be doggy style, and a \"foot massage\" that is obviously meant to be a footjob. Seriously, you can even see some suspicious stains on the girl's clothes appear after the \"foot massage\". This being an 18+ game was obviously the plan from the start. If they had come out and said something like \"hey, our government is cracking down on adult content, sorry, change of plans\", I would totally get it and still stand behind the devs. But that's not what happened now, is it? They released a statement implying that 16+ was always the plan and arrogantly compared themselves to CDPR (or well aspired to be). You (the devs) have demonstrated great talent at making porn games (this game was clearly meant to be one too) and that's what people are buying your games for. You don't need to make the next \"Witcher 3\" to be successful game devs, you just need to not screw over the fanbase you made. Hell, had you named this something different than Mirror 2 and made it clear it wasn't an H game, I'd probably still have bought it. Again, just to be clear: either make this game what it was always meant to be (don't lie, those scenes are clearly supposed to be sex scenes) or you are never getting another cent from me and I hope most people you screwed over do the same.\n\nWith that being said, if you don't care about any of the 18+ stuff this is actually a lot of content for very little money if you want simple match 3 and cute anime girls. If you DO actually want great 18+ content just buy Mirror and it's extra content DLC (best content is in the DLC imo).", "timestamp_created": 1665114443, "timestamp_updated": 1665116098, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572751343250274658", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123466923": {"recommendationid": "123466923", "author": {"steamid": "76561199337605510", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 96, "last_played": 1661993564}, "language": "english", "review": "The age rating of the game was not stated when it was released, which misled a large number of players.More than that, after being denounced by a large number of players, the game official hypocritically released a third-party refund website that bypassed the supervision of the steam platform.The third-party website requires the players who apply for refunds to enter the account password of steam platform and Alipay, which seriously infringes the players' personal rights.In some forums, there are instances where players are stolen after they enter the steam account password on the refund website!\nI think the game company completely constitutes a fraud against the players, and the attitude is extremely bad, and even wants to steal the personal information of the players.To sum up, although this is a small expense, I don't want such a game company to get even a little income!", "timestamp_created": 1665112563, "timestamp_updated": 1665112563, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530148804187774658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123466351": {"recommendationid": "123466351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000712394", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1557, "last_played": 1651343635}, "language": "english", "review": "ok guys, dont waste your money on this bs. just move on and find something else to play", "timestamp_created": 1665111413, "timestamp_updated": 1665111413, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123464836": {"recommendationid": "123464836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263107120", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1211, "last_played": 1662898736}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a complete fraud.

Looking at what statement they released and next game they \"plan\" to launch it does not seem they understand the magnitude of the error at hand.

They waited for people to be well past the steam refund date, waited for people to buy the DLCs and spend money on a game they thought was coming, before finally coming \"clean\". \n\nThey are simply riding the coattails of a successful game. As you can read in other recent reviews, they are incredibly shady, using a 3rd party website to offer refunds. Even if you don't care about the 18+ content, the way this developer has conducted themselves is enough to not recommend this.

For just a dollar or so, this game is an animated visual novel with different characters and ending. At the core is a match-3 game. The decisions I made would lead to different ending. The story is great. The artwork is beautiful. There is a lot of replayability just to explore different decision trees while enjoying the match-3 game. Sure, this is not a p0rn game. Neither was Mirror 1 (the NSFW patch was made by users). I have no problem with that. I mean, there are way better p0rn games elsewhere. I have no intention for a refund and hence, I can't relate to the whole refund fiasco. Even as the refund mechanism is questionable - as it may well be constrained by Steam refund policy - I review this game as-is. I.e. do I or do I not enjoy playing this game.

This goes from a qualified thumbs-down to an unqualified \"DO NOT BUY THIS\" until the developer comes back and shows they're still working on the game.  Original review follows below:\n\nThis game is still in Early Access, quite a while after I initially purchased it.  In that time, it has slowly released new characters, but each character is the same:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Slightly branched, but ultimately linear flow chart as you work through levels.\n    [*]Match three game play that feels slower and slightly less balanced than the original Mirror.\n    [*]Enough risque and suggestive content that you wouldn't play it anywhere you wouldn't play an +18 game, but no +18 content.\n    [*]A relatively unengaging story, with colorful characters and adequate Japanese voice acting.\n[/list]\n\nI was excited about Mirror 2 because Mirror was a great match-3 game that had great gameplay, great art, great balance and great characters.  It wasn't Shakespeare, but it was a great match-3 game with adult content that was fun to play.\n\nThis game originally was supposed to be a Kickstarter project that from the Kickstarter page was the same \"Classic combination of love simulator and match-3\", but the developers have just come out and said this sequel is a 16+ (not 18+) game, and so you now get the classic combination of a match-3 game with some cheesy 3D beach house mode where you can snap photos of your 3D girls, but only with skimpy clothing on, never anything that would be worse than 16+.\n\nThe developer's investment of time and money into home mode and selling DLCs for additional outfits, instead of staying true to Mirror as a sequel that builds on the first game is a frustrating turn of events, and creates at best an adequate match-3 game with an uncomfortable amount of \"almost 18+\" panty shots and near nipslips content without ever actually having any nudity.  It's annoying cheesecake that I'm not sure who it's for, but that's the content this EA game is shaping into.\n\nIf the idea of a match 3 that looks like an 18+ game, but doesn't actually ever cross the line into 18+ sounds like a good idea...wait a year or so for the additional characters and stages to be added, the gameplay to be tuned, and maybe you'll have a pale imitation of Mirror to consider purchasing.  For now, I'd say get Mirror without the 18+ pack and you've got a much better game that's fully baked.  If you want the 18+ content, that also exists for Mirror now, and makes the original Mirror one of the best 18+ games I've ever played.\n\nThis?  This game is a game that could have potential if the developers weren't foolish enough to decide that 16+ was the direction to go.\n\nTheir decisions around Mirror Home, Mirror Project Y and Z and shutting down the workshop all prove that the developers are out of touch with, and don't care about, their audience.\n\nMaybe this game can save itself over time...the recent reviews for the game are \n[strike]97% \"Overwhelmingly Negative (35,155)\"\n[/strike] 98% \"Overwhelmingly Negative (54,848)\" as I [strike]write[/strike] update this review...so maybe the developers can see how badly they are handling things.  But I don't have much hope.  I spent a decent number of hours trying to find something worth my purchase price here...but I cannot recommend this game in it's current form.\n\nNote:  I have not spent as many hours in the game as the review suggests, one additional weakness Mirror 2 has over Mirror is a separate launcher to open either the Match-3 game or the Mirror Home world from a separate launcher.  Forget to close the launcher after closing the game and Steam will keep adding hours played while the launcher is open.", "timestamp_created": 1664752043, "timestamp_updated": 1668803458, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546116530895233154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123253438": {"recommendationid": "123253438", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182077470", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 48, "last_played": 1642765147}, "language": "english", "review": "this game looks like illegal fund raising", "timestamp_created": 1664750734, "timestamp_updated": 1664750734, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123251407": {"recommendationid": "123251407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198860292186", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 339, "last_played": 1662231685}, "language": "english", "review": "No 18+ content coming.

I've bought it for like 1 or 2 USD as a spiritual successor to Mirror 1, which was one of the best 18+ puzzles to be found on Steam, so naturally I was thinking that new 18+ game on UE4 will be quite pleasant.\nYet devs had decided to announce 16+ rating only after almost a year after release, which is, frankly, irritating.

I sincerely demand a a legal refund on steam of this game and its DLCs, as well as a ban or a penalty on these producers.\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u5f15\u8bf1\u4e70\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6210\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u901a\u77e5\u4e70\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a16+\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6210\u4eba\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u76f4\u5230\u6628\u5929\u5236\u4f5c\u4eba\u624d\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5df2\u7ecf\u662fEA\u53d1\u5e03\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u7684\u4e8b\u4e86\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u975e\u514d\u8d39\u7684DLC\u4e86\u3002\u8ddf\u9a97\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8981\u94b1\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u533a\u522b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u751f\u4ea7\u5546\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u9000\u6b3e\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u975e\u6cd5\u6536\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u8d2d\u4e70\u8005\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6211\u771f\u8bda\u5730\u8981\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u9000\u6b3e\u84b8\u6c7d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u5b83\u7684DLC\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7981\u4ee4\u6216\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1664596647, "timestamp_updated": 1664596647, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123119277": {"recommendationid": "123119277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294931170", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 320, "last_played": 1642848896}, "language": "english", "review": "no R18", "timestamp_created": 1664596646, "timestamp_updated": 1664596646, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123119140": {"recommendationid": "123119140", "author": {"steamid": "76561199006946439", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1655112038}, "language": "english", "review": "You are cheating others !!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1664596515, "timestamp_updated": 1664596515, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123119079": {"recommendationid": "123119079", "author": {"steamid": "76561199098493018", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 310, "last_played": 1643441944}, "language": "english", "review": "-rep", "timestamp_created": 1664596456, "timestamp_updated": 1664596523, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123118695": {"recommendationid": "123118695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198209365033", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1663425445}, "language": "english", "review": "bad game \n", "timestamp_created": 1664596048, "timestamp_updated": 1664596048, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123117715": {"recommendationid": "123117715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048013748", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 87, "last_played": 1642772904}, "language": "english", "review": "What a fucking joke, I waited for seggs and this is what I get?

This Video game equivalent of Halloween III. It's a really good game for what it is. but as a 16+ squeal to an 18+ H-game it has generated a lot of salt. Like I said it's a great game but not the squeal it's audience wanted or expected. Still it is worth playing.\n\nHoly cow how dose a match 3 get this much effort put into it I will never know. Good anime style graphics, great story writing and a bit of suggestive edge to most of it. Easily the best match 3 game you can get. \n\nAnd then the completely unexpected addition of an exploitable island was a really neat treat. But like many others who played the original game, I was still wondering. Were is the 18+ content. Hoping it would be implemented soon.\n\nIn reality it was never intended to have that content from the start. The devs set out to make a 16+ game with some suggestive content. And on that it dose deliver. Very well.\n\nThe problem is the games store page makes it look like it could have 18+ content and while the devs never said it would in any marketing or descriptions it did have the #Nudity and #Sexual Content tags. But so dose Mortal Kombat and a slew of other 16+ games. More to that point since this was a squeal to an 18+ H-game most assumed this would be as well and while the Devs never said it would have 18+ content they also epic failed by not saying it wouldn't have 18+ content.\n\nThis has led many who purchased the game (many fans of the previous game I surmise.) to be quite salty and retaliatory in response. However the devs have tried to apologist as best they could and offered to refund any copies purchased prior to Sep 29 2022. They have also removed the #Nudity and #sexual Content tags from the game the same day.\n\nPersonalty I would I have liked it to have 18+ Content. But it not being there doesn't take away from the game. And should the devs been more upfront about it's lack of content? Definitely!  But they did do something to try and make things rite. maybe only because they got caught. Maybe not. But that's more then EA would have done.", "timestamp_created": 1664580617, "timestamp_updated": 1664580617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478056073188781738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123105670": {"recommendationid": "123105670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132173690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1654228268}, "language": "english", "review": "18+ sequal game with 16+ contents brhh", "timestamp_created": 1664579730, "timestamp_updated": 1664579730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123105294": {"recommendationid": "123105294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031718939", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 52, "last_played": 1644596580}, "language": "english", "review": "Imagine if HuniePop 2 had no 18+ content, this is that.\n\nOh and they take all your Steam personal information (password, payments, etc.) when you want a refund.

They made it clear at the outset that it was a sequel, and rather guidedly vague the question of \"is there restrictive content\", which I believe most people bought because of it, because without restrictive content, then the game is a vulgar entertainment + industrial script (no novelty story and faded clich\u00e9s). There are many excellent visual novels in this world, and there are also many new ways to play and have fun, and it is highly recommended that you do not waste your precious life in this gimmick game that is outside the golden jade and loses in it.\nAlthough the official gave a refund route, but just like the wild dog absolutely refuses to spit out the meat he has swallowed, the mere need to fill in personal information for the refund is very suspicious, is the official expecting us to believe in a liar again? So I recommend that you use PayPal refund, because that one doesn't seem to require filling in the details.\n\nLos siguientes comentarios los escribir\u00e9 en cuatro de los idiomas m\u00e1s hablados del mundo:\nLos creadores de juegos son mentirosos sin fondo, como especuladores especulativos. Dejaron claro al principio que era una secuela, y bastante vaga la cuesti\u00f3n de \"\u00bfhay contenido restrictivo?\", que creo que la mayor\u00eda de la gente compr\u00f3 por ello, porque sin contenido restrictivo, entonces el juego es un entretenimiento vulgar + gui\u00f3n industrial (sin historia novedosa y clich\u00e9s desvanecidos). Hay muchas novelas visuales excelentes en este mundo, y tambi\u00e9n hay muchas formas nuevas de jugar y divertirse, y es muy recomendable que no desperdicies tu preciosa vida en este juego efectista que est\u00e1 fuera del jade dorado y pierde en \u00e9l.\nAunque el funcionario dio una ruta de reembolso, pero al igual que el perro salvaje se niega absolutamente a escupir la carne que ha tragado, la mera necesidad de completar la informaci\u00f3n personal para el reembolso es muy sospechosa, \u00bfel funcionario espera que volvamos a creer en un mentiroso? Por lo tanto, le recomiendo que use PayPal reembolso, porque ese no parece requerir completar los detalles.\n\nLes commentaires suivants que j\u2019\u00e9crirai dans quatre des langues les plus parl\u00e9es dans le monde:\nLes fabricants de jeux sont des menteurs sans fond, comme des profiteurs sp\u00e9culatifs. Ils ont clairement indiqu\u00e9 au d\u00e9part qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une suite, et plut\u00f4t vaguement la question de \u00ab\u00a0y a-t-il un contenu restrictif\u00a0\u00bb, que je crois que la plupart des gens ont achet\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de cela, car sans contenu restrictif, alors le jeu est un divertissement vulgaire + script industriel (pas d\u2019histoire de nouveaut\u00e9 et de clich\u00e9s fan\u00e9s). Il y a beaucoup d\u2019excellents romans visuels dans ce monde, et il y a aussi beaucoup de nouvelles fa\u00e7ons de jouer et de s\u2019amuser, et il est fortement recommand\u00e9 de ne pas gaspiller votre pr\u00e9cieuse vie dans ce jeu gimmick qui est en dehors du jade dor\u00e9 et perd dedans.\nBien que le fonctionnaire ait donn\u00e9 un itin\u00e9raire de remboursement, mais tout comme le chien sauvage refuse absolument de cracher la viande qu\u2019il a aval\u00e9e, le simple besoin de remplir des informations personnelles pour le remboursement est tr\u00e8s suspect, le fonctionnaire s\u2019attend-il \u00e0 ce que nous croyions \u00e0 nouveau en un menteur?

Second, it isn't what the first mirror game players would expect, as everyone knows, sex sells, this is like if Riley Reid suddenly started making anti abortion fundraisers. Finally and the most important thing, is that yesterday, the developers sent a message, talking about a \"full refund\" and many other reviews also explained that the website makes you fill in your steam login information and payment information, under the reason \"contacting steam for refund\", which could be done simply within steam. This just made me mad because I felt sorry for the small dev team that they have who worked hard on this, but this news just made me turn my feelings to disgust.\n\n\nTLDR: First game is great, second game kinda ass, developers tries to scam people", "timestamp_created": 1664066132, "timestamp_updated": 1664602754, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595594882965087891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122737778": {"recommendationid": "122737778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202400600", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 243, "last_played": 1693317071}, "language": "english", "review": "goob", "timestamp_created": 1664018910, "timestamp_updated": 1664018910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471880912780761719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122676037": {"recommendationid": "122676037", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983769618", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 82, "last_played": 1663365147}, "language": "english", "review": "blueballs simulator", "timestamp_created": 1663925206, "timestamp_updated": 1663925206, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530593395233154297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122597946": {"recommendationid": "122597946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250703832", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 80, "last_played": 1663791148}, "language": "english", "review": "Lewd content and ''armor piercing/enrage'' mechanic, as well as dialogue options having tactical modifiers on combat (and there is little of them) that made the original Mirror so great are missing so far.\n    But knowing the dedication of devs to their projects and after seeing the polish given to everything added so far I would recommend supporting this project.

offer so far. the story mode for the characters is very strangely paced and confusing, and the character models are all kind of wonky and poorly made. stuff like lynn's eyes being very far apart, leah's ears are visible despite having headphones hovering above them, etc. this seems like nitpicking but this is the current main draw for the game. thats literally the only thing this game has to offer - looking at cute 3D models in inconsistent quality of animation and solving puzzles. so when the models themselves can't even be looked at without me noticing i could fit an entire hamburger on one of the character's noses and still see her eyes its a little distracting. the voice acting is actually pretty great but i wish i could find the credits for who voices what character somewhere in game. caiyun is the best character by far. her story is interesting, her model is adorable, and her world and puzzles are fun. the actual puzzle game part is kind of confusing to me, it seems like your points and items you earn do not transfer over to the next game, but maybe im just being stupid and they do and i'm missing something. it seems like a lot of this game is being rushed even though theyre taking so long to add the promised characters they announced.\n\ni have played mirror 1, i purchased the dlc for this game, and i somehow spent 14 hours thus far in an nsfw puzzle game with only 4 characters so far. im not going to talk about the lack of explicit content because i'm aware of how hard its becoming for chinese companies to publish porn games, the lack of explicit content is not why i feel negatively about this game. if you have to back out of doing pornagraphic content, actually beef up making your models cuter and your game better. theres tons of cool unlockable art, a cosplay album, a nice ost, lots of stuff to show there is actual love behind this game - but the actual models in game are really suffering from the level of care a game like this should have since, again, thats the entire point of the game as it stands. if you have to not do porn, make the rest of the game really good and worth the money you charge for the dlc. the costumes aren't worth buying if the models look wonky in them.", "timestamp_created": 1661584404, "timestamp_updated": 1661584404, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536359190940856934",

Whilst it did have its fair share of problems, in retrospect it was definitely one of the more defining H games out there.\n\nThe most defining difference in this game is the use of fully animated 3D graphics. Whilst its not AAA levels of detail, it is still of an excellent quality. This change helps convey the emotions of the characters much better than just text like in the original. \n\nThe voice acting in this game is a considerable step up from the original. Whilst there was some very talented VAs in the previous game, some was quite amateurish, making the quality inconsistent at places. The VA for the characters so far do a pretty good job (except Norman, which is unfortunately quite bad). The dialogue doesn't feel natural at times but is not glaringly so. The translation for English and Chinese feels much smoother than the previous game.\n\nIn terms of the story quality itself, having a story tree with various endings is an excellent design approach. The option to explore multiple endings that aren't just limited to pain and pleasure really opens up the depth to the story. For the character's so far, Leah's is pretty good, Lani's was a little abstract, but still solid.\n\nThe final character is one of my - and I'm sure most people's - most anticipated character. Cai Yun. She featured one of the best story in the previous game, and I was very hyped to see it's continuation. Unfortunately, there seems to be a time skip, and it didn't feel like a continuation of her story, more of just a different variation. The story itself was pretty solid, although I do think it pales in comparison to the story of Mirror 1. Since this was the newest character, her story tree was barely developed, and the main branch felt quite short and unfulfilling. However, I'm sure this would be expanded upon in the future.\n\nAside from the main story, you can read pieces of lore as a drop from each level. The contents are very interesting, but it felt pretty bland reading it purely as text. Whilst I appreciate it might not be possible to accompany all lore pieces with a CG or cut-scenes, some different ways of presenting these lore pieces would make it much more engaging.\n\nNext, the biggest problem with this game. It will not contain any H scenes. This is more than just me needing to go to horny jail, but as weird as it sounds, the IDENTITY of Mirror was very much thanks to the H scenes. Mirror 1 is a masterpiece because it was a H game where everything surrounding it was polished to perfection, so what is Mirror 2? Not the story nor the gameplay has that much an appeal to a new player, and if this was not a Mirror sequel, I would surely not be recommending this. As unfortunate as it might be, the developers more or less confirmed that this game will not have any H scenes. Due to this reason, I will say that as a Mirror 1 player, get this game. But if you haven't played Mirror 1, this game will hold no charm to you.\n\nThe music in this game didn't leave that much of an impression on me. I won't present this as a bad point since I didn't find them unenjoyable at all, but considering some of the legendary tracks in the prequel, it was a small yet bitter shame.\n\nFinally I will talk about the gameplay. It is more or less similar to Mirror 1, with a change on the rage mechanic. Progression is only present in the same story (account progression do not carry over between stories). I am personally not a fan of this, but it is not too much of a bother. The gameplay is different, I can't say there are any visible upgrades from the prequel, but there is two moderate downgrades. \n\nFirstly, the animation of the gems being cancelled out felt very glass-like and light. It doesn't really bring the same level of satisfaction and epicness as when you get a massive combo as before. This is not the only reason it feels unsatisfying to play. Since this is no longer a H game, all clothing tear are completely removed. This was also one of the iconic identities of the previous game, and having this gone makes the gameplay feel empty. \n\nSecondly, connecting 3 gems has no effects. It was one of my favourite things to do in the previous game, and I was fully expecting a unique animation (even more, a unique animation for each character would be amazing!), but unfortunately, nothing happens. Shattering the gems themselves also didn't feel like you are bringing a powerful explosion, more like breaking a glass panel (see previous point).\n\nI do feel like the need to mention, one aspect that some may consider an upgrade is that during the fight, the enemy's signature ability gets a unique cut-scene animation. I am indifferent about this mainly due to the fact that it feels exactly like a cut-scene - it doesn't feel like it flows with the fight, but rather forcibly sewn onto it. It's not obnoxious enough to ruin the flow of gameplay, just that it doesn't feel impressive.\n\nIn conclusion, this game does not live up to the prequel's name, and even with all the changes suggested, it would only elevate it's status from \"Original Mirror players should also try this\" to \"This is pretty fun for original Mirror players.\" I still don't see its appeal as an independent game. In attempting to change too much from the original, the game lost its core identity, and it is clear that we are far past the point of bringing the energy of the original game back. With a reluctant heart I will still recommend this game from an objective point of view, but personally I still feel disappointed due to how differently the game could have turned out.",

Most of them are bashing the developers for removing R-18 content due to their country laws in relation to adult content and its complete ban. However, I believe this game has a lot more than that going for it.\n\nMirror 2 is match-3 type of game where you are greeted with awesome-looking and detailed mmd models, great visuals, fantastic animations, decent voice acting and solid gameplay. To top it off, the game has multiple endings FOR EACH STORYLINE you play! This game has improved in every single department compared to its predecessor and it is an eye candy that I can't get enough of. What's more, at this price point it is AN ABSOLUTE STEAL! I'd be willing to pay a lot more for this knowing the amount of detail and effort put into it. I liked this game quite a lot more than HuniePop 2 that released earlier this year despite the fact that it does not feature any R-18 content. Yes, the themes are somewhat suggestive but they don't go overboard which makes it easy to recommend to those who consciously avoid or feel uncomfortable playing R-18 games. \n\nUpdate: there is 'home' where you can control the characters, explore the location and find new poses and points of interest. So, it's basically two games in one which is even more INSANE. However, 'home' right now doesn't have much content and the characters and their postures are somewhat limited in how you can customize them. Feel free to exlore at any time, no R-18 content as of now.\n\nNote for fellow Lowspec Laptop / PC Gamers like me: the game is somewhat graphically intense featuring really detailed models and some fancy visual effects so keep in mind that this won't run smoothly on any random potato PC. You need to at least have 2 cores / 4 threads clocked reasonably ( at least slightly above 2Ghz ) and a capable graphics cards ( at least Vega 3 in double channel / any discrete graphics cards above GT730 GDDR5 variant ). \nMy specs: Athlon Gold 3150U 2 cores (4 threads) + Vega 3 (in double channel) = 1080P lowest -> 15-25 fps, 720p low -> 30-40 fps. I didn't exactly see the fps counter, but I'm pretty sure the numbers are close to real results. Is it playable? Yes, but you have to compromise some visual fidelity for that. Just a friendly warning and something to keep in mind for those who play on lowspec machines like mine :)\n\nDo I recommend this game? 'YES! YES! YES! YES! ...

first review I've ever left on Steam, but I think other buyers need to know this.  Not all adult games are bought by young boys 'playing' by themselves.  My wife and I got this game because we really enjoyed playing the first one together.  It was easy for her to pick up for somebody that doesn't play video games, and was also a fun time we could have together as adults.  We were excited for this and picked it up during the Steam Summer sale.  Unfortunately, we're both a bit disappointed.  While it's a beautiful game.  much more so then even the original, I wish more was done to let people know that there is no adult content in here.  Needless to say we both grew bored of this quickly and were really missing that part of the original experience.

Three different stories seem to be written by different authors/directors, they have different styles so that Mirror 2 offers a very diversified and immersive experience. The stories themselves are interesting, although I think the pace of some important parts are too quick (for example, the event before Caiyun's last battle) - adding more narratives or dialogues might help.\n\nThe gameplay part is also excellent. I never expected a minigame can be so interesting and strategic. The gameplay is basically a turn-based 3-elimination game, with a JRPG-like combat system. The GFX and SFX are also of top qualities.\n\nHowever, the challenge mode still needs great improvement. First, the balance of items is too broken: some items are so good and they almost immediately ensures victory. Second, player is stronger in level 2, but the enemies are not - it will make level 2 much less challenging. Third, although we choose one character for the challenge mode, but we cannot see any related graphics and hear any voices about the chosen main character through the gameplay.

It's called \"hentai\". Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college. Who knows, I might be the one writing the subtitles in the future. Oh, and one last thing, you should know that hentai's considered pretty mainstream in Japan now, and it's also quite common in the western world too now. Everyone's watching it. I mean, if I don't watch it, I'll be seen as some sort of freak at school. You don't want your son to be some kind of pariah because he doesn't watch hentai, do you?", "timestamp_created": 1657556251, "timestamp_updated": 1657556251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47752806544303894", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118632139": {"recommendationid": "118632139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032589393", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 315, "last_played": 1698885754}, "language": "english", "review": "Insane value for money imo, great match 3 gameplay and fun stories.

of the way - there are not NSFW scenes in this game. It is possible that the devs may add them at a later date, but  they may also not for reasons I will explain.\n\nLike the first game, Mirror 2 consists of you passing through the shards of a mirror into disjointed, parallel worlds where various drama is taking place, which you solve by playing bejeweled. This game puts a much bigger emphasis on story than its predecessor, which is likely why the devs did not add the H-scenes. While that is slightly disappointing the truth is that erotic content would just get in the way, and honestly the game is better for it. \n\nThe greater emphasis on story also means that Mirror 2 takes a different graphical approach than Mirror. Where the first one had static yet detailed 2-dimensonal drawings, Mirror 2 is almost entirely in 3D, akin to Honkai Impact or RWBY. Despite this, the game keeps the same aesthetic from the first game, and when combined with the environments it looks beautiful. Still, some people have been turned off by it, so make of it what you will.\n\nMirror was known for having a variety of characters from various worlds, and this game is no different.

Would make a great FULL game with the characters, stories, music, and overall graphics. Sadly it is barred behind a set up of candy crush. If developers realize the potential this holds and maybe increase price and budget, we could have a game on par with many upcoming anime games. Either way it still is enjoyable for a story, similar to an interactive show where your input matters. A system of branches allow you to go back and finish all the different endings and possibilities. Rewards are art and items for you progress through the Candy Crush like minigame. Much like the previous game same mechanics with minor alterations. The story is heavily entertaining, too me at least, and I find all the characters having a personality you can either relate to or connect/empathize. So far have only finished two but have loved it. If you came for R-18+ because of previous game, not here. Maybe once it comes out of early access they might add it, but so far for a cheap price hella nice. There is also a challenge mode that is in the main game that I have yet to try, but if it is worth mentioning I will come back and edit this review to share a quick summary. I did just mention a main game, and that is because there is a second \"game\" which is a sort of photo taking island. You can change outfits, do poses, go in or near certain objects. Personally, I don't really care to much for it but others might. There are mods and the capability for mods in this second \"game\" if one wishes for some custom-custom experiences. For the DLCS, they are cheap and support the devs, which does not hurt. I got them all and they seem not necessary but a nice cheap add on.\n\nTLDR: Good game with great graphics, writing, cinematic, characters, and music. Some slight ecchi in some certain areas. Multiple game modes/games.\nHorny- Wait for full release to see if added. Or try it out in the first bit and refund... its like 2 bucks and the content is worth imo. \nNot Horny- Get it and enjoy the few stories added so far, obviously not finished so there is much more to come. Might have even been some early hints in the Leah's story of what to expect ;).\n\nEdit: Challenge mode is pretty neat. Its a simple, what im assuming endless, branch-like board game set up like you would find in a mobile gacha game. You have 1-3 options of a path to go to that offer different scenarios. A heal, maybe an item, event, and of course the funny candy crush. Is it top tier game play? Preference really, but if you love the game enough and cannot wait for more story its perfect for wasting away time. From the short bit I played, I did not notice any immediate rewards other than items and passives/skills for further challenge progression. There must be something a player earns from playing though, whether its a cosmetic for the little house \"game\" or items for the main stories idk. Maybe later this is how you unlock scenes if you know what I mean ;). Again though, no one knows if they will ever add those so don't cope too hard. Just try it yourself if you want more info on it really.", "timestamp_created": 1656825921, "timestamp_updated": 1658213308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565831780433654785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "118106086": {"recommendationid": "118106086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995097805", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 415, "last_played": 1656822089}, "language": "english", "review": "Why so many \"moral dilemma\"?

It's currently just two characters (was just one character when I bought it) and they're adding to it as time goes by.   The base game is very cheap, and the DLC they're currently selling is not needed to enjoy the game.  You might want to buy the DLC anyway as a means to support the developers who are still working on this game though.\n\nSo for those who don't know (maybe you didn't play the original game?) this is basically a story with some match-3 battle modes in it.  If you played the first game you know what to expect, but so far the content is much tamer as far as sex is concerned (I'm OK with that.)  There's still pretty much the same system as the first game: a physical attack, a magic attack, a heal for yourself, and some matches increase your power to allow you to use special tools to do additional damage or heals. \n\nThis time the story branches out due to choices you make as you play and the challenges may be different depending on those choices.  Of course you'll want to go back and experience all branches of the story, and it doesn't take long to go back through and play another game till you can make the other choice you didn't take. The animation and voice acting is pretty good, and in some cases you have a minute or two of watching the cutscene before you can even play.  They ARE skippable if all you want is to match some symbols and get points but you should probably watch them at least once so you have an idea of what's going on.\n\nSo far, the challenge is pretty light.  Maybe it'll get more difficult later, but from my experience so far, it's been fairly easy, though there IS a challenge mode now where you take on some random enemies and that IS harder.  If all you care is to find out more about the story, then the difficulty probably suits you fine.  If you're looking for a serious challenge or lots of fun then maybe you will want to wait for the game's full release (at which time I'll revisit this review and edit it if I remember). \n\nThe graphics are actually pretty good, the story could be a bit more fleshed out but it's somewhat interesting.  I think some of the writing suffers from the developers having to think of how to fit in another combat session in some of the story bits.  Maybe they can rework the story a bit later?\n\nOverall, I'd say that for $2 (or less on sale) it's worth that much at least. I'm still looking forward to the rest of the game being finished, but I'm glad they're not trying to release it all at once and instead are just adding more levels to it as they go along.   If the idea of buying an unfinished game bothers you, then wait.  Otherwise, the price isn't so much that you're being ripped off.  There's at least $2 worth of content in it now and it'll only get better as they add to it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1656203523, "timestamp_updated": 1656203523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623931586742401123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117609773": {"recommendationid": "117609773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077088440", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 53, "last_played": 1675389787}, "language": "english", "review": "This game blew me away.

This game isn't like the first one.... Not at all. Am I dissapointed? Nope![/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZZxoaI_gTc\nWhat I meant with this? There are no \"Doki Doki\" scenes and you are not doing \"Doki Doki\" with the girls. The gameplay is still the same tho. It is a Bejeweled clone: You match +3 Gems together and activate their effects. You can either heal yourself, attack (magic/melee) or regenerate mana (to use special abilities). When you finish a level you get money, which you can use to buy stronger abilities or level up your character! \n\nLike I said... Still the same as the old one in these regards!\n\nWhat really blew me away tho was the fact that the storytelling has become so much better. The story for each girl feels shorter, but there are more than only 2 endings for each (unlike the first one). Replayability is given! Each story arcs are as heartbreaking and enjoyable as you might know from the first game. Rollercoaster of emotions! The graphics (3DG) is also really impressive. Even the expressions are on point.\n\nAnother reason to get into this might be the \"Home\" mode. It is a small island you can walk around with your favourite girl. Dress her as you like and do photos. The photo mode is impressive and has lots of options. You can even make your own poses. There is even mod support to add custom 3D models so don't forget to check out the Workshop!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2825774065\n[code]All in all this game is really nice and totally worth the price. It is still not completed and far from it. They add things with regular updates, but it will take some time to get to the final release. So far there are only 3 girls. There also might be a R18+ Patch someday, but who knows.... I can assure that the game is already worth the asked price![/code]", "timestamp_created": 1656173297, "timestamp_updated": 1656173357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 258, "votes_funny": 15,

I puzzle-battled her twice, then she went evil spirit mode and tried to convince me i was being used by my work colleagues or whatever then... it ended. wtf? I felt like i parachuted down on a sinking ship and briefly befriended the crew right before everyone drowned. No heads or tails to the story.\n\nThe other one was about... idk i skipped most of it because i wanted to play the puzzle part. But there was a girl that came into my magic apartment and then there was a genie or some shit in a lamp and then she got possessed and then she was dirty and i had to click on the screen and then i quit.\n\nI'm not going to refund a 50c game that I've played for an hour because that's a dick move, but I'm probably never touching this game again. And to be fair the puzzle game is kinda fun. There's a reason bejewed is cloned so much. I already had my 50c's worth. \n\nAnyway, this game is definitively not for me.

On the other hand, Mirror 2 has no H-scenes, which is somewhat dissapointing but they have changed that in order to tell you a more deep story with beautiful animations. They are putting a lot of love on each thing they do. The puzzles, the mini games and the Home feature are nice.\n\nThey changed from the usual VN japanese anime/manga art style to cel shading animated characters. The game is running on Unreal Engine 4, which makes the game look amazing. I won't say that the game has the best graphics ever, but is very well done.\n\nVoice acting is good, music is nice too and the game has a very low price, so you can't go wrong by getting this game. The final product will include like 5 basic stories and maybe later, some DLC's. They also included some art and cosplay pictures by purchasing the game. The quality of the cosplays, the pictures and the art/sketches are top notch.\n\nMaybe is not the H-game that I expected, but they have nailed with these changes and I support the path where the devs are going to.", "timestamp_created": 1655499305, "timestamp_updated": 1655499305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "117143330": {"recommendationid": "117143330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295739880", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30, "last_played": 1655496685}, "language": "english", "review": "So, as a person who played Mirror 1 for over 10 hours I must say that I'm pretty disappointed.

I wanted to scratch my HuniePop itch (which I'm a fan of) and the game does just that. \n\nThe story is super short and with the flowchart option, which I'm very grateful for, makes going back to make different role play choices easy since I'd hate to go back and refight the previous puzzle fights just to make a different choice. The devs thought of us on that one.\n\n Challenge mode is actually really challenging. I've yet to beat the final boss on easy mode. Though I didn't really like that we're going up against an image rather than a 3D character model.  The final boss is something to behold. Like the game went from chill casual mode to Dark Souls mode. \n\nPros: \n- Great character designs. Very Genshin Impacty which I like\n- Great character animations. Work was actually put into their gestures, facial expressions, and lip syncing\n- Fun puzzle game. Very similar to HuniePop\n- Nice end game artwork\n- For under $2, this game is a steal\n\nCons:\n- Super short. Can finish a character in under an hour if you're using the convenient flowchart\n- Lacking of any character development. Character development is done with these readable files you can obtain after a puzzle fight\n- Lacking of characters. The challenge mode has more characters, but they're more like images rather than a 3D model.\n- English localization could use some work. Some of the texts aren't in English for some of the items I saw in the obtainable files after a puzzle fight. \n\n But for under $2, I'm not too worried about these cons over the pros. \n\nCant wait to see the final product after the devs are complete!\n", "timestamp_created": 1655146742, "timestamp_updated": 1655146742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116916218": {"recommendationid": "116916218", "author": {"steamid": "76561199086922967", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 26535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12443, "last_played": 1661703943}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1655117485, "timestamp_updated": 1655117485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116855559": {"recommendationid": "116855559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112790446", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 42, "last_played": 1687552195}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a hidden gem.", "timestamp_created": 1655019352, "timestamp_updated": 1655019352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116847229": {"recommendationid": "116847229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275393415", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1654999729}, "language": "english", "review": "Seggs where?", "timestamp_created": 1655002737, "timestamp_updated": 1655002737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540636062622070313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116842892": {"recommendationid": "116842892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257008526", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 70, "last_played": 1665927195}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i have ever played, truly a masterpiece :3\n\n(1)No it's not", "timestamp_created": 1654994542, "timestamp_updated": 1687202931, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "116820517": {"recommendationid": "116820517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971380682", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 196, "last_played": 1670246954}, "language": "english", "review": "Is there a way to give more money to the devs?

content and has an unclear objective in terms of fan service. Match 3 combat shows promise and the cinematic presentation holds up so far. \n\nIts a cinematic match3 combat game with decent mechanics and acceptable audiovisuals. No adult content but much less degenerate than Mirror1 so far. Without at least some H content it might be hard to find the appeal in this but it could at least be a solid replacement for bejeweled when it is finished. Some of the mechanics are less intuitive than the first, especially the tilesets and the special abilties are less obvious to immediately figure out. The music was okay, the engine looked okay but not great, with a unity engine visual glare quality to the 3D that I disliked over the 2D of the previous game. Additionally there are only 2 girls so far. The game has english options but they had to be manually turned on in the options.\n\nThere wont be a follow up review since I did not really enjoy the engine, the lack of H content, the slow updates and the generally more confusing presentation. So I am removing all Mirror content in favor of \"Wish\" which accomplishes generally the same thing, has a no censorship DLC and features plump adult women that are not furries, corpses or other strange stuff like these devs seem to prefer doing.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1207780/Wish/", "timestamp_created": 1653504679, "timestamp_updated": 1653680572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487170368432998657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115974250": {"recommendationid": "115974250", "author": {"steamid": "76561199108381707", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1643098338}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buena trama", "timestamp_created": 1653455128, "timestamp_updated": 1653455128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115951545": {"recommendationid": "115951545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069606103", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1652294960}, "language": "english", "review": "No plan for r18", "timestamp_created": 1653413531, "timestamp_updated": 1653413531, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.57603144645690918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115908920": {"recommendationid": "115908920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268750597", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 307, "last_played": 1653332973}, "language": "english", "review": "lacking.", "timestamp_created": 1653333086, "timestamp_updated": 1691321427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115879002": {"recommendationid": "115879002", "author": {"steamid": "76561199171333824", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1656436471}, "language": "english", "review": "too small 1/10", "timestamp_created": 1653275405, "timestamp_updated": 1653275405, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "hidden_in_steam_china": false, "steam_china_location": ""}, "115854477": {"recommendationid": "115854477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142444849", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 141, "last_played": 1653775335}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for the ecchi, stayed for the match-three.

A game with fantastic cutscenes, backstories and characters.

You can walk around your own little space and pose your character as you'd wish. While I understand this is an early access game I was disappointed to find I had already gotten caught up within 2 hours. That being said, this game is still addictive and fun and certainly serves what the community wanted... In my opinion I would even go as far as to say this game is severely underrated and I would totally recommend it to those story/lore people, weebs, puzzle players etcetera. I am excited to see what other updates come in the future and look forward to supporting the Devs all the way through. My only recommendation would be to add another fun method of play as you quite literally complete the game as soon as you finish the stories and their respective tree of possibilities. I was slightly disappointed to see only one achievement as I believe you should receive an achievement for special decisions.

In certain areas, it's great, but in others, it's a nose-dive.\n\nLet me just get one thing straight. As of April 28th, the game is still in Early Access, and still will be for months, maybe even the next year, and it [b] does not have any H-Content. [/b] This means exactly what you think; no birds and the bees. The closest you get is \"spending time\" with the girls. Which is just screwing about with them, but not actually, well, screwing them.\n\nThat alone will probably turn you away, and I completely understand, as it's doing the same with me. I bought Mirror 1 because of very obvious reasons, and it was an enjoyable match-3 puzzle game with RPG elements. While this game is basically the same as the first, but with 3D elements, it doesn't have the 'stuff' that you're there for.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, the game itself is pretty well made, other than the obvious bugs and glitches and weird stuttering (along with the heavy usage of CPU and GPU, which is a tad worrying), but as it's in Early Access, you have to look past that. The game has full on cutscenes and choices with different endings, and it seems well-made for what it is, especially for the price.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a very simple, and (currently) barebones puzzle game, I'd skip, as the devs are extremely untrustworthy, but for anyone like me clearly wanting the H-Content, you're sh*t outta luck. go find something else.\n\nEDIT: [strike]After talking with someone in the comments of this review, it's come to my attention that the game's H-Content does actually exist, and might come in the future. Most likely at it's full release, but until then, I'm keeping this review negative as the H-Content is still the big factor in why I don't recommend it for people like myself.[/strike]\n\nEDIT 2: so that was a f*cking lie. screw these devs. do not buy this game even if it's 2 bucks. it's not even worth that. especially considering we've been lied to lol.", "timestamp_created": 1651135854,

So what do you get for your $2?\n\nGame is around Neptunia levels of lewdness. No nudity here.\nGame is extremely short and the story is honestly a joke. You could complete both Chapters in just a few hours.\nChapter 1 has you play as a particularly stupid member of the SCP Foundation.\nChapter 2 has you play as a dude on a road trip with a catgirl.

However the bare bones that is currently the story shows potential greatness. If they continue with the themes of integration to foreign societies, compassion and courage to understand someone different than oneself, for one to change one's ways and being strong enough to stand-up and take action to do what one views as right; it truly will be a fun experience to go along with the fun match-3 gameplay. I am glad Lost Ark went down for maintenance so that I could play this.\n\nMy only concern is how 2 of the four endings involve having the MC's mind becoming Leah's plaything. [spoiler] \"Ending the run early\" and taking action against the Board seems to be the only way to avoid becoming a puppet. Though I'd argue every ending makes you a puppet to Leah in a regard.[/spoiler] That type of manipulation is exceedingly worrisome to me and I would like to see it minimized in the future. I understand manipulation of the senses is kind of Leah's thing being a [spoiler] succubus [/spoiler] and that there is a kink for that type of situation; I am just not the target demographic for such things and while I don't mind it being represented for those who are, I would like it to not overpower the story-telling as a whole as well as with the sub-stories with each of the characters.\n\nI hope those of you who read this enjoy the game and play it when it is fully released. I know I'll be looking forward to it.\n\nTo the developer(s): Please keep up the good work on this game. You've done well thus far.\n\nLani Content Update Edit:\n\nI've recently played through the new story content featuring Lani and Norman. A good post-apocalyptic setting with a wholesome adventure with a cute pairing. Again the story here is a bit light, very much still a skeleton but it is a healthy one at that. This time the story is about making a choice that is better in the long run versus being selfish in the interm. The addition of artwork specific to endings is a great idea. \n\nNot much else to say that I haven't already said. Lani is exceedingly cute and the team making this game is continuing to do an excellent job. More power to them. :)", "timestamp_created": 1647341653, "timestamp_updated": 1649757475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0,

In Mirror 1, the combat seemed more complex and that's what I enjoyed about it. Like how if you got a 4 in a row you'd get a silver skill one, but if you got an L or a T you'd get a golden skill bubble. In this game, if it is there, I haven't noticed it. It made getting the L's and T shapes on the board a lot more exciting and dopamine inducing. I'd ask that if you guys could, make it do the same as it did in Mirror 1 and I'd be happy with the game in its entirety.\nIf that was a specific decision not to do it the same as last time, I'd understand that too.
